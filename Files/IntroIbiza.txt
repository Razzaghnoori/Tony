 Ibiza and Formentera Ibiza offers a healthy slice of the Mediterranean lifestyle infused with some of the spirit and architecture of North Africa Although it is strictly a part of the Spanish archipelago known as the Islas Pitiusas or pine covered isles Ibiza in fact displays many of the characteristics of the Islas Baleares or Balearic Islands of neighbouring Mallorca and Menorca with which it is commonly grouped In terms of government it is part of the Spanish province of Baleares Here you ll find all the resorts bars and discos you could wish for but there are also traditional villages deserted beaches secret coves and quiet walks for when all you want to do is escape the fray Formentera Ibiza s diminutive neighbour just one hour s ferry boat ride or 25 minutes by hydrofoil to the south is an island apart in some ways more like a desert island than a satellite or outpost of Ibiza During the supremacy of the Barbary Coast pirates in the 16th and 17th centuries Formentera was so vulnerable it had to be abandoned and it wasn t resettled until the 18th century Now it offers the perfect antidote to the stress of modern day living and is the ideal place to recharge yourself before another evening of exuberant nightlife back on mainland Ibiza Alternatively if you prefer to find an even quieter stretch of beach the waters around Ibiza are dotted with a host of minor islets most uninhabited but all eminently explorable One thing you ll quickly realize about Ibiza is its laissez faire attitude towards life On this island paradise tourists and expatriates coexist side by side with movie stars artists the young and trendy ageing hippies and of course locals the total residential population being over 80 000 Despite the onset of tourism in many parts the islanders still adhere to old traditions living off the fruits literally of land and sea Ibiza small as it is is not one of those barren Mediterranean rocks with an allure that begins and ends at the beach and although it s a part of Spain it is not the usual bullfight and flamenco scene The people are a distinct race they have a unique ancient heritage and a passionate folklore all their own They also have their own language Ibicenco a dialect related to the mallorqu Majorcan branch of the Catalan language though Castilian is spoken as well Ibiza lies nearer to the coast of North Africa than to the Catalonian city of Barcelona With an area of just 541 sq km 209 sq miles it is slightly smaller than the Isle of Man or twice Martha s Vineyard in Massachusetts It may not be much of a speck on the globe but it is big enough to contain a modest mountain verdant farms and that real Mediterranean novelty a river Likewise the island s highest peak Mount Sa Talaia or Atalaya 475 meters 1 558 feet hardly ranks among the world s most dramatic but you can see Spain from the top The climate here is distinctly Mediterranean temperature extremes are uncommon and days are warm throughout the year with the heat of the summer usually tempered by sea breezes This combined with the island s extraordinary underground water resources assures the success of Ibiza s agriculture For the tourist the olive fig and almond trees are objects of beauty and colour for the farmer they re cash crops So is the salt drying in the huge square pans at Las Salinas in the south The capital of Ibiza called simply Ibiza or Ibiza Town has a population of almost 35 000 This is the island s main city and financial governmental and administrative centre and its charms match those of other Mediterranean jewels It is also a major entertainment spot with its own appeal from the whitewashed houses of the ancient walled city clambering up the hillside to the hustle and bustle of the harbour area with its bistros and boutiques Its popularity is such that it has gained a reputation for being something of a trend setters haven post modern or New Age this is the place to be The busiest tourist town on the island lies 15 km 9 miles west of the capital The Romans called it Portus Magnus great port which the Ibicencos adapted to Portmany You might still come across both versions but the official name of the boom town is Sant Antoni Abad San Antonio in Castilian or Abbot St Anthony in English Skirting the bay which has been transformed into a variation on Rio de Janeiro s Copacabana Beach are high rise hotels and apartment buildings The resort is a centre not only for beach activities but for lively nightlife as well The second largest as opposed to busiest town on the island is Santa Eul ria del Riu or R o on the east coast Originally this was merely a hamlet on a hilltop crowned by a picturesque fortress church Now the tourist imperative has extended the town all the way down to the sea and far along the coast Other villages are much less developed and therein lies the essence of many delights If you head inland to the less populous centre of the island you ll find hamlets consisting of little more than a whitewashed church a general store and a bar This is the time to relax over a glass of the locally made hierbas an alcoholic drink made from herbs listen to the crickets and watch the world go by
