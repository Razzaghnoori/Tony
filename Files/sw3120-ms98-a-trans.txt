        okay   okay   well did you go to college   yes i did   and where did you go   i went to a small liberal arts college in Virginia   uhhuh   um it was Sweeper College it was about seven hundred and fifty students i had gone to a small school growing up uh and a lot of my friends went to univerty University of Michigan but my parents were retiring in South Carolina when i graduated and um were looking for a southern school and   umhum   um also U of M seemed overwhelming in size and um what about you   well i went to the University of Minnesota   oh so youre from the Midwest too   i am uhhuh where do you live now   um i live in Texas now where are you   well im in Texas im in Austin   oh um my brothers in Austin um he lives Lakeway he um had moved uh were in Plano   uhhuh im familiar with Plano i visited once or twice   and oh Austin is so pretty i really like it   oh i love it i love it i really do   and your daughter is going to be a sophomore   thats correct i have two daughters but my oldest will be will be a sophomore   is um because you live in Austin is she thinking about the University of Texas   she has her heart set on U T       and um you know having gone to the University of Minnesota i know what a big university is like and um one thing that i did this summer which i thought might benefit both my daughters is my youngest daughter got involved in band and Baylor has a band camp   oh   so she went for a week and it was overnight and they lived in the dorms and i thought this would expose both of them to what its you know like on a college a smaller college campus and um my oldest one just wasnt impressed at all with the idea of a small school so um i i i still think the exposure was good   yes   the reason i ask if you went to college is i thought well you know what were your selection criteria did you base it on what you wanted to major in or what you would feel comfortable with or what you could afford or you know theres all of these areas to look at in making the decision   um yeah those um and those were several uh that we did consider um my parents uh um certainly didnt push but wanted me to look in the south and because i had been in a small school they suggested that i probably i when i say small my graduating class had eighteen in it   oh wow   and so they suggested that i might want a smaller school because i was used to a lot of oneonone   oh definitely   um or small group situations and i did pick it because at the time i was interested in majoring in biology and i also wanted to spend   umhum   one year studying in Europe um i had had an A F S student from Germany live with us our senior year   oh how exciting   i and we just thought that would be a wonderful thing and i ended up majoring in French one of the reasons i picked the school was because they had a strong science department they also had a strong language department and id always loved working with children um and i found that i couldnt fit everything in but because i had had a fair amount of French going in i was able   umhum   to do my years study in France and able to take a lot of the other courses that interested me um   oh that was a that worked out very well for you   and so that was some of but several of the things you mentioned were the things that um our son has talked a lot about Texas A and M hes but he thinks he wants to be a writer and i dont think that   well then he should come to U T   yes um and really his his graduating class will probably be in the neighborhood of eight hundred and fifty to a thousand   umhum   um and so hes used to a bigger size and because my brother is there   large classes   uh he would have family close by so there there are advantages um but i also because i had so many friends who did go from our small school to University of Michigan which was so large and they really felt um like they were numbers   oh i went from a large high school to a university large university and i definitely felt like i was a number um i mean   you still yeah   it is a different feeling but that was that was my only option i i mean i just really couldnt look at anything else that was the one and only thing i could really afford other than a junior you know a junior college which i didnt want to do so thats how you know my decision was made but um   well thats thats certainly um especially today with the cost of college i mean that is a a major um consideration and i do feel fortunate that Texas has so many good schools and even though Baylor um   yes   and when you mentioned that we we have friends who have children there who just love it and for a private school it is not as expensive as most are and it is a smaller size and um i do feel like there are a lot of options its its but  i had been hoping some schools i know give um oh even this year Jay had an aptitude test um   what what does he hopes to be a writer   yes he thinks thats what hed like to do but hes really strong in math and science too and   huh   we keep encouraging him to keep an open mind does your daughter know what shed like to do   oh she she has uh you know interests that are just you know going in all directions um   yeah   what she talks about a lot is theater which i think is okay Bethany lets be real  um she really is is pretty unfocused at this point and i dont know shes taken a lot of French and she may end up doing something with that and i am a single mom so ive been and i made the mistake of dropping out of college to get married so im trying to have my children not make the same mistake and im you know showing them if youre strong in math and science kiddos this is one area where women can make some decent money   yes   you know i mean im kind of really putting the practical application you know and and saying yet d o something that you enjoy   umhum   by all means go get that piece of paper you know do you just have one son   yes   i see well it sounds like hes got some really you know good strong ideas of what he wants to do   well he but he has even now that hes in high school um and of course theres there is still time but hes beginning to feel that as much as he enjoys writing he wonders if he can make a living at it you know its the its
