 The Worst Songwriter of All Time Bob Merrill wrote one of the most recognizable most parodied and for non Streisand fans most irritating lyrics of all time PeoplePeople who need peopleAre the luckiest people in the world I don t know whether Merrill was a person who needed people and if he did whether he considered himself lucky for so doing But the other week he went out to the driveway of his Los Angeles home and shot himself He was 76 When the elderly kill themselves we gloss over that fact It isn t really a tragedy not like a teen ager s suicide or a young mother s But for the record aside from self destructing rockers such as Kurt Cobain I can t think of another hit songwriter who s taken his life I only had a very slight acquaintance with Merrill but it seems a sad end for someone who wrote more determinedly happy songs than anyone in history In a century of pop music Bob Merrill pretty much has a hammerlock on the first half of the 1950s Even then he wasn t exactly a household name and if you beg to differ chances are your household s mixing him up with Robert Merrill the great Metropolitan Opera baritone who appeared around the same time Merrill Bob chose the diminutive deliberately to avoid confusion with Merrill Robert though it s hard to see why anyone would think a fellow who makes his living singing Mozart and Verdi would go home at night and write If I Knew You Were Comin I d ve Baked a Cake That was Bob s first hit He d been head writer at NBC and dialogue director at Columbia Pictures but when he tried to break into Tin Pan Alley they kept telling him his stuff was too complex He took their advice to heart and how If I knew you were comin I d ve baked a cakeBaked a cakeBaked a cakeIf I knew you were comin I d ve baked a cakeHowdja do Howdja do Howdja do Not exactly Lorenz Hart But it sold a million And Merrill followed it with an even bigger song How Much Is That Doggie in the Window a hit for Patti Page or to give her her formal title The Singing Rage Miss Patti Page Posterity hasn t been that kind to Patti and her four legged friend It would be unfair to call this a nursery rhyme it was childish rather than childlike writes Donald Clarke in The Rise and Fall of Popular Music Nobody knows how many music fans stopped listening to the radio after hearing Doggie In The Window too many times Clarke s being a little harsh The early 50s don t forget were the heyday of the dog song and rare was the pop star who managed to avoid having one inflicted on him Half a century later Frank Sinatra will sock you on the jaw if you so much as mention Mama Will Bark his canine love duet with the big breasted faux Scandinavian actress Dagmar The Singing Dogs who barked their way through Oh Susanna are more relaxed about it but then of course they are dogs By these standards Merrill s song was as they say at Westminster Kennel Club Best in Show Novelty songs they used to call them But in the early 50s novelties weren t so much a novelty as terrifyingly ubiquitous If you want the entire history of pop music on one single the tug between its highest aspirations and its basest instincts Sinatra wrapped it up in 1951 on the B side I m a Fool to Want You an almost painfully exposed ballad that today ranks as one of his greatest recordings but on the A side yes Mama Will Bark Mitch Miller top dog at Columbia Records insisted Sinatra do it Frank wound up leaving Columbia but he never forgave Miller Years later they happened to be crossing a Vegas lobby from opposite ends Miller extended his hand in friendship Sinatra snarled Fuck you Keep walking But so what In those days Sinatra was a loser The smart money was on Miller s new discovery Guy Mitchell nice kid pleasant voice no trouble Frank didn t want Sparrow in the Treetop so Miller gave it to Mitchell along with My Truly Truly Fair Belle Belle My Liberty Belle Feet Up Pat Him on the Po Po She Wears Red Feathers And a Hula Hula Skirt and There s a Pawnshop on the Corner in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania the biggest hit ever written about Pittsburgh All six songs were by Bob Merrill all were arranged with Miller s unrelenting jolliness whooping French horns throughout and all were smashes If Merrill had a yen to write boy meets girl it didn t show boy meets cake girl meets dog sparrow meets treetop Pop songs are supposed to be universal I Will Always Love You but Merrill was specific with a vengeance Even if you were minded to write a song about a gal who wears red feathers and a huley huley skirt and lives on jes cokeynuts why would you open with the line I work in a London bank It remains incidentally the biggest hit ever written about a London banker who meets a hula hula girl He composed in case you hadn t guessed on a child s toy xylophone Between 1950 and 1955 it also cranked out Where Will the Baby s Dimple Be Mambo Italiano and my personal favorite Oooh Bang Jiggily Jang Even the singers don t like these songs Rosemary Clooney revisiting Mambo Italiano for a recent autobiographical album explains in the liner notes how much she loathes all her early hits Come On a My House Armenian novelty song Who Don Mon Man calypso novelty song Botch a Me botched novelty song But you have to admire Merrill s resourcefulness Any old Alley opportunist can write a novelty Italian song That s Amore or a novelty mambo song Papa Loves Mambo but to write a novelty song about Italians doing the mambo that takes guts Hey Mambo Mambo Italiano Go go Joe You mixed up Siciliano The guy who wrote that gets hammered from both ends To those who love the great American standards Merrill is the man who single handedly produced the worst songs of the decade and so debauched the currency of mainstream Tin Pan Alley that it had no moral authority to resist rock n roll And for baby boom rockers when all other musical lyrical and sociopolitical claims for the rock n roll revolution have collapsed the memory of growing up with the Bob Merrill songbook will always be justification enough Merrill moved on to Broadway and Hollywood Having been told he was too complex for pop music he was now regarded as too simple minded to write show scores But 33 years after he gave Barbra Streisand People she s still singing it These days over the instrumental break she s prone to toss in a homily about world peace and how whether we re in America Bosnia Rwanda the Middle East are young old black white gay straight or transsexual we re all still people people who need people When she first sang the song in the musical biography of Fanny Brice Funny Girl it was about precisely the opposite Fanny was so obsessed with her public identity that she d neglected the personal she could love audiences but not individuals Only James Brolin and the more assiduous tabloid reporters know whether that s true of Barbra in private but it s increasingly the case professionally She declaims her love songs as if addressing an audience of millions rather than one very special person Ostensibly Bob Merrill s most general lyric it is in fact the most specific of all
