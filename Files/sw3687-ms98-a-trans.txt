        uh what uh guess i should have talked before uh what team do you wanna     huh   are you familiar with i guess or do you have a favorite team i guess   um yeah my favorite teams probably the Reds yeah im from Cincinnati yeah   is it are are you really great   yeah but uh most national league teams im pretty familiar with     yeah i uh im im familiar with the Reds myself we lived out there in Dayton for three years so we used to root from the line i dont know they got a pretty good team but i see i kind of think the Braves are the gonna ones be the ones to go places this year   oh really yeah thats what i thought even last year i thought theyd be doing pretty good   yeah theyre pretty theyre so young and everything i i was just starting to get Dave Justice is one of my favorite players so   yeah hes pretty exciting to watch   im hoping he can pull them through and maybe have a good series like they did against the Twins again   yeah i think the Dodgers you got to look out for with all the the hitting theyve gotten recently   oh yeah and who else did they pick up they got Strawberry and who else did they   they got Davis from the Reds   Davis too   yeah and uh they traded away for some pitcher too   oh yeah   yeah because they dealt Belcher and then they got someone else i forgot his name though   huh yeah ive ive kind of i they always make me nervous because Lasordas good coach and everything but uh they got the bucks to spend they can get all those guys   yeah it seems like they always get the the high paid guys and they always seem to end up doing pretty good for a while   yeah yeah i uh im kind of a Mets fan myself too i uh like to see them go i dont know why but because theyre   well they just signed uh what Bonilla from Pittsburgh yeah   Bonilla  i see thats being from Pennsylvania i thought youd maybe be a Pittsburgh fan but   yeah   but no huh  do you   no i keep up on it yeah i tell you though hes getting what six million a year or something   yeah you cannot its kind of hard to turn that down thats for sure   yeah you got to think Bonds is worth more than that too   yeah definitely i wonder if he is he gonna stay with them or   no hes looking to leave from what i hear   oh if he leaves then theyre theyre done with they wont go anywhere this year i mean thats their two biggest guys that are walking so   yeah they signed a couple of their pitchers who are gonna be free agents   yeah they resigned them well thats good thatll help but   yeah yeah they got Walken someone else they resigned   i wouldnt be surprised to see them if they go after Bonds but   theyre not gonna give them more than six million a year they cant afford it   well i dont think anybody can i dont know if anybodys worth that much for what they do but uh   yeah   i dont know i really i say i really hope the Braves can pull it through theyre i think they caught everybodys imagination last year it was a it was great series but itd been fun to see them win it   yeah you got to like the underdog   yeah thats true maybe they can pull it off again but i tell you i dont know its so are you a big baseball fan or do do you   yeah pretty much yeah up where we are we dont get much baseball news but uh i try to keep up on it   oh do you just through the  papers or whatnot   yeah reading the little transactions column is about all we get   oh huh well what do you think about the As and Canseco and those guys have they got any chance or   i dont know they really surprised me last year when they dropped off so quick   yeah im wondering if theyre maybe just getting a little bit too high paid and thinking theyre so good and   yeah too many attitudes out there   pardon   too many attitudes out there i think so i think it   yeah thats true thats definitely true   they got a lot of high paid players that could start somewhere else as backup   yep thats true got to get Cansecos mind off Madonna and then he might be able to play a little bit  yeah exactly   yeah or Steve Picketts yeah but they were in the World Series so many years straight then they were in like third or fourth or something   yeah then they thats like they dropped off the map and they had all the same players but   yeah the Reds did the same thing players then down into fifth   yep oh yeah that surprised me because they were so tough and then i just i just wonder like i say if they lose the desire they did it once and then they just forget it and   yeah   i dont know but uh   you figured after all the Rose stuff was over everything would be fine and it was but then i dont know what happened last year   umhum yeah they just like i say they tailed right off but yeah i heard Davis was hurt quite a bit so that kind of hurt them   yeah but he always is i mean thats why they got rid of him he only plays like half a season   yeah thats true yeah itll be interesting to see what he does now that hes out there with his bud Strawberry and if all of a sudden he becomes healthy all the time   yeah he kept on saying that uh the Reds should switch to natural grass just for his knees but uh they never did but they got that out in LA that should help him   uhhuh yeah itll help but yeah we used to i was back there with the Reds when Ray Knight used to play and when he yeah when he took well it was the year that he took Pete Roses place and of course he couldnt do anything right and   yeah third base   but uh we used to go i used to get free tickets for from school and go out and watch them but uh so they were always kind of were kind of a good my dad still loves them thats his favorite team but   yeah yeah i can remember going to games there when i was a kid   yeah that was good fun if i the stadiums what was amazing to me i mean weve got nothing that big out here as far as a you know baseball or football stadium you know walk inside and it was just huge to to see them but uh it would seem like it was always bigger on the inside than it was outside   yeah because it looks small on the outside   yeah i had all these huge i we always were up in the nose bleed seats so we never got a chance to get too close but   yeah and anytime you try to walk down the uh the ushers would always tell you to go back   yeah yeah i did that a few tried that a few times can i see your tickets and then you just get up and leave because you know theres no other     yeah or uh oh i left them up in my seat   yeah  yep but uh i dont know yeah i like i enjoy baseball i play a lot of softball
