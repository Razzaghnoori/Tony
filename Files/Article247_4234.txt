 Gore vs Bradley vs Russert Issue 1 is the Democratic presidential debates both Friday night s face off on ABC s Nightline and Sunday morning s joint appearance on NBC s Meet the Press Issue 2 is the GOP race including George W Bush s remark in a debate last week that Christ changed his heart and a new poll friendly to John McCain Sitting inches apart on Meet the Press Bill Bradley and Al Gore carry on the most spirited back and forth of the presidential campaign Unlike most debates however this one has a hands on moderator in Tim Russert who peppers the candidates with his special brand of heavy hitting pinpoint accurate questions Russert is especially tough on the entitlement issue He shows both candidates a government report signed by three Clinton Cabinet secretaries which concludes that by 2035 politicians will either have to raise taxes or cut Social Security and Medicare benefits But neither candidate will commit to doing either despite Russert s insistence that there is no free lunch Gore wearing a dark blue blazer rather than his trademark earth tones calls Russert s notion elite opinion and then reasserts his commitment to the working man Jumping on Bradley s boat Gore promises that he too will forgo soft money in the general election if John McCain is the Republican nominee Read about Bradley and McCain s campaign finance pledge in Slate s The Week The Spin and Ballot Box Gore also pledges to renounce all TV and radio advertising in the primary campaign if Bradley will go along and challenges the former senator to two debates per week as a substitute for the forgone ads Bradley dismisses both proposals as ridiculous Late in the program Russert catches Gore flatfooted Asked if he would admit that in 1996 the Clinton Gore fund raising apparatus was overly aggressive perhaps unethical Gore says I m not going to use those words I think obviously if we had to do it over again the point is do you learn from your mistakes and I certainly have I strongly support RUSSERT What was the big mistake that was made if you learned from it GORE Oh I think um pushing the limits um all this was reviewed and um charges were brought But I think it was a mistake nonetheless On CNN s Late Edition the only pundit show taped after Meet the Press Susan Page opines that Gore s campaign finance ploy worked and Tucker Carlson says that Bradley looked haughty but Steve Roberts thinks that Gore came across as he always does like a nervous Nellie On ABC s This Week Bill Kristol notes that in Friday s Nightline debate neither Democratic candidate mentioned the name of their party s popular incumbent president Bill Clinton Many pundits agree that there are still few substantive differences between Bradley and Gore Mike McCurry This Week calls the two candidates Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi while Margaret Carlson CNN s Capital Gang says deciding which candidate to vote for is like trying to choose between 1 percent or 2 percent milk To read Ballot Box on both Democratic debates click here to read Chatterbox s dissent click here The pundits ruminate on the appropriateness of George W s remark in his third presidential debate that his favorite political philosopher is Christ because he changed my heart Gloria Borger PBS s Washington Week in Review Margaret Carlson and Al Hunt Capital Gang think it unseemly to wear one s religion on one s sleeve and Bill Kristol sees baby boomer selfishness in Bush s transformation of a political question into a personal one But George F Will This Week and William F Buckley Fox News Sunday see little wrong with a simple declaration of faith On Late Edition Wolf Blitzer trots out Friday s CNN Gallup USA Today poll indicating that if John McCain and Bill Bradley win some early primaries Bush voters may switch to McCain but Gore voters likely will not switch to Bradley The poll also shows that campaign finance reform is low on voters lists of election concerns asked about this on Late Edition McCain blames the wording of the questions Paul Gigot and Mark Shields both of PBS s NewsHour With Jim Lehrer say that the poll doesn t matter The campaign finance issue is merely a prop for McCain s better selling points his biography and his character Et Cetera In an interview on Late Edition Ken Starr says that if he could do it over again he would have used the independent counsel s office as a bully pulpit appearing on television to counter the White House s spin doctors Being Nothingness and Peanuts Peanuts is also a commentary on the culture The recurring theme is too much and too little self esteem Lucy has too much and Charlie Brown has too little There is a kind of mild metaphysic involved In one of the strips one of the characters is jumping rope and says Suddenly it struck me that it all seemed futile Well what doesn t George F Will on the legacy of Charles Schulz s cartoon strip This Week Last Word It immediately communicated a certain reverence which is to be welcomed But Christ was not a political philosopher he was the source of philosophy the source of goodness the source of contemplation So there is a formal objection to his being named as such William F
