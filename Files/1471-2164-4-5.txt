 Background Binding and recognizing diverse small molecules is a central aspect of signal transduction mechanisms in all cellular life forms A variety of environmental small molecules namely nutrients xenobiotics and first messengers are recognized by cells with the help of specialized protein sensors on their surfaces 1 2 Additionally cells also use protein bound small molecules such as FAD cinnamic acid tetrapyrroles and heme as sensors of photons and the ambient redox states 3 4 Within cells small molecules such as cyclic nucleotides are used as intracellular messengers to transduce signals arising from a variety of stimuli 1 2 Over the past few years a combination of protein sequence analysis and biochemical studies have revealed several unifying principles that govern the recognition of small molecules by cells 4 5 6 7 8 9 A significant component of small molecule protein interactions is mediated via a relatively small set of ancient conserved protein domains that bind their ligands using specialized pockets 4 10 Certain protein folds have given rise to several large superfamilies of ligand binding domains These include the PAS like fold which is the scaffold of the PAS 11 12 GAF 13 and probably the CACHE 14 superfamilies and the ACT like fold which is seen in ACT ferredoxin and related ligand binding domains 4 15 Identification of such conserved domains has often improved our understanding of the general structural and biochemical features that underlie protein small molecule interactions Typically these small molecule binding domains SMBDs are combined within the same polypeptide to a number of conserved domains that are directly involved in signal transduction These include enzymatic domains such as nucleotide cyclases histidine and serine threonine kinases cNMP phosphodiesterases receiver domains and several different kinds of ATPases 3 4 Non catalytic domains like DNA or RNA binding modules eg the helix turn helix domains methyl accepting domains and FHA domains that bind phosphorylated peptides are also often fused to SMBDs 3 4 The soluble guanylyl cyclases are important signaling molecules in animals that transduce signals mediated by the gaseous first messenger nitric oxide 16 17 18 19 In animals NO functions as a neurotransmitter both in the central and peripheral nervous system NO is released by a cell through the action of the nitric oxide synthase NOS on its substrate the amino acid arginine 20 NO diffuses through the neighboring cells and elicits its functions by activating a soluble guanylyl cyclase SGC that synthesizes cGMP using GTP as a substrate 16 18 The animal SGCs are dimeric enzymes comprised of two homologous subunits and The sequence similarity between these subunits extends throughout their entire length and they contain a long extension N terminal to the cNMP generating catalytic domain The N terminal region of the subunit forms a covalent link with heme via a histidine H105 in human SGC1 21 Though the porphyrin is identical to that found in hemoglobin it only binds NO and carbon monoxide and not oxygen even though O 2 is present at much higher concentrations within the cell 22 23 This ligand specificity of the NO binding domain of animal SGCs is very similar to bacterial cytochrome c that likewise binds only NO and CO 24 The N terminal region of the subunit has been shown to bind certain synthetic pyrazolopyridine ligands which act as potents NO independent agonists of cyclase activity 25 26 Using sensitive sequence profile analysis we show that the heme binding domain of the animal SGCs defines a novel family of ligand binding domains that are also widely distributed in bacteria The SGCs also contain a second globular domain situated in between the heme binding and cyclase domains We show that this domain is also present in the bacteria and present evidence that these two domains are likely to function together both in eukaryotes and bacteria and activate a diverse set of downstream signals Results and Discussion Identification of the HNOB and HNOBA domains Though both the and subunits of SGCs are homologous throughout their entire length only the subunit contains the critical heme binding residue As this long homologous N terminal extension of SGC subunits does not map to any previously characterized domains we sought to investigate its provenance through sequence analysis methods The length and conservation pattern of the N terminal domain suggested that the N terminal extension of the SGCs is likely to comprise of two globular domains in the least This conjecture was also supported by an analysis of sequence complexity of the polypeptide using the SEG program 27 A PSI BLAST search was initiated with the conserved N terminal extension of the SGC human SGC1 gi 4504215 region 1 360 using an inclusion threshold of 01 and compositional bias based statistics to eliminate false positives arising due to peculiarities of sequence composition Both the N and the C terminal parts of this extension gave several distinct hits to different bacterial proteins supporting the presence of two distinct globular domains in this extension Based on these hits we divided the extension into N and C terminal parts and initiated separate PSI BLAST searches with them Searches with the N terminal part of the extension gave significant hits to bacterial proteins of the length 180 195 residues within the first 3 iterations eg Mdge1313 from Microbulbifer degradans is detected with an expect value e of 10 4in the first iteration This region of similarity encompasses the entire length of these bacterial proteins and includes the heme liganding histidine of the SGC subunits and is likely to define a distinct globular domain In order to probe this domain further we isolated this region from SGC1 1 185 and seeded a PSI BLAST search that was run to convergence At convergence this search detected in addition to the soluble guanylyl cyclases from the animals several bacterial proteins including certain methyl accepting chemotaxis receptors from bacteria such as Desulfovibrio and Clostridium Transitive searches initiated with the small bacterial proteins that entirely correspond to the N terminal most domain of the SGCs also recovered the same set of proteins as observed in the earlier search with e 01 These observations suggest that the N terminal most domain of the SGCs is evolutionarily mobile it occurs in several distinct contexts with other domains in the same polypeptide or in a stand alone form PSI BLAST searches initiated with the C terminal part of the SGC specific extension the region in between the above detected N terminal most domain and the C terminal cyclase domain human SGC1 region 200 370 recovered homologous regions from all other animal soluble guanylyl cyclases and additionally N terminal regions of histidine kinases from Nostoc and Anabaena species eg gi 17229771 e 10 4in iteration 1 and a diguanylate cyclase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides gi 22958462 e 10 3in iteration 3 The region of similarity shared by these bacterial proteins and animal SGCs encompassed more or less the entire middle region which is present between the two other globular domains Reciprocal searches with the corresponding region from the cyanobacterial histidine kinases recovered the animal SGCs thereby confirming the evolutionary relationship between these regions These observations suggest that the middle region of the animal SGCs defines a second evolutionarily mobile globular domain that is shared with several distinct bacterial proteins A multiple alignment of the N terminal most domain of the SGCs and its bacterial homologs was prepared using the T_coffee program and adjusted manually based on the PSI BLAST HSPs Fig 1 The multiple aligment shows that the heme binding histidine of the SGC subunits is contained within this domain We accordingly termed this domain the HNOB H eme N itric O xide B inding domain The histidine is predicted to be positioned next to the N terminus of an helix and is conserved throughout this superfamily with the exception of subunits of the SGCs Fig 1 and two bacterial versions from Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Magnetococcus species Though SGC subunits lack the histidine the region encompassing the HNOB domain in human SGC1 has been shown to be important for functional heme binding by the dimeric enzyme 28 Hence in addition to covalent heme binding HNOB domains may also interact with it non covalently The N terminal part of the domain contains a universally conserved acidic residue that may play a critical role creating the local environment for NO selectivity The rest of the sequence conservation maps mainly to the cores of secondary structure elements and some well conserved turns Fig 1 Secondary structure prediction shows that the HNOB domain is likely to adopt a predominantly helical fold with a few interspersed extended elements Further the predicted trans membrane topologies of HNOB domain proteins suggest an intracellular localization for all occurrences of this domain However neither direct comparisons nor sequence structure threading revealed any relationship with the two other well characterized helical heme binding domains namely globin and cytochrome C Hence it is likely that the HNOB domain adopts a structure distinct from these domains Because the middle domain of the SGCs is always associated with the HNOB domains see below we named it the HNOBA HNOB A ssociated domain A multiple alignment of this domain revealed that unlike the HNOB domain it is likely to adopt an fold with segregated and domains Fig 2 Its core contains 5 conserved strands followed at the extreme C terminus by a long helix that is likely to form a coiled coil linker region involved in dimerization Fig 2 Within the core the first two strands are predicted to form a hairpin followed by a helical region which in turn is followed by 3 consecutive strands and single helix A similar secondary structure pattern is also observed in several other ligand binding domains such as the PAS GAF profilin and probably even the CACHE domains 10 Sequence structure threading using the 3DPSSM method detected the PAS domain Photoactive yellow protein PDB 1drm with marginally significant scores 5 50 70 probability of correct fold prediction This suggests that the HNOBA domain could potentially contain a PAS like fold All versions of the HNOBA domain except one from Rhodobacter sphaeroides contain a conserved histidine between the core region and the long C terminal helix that links it to a kinase or cyclase domain Fig 2 However studies on the SGCs suggest no evidence for a second covalent heme binding site implying that this histidine could have some other function Interestingly binding studies on a synthetic pyrazolopyridine SGC agonist BAY 41 2272 have suggested a role for the region 236 290 of the human SGC1 subunit in interacting with this ligand 25 26 Though actual cross linking occurred with cysteine residues situated just N terminal to the HNOBA domain it is likely that the rest of domain is involved in contact with the ligand This may suggest the possibility of the HNOBA domain binding some as yet unknown endogenous ligand In such a scenario it could participate in allosteric regulation of the SGCs similar to the GAF domains of the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases 6 13 Evolutionary history domain architectures and gene neighborhoods of the HNOB and HNOBA domain proteins The HNOB domain is found in various bacterial lineages such as cyanobacteria proteobacteria and low GC Gram positive bacteria It is entirely absent in all archaeal proteomes available to date and amidst the eukaryotes is only detectable in the animal lineage In bacteria the HNOB domain proteins display two principal architectures They may occur as stand alone proteins entirely composed of the HNOB domain in several bacterial lineages Fig 3 In the low GC Gram positive bacteria and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans they occur in combination with the methyl accepting chemotaxis receptor proteins with or without the HAMP domain 29 30 Additionally in Magnetococcus a HNOB domain is fused at its C terminus to an uncharacterized conserved globular domain Fig 3 In animals the HNOB domain always occurs in the N terminal extension of SGCs The phyletic pattern of the HNOB domain suggests that it was most probably acquired early in the evolution of the animal lineage via lateral transfer from a bacterial source In order to test this further we used a multiple alignment of the HNOB domain Fig 1 to construct phylogenetic trees with the neighbor joining least squares and maximum likelihood methods A consensus tree for the HNOB domain superfamily shows that the animal versions form a strong monophyletic group Fig 3 Within the animals there is a small lineage specific expansion in the nematode lineage SGCs with distinct and subunits appear to have emerged in the coelomate lineage after its divergence from the nematode lineage In bacteria the HNOB domains occurring in the chemotaxis receptors form a well supported monophyletic group while the remaining standalone forms are paraphyletic Fig 3 Interestingly the solo versions from Nostoc and Anabaena species group strongly with the animal SGC clade supporting the origin of the latter forms via horizontal transfer from a bacterial source Rell BP support 80 10000 replicates Genes whose products closely interact with each other in macromolecular complexes or biochemical pathways often cluster together in prokaryotic genomes These co functional gene clusters or operons often provide contextual information that may throw light on the functions of uncharacterized proteins 31 32 In order to obtain a better understanding of the HNOB domains we analyzed the neighborhoods of the genes encoding them in bacteria Genes encoding practically all the solo versions of the HNOB domain occur in the same predicted operon as a histidine kinase or a GGDEF domain diguanylate cyclase 33 34 35 In some cases these operons also encode receiver domain proteins of the two component systems PP2C phosphatases or cyclic diguanylate phosphodiesterases Fig 3 Interestingly the histidine kinases from the two cyanobacteria and the GGDEF domain protein from Rhodobacter which co occur with solo HNOB domain proteins contain HNOBA domains at their extreme N terminus Fig 3 Thus even in the bacteria the HNOBA domain always appears to function in association with the HNOB domain Given that these cyanobacterial HNOB proteins are also the closest bacterial relatives of the animal HNOB domains it appears likely that the animal lineage acquired a related assemblage of HNOB and HNOBA domain as a single piece Thus the HNOB and HNOBA domains resemble functionally similar CACHE and CHASE domains which have also been acquired by certain eukaryotic lineages via lateral transfer from bacteria 14 36 37 A phylogenetic analysis of the guanylyl cyclase domains of the animal SGCs shows that their closest relatives are cyclases from various bacteria such cyanobacteria and Leptospira data not shown Taken together these observations support a potential bacterial origin for these components of the nitric oxide signaling pathway This is also consistent with the presence of orthologs of the animal NO synthases in several bacteria 38 39 The co occurrence of the HNOB and the HNOBA domains in either the same protein or proteins encoded by the same operon suggests a strong functional interaction between them Studies on the human SGC1 suggest that the synthetic pyrazolopyridine ligand binds at site distinct from NO and heme but requires the heme binding site for its action 25 26 This could imply a synergy or cooperation between these domains in heme interation and cyclase activation Majority of the bacterial HNOB domain proteins are predicted to covalently bind heme Those versions that lack the heme binding histidine might either non covalently interact with heme as in the case of the SGC subunits or bind some other unknown ligand They are likely to function as sensors of diffusible gaseous ligands that activate at least three distinct downstream signaling pathways namely phosphotransfer through the two component systems methyl ester dependent chemotactic response and cyclic nucleotide signaling through the diguanylate cyclases phosphodiesterases However further experimental studies would be required to determine if they function as NO or CO sensors like the animal proteins or as oxygen sensors Conclusions Using sequence profile searches we identify two conserved domains in the N terminal extensions of the soluble guanylyl cyclases from animals One of these the HNOB domain contains the heme binding site of the SGCs and defines a family of small molecule binding domains exclusively occurring in animals and bacteria In bacteria the HNOB domain occurs either as a standalone version or fused to the HAMP and methyl accepting domains of chemotaxis receptors The bacterial solo versions co occur in predicted operons encoding genes for two component systems and diguanylate cyclases or phosphodiesterases and are likely to transmit signals to these downstream molecules The second conserved domain of SGCs the HNOBA domain is always associated with the HNOB domain either in the same polypeptide or in polypeptide encoded by neighboring genes in an operon It is predicted to adopt an fold that is possibly related to the PAS like fold The HNOB and HNOBA domains are likely to function synergistically or cooperatively The latter may either cooperate in binding heme or might bind distinct ligands The phyletic pattern of these domains and phylogenetic analysis of the HNOB domain suggest that the animal versions were probably acquired through lateral transfer from a bacterial source Identification of the HNOB and HNOBA domains could help in further investigations of the SGCs that are critical components of the nitric oxide signaling pathway in animals Furthermore investigating their role in bacteria such as Vibrio cholerae could be important in understanding the sensory mechanisms of human pathogens Methods The non redundant NR database of protein sequences National Center for Biotechnology Information NIH Bethesda was searched using the BLASTP and PSI BLAST programs 40 Profile searches using the PSI BLAST program were conducted either with a single sequence or an
