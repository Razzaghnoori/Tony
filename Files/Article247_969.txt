 Headline You raise an interesting point If we consider the right wing politicians and media people on your list as actually believing their professed ideology which I m not sure they all do I think yes orthodoxers of one sort or another are often fighting the return of the repressed a stop me before I divorce again kind of a thing They re like gaybashers who are in flight from their own homosexual impulses Except in the case of the people you mention they do get divorced all they want to That s what gets me they permit themselves a freedom they seek to deny to others Instead of being made more understanding by their own frailties and failures they just forgive themselves and condemn others In any case I don t think marriage works as a preserver of relationships At least not for long just a few weeks in the case of John Podhoretz What was the story there I wonder Having children often does make people try hard to make their relationships work but I don t think marriage in and of itself does that although I know that is an argument often advanced in its favor People just get mean and depressed and drag about sullenly hoping their spouse will be swept away by El Nino Or become obsessed with work Or have whipped cream nights out when the cat s away Or all of the above About NOW Yes I have disagreed with their policies publicly on many occasions Not just about Paula Jones where I don t think their actual position is as bad as it s been made to look in the media but also their enthusiasm for electoral politics the Democratic Party and Clinton I have to say though that I don t blame them for not signing on to Paula Jones appeal The whole thing has become such a circus and Jones and her people are no friends of women either Look what they ve done to Monica Lewinsky The real victim in all this if you ask me Cheers Katha
