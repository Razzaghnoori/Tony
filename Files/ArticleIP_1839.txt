 Barry Scheck If there is a special corner of hell reserved for O J Simpson s lawyers and I m sure there is Barry Scheck has spent the last week roasting in it Scheck had conducted a magnificent defense of accused baby killer Louise Woodward complete with his trademark sneering speeches windmilling arms and devastating cross examinations Then Scheck watched stunned as his client was convicted of second degree murder and sentenced to life in prison What does this have to do with O J Well one alternate juror hinted that one factor in the verdict might be an O J backlash The alternate says he heard other panel members talk about getting Scheck about punishing him for his courtroom histrionics la the Simpson trial his sarcastic attacks on prosecution witnesses la the Simpson trial his hocus pocus medical evidence la the Simpson trial This is Barry Scheck s torture to be forever yoked to the Simpson case Not just yoked to the Simpson case but yoked to the worst of the Simpson case Scheck and fellow O J attorneys did the impossible They managed to lower the public s estimation of criminal defense lawyers Johnnie Cochran race baited and spun wild conspiracies Scheck badgered witnesses and split hairs His destruction of the prosecution s heralded DNA evidence was meticulous obnoxious and unforgettable Many lawyers consider Scheck s eight day evisceration of criminalist Dennis Fung Where is it Mr Fung the greatest cross examination since the Scopes trial The verbs to Scheck and to Schecktify entered the legal vocabulary Scheck came to personify the grotesque defense attorney bullying self righteous melodramatic In a priceless moment during the Woodward trial O J himself phoned Court TV to defend Scheck against charges of obnoxiousness For more on this click And yet of all O J s lawyers Scheck is the one who least deserves public disapproval He is in fact the very model of what a celebrity defense attorney should be Scheck has spent his entire professional life in pursuit of usually worthy causes His motto could be always righteous often right As an undergraduate at Yale in the late 1960s for example Scheck was a fervent anti war protestor Big deal so was everyone else But Scheck s protest was inspired and brave He fought to abolish all student deferments figuring that the war would end only when white middle class parents saw their white middle class kids like him die in Vietnam The same creative skepticism toward authority defines his legal career After law school Scheck worked for several years trying to expose grand jury abuse and then spent five years as a Legal Aid lawyer in the Bronx Eventually Scheck s vigor and intelligence landed him a job as a clinical law professor at New York s Cardozo Law School The job gave him the freedom to pursue cases that interested him In 1988 Scheck represented Hedda Nussbaum adoptive mother of the murdered Lisa Steinberg Paid only 25 an hour Scheck helped Nussbaum escape prosecution for Lisa s death and shifted blame to her companion Joel Steinberg who had battered and abused Nussbaum Scheck found his forte in the mid 1980s He and his law partner an equally pugnacious lawyer named Peter Neufeld handled a case where prosecutors carelessly used DNA evidence to railroad a suspect He and Neufeld made themselves the legal experts on DNA testing It became a cause for Scheck He was convinced that prosecutors would overstate their DNA evidence to secure conviction So five years ago Scheck and Neufeld launched the Innocence Project You would be hard pressed to find a more admirable enterprise Scheck Neufeld and their law students use DNA evidence to spring wrongly convicted criminals frequently rapists and murderers So far the Innocence Project has cleared more than 30 inmates including a dozen on death row Scheck is not perfectly consistent about DNA He uses genetic fingerprinting when it exonerates his clients and criticizes the technique when it implicates them But defense lawyering is a rough trade The O J case was Scheck s Faustian bargain It gave him useful fame but it tarnished him as someone who had helped O J get away with murder Scheck doesn t see it that way For him the O J case was as much about the misuse of medical evidence as about murder His devotion to his cause scientific evidence allowed him to avoid larger questions such as say Did he kill em Within that narrowed framework Scheck could construct an intellectually honest defense There was reasonable doubt because police forensic work was shameful Scheck began the case on the periphery of the defense team and ended it in the center There are very good reasons for this Scheck was probably the smartest of the defense lawyers and he was certainly the hardest working he spent weeks poring over complex evidence that other defense lawyers didn t bother with In Jeffrey Toobin s O J book The Run of His Life the chapter about Scheck is titled The Best Trial Lawyer O J made Scheck one of the most famous lawyers in the world and Scheck doesn t seem to mind He writes for Newsweek and comments for NBC on big trials He did the O J civil case and was surprisingly evenhanded But mostly he has used his celebrity to advance his causes Scheck is constantly in court for Project Innocence He has spoken out against the new restrictions on federal habeas corpus He serves on the New York State Commission on Forensic Science and he lectures to police departments and prosecutors across the country about proper use of genetic fingerprinting He is representing Abner Louima the Haitian immigrant who allegedly was sodomized with a toilet plunger by New York City cops The defense attorney is even advising Colorado investigators prosecutors on the medical evidence in the JonBenet Ramsey case Estimates of Scheck s fee in the nanny trial range from 100 000 to 300 000 But the Woodward case his second Trial of the Decade reflects Scheck s high mindedness as much as his greed After all Scheck earns a pittance compared with what he could if he were a full time criminal defense attorney The nanny case jibes perfectly with Scheck s obsession The case turns on questionable medical testimony about injuries to 8 month old victim Matthew Eappen Scheck commentators agree poked huge holes in the prosecution s claim that Woodward shook the baby and then dashed his head against a hard object If the wound to Eappen s skull was new asked Scheck why had scar tissue formed around it If Woodward had shaken the baby why did his neck show no signs of damage Scheck s questions didn t convince the jury but they may well persuade the judge to toss out Woodward s conviction or reduce her conviction to manslaughter The judge will not make that decision until Nov 10 at the earliest During the Woodward trial Johnnie Cochran has occasionally devoted his daily Court TV show Cochran Company to the case He has interviewed other lawyers alternate jurors experts Tuesday night Scheck himself was billed as a guest but he never appeared There was something fitting about this Cochran pontificated windily for the camera Scheck was too busy being a lawyer too busy trying to redeem a possibly innocent client to join him
