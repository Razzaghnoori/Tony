 The Suburbs Have Won The great movement of Americans during the 20 th century has been from the countryside and small cities into big metropolitan areas But within metropolitan areas the movement has been outward from the cities to the suburbs The next census in 2000 will show that the United States has become majority suburban Most Americans that is now live in metropolitan areas but outside the city limits New York is the biggest city in the country by a wide margin and it is the most urban in character but don t let that deceive you Seventy percent of New Yorkers live in the suburbs New York has been majority suburban for decades since before there was Levittown or Newsday or Please Don t Eat the Daisies About one in 20 Americans is a New York suburbanite The suburbs dominate popular culture The default setting for movies television shows and even rock music is the suburbs Anything with an urban or a rural setting is self consciously played as different The suburbs dominate politics especially national politics Newt Gingrich is the first suburban speaker of the House Every presidential campaign is now conceived of by strategists as a battle for the soul of the suburbs The presidential electorate became majority suburban years before the country as a whole did The dominant political machine in New York is a suburban one Al D Amato s Forget every Sunday newspaper trend story you ve ever read about gentrification or about harried metropolitans fleeing to small towns or about good hearted buppies returning to the hood Those are statistical blips or anecdotes or fantasies Urban America is still losing population Rural America is still losing population Black people are suburbanizing faster than white people The suburbs are unstoppable inescapable It is still possible to hear the suburbs described especially by professional city planners and other urbanologists as a kind of temporary and revocable aberration You know the argument They were subsidized by the federal government through the interstate highway program and cheap Veterans Administration mortgages They were forced upon New Yorkers by a road crazy mass transit hating Robert Moses Their growth was a pure product of race prejudice Millions of people especially New Yorkers are poised ready waiting eager to move back into the city if only I m sorry Forget about it The main reason for the growth of the suburbs is that Americans like suburbs They like houses They like lawns They like cars Most low income city people would move to the suburbs if they could Mass commitment to urbanism has never existed in the United States even in New York which seems more urban than it really is because it annexed most of its suburbs that is the Bronx Brooklyn Queens and Staten Island long ago What s remarkable about New York s suburbs is not their demographic success that s a characteristic of all suburbs but their cultural failure New York has the most out of it least happening suburbs of any big American city Only New York has no suburb with an essentially yuppie character by which I mean dotted with little strip centers containing perhaps one or two casually chic restaurants a Starbucks a Borders an upscale food market an art gallery a Merchant Ivory type movie theater and a mildly stylish home furnishings store Palo Alto Shaker Heights and University City Mo have far more of a patina of sophistication than any New York suburb New York also doesn t have a full blown suburban nirvana edge city suburb such as Plano Texas or Bloomington Minn or Tysons Corner Va the kind of suburb that has shiny enormous malls and totally planned communities with spindly little trees and curving streets and thatchy English names Meanwhile a truly hip suburb no that s not oxymoronic go visit West Lake Hills Texas or Berkeley or Topanga Calif where there would be leaflets stapled to the telephone poles and vegetarian restaurants and rave clubs is completely out of the question in New York the only American city where there is still a total overlap between downtown and bohemian It s the only city where the actual city is still the center not just of the metropolis s official high culture but of its everyday culture too Westchester County where I live is suburbia set in amber Its population has barely fluctuated for three quarters of a century You like prewar buildings Virtually the whole county of Westchester below Interstate 287 is prewar buildings it could be a movie set There are very few malls Superstores are just starting There is ethnicity There are country clubs the old undemocratic kind not the new kind that are essentially outdoor health clubs The expensive restaurants still serve continental cuisine The communities are all villages with sidewalked main streets containing rows of brick buildings just what brave suburban reformers in the Sun Belt are struggling desperately to coax into existence Life revolves around children If you lead any kind of alternative lifestyle you will be left blessedly alone rather than being ostracized but you won t find much in the way of an affinity culture At dinner parties people argue whether the kid who wrote bitch on a toilet stall in the middle school bathroom should be expelled My suburb Pelham is Westchester s alleged literary media colony but I have never been to a single social event here where a hothouse conversation about the Industry could be sustained for more than about half an hour before it slowly flutters back to home ground the town and the kids Yes this was the case even the week that Pelhamite Joe Klein was unmasked as the author of Primary Colors Virtually all the cultural imagery pertaining to Westchester dates from the 1950s The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit era and is now out of date But nothing has replaced it Martinis barbecues cigarettes adultery all are now vestigial but where are the new suburban symbolic hooks Back in the 1950s twin colossi sat astride the Hudson figuratively glowering at each other Betty Friedan in Grandview on the West Bank writing The Feminine Mystique and John Cheever in Scarborough on the East Bank writing the Wapshot books and the short stories She upset about the limited role accorded educated upper middle class women he upset about how little comfort the unlimited role accorded upper middle class male Episcopalians seemed to bring Since then at least one monumental social change has swept across suburbia namely the entry of married women into the work force without generating a literature The best Westchester novel of the past quarter century E L Doctorow s Ragtime is set in 1910 When I moved to New York from Texas people kept pulling me aside and saying helpfully that my life would be completely ruined if I chose to live in the suburbs or the city All my friends who had grown up in the organic New York suburbs had at some point around age 14 taken a blood oath never ever to live in the suburbs as adults People who did move to the suburbs had to obey an unwritten conversational rule that you had to justify it in stagy and fake terms either by exaggerating the hellishness of the city for children or by pretending that the suburbs were really not that far away and had lots of great Korean groceries I felt as if I had wandered in in the middle of the second act why did it make such a big difference What had happened to all those people when they were 14 that was so horrifying I now realize that what all this was really about was first the extreme difference in New York between suburban and urban culture which doesn t exist in most other cities because they don t really have an urban culture for middle class parents any more and second status The status point is a tricky one In the minor leagues of status where most people play the city is for the poor and the suburbs are for the rich so to move out to the suburbs is to move up as well But in the major leagues of status the city outranks the suburbs The city is where the real players live The city is for the aristocracy and the suburbs are for the bourgeoisie In the major leagues when you live in the suburbs it means that you haven t made it enough to afford the basic setup of co op apartment private school weekend house Or it means that you re not New York savvy enough to be able to arrange for yourself one of those special little deals the city is full of such as mainly a rent controlled apartment Or it means that you re not artful enough to be able to live charmingly as a bohemian If you have major league aspirations and can t manage to live in the city you re better off moving out past the suburban Zone of Shame and living full time in the kind of lovely small town where major leaguers spend weekends and summers At least then you re plausibly rustic and creative When I m off the Eastern Seaboard and people ask me where I m from I say New York When closer to home I have to answer in apologetic question language A suburb of New York In Westchester County Called Pelham Think of a real New York big shot Felix Spike Brooke Donna Mick Anna and then try to picture that person standing on a train platform listening to a humanoid voice announce over a microphone 1984 style Attention The 8 19 train to New York will be 13 minutes late due to operating difficulties It doesn t work does it More than the Democratic Party more than major league baseball more than the Social Security system more than the Hollywood salary structure the New York suburbs need to be reinvented They need a real animating idea that isn t a half century old Or at the very least a new set of clich s
