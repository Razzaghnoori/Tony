 well Amy it s been uh kind of overcast today and cloudy we have a our i have a son in kindergarten he was having a kite day yeah oh boy and i was really worried about it raining because it its has been there been some dark clouds and it s been um and it s been pretty rainy looking yeah i ve been trying to put weed spray on the lawn for the whole week and you can t put it on if it s suppose to rain within forty eight hours uh oh and so i keep hearing the forecast it s going to rain it s going to rain it s going to rain but it really hasn t rained yeah i know it just has that i it looks several times in the last couple of weeks it has looked rainy that day and not not done anything and we have a lot of trees yeah yeah in our yard and our property and they re pretty old big tall trees and so if it s an overcast day then the weather is pretty blah because i really have to some sunshine or else i feel like i live in a cave all the time um hum yeah yeah well i get tired with the kid i have two kid preschoolers a three year old and a two year old and when it s you know not nice and they can t go out it s really the pits so i appreciate it when at lately they can at least go play in the backyard for an hour or something you know um hum oh i bet yeah that makes a big difference but i uh we re kind of new to Plano and i m yeah yeah working on a carnival that s going to be in a couple of weeks for our school and i m thinking that this has been a pretty you know rainy season it s been scary it s of kind of been cloudy every day and i thought well i m just not anxious to have worry about the weather yeah yeah well my three and half year old he really wants to have the pool out in the backyard you know so any day i mean all Winter long he s been wanting a pool in the backyard so i m hoping you know that oh yeah it just seems like the weather around here goes so quickly from being Winter to you know muggy and hot and it s just you never really have like nice cool sixty five or seventy degree weather with sunshine you know and i really miss that i m from Chicago originally and i miss some miss seasons that you know that we used to get up there that you just don t have down here um hum well i know in um i m from Missouri and we always had pretty nice four seasons and and you know extreme we have some extreme weather in each season but um yeah i like that and we moved here from Houston in in uh July and everyone kept saying oh you re going up north it s not going to be so hot it s not going to be so humid and yeah that has just not been the case it has been oh oh really yeah it s pretty hot here during the Summer gosh oh it was extremely hot i thought i was going to die my car i thought it was going die last summer but do have air conditioning in your car or well the air conditioning was broke but broken i guess it just couldn t handle yeah the stress and the heat the record heat and you know i was worried about every time we came to an intersection that the car started idling rough you know because of the extreme heat oh yeah yeah yeah i know my husband doesn t have air conditioning in his car and he when he comes home from work you know during the Summer he s just well he feels like he s burning like he s been baking for an hour gosh um hum oh i know that s really awful but but i uh understand that this is kind of typical for this time of year the rainy season yeah what i hate is i hate having to water so much around here you know well we never used to have to water our lawns you know in Chicago it was always enough rain here and there um hum no sure but here if you don t water it just looks awful and i just hate to spend the money just going down the drain in watering grass you know brown yeah that is that is awful and it it takes time and the and the kids they you have to water your lawn and they want to go out and run in it and get all muddy and you know so you re going do i want a dirt a green lawn or a muddy feet in the house yeah we have a dog too so that adds to it you know been tracing in and out with whatever the weather is like out there so oh no well i don t know do the nice thing i m looking forward to is uh not having a hurricane season oh yeah because Houston was really hurricane alley wasn t it weren t there a lot of hurricanes there or yes we always had to big concern about hurricanes because we re close enough to the coast and you know you had to have a supply like uh emergency supply on hand all the time during the hurricane season and oh boy and it was pretty spooky this yeah that would be gosh they always have to think you know what s the weather doing and keep the weather radio close by and stuff like that right and do we have enough for you know um food storage and enough uh batteries and all the kinds of things yeah yeah really every time i store batteries i wind up going to use them and they re dead they ve been stored so long oh boy well then this is a little bit of relief although they still have warnings all the time around here for that s right so you know tornado season hurricanes and stuff so um hum well i yeah i don t really like tornadoes either but yeah but uh at least there isn t at least i feel like i got rid of something yeah hurricanes so not too much of that yeah well i ve been worried about mostly with having little kids now with taking them out in the Summer and getting them burnt up i mean i have to keep the sun screen on them just constantly when they go outside yes because they say it s just so dangerous for little ones to get a bad sunburn and it is and i just i can t believe this the record temperatures that have were here last summer that so yeah a hundred and ten degrees and it was just unbelievably hot and i can t stand to be outside at all when it s like that i just don t even want to go out you know the house to get the mail even leave me in the air conditioning that is pretty bad we had our air conditioning broke break last last Summer the switch got something wrong with the switch and we had to call somebody out to fix it because i couldn t take it more than a few hours without it on but oh i know i can t imagine even well that would it is just pretty bad but so i guess um yeah i guess the weather hasn t changed too much from here to Houston and yeah but it is like you say coming a little bit further up north yeah yeah it s a little bit nicer to have a Spring and a Fall season where you have some pleasant weather everyday where you can feel like you just want to open your windows and no yeah that s really nice i hate having to leave the house closed you know closed up all the time um hum yeah and get some fresh air in the house and it feels good but yeah but i guess well have you been here during the real heavy heavy rains i mean i can t remember what time of year i think it s usually t his time of year when we get some just torrential down pour gosh there was flooding our neighbors had flooding so badly it was like a foot deep in their house last year no but i remember oh no they had to replace all their carpeting and everything it was miserable now that sounds awful yeah that would not be fun no i have seen those i have driven around in the neighborhoods and seen those little flood gauges that will be there little yellow signs um hum it s you know has it like from one foot to four foot and i thought i would never buy a house were there is a flood gauge down the street oh really oh gosh no kidding talk about asking for trouble huh yeah that would be awful yeah yeah well i ve got some kids out on the trampoline i need to go look and see what they re doing okay well have a good day thanks bye bye well you too bye bye
