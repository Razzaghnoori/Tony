 Background Heterochromatin was first distinguished from euchromatin cytologically on the basis of differential staining properties 1 Molecular and genetic properties that further distinguish heterochromatin from euchromatin include DNA sequence composition replication timing condensation throughout the cell cycle and the ability to silence gene expression 2 3 4 In addition to genes required for viability and fertility 5 heterochromatin contains essential cis acting chromosome inheritance loci including elements required for centromere function 6 meiotic pairing 7 8 9 and sister chromatid cohesion 10 11 A significant fraction of the fly and human genomes are heterochromatic yet our current understanding of the sequence and organization of heterochromatin is very limited Heterochromatin is concentrated in megabase sized tracts in the centric and subtelomeric regions of the chromosomes It contains tandemly repeated short sequences satellite DNAs middle repetitive elements for example transposable elements and some single copy sequences 4 Progress has been made in the analysis of the non satellite component of Drosophila Arabidopsis and human heterochromatin 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 Less progress has been made in analysis of satellite sequences although recent studies have revealed the structure and composition of centromeric satellites 21 22 Heterochromatin accounts for an estimated 59 megabases Mb of the 176 Mb genome of the Drosophila melanogaster female and the 41 Mb male Y chromosome is entirely heterochromatic Figure 1 Polytene chromosomes which are so valuable in mapping euchromatic genes in Drosophila provide minimal resolution in the heterochromatin The heterochromatin is either severely under represented or poorly banded in polytene chromosomes and aggregates into an unbanded structure known as the chromocenter 23 24 Drosophila heterochromatin is best defined by the cytogenetic map of neuroblast mitotic chromosomes which resolves 61 heterochromatic bands h1 h61 by differential staining properties 5 25 The locations of repeated sequences within the heterochromatin have been studied using in situ hybridization of probes derived from known repeated elements to mitotic chromosomes 26 27 This together with molecular analysis of minichromosomes has elucidated the general organization and composition of heterochromatin Satellite blocks of 20 kilobases kb to 1 Mb are interrupted by islands of 5 50 kb of complex sequences that contain a high density of transposable elements 22 28 29 30 The transition between heterochromatin and euchromatin appears to be gradual rather than abrupt For example a hallmark of heterochromatin is a high density of transposable elements and the density of these elements in the genomic sequence increases continuously toward the centric ends of the euchromatic portions of the chromosome arms 12 31 32 This trend continues in the centric heterochromatin which contains large blocks of specific types of middle repetitive sequences 22 27 Heterochromatic genes have been defined by mutations that affect viability or fertility 33 Genetic screens reviewed in 5 have identified 14 vital loci in the heterochromatin of chromosome 2 34 35 and 12 vital loci in the heterochromatin of chromosome 3 36 Although no vital loci have been identified in the proximal heterochromatin of the X chromosome 37 several identified loci map near the boundary between the centric heterochromatin and the euchromatin see 38 There are six Y linked loci required for male fertility 39 reviewed in 5 Thus there are at least 32 identified genetic loci required for viability or fertility in the centric heterochromatin This is likely to be an underestimate because saturating genetic screens have not been done for all of the heterochromatin Molecularly characterized Drosophila heterochromatic genes encode diverse proteins and functions Examples include light post Golgi protein trafficking concertina like G protein subunit Nipped B morphogenesis rolled MAP kinase poly ADP ribose polymerase chromatin structure bobbed ribosomal RNA and the Y linked fertility factors kl 2 kl 3 and kl 5 dynein heavy chains 33 Genes have been localized on the cytogenetic map through analysis of chromosomal rearrangements and by fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH 25 40 41 The genomic structures of several of these genes have been determined and they differ from those of euchromatic genes Their introns and regulatory regions are composed of clusters of partial and complete transposable elements and some introns are hundreds of kilobases in length 42 43 44 45 46 The Release 1 whole genome shotgun WGS assembly of Drosophila 12 included 3 8 Mb of short unmapped scaffolds representing heterochromatic sequence The most recent version WGS3 47 assembled a total of 137 7 Mb of the Drosophila genome using an improved assembly algorithm and the same trace data used for Release 1 A high quality sequence of 116 9 Mb that spans the euchromatic portions of the chromosome arms is reported in 47 For the sake of consistency we refer to this 116 9 Mb sequence as the Release 3 euchromatic sequence even though on the basis of the cytological criteria for defining the boundary between euchromatin and heterochromatin described below we believe this sequence extends into the centric heterochromatin of each chromosome arm The annotation of genes and transposable elements in this approximately 2 Mb of heterochromatin derived DNA are reported in 32 48 Here we characterize and annotate the 20 7 Mb of WGS3 sequence the WGS heterochromatic sequence that is not represented in the 116 9 Mb Release 3 euchromatic sequence Results Annotation of WGS3 heterochromatic sequences WGS3 was aligned to the 116 9 Mb Release 3 sequence spanning the euchromatin 47 The WGS sequence that extends beyond the Release 3 euchromatic sequence or otherwise fails to align is an unfinished draft quality assembly of a total of 20 7 Mb of the heterochromatic portion of the D melanogaster genome The WGS3 heterochromatic sequence is distributed in 2 597 scaffolds It includes portions of five scaffolds that overlap with and extend the Release 3 euchromatic sequences of chromosome arms X 2L 2R 3L and 3R The scaffolds range from 1 kb to 712 kb Figure 2 and include 1 170 sequence gaps accounting for 3 7 Mb 18 Some scaffolds particularly those under 2 kb may map within sequence gaps of larger scaffolds The WGS3 heterochromatic sequence was aligned to the corresponding portion of the Release 2 sequence Although there are local differences between the two assemblies the order and orientation of sequences are well conserved The most significant difference between them is that WGS3 heterochromatic scaffolds are often considerably longer than the corresponding Release 2 scaffolds For example a 252 kb WGS3 scaffold extends over 13 smaller Release 2 scaffolds and includes all seven exons of the heterochromatic gene rolled in the correct order and orientation Figure 3 rolled maps to bands h40 h41 on the right arm of chromosome 2 49 We annotated the 12 0 Mb of WGS3 heterochromatic sequence in the 85 scaffolds longer than 40 kb plus a 133 kb sequence at the centric end of the Release 3 euchromatic sequence of the X chromosome that was not annotated by Misra et al 48 We arbitrarily excluded the 8 7 Mb of WGS3 heterochromatic sequence in the 2 512 scaffolds shorter than 40 kb from detailed annotation Preliminary analysis suggested that gene identification in these small scaffolds is hampered in part by the separation of exons onto different scaffolds This is illustrated by our annotation of seven super scaffolds that were constructed by linking together 25 short WGS3 heterochromatic scaffolds using cDNA evidence see below Thus the scaffolds shorter than 40 kb do contain genes but a reliable annotation of these sequences will require further analysis Identifying genes within heterochromatin presents challenges not encountered when annotating euchromatic sequences Open reading frames ORFs in transposable elements can interfere with the identification of single copy protein coding genes particularly when transposable elements are nested within introns Also heterochromatic genes can have large introns separating relatively small exons 42 43 44 45 46 Therefore transposable element and low complexity sequences were masked then the lengths of masked regions and sequence gaps were reduced to a maximum of 70 bp which is the median intron length of euchromatic protein coding genes in Drosophila 48 50 We annotated the masked scaffolds using the computational annotation pipeline developed by Mungall et al 51 and the annotation tool Apollo 52 The pipeline generates stores and filters alignments of expressed sequence tags ESTs cDNAs and the results of protein similarity searches and gene prediction algorithms Apollo displays the filtered results of the pipeline in tiers of evidence and allows human curators to evaluate and use the evidence to construct gene models The guidelines used to define gene models in the euchromatin 48 were modified slightly to deal with the unique properties of heterochromatic sequence see Materials and methods We generated 351 preliminary gene models on the masked scaffolds Next the preliminary gene models were re curated on the unmasked WGS3 heterochromatic sequence scaffolds The unmasked scaffolds were run through the computational annotation pipeline and the preliminary gene models were aligned to this genomic sequence Twenty five preliminary gene models could not be aligned to the unmasked scaffolds using sim4 53 After further examination 11 of these were accepted as curated gene models six were similar to transposable elements and were rejected and eight could not be reconciled with the unmasked sequence A higher quality genomic sequence may be required to verify these eight models and they have not been included here The remaining preliminary gene models aligned in a consistent manner After re examination of the evidence a total of 293 preliminary gene models were accepted including 287 protein coding gene models and five non protein coding gene models Because they are present on WGS3 heterochromatic scaffolds shorter than 40 kb a number of previously known Y linked protein coding genes were missed by our analysis We annotated six of these Y linked genes kl 2 kl 3 kl 5 Ory Pp1 Y2 and Ppr Y The WGS sequence data were generated from clone libraries made from mixed sex populations so the male Y chromosome is represented by a four fold lower density of sequence reads than the autosomes In addition Y linked genes can have very large introns 46 Consequently sequences on the Y chromosome are represented by shorter scaffolds in the WGS assemblies 54 In fact five of the six Y linked genes that we annotated were first characterized by analysis of short WGS scaffolds 55 56 We used cDNA sequences to identify short WGS3 scaffolds bearing fragments of each of the six genes concatenated these scaffolds into larger scaffolds super scaffolds see Materials and methods and annotated the resulting sequences to produce gene models We produced and annotated one additional super scaffold linked_7 using EST evidence The seven super scaffolds contain 10 protein coding gene models and one non protein coding gene model Evidence for the gene models We generated 297 protein coding gene models and six non protein coding gene models These include 30 previously known and molecularly characterized protein coding genes see Supplementary Table 1 in the additional data file The protein coding gene models are supported by four classes of evidence alignment to Drosophila ESTs alignment to Drosophila full insert cDNA sequences protein similarity and prediction by gene finding algorithms There are 134 gene models 45 that overlap at least one aligned EST and 58 of these 20 are further supported by an aligned cDNA sequence There are 167 models 54 with protein similarity evidence and 241 models 81 supported by gene prediction The numbers of gene models supported by all combinations of the classes of evidence is diagrammed in Figure 4 The 28 models 9 supported only by EST evidence require further validation because cDNA libraries can be contaminated with various artifacts including sequences from unprocessed transcripts The 89 models 30 supported only by gene prediction are included in our curated set because they encode peptides of at least 100 amino acids with no significant similarity to proteins encoded by transposable elements see below Finally the 15 models 5 supported only by protein similarity have BLAST or TBLASTX expect scores E values of less than 1 10 10to sequences in Drosophila or other species We excluded gene models with greater than 95 identity over 50 bp to known transposable elements We then examined nine remaining preliminary gene models with a TBLASTX E value of less than 1 10 9when compared to a database of transposable elements 32 and we retained all but one of them in our annotation Although these gene models have weak similarity to proteins encoded by transposable elements the extent of similarity is insufficient to suggest that they represent bona fide transposable element ORFs Two of these models represent the genes kl 5 and scro and the region of similarity in scro corresponds to the homeodomain of this transcription factor gene To further verify that the WGS3 heterochromatic annotations do not show significant homology to transposable elements we compared the distributions of WGS3 heterochromatic and Release 3 euchromatic gene models with TBLASTX similarity to transposable elements over a range of expect scores Figure 5 This analysis shows that the percentage of gene models with weak similarity to transposable elements is comparable in the WGS3 heterochromatic annotation and the Release 3 euchromatic annotation The WGS3 heterochromatic gene models are supported by fewer data than the Release 3 euchromatic gene models In the WGS3 heterochromatin 45 of gene models have an overlapping EST compared to 78 in the Release 3 euchromatin Twenty percent of gene models in the WGS3 heterochromatin are based on full insert sequences of cDNAs compared to over 70 in the Release 3 euchromatin However this observation is biased because half of the cDNAs in the Drosophila Gene Collection were selected for full insert sequencing based on EST alignments to Release 2 gene models 57 and the WGS3 heterochromatin annotation preserves few of the Release 2 models and adds many new models Many WGS3 heterochromatic gene models are based solely on gene predictions Despite generating a large number of models gene finding algorithms were less successful at predicting heterochromatic genes than euchromatic genes For example only 72 of the heterochromatic gene models are supported by Genscan predictions as opposed to 96 of the Release 3 euchromatic gene models Finally we annotated six non protein coding RNA genes WGS3 scaffold 211000022279294 contains rDNA sequences including two complete copies each of the 5 8S and 28 rRNAs a truncated 18S rRNA sequence that extends into a sequence gap and a truncated 2S rRNA sequence that extends beyond the end of the scaffold This region probably represents a portion of one of the two bobbed loci which map to the X and Y chromosomes 58 59 Two additional non protein coding gene models were annotated by similarity to euchromatic genes see Supplementary Table 1 in the Additional data file Comparison to the Release 2 annotation The annotation of WGS3 heterochromatic sequence has increased both the number and quality of gene models in the heterochromatin relative to the corresponding portion of Release 2 see Supplementary Table 2 in the additional data files During the curation of the 297 protein coding gene models in WGS3 heterochromatic sequence 79 gene models from the corresponding portion of Release 2 were deleted and 250 new gene models were created Many of the deleted Release 2 annotations represent ORFs that overlap transposable elements In annotating WGS3 heterochromatin 10 Release 2 gene models were merged into five new models one Release 2 model was split into two new models and one Release 2 annotation was split into two models one of which was merged with another model Only 30 of the 130 Release 2 protein coding gene models were preserved intact in the new annotation 21 previous models were preserved with modifications Thus a much higher fraction of Release 2 gene models was modified in the WGS3 heterochromatin annotation than in the Release 3 euchromatic annotation in which nearly two thirds of predicted ORFs were unchanged 48 As in the annotation of the Release 3 euchromatic sequence the increased numbers of ESTs and cDNA sequences available for alignment to the WGS3 heterochromatic sequence resulted in significant improvements in the annotation of untranslated regions UTRs alternative transcripts and intron exon structures see Supplementary Table 2 in additional data files Twice as many genes in WGS3 heterochromatin have annotated 5 and 3 UTRs as in the corresponding portion of Release 2 The average 5 UTR length is 258 bp and the average 3 UTR length is 335 bp both of which are close to the average UTR length of Release 3 euchromatic genes There are 49 gene models with more than one transcript only three were annotated in the corresponding portion of Release 2 There are 377 predicted protein coding transcripts encoding 1 096 distinct exons three times as many as were annotated in Release 2 The average number of introns per gene model increased from 2 to 2 7 but remains below the 3 6 average in the Release 3 euchromatin The average length of introns increased significantly from 892 bp in the corresponding portion of Release 2 to 3 743 bp in WGS3 heterochromatin The longest annotated intron in WGS3 heterochromatin is 119 217 bp dwarfing a 17 613 bp intron that was the longest in the corresponding portion of Release 2 Finally only two introns longer than 10 kb were annotated in Release 2 but 76 gene models in WGS3 heterochromatin have introns longer than 10 kb Whereas the majority of annotated introns in both the WGS3 heterochromatin and the Release 3 euchromatin are in the range of 50 70 bp there are clearly more long introns in heterochromatic genes Annotations of selected regions The second largest WGS3 heterochromatic scaffold annotated is 594 kb long Figure 6 and incorporates five separate Release 2 scaffolds The sequence of this scaffold is contained within a previously described BAC contig 60 61 Because the scaffold contains two well studied autosomal heterochromatic genes light and concertina analysis of its sequence provides an opportunity to assess the accuracy of both the WGS3 sequence assembly and the annotation process over an extended heterochromatic region This scaffold maps within band h35 on 2Lh and its orientation with respect to the centromere is known 49 61 62 The scaffold lies approximately 100 kb proximal to the end of the Release 3 euchromatic sequence of 2L 47 as determined by genomic Southern blots using single copy probes derived from the ends of the scaffold and the Release 3 2L sequence 61 The structure of the scaffold is entirely consistent with previous 2Lh mapping studies in that the order of six single copy sequences and the predicted Not I Pme I and Sfi I restriction maps of the scaffold except for four regions corresponding to sequence gaps are the same as those observed in the corresponding BAC contig and on genomic Southern blots We annotated 12 protein coding genes within the scaffold The annotation of the rolled gene illustrates how masking the WGS3 heterochromatic sequence improved Genscan performance and simplified curation Figure 7 cDNA sequences define two alternative rolled transcripts that differ in their 5 UTRs All rolled exons defined by the cDNA sequences align to the WGS3 heterochromatic scaffold and the masked scaffold in the correct order and orientation In the annotation of the unmasked WGS3 scaffold transposable elements within rolled introns interfered with Genscan so that a very poor rolled gene prediction was generated and protein similarity results of transposable elements complicated the evidence In the annotation of the masked scaffold Genscan predicted a single gene model that includes all but one rolled coding exon and protein similarity evidence supported the exon that Genscan missed Transposable elements We carried out a preliminary analysis of the transposable element sequences found in the WGS3 heterochromatic sequence We used a database of transposable elements 32 and RepeatMasker 63 to measure the amount of sequence that was derived from each transposable element family Many of the sequences we identified represent only portions of elements such fragmentary elements are often generated when transposable elements insert into one another to form complex nests 32 Despite this complication we were able to estimate the contribution of each transposable element class The most striking observation is the high fraction of the WGS3 heterochromatic sequence that is derived from transposable elements We found that 52 of the 20 7 Mb WGS3 heterochromatic sequence had similarity to known transposable elements Using similar analyses transposable elements account for just 5 0 of the Release 3 euchromatic sequence a slightly lower value of 3 9 was obtained in the analyses reported in 32 which required a higher level of sequence conservation There were also some differences in the relative contributions made by different classes of elements in heterochromatin and euchromatin LTR elements represent 61 of euchromatic transposable elements and approximately 78 of heterochromatic elements LINE elements represent 24 of the euchromatic and 17 of the heterochromatic transposable element sequence TIR elements represent 15 in euchromatin and 5 in heterochromatin No FB elements were identified using RepeatMasker a more targeted search identified 12 kb 0 1 of FB element sequence Although we found a much higher density of transposable element sequences in the heterochromatin than in the euchromatin it is likely that we missed many heterochromatic transposable elements In fact we found ORFs with similarity to transposable elements such as those encoding transposases outside those regions we annotated as transposable elements see Figure 7a for example suggesting the existence of novel transposable element families Finally many of the sequence gaps within scaffolds probably correspond to regions of the genome with very high transposable element density Thus our analysis almost certainly represents an underestimate of the total transposable element content of the WGS3 heterochromatic scaffolds As repetitive elements are difficult to assemble using the WGS strategy an accurate estimate of their contribution to the heterochromatic sequence awaits a more finished version of the sequence Cytological boundaries of centric heterochromatin Although there is no universally accepted definition of heterochromatin the most reliable classification of the centric heterochromatin is cytological Therefore we consider the sequences located within the bands h1 h61 of the cytological map defined on mitotic chromosomes to be heterochromatic In order to correlate heterochromatin cytology with the genome sequence we mapped the boundaries of the euchromatin and centric heterochromatin on chromosome arms X 2L 2R 3L and 3R by FISH of BAC derived probes to mitotic chromosomes see Materials and methods BACs were selected from the centric ends of the essentially finished Release 3 sequence contigs that span the euchromatin 47 and the positions of the resulting hybridization signals on the cytological map were determined Figure 8 Table 1 These data show that the large Release 3 sequence contigs extend into the centric heterochromatin on these five chromosome arms Although BACs were localized to chromosome 4 data not shown the cytology of this chromosome is too poor to permit a clear BAC based mapping of the boundary of the centric heterochromatin The Y chromosome has no boundary because it is entirely heterochromatic For the purposes of defining the gene content of the heterochromatic portion of the genomic sequence we provisionally designate the distal ends of the indicated BACs Table 1 as defining the boundaries of the centric heterochromatin within the finished genomic sequence However the transition from euchromatin to heterochromatin appears to be gradual rather than sharp and the resolution of these cytological mapping experiments appears to be on the order of 100 kb Therefore we have approximately localized the heterochromatin euchromatin boundaries with respect to the genomic sequence and have defined precise boundaries here simply as a convenience in discussing the genome annotation data By this definition the Release 3 sequence that spans the euchromatin includes 2 1 Mb of sequence in centric heterochromatin and this sequence includes 150 curated genes described in Misra et al 48 These genes are in addition to those identified in our analysis which was restricted to the WGS3 heterochromatic scaffolds described above The BACs that we localized on the cytological map of the mitotic chromosomes have also been positioned using in situ hybridization to salivary gland polytene chromosomes 47 60 Although banding in the proximal regions of the polytene chromosomes is not as distinct as in the euchromatic regions comparison of the two datasets shows the approximate extent of overlap between the mitotic and polytene cytogenetic maps Table 1 The boundary of the centric heterochromatin of the X chromosome at the distal edge of band h26 corresponds approximately to polytene division 20C band h35 on chromosome arm 2L corresponds to polytene division 40A band h45 on 2R corresponds to polytene division 41F band h47 on 3L corresponds to polytene division 80A and band h58 on 3R corresponds to polytene division 82C Discussion Improvements to the annotation The annotation of the heterochromatic portion of the Drosophila genome described here is a work in progress We have annotated protein coding genes and summarized preliminary observations on non protein coding genes and transposable elements Our analysis was limited by the high repeat content of heterochromatin and by the unfinished quality of the WGS3 heterochromatic sequence Our decision to delay annotation of the scaffolds shorter than 40 kb has probably resulted in failure to identify some genes especially on the Y chromosome Despite these limitations the protein coding gene annotations are generally reliable as demonstrated by the identification of previously known heterochromatic genes and the alignment of cDNA sequences to the draft genomic sequence and the annotated gene models Nevertheless the quality of the annotations will be greatly improved by the addition of more full length cDNA sequences of heterochromatic genes and by comparative analysis using the mosquito 66 and D pseudoobscura 67 WGS sequences Future analyses of the differences between euchromatic and heterochromatic sequence may lead to improvements in the performance of computational gene prediction algorithms on heterochromatic sequence Our observations that the gene prediction tools Genie 68 and Genscan 69 performed relatively poorly in identifying heterochromatic genes suggests that these programs could be modified to improve their performance on heterochromatic sequence Processing the genomic sequence by masking repeats and reducing the distances between potential coding exons improved the performance of the gene prediction tools and improved gene identification during subsequent re annotation of the unmasked sequence Optimization of these preprocessing steps should lead to improved performance The annotated gene models that are supported by cDNA and or high quality TBLASTX matches provide a useful dataset for training and testing gene prediction algorithms on heterochromatic sequence A collection of approximately 600 P transposable element insertions in heterochromatin has recently been generated 70 A Y Konev C M Yan E O Hagan S Tickoo G H K unpublished data These P element insertions will provide tools for the analysis of heterochromatic genes and manipulation of the heterochromatic portion of the genome For example P element mediated deletions of centric heterochromatin have been used to map genes and regions responsible for controlling gene expression and replication 40 Improvements to the genomic sequence We plan to improve the WGS3 heterochromatic sequence by filling sequence gaps and correcting assembly errors The quality of the WGS assembly suggests a strategy for bringing these sequences to high quality first select a tiling path of 10 kb genomic clones from the WGS that span each scaffold second sequence each clone to high quality third assemble these 10 kb sequences to reconstruct the genomic sequence and fourth verify the assembly by comparison to cDNA sequence alignments and to restriction digests of genomic DNA assayed if necessary on Southern blots cDNA alignments will also be useful in linking separate scaffolds in cases in which the exons of a single gene lie in more than one scaffold We gained extensive experience in each of these steps during our finishing of the euchromatic portion of the genome 47 and no new technology is required to bring the WGS scaffolds we have described here to finished quality Some regions of the heterochromatin are clonable in BACs Three small BAC contigs from the genome physical map are located in the centric heterochromatin of chromosome arms 2L 2R and 3L 60 Draft sequences of BACs spanning these contigs were produced during the Release 1 phase of the genome sequencing project 12 71 The small BAC contig on 2L corresponds to the WGS3 scaffold that includes light and concertina see Figure 6 61 and the contigs on 2R and 3L also align to WGS3 scaffolds We have also identified BACs containing the rolled PARP and SNAP25 genes in pilot STS content mapping experiments in the heterochromatin Doubtless other regions of the heterochromatin will be represented in large insert libraries and BACs will be useful for linking and orienting short WGS3 heterochromatic scaffolds However we were unable to identify BACs containing the Y linked genes ccy and kl 5 in available Drosophila BAC libraries 60 72 perhaps due to high satellite DNA content This suggests that not all heterochromatic regions assembled in WGS3 will be represented in BACs We also do not yet know whether the highly repetitive nature of heterochromatin decreases the stability of sequences cloned in BACs For these reasons we favor a sequence finishing strategy based on the 10 kb clones generated in the WGS Materials and methods Genomic sequence alignments The alignment of WGS3 to the essentially finished Release 3 sequence spanning the euchromatin is described in Celniker et al 47 WGS3 scaffolds that did not show significant alignment were defined to be heterochromatic In addition five WGS3 scaffolds aligned to the centric ends of the Release 3 euchromatic sequence and extended beyond them We used sim4 53 and MUMmer 73 to realign these five scaffolds and the sequence extending beyond the aligned portions of the Release 3 euchromatic sequence contigs was extracted with a 60 bp overlap and included in the WGS3 heterochromatic sequence Finally a 133 kb region including BACR48D21 at the centric end of the Release 3 X chromosome sequence 47 was not included in the Release 3 annotation of the euchromatin 48 This sequence was included in the analysis of WGS3 heterochromatic sequence The WGS3 heterochromatic sequence scaffolds were aligned to the corresponding Release 2 sequence scaffolds using BLAST2 74 The alignment results were carefully examined and the two assemblies were found to have few discrepancies Masking sequence scaffolds We masked WGS3 heterochromatic sequences before annotation We used RepeatMasker 63 with the default settings to mask transposable elements 32 and low complexity sequences Next we shortened all sequence gaps and repeat masked regions to 70 bp Databases and tools To annotate the WGS3 heterochromatic sequence we used the computational analysis pipeline and databases described in Mungall et al 51 This pipeline aligns Drosophila ESTs cDNA sequences and other sequences in GenBank using sim4 53 performs DNA and protein sequence similarity searches of the GenBank and SwissProt TrEMBL databases using BLASTX and TBLASTX and executes the gene prediction algorithms Genie 68 and Genscan 69 The results generated by the pipeline were filtered using the Bioinformatics Output Parser BOP 51 and the filtered results were curated using the tool Apollo 52 Curation guidelines To determine the intron exon structure of gene models curators visually inspected the alignment of computational evidence types to the WGS3 heterochromatic sequences using Apollo Alternative transcripts supported by EST evidence and UTRs were annotated The criteria used to curate the gene models in the WGS3 sequence were identical to those used in the annotation of the euchromatin 48 with two exceptions First computational results derived from Genscan were not judged by their scores as it was empirically determined that low scoring Genscan results often correctly predicted the intron exon structures suggested by other evidence types such as cDNAs Second the predicted proteins of the WGS3 annotation were compared to a curated transposable element dataset 32 Gene models with an alignment of at least 50 nucleotides with at least 95 identity to transposable elements were rejected Gene models produced on the masked scaffolds were mapped to the unmasked WGS3 sequence using sim4 Gene models that aligned with less than 95 identity to the unmasked sequence were not preserved Gene models were checked to ensure that they did not overlap transposable elements and that they did not have major alterations of their intron exon structure due to the presence of unmasked data Gene models were refined using evidence that had not aligned to the masked WGS3 sequence Linking scaffolds with cDNAs In WGS3 exons of the kl 5 gene are distributed over four scaffolds These scaffolds were concatenated and annotated to produce a kl 5 gene model Similar super scaffolds linked_1 to linked_6 were constructed for the genes kl 2 kl 3 kl 5 Ory Pp1 Y2 and Ppr Y An additional super scaffold linked_7 was constructed based on EST evidence The super scaffolds were constructed as follows with each WGS3 scaffold indicated by the last five digits of the scaffold ID and relative orientation indicated by F forward or R reverse

80118R linked_6 80329F 78590F and linked_7 78279R 78567F Because the gaps between individual scaffolds in a super scaffold are not spanned by identified genomic clones their lengths are undefined These gaps are represented with a string of 1 000 Ns following the convention established for the Release 1 genomic sequence 12 Fluorescence in situhybridization FISH Mitotic chromosomes from third instar larval neuroblasts were obtained by standard procedures 25 Slides were aged at room temperature for 24 h or for 2 h at 60 C pretreated in 100 g ml RNaseA 2x SSC pH 7 at 37 C for 30 60 min

ethanol Probes were centrifuged for 20 min at 14 000 rpm and 4 C washed in 70 ethanol and briefly dried in a Sorvall SpeedVac Hybridization mix 10 15 l was added to each dried pellet All probes were initially hybridized in a solution containing 55 formamide 2x SSC 20 dextran sulfate 1 Tween 20 incubated overnight at 37 C and washed in 55 formamide 2x SSC at 42 C for 20 min followed by four washes

stringency 60 formamide hybridization solution and post hybridization washes In single color hybridization experiments biotinylated or digoxigenin labeled BAC probes were detected using FITC avidin Vector Laboratories or FITC anti digoxigenin Roche respectively Detections were performed overnight at 4 C or 1 3 h at room temperature For multi BAC two color FISH biotinylated probes were detected with FITC avidin and digoxigenin labeled probes were detected with Rhodamine anti digoxigenin Roche After incubation with avidin or anti digoxigenin slides were washed in coplin jars on a rotating shaker for three 5 min washes in 4x SSC 0 1 Tween 20 DNA was counterstained with Vectashield Vector Laboratories containing 1 5 g ml 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole DAPI The location of the BAC signals relative to the DAPI banding pattern on the heterochromatic map was determined by visual analysis in Photoshop Adobe In addition an independent quantitative analysis using IP Labs Signal Analytics Vienna VA and a fluorescence quantitation script 70 was performed on each image The fluorescence levels along lines drawn through the chromosome axis were plotted for the DAPI and BAC signals Figure 8b which produces a more precise localization than is possible by visual inspection of the images A minimum of 10 prometaphase chromosomes were analyzed for each BAC and localizations were determined by consensus Heterochromatin in the Release 3 euchromatic sequence The BACs at the boundaries between euchromatin and centric heterochromatin see Table 1 identify 2 1 Mb 150 curated gene models of heterochromatic sequence at the centric ends of the high quality Release 3 sequence spanning the euchromatin 47 The distal ends of the boundary BACs were identified using BAC end sequences The sequence proximal to these positions is provisionally defined to be heterochromatic X 21 561 835 to 21 912 668 bp 0 351 Mb six genes 2L 21 834 050 to 22 217 931 bp 0 384 Mb 25 genes 2R 1 to 467 915 0
