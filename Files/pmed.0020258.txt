                            Animal models can play an essential role in guiding preclinical vaccine development        including in studies of preclinical vaccine safety vaccine toxicity and vaccine        immunogenicity Appropriate pathogen challenge models can also provide the opportunity to        perform preclinical tests of vaccine efficacy Preclinical tests of HIV vaccine efficacy        are usually performed by exposing macaques to simian immunodeficiency virus SIV a virus        that is closely related to HIV However the viral inoculum sizes used to infect macaques        with SIV vastly exceed the amounts of HIV that humans are exposed to during a given        exposure Typically animals are exposed to  times the infectious dose at which  of        the animals become infected ID These excessive doses may not provide realistic        preclinical tests of vaccine efficacy Indeed no vaccine has been shown to be effective in        preventing infection by SIV socalled sterilizing immunity in such high viral inoculum        trials Now in a paper published in         PLoS Medicine  Roland Regoes and colleagues speculate that an        alternative approach to trials in animals not only can mimic the human patterns of repeated        lowdose exposure but also can remove one concern for animal researchersthe need to use        very large numbers of animals in experiments        What the researchers did was use statistical power analysis to compare a single lowdose        challenge design in which each animal is challenged only once and a repeated lowdose        challenge design in which each animal is challenged until it is infected or a        predetermined maximum number of challenges is reached The statistical power of an        experimental designa measure of the statistical qualitywas assessed by simulating        experiments evaluating them and then repeating the procedure thousands of times        What they found was that the experimental design using a single low dose of virus in        each animal required unfeasibly large numbers of animals even for the highest modeled        vaccine efficacy of  the single lowdose challenge design required more than  animals        per group to reach a statistical power of  However when the researchers modeled a        protocol of repeatedly challenging the virtual animals with a challenge dose of one         ID          and allowing for a maximum number of  challenges of each        individual animal as few as five animals were required to achieve more than  of        statistical power        Where do these results leave the design of HIV trials To begin with the results should        encourage researchers to develop animal models that reflect to the fullest extent        possible what is known about the natural history and pathogenesis of the disease in        humans rather than designing trials to fit the animal models that are available The        authors have made available the programming script of their analysis so anyone can repeat        it it would be interesting to know whether preclinical trials assessing vaccines or        treatments against infections by other pathogens could be usefully modeled in this way as        well
