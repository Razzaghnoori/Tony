 Libertarianism Is Not Anarchism I have been asked to kick off this discussion with Larry about what may be termed the rapid colonization of the Internet As with all new spaces someone has to figure out the rights and duties of all the participants to that new world And to do that it becomes important to use but not abuse the analogies that are available to us from existing spaces In doing this inquiry we can work the issue descriptively and ask how things have gone But the focus I think of Larry s book is to ask the normative question given who we are as people what ought to be the way in which this new space is occupied by its new tenants In answering that question I ll take my cue from Larry s favorite foil the libertarian to see how he or she would inhabit that space I might also state from the outset that I take this tack with a certain rooting interest since my affection for libertarian thought at least of the limited government variety long antedates my concern with cyberspace In so doing I shall break ranks however from those cyberspace devotees who think on Larry s account that cyberspace is unique because its basic structure or its nature rules out of bound any form of effective state regulation I confess that this is not my understanding of the problem at all The use of nature as a trope for libertarian thought goes back a long way before cyberspace There were lots of libertarians who thought that human beings were by nature free or that individuals could acquire property by first possession that is for non lawyers the capture of animals or movables or the occupation of land Indeed occupation was called the natural mode of occupation But these efforts to win the libertarian battle by appealing to some sort of natural law natural right or natural necessity always turned out to be losers Someone could come along and argue that the brute fact of possession did not translate itself into a right But of course skepticism could run in every conceivable direction at once so that once the challenge was made at least one riposte was possible Animals lands and chattels are not communal by nature either Someone has to come up with an argument that shows why their preferred form of social organization should induce the rest of us as rational agents to sign on to their program Stated in that way the case for private property rests on the incentives that it creates for the preservation and spread of wealth while the case against it rests on similar utilitarian commitments giving private ownership to a river blocks transportation recreation and aesthetic values And then one has to pair up different regimes of ownership with different kinds of assets So it is with cyberspace It is quite possible to think that it is best for government to have a copy of each and every communication that takes place across the net and someone armed with that conviction could think it proper to stage nighttime raids in private homes to shut down nonconforming machines Or we could simply refuse to allow people to communicate over the net much the way in which the old Soviet system refused to allow private individuals to communicate with each other by telephone So I quite agree that the legal structure sensible or Draconian as it might be can shape the nature of interactions on the net just as it has shaped interaction first on land and sea and then on the spectrum If Larry wants to call the sum of regulation public and private code so be it But I don t see what the use of that terminology which cuts at variance with ordinary English adds to the discussion of the matter That said I think that it is important to answer the question of why so many people who are attracted to the Net call themselves or think of themselves as libertarian Here on earth the libertarian is not an anarchist who thinks that all government conduct is bad and all private conduct good He does not believe as Larry would have him say that government in the modern libertarian s view is the threat to liberty private action is not Page 85 Nor would a libertarian accept that his goal is focused on reducing government s power That is surely the current objective given the bloated government that we have But it is not the way in which a libertarian traditional or modern thinks about government if we start as political theory often starts in the state of nature Rather the libertarian is someone whose objective function starts with the goal of minimizing the use of force and fraud in human interactions The hard part of the system is to figure out a way in which that minimization takes place over both public and private actors Aggression by private persons produces small gains and very large losses which is why we allow force in self defense But aggression that is the use of force by government is subject to the same peril and becomes even more dangerous if the state falls into the wrong hands when it has a monopoly of force against all persons Unfortunately the world is such that we will not minimize the total amount of aggression by reducing the amount of government aggression to zero That is why the libertarian is not an anarchist But we would like with some sense of rough justice to create a system in which each increment of government force results in a greater decrement of private force so that at the margin the sum of both is minimized But even that program is called into question at least in part because some government coercion is justified such as taxes to secure the creation of infrastructure and the police force to prevent private aggression while curbing the excesses of rogue officers One real dispute is just how much force results in the social optimum If one looks to the Internet it is clear that we can get along with a lot less government force than in other places Physical aggression against neighbors is ruled out in part by the anonymous participation that is possible online And there is a widespread recognition of the inability to form a complex infrastructure by largely private means Someone perhaps the state has to organize some infrastructure over which all communications must travel But then it is possible as in physical space to add on to that collective spine all sorts of gated communities in cyberspace which can be subject to their own internal organization and rules Larry is right to point out that the architecture of the Harvard system is more centralized to its detriment than the Chicago system But to a libertarian that is just fine since each of these organizations is internally organized under a principle of unanimous consent But it is the want of force and the successful nature of voluntary interactions that allow people to see how much can be done without government But still the idea that liberty converges onto anarchy seems to me to be misguided It is still possible to steal confidential information that is transferred on the net and so we need at a minimum some law of privacy and trade secrets It is possible to defame people over the net and to do so far and wide The problem of multi jurisdiction squabbles over libel and slander does not disappear It is possible to blackmail people over the net as well And so it goes As a libertarian I don t see the net as a safe harbor from government regulation But I do see it as a place in which the social successes from following libertarian norms of force fraud and taxation for example yield pretty positive results And if those principles work so well in cyberspace then maybe we should have a greater attraction to them in our more earthbound behaviors as well That said it s over to Larry to explain why the same version of sensible libertarianism private property freedom of contract some state supplied infrastructure and easy taxation should not guide our activities in cyberspace as it does on earth
