 hi how are you today i m great good well as a matter of fact i m before we started this conversation i was working on my PC at home yeah uh do you have one no i don t have one at home i work with one on at work continually you know but i do not have one of my own at home yeah do you have what do you have at home we have an um actually it s a TI computer but it is the IBM uh huh um clone it s not the TI PC from back when right from the the oldies but the goodies it s probably pretty close to what i have because i have the same kind of thing at work i have a three eighty six S X which is TI computer but everything in is in IBM mode so right uh huh right right yeah that s what we have um do you use it a lot at home what do you well i really do i um am an accountant and but i work at home uh uh huh so i use it for that quite often um so you re on it a lot uh huh we have you know used some of it for some personal things we keep track of personal budgets and things like that on it um i since it s tax season i m doing a lot of taxes so i do a lot of um a lot of that work on it as well uh huh i was amazed when i took our taxes to our tax person and she works out of her home also and the uh software that does the taxes is just incredible you know i mean she just uh huh oh it is you know i expected to go and you know drop the stuff off and go back two weeks later and you know she had it done and out in twenty minutes on her little PC it was great yeah you can that s right that s wonderful i have often thought that that having one at home would be neat i just don t know if we would really use it that much you know i we really we decide we didn t decide to get one until i started working at home uh huh then you know then we thought well we can use it for you know some personal things but it for us it really took you know a business application to justify the expense of it uh huh oh definitely definitely i know my stepfather bought my mother a little personal computer oh i guess probably three years ago for Christmas and so uh huh and you know it s got some stuff on it it s got a nice little word processing software on it you know and some budgeting type things and stuff and i don t think she s ever touched it really you know it just it just seems like a lot of trouble for something at home you know she always seems to have better things to do than to try to sit down and figure out how to use her computer you know so right she could just as easily do those things by hand yeah just as quickly yeah now i know my boss has bought the software um that he can that his his checkbook is on on on a disk and he goes in and prints and types his checks on the screen and then hits print and they print out on the checks and uh huh and he s ordered envelopes with the windows in the right places you know oh my gosh and he just whips out you know i saw him yesterday morning over there and and he paid his monthly bills and he just you know wrote all the checks on the screen and hit print and it printed out like ten checks and he just you know they re perforated and he just ripped them off they go through just a continuous thing on the printer and huh right he ripped them off and stuck them in the envelopes and there they went you know and he said you know i can balance my checkbook in seconds you know because it s all in the computer you know so right and you know there s not going to be those adding mistakes that we all make that s exactly right he said you know he said used to be i always sat looking for those you know he said this way there isn t any you know it does it for you so right that s true this you know there are some definitely some some advantages to it it s just a matter of like you say are the advantages does it justify the cost if you re using it strictly for personal business so right i i think in most cases i d have to say no not unless somebody really enjoys it or right perhaps is using it for education i have a four year old son and we have some education programs that he likes a little Sesame Street one and um we have another one that plays music and he really likes that one yeah yeah as he grows up he ll be even more and more too that s right that ll be great yeah and now i think about it i guess for for kids like as they get older especially now uh huh uh when they get to junior high school high school and even college i mean my sister went to college um started about three years ago and she had to have a a computer really i mean it was like a necessity she couldn t imagine going through college without a computer well yeah i i m going through right now i m you know going part time in the evenings and you know i do yeah everything has to be typed i mean they require it you have to type it you know and uh huh right and so i m up here you know nights and weekends you know working on the little PC on the PC up here you know typing stuff so i can see where it would be a great advantage to have one at home you know if you were going to school sure yeah any more i don t even know if they have if a college kid would have a typewriter well you i don t know no i can t no and they probably used to have it i just finished a a major research paper a couple of weeks ago and i couldn t imagine not having that thing on a disk where i could go back in and move stuff around and change it i probably not even no uh huh i don t know what they used to do before they well unfortunately in our family my husband and i went through college together and then he went on and got his Master s degree while i was working uh huh and i m the better typist of us and we just had a regular old typewriter not even a correcting one back then it wasn t that long ago but uh huh oh and you had to type all of his papers i typed his Master s papers and things on a typewriter oh boy to have a computer back then oh gosh oh cut your time in half at least at least i mean and then of course you have some changes to make and do the whole thing over you take out a sentence at least yeah on a computer you take it out bleep print it out fine take out a sentence on a piece of paper uh huh you you do the whole thing over that s right that s right you know i remember when i was working in high school you know i was working in an office and right right after i got out of high school i continued working there for probably another year and we did everything on a typewriter uh huh and we did everything on a typewriter you know everything but it s amazing you know then when where you know someone would have you type a letter oh yeah they did it right they did it right i mean they were yeah they sit there and they go is this really what i want to say and you typed it and that was it and now you know people just send it back over and over and over and over the first time yeah that s probably one of the problems and frustrations that it s brought about because people do feel like oh well we can just change it if you need to well we ll try this out and see what it looks like yeah so right use it as a just a yeah instead of knowing what they want to say before they ever they just you know play with it and which in a way is nice to be able to do but you know it it gets a little out of hand sometimes i ve seen it get out of hand up here you know where right i know oh yeah you know we ve got a secretary that sits over here that s keeping metrics right now and keeping up you know of all the letters i type how many changes how many of them do i make changes on and on each letter what types of changes are they typos are they because i couldn t read it or people just change a like one word because they think it sounds better or whatever uh huh and you know she s also keeping a percentage you know what percentage of letters am i retyping for whatever reason and there s like one week she she did retypes on ninety percent of what she typed uh huh i believe it you know and it s like you know it s ridiculous and that was that was the high week but it s running about seventy which is still ridiculous to have to make changes to seventy percent of everything that she types you know that s uh huh well it s good that she does that i mean bring it to people s attention well that s exactly right you know she keeps you know keeps several weeks worth of data and then in addition is keeping copies of all the changes to show you know look this didn t really need to be changed you know this is this is ridiculous and you know changing add this time to now you know i mean that s the kind of things you know people that she s keeping and showing that this was a big waste of time it was a waste of paper it was a waste you know to change something like that so right anyway maybe you know maybe it ll it ll help in some way but i don t know there there there definitely even with the few disadvantages like that are far better than the alternative oh i have to you know without a doubt without a doubt well i would like to get one at home some day we ve got a two year old son and so you know some day i would like to get even just like the video tell or something like that you know just to to be able to pull in sources sources from outside would be wonderful you know so right especially when they re in school i think they would get a lot out of it oh i do too i do too the on line um encyclopedia just sounds wonderful you know that that sounds like such a great idea you know it d be kind of fun to be be able to play with it uh huh oh yeah so i know my father had a PC and and when we were in high school it was always fun we could um link in and i don t even remember now what it was called but you could link in and talk to other people talk to people all over the country you know uh huh and like you have your own little code name you know and you d type in hi how are you and they d type back and everybody and you d have five or six or seven people talking to each other at the same time and everything everybody said right prints out on your screen as they re typing it and it was just great fun you know right it was very expensive because the whole time you were on there you were on long distance you know it was like a long distance phone call so we were each limited limited to like twenty minutes a day you know so ooh uh huh ooh that still could add up it s oh it added up big well you know we my parents were divorced and so the time we were like visiting our father in the summer time you know so he felt like he could splurge and let us do it you know i m sure we would not have been allowed to do that under normal situations you know yeah but when you re doing the guilty father complex you know because he s not there to watch us grow you can kind of get all kinds of stuff you know yeah oh that s sad well it was nice to talk to you well yeah you too have a nice you too have a nice day bye bye bye bye
