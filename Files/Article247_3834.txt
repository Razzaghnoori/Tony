 Coup s on First The New York Times and USA Today lead with the aftermath of Wednesday s defeat of the nuclear test ban treaty by the Senate Like yesterday s bold headline Evokes Versailles Pact Defeat today s NYT headline also spans four columns and gives a distinctly pro White House spin Clinton Says New Isolationism Imperils U S Security USAT s headline announces the international rebuke on the test ban vote received by the U S while the Washington Post and Los Angeles Times which off lead the story note merely that Clinton Fumes at the GOP LAT and Fault s GOP Partisanship WP The Post and LAT lead with the military s tightening grip on Islamabad a story off leaded by the NYT and stuffed by USAT All the papers run roundup articles assessing the defeat of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in terms of international prestige foreign policy President Clinton s legacy and the presidential campaign Gore aired a TV ad on the issue his first President Clinton all the papers note appeared angry at a press conference resolving to continue America s seven year old ban on nuclear tests and warning that the election of a pro test president in 2000 could provoke tests by Russia China India and Pakistan On the NYT op ed page Senator Robert Byrd D W Va explains why he abstained from a vote for the first time in his 41 year Senate career because the Senate didn t debate long enough to allay his doubts about the treaty but it was too important to vote down Gen Pervaiz Musharraf consolidated power in Pakistan by imposing martial law dismissing the parliament suspending the constitution and proclaiming himself chief executive The LAT and Wall Street Journal note that although many citizens and some newspapers welcomed the coup on Wednesday see International Papers on Thursday the Pakistani stock market fell 7 4 percent and the central bank froze foreign capital for a week Taking advantage of its later deadline the LAT reports that the State Department finally recognized the coup a decision that legally cuts off U S aid though at 5 million a year it s chump change The NYT gets a nice detail Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif fired Musharraf as he was flying back to the country and forbade his plane to land as the plane ran low on fuel the army commandeered first the air control tower and then the country The Post quotes a senior Pakistani army official saying There is no doubt in our minds that the world will never accept military rule but we are in for the long haul He adds We have decided we must cleanse a political system that allows corrupt people to decide the destiny of our people NYT columnist A M Rosenthal the paper s former South Asia correspondent argues that the coup underscores the poverty of America s policy in the region which has long favored the efficient Pakistan to the chaotic but truly democratic India Two medical stories in the NYT and WP are like day and night The Times fronts what it claims is an earth shattering discovery A researcher experimenting on monkeys has determined that their brains add neurons to the cerebral cortex even in adulthood Such a finding would uproot decades of conventional wisdom which holds that higher mammals add brain cells only in childhood If the discovery translates to the human brain the Times is optimistic it will revolutionize our neurobiological understanding of memory which might turn out to be a long string of continually produced neurons that record experience through time like a tape recorder and promise cures for degenerative diseases such as Parkinson s Alzheimer s and stroke induced dementia The Post however is skeptical It runs the story on page A02 and warns that it s unknown whether the new cells are even functional What s clear is that any regenerative potential in the brain would have to be massively stimulated in some way to be of clinical use The LAT fronts and the NYT reefers the latest merger in the aerospace industry between Germany s DaimlerChrystler and France s Aerospatiale Matra It will become the world s third largest aerospace firm behind Boeing and Lockheed Martin and will own an 80 percent stake in Airbus Industrie Boeing s main competitor in the commercial passenger jet market The Journal says the merger is a blow to the Pentagon which had been trying to forge cross Atlantic mergers while the Post points to the increasing privatization of subsidized European industries like Airbus The NYT says the merger represents the first time European nations have integrated large parts of their defense industries an integration made necessary the paper argues by technical inefficiencies revealed during the NATO bombing of Kosovo All the papers note Boeing s announcement of better than expected third quarter earnings The LAT and WP front Microsoft s attempt to have Congress cut next year s proposed budget for the Justice Department s anti trust division an odd lobbying effort that even if successful will not affect the government s suit against the company The Post notes that MS also gave an expense paid junket to several non profit groups who are now pressing the government for the same DOJ cuts The LAT runs a long portrait of Gore s service in Vietnam True to character Gore struggled with his decision for many months in the summer of 1969 seeking the counsel of his father his friends and a professor He was opposed to the war but worried that if he opted out a friend from Tennessee would die in his place With his father seeking re election to his Senate seat that fall Gore Jr enlisted in the Army and served as a reporter Army buddies say he took some risks but was kept out of harm s way by Army brass and never saw combat When and if I get home from Vietnam he wrote a friend I m going to divinity school to atone for my sins He did for a year During his 1988 presidential run he often implied he saw combat although he does not do this anymore On the Journal s editorial page famed evolutionary theorist Stephen Jay Gould announces that he has finally found God This is church and nonbelievers cannot know the spirit he preaches Gould it turns out worships at the altar of Major League Baseball A Red Sox victory over the Yankees in the playoffs and over the Mets in the World Series he says would redeem the fallen team s century of ill treatment by the sinners of New York and restore the earth s moral balance just before our great calendrical transition Nothing can explain the meaning and excitement of all this to nonfans he says of the Pentacostal er pennant season No sensible person would even try One can only recall Louis Armstrong s famous statement about the nature of jazz Man if you gotta ask you ll never know
