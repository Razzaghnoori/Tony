 Background Cyclosporine CsA and tacrolimus TAC are the primary immunosuppressive drugs used for the prevention of acute rejection after renal transplantation The long term treatment of patients with either CsA or TAC results in side effects such as nephrotoxicity hypertension and gingival hyperplasia 1 2 Sirolimus SRL a new immunosuppressive agent is structurally similar to TAC binds to same binding protein FKBP but its mechanism of action is different 3 Both clinical and experimental studies demonstrated that SRL when used either with CsA or alone is associated with side effects such as hyperlipidemia thrombocytopenia and nephrotoxicity 4 5 6 7 Since SRL and TAC have affinity for the same binding site it was thought to be ineffective when used together However experimental and clinical studies have refuted this assumption and have successfully demonstrated the efficacy of this combination therapy 8 9 10 Encouraged by our recent in vitro study 11 that demonstrated a significant inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation IL 2 and induction of TGF expression by combination of sub clinical concentration of SRL with either TAC or CsA we conducted the current study on renal transplant recipients A total of 10 stable renal transplant recipients were selected to participate in a pharmacokinetic PK and immune function study with combination of TAC and SRL therapy in human transplant The current study describes the analysis of immune function in stable renal transplant recipients with SRL and TAC combination therapy Methods Study subjects Patients Stable renal transplant recipients receiving TAC based immunosuppression were included in this study Definition of stable transplant patients is based on post transplant care renal function acute rejection episodes A total of 10 patients were enrolled after informed consent Azathioprine MMF Mycophenolate Motefil were discontinued prior to initiation of SRL and all patients were on corticosteroids On day zero 24 h after discontinuation of Aza MMF blood samples were collected at time zero baseline and 12 h after the administration of TAC for lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine expression at the gene and protein level SRL was started on day 0 and patients were maintained on the same dose of TAC and SRL for 14 days Blood samples were repeated on day 14 for immune functions again at time zero baseline and 12 h after The graphic representation of the treatment protocol is shown in figure 1 The effect of this concomitant therapy on the immune function was studied by quantifying lymphocyte proliferation and the mRNA expression of TGF TNF IL 10 IL 6 IFN by RT PCR assay Serum levels of cytokines IFN TNF IL 10 and IL 2 were quantified by a cytokine bead array system and TGF specific ELISA Trough levels of TAC and SRL were not available as they were processed in central core laboratory as a part of multicenter study Preparation of lymphocytes and Experimental Protocol Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the blood of renal transplants obtained at time zero day 0 and day 14 were separated by ficoll hypaque as described by earlier 11 Briefly lymphocytes were washed twice in Phosphate Buffered Saline PBS and suspended in RPMI containing 5 FBS and Penicillin Streptomycin Lymphocytes were counted and adjusted to 1 10 6 ml and 200 000 cells were plated in a 96 well plate Cells were cultured at 37 C in an ambient environment with 5 CO2 air with PHA 2 g ml ConA 2 g ml and anti CD3 100 ng ml for 60 70 h and last 16 hours with 3H thymidine 1 Ci well The cells were then harvested on filter papers using a harvester filter papers were dried and were then transferred to liquid scintillation vials and 3H thymidine uptake were quantified as counts per minute CPM using a liquid scintillation counter Detection of mRNA by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction RT PCR Total RNA was isolated from lymphocytes isolated from blood obtained from patients using Trizol isolation System Life Sciences Invitrogen and quality of RNA was verified by 260 280 nm ratio 1 g of RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using Superscript First Strand Synthesis system for RT

of the specific gene to actin Cytokine Bead Array We studied the expression of circulating levels of cytokines IFN TNF IL 10 IL 5 IL 4 and IL 2 in sera of patients using a new cytokine bead array system BD Biosciences San Diego CA USA This method also named multiplexed bead assay is comprised of spectrally discrete particles which can be used to quantitative soluble particles in this case cytokines using a fluorescence based detection mechanism and flowcytometric analysis The beads coated with IFN TNF IL 10 IL 5 IL 4 and IL 2 react with test sera and standards to which fluorescence dyes are then added The flowcytometric analysis using special software allows the calculation of concentrations in the unknown sera Quantification TGF protein in sera Circulating levels of TGF 1 protein in patients sera were quantified using the TGF specific ELISA Promega Madison and USA as described by us earlier 11 Data Analysis Statistical analyses were performed by using statistical

not available as they were processed in central core laboratories however were maintained at therapeutic level Effect of concomitant tacrolimus and rapamycin therapy on lymphocyte proliferation The proliferation of lymphocytes from patients treated with TAC and SRL were compared with lymphocytes from patients treated with TAC and MMF Aza The results are shown in Figure 2which demonstrated a

protein expression in sera of patients Since we observed a significant increase in TGF mRNA expression in lymphocytes from patients treated with combination of TAC and SRL compared to TAC MMF Aza we also studied circulating levels of total TGF protein in acid activated sera from these patients The results figure 7 demonstrate statistically increased levels p 0 04 of TGF in renal transplant recipients after addition of SRL to TAC 107 17 7 ng ml vs 135 18 ng ml These results demonstrate that decreased lymphocyte proliferation in part may be due to increased levels of TGF in these patients Discussion A number of studies have demonstrated that long treatment of both CsA and TAC is associated many side effects such as nephrotoxicity hypertension and gingival hyperplasia 1 2 Rapamycin clinically termed as Sirolimus SRL is a new immunosuppressive agent which is structurally similar to TAC binds to same binding protein FKBP but has different mechanism of action 3 Both clinical and experimental studies demonstrated that SRL when used either with CsA or alone is associated with side effects like hyperlipidemia thrombocytopenia and nephrotoxicity 4 5 6 7 SRL and TAC compete for the same binding site and hence it was thought they could not be used concomitantly However recent experimental and clinical studies have refuted this assumption and have successfully used this combination therapy 8 9 10 Therefore there is need of an alternate strategy to use these drugs to treat renal transplant recipients Recently 11 we have demonstrated the efficacy of combination of low doses of SRL with either CsA or TAC to inhibit lymphocyte proliferation The results from this study also demonstrate the increased immuno modulation in renal transplant recipients by this therapy The synergistic effect of SRL and CsA has been demonstrated in animal models and clinical transplantation 19 20 This prompted us to explore the mechanistic action of SRL and TAC when used in combination Patients when received a concomitant therapy of TAC and SRL exhibited a significant inhibition of their lymphocytes when cultured with mitogens PHA ConA and anti CD3 compared to the proliferation of lymphocytes obtained from when they were treated with TAC and MMF Aza Such a sustained effect is expected to prevent graft rejection demonstrating the efficacy of this combination in renal transplant recipients To analyse the mechanism of the effect of concomitant therapy of TAC and SRL on lymphocyte proliferation we studied the mRNA expression of TGF p21 IFN TNF Il 6 IL 10 cyclins G and E The results demonstrated a significant increase in TGF mRNA expression p 0 03 with TAC and SRL The expression of p21 mRNA was also increased in renal transplant recipients with this therapy These results are consistent with our previous studies 21 22 that TGF mediates in part the immunosuppressive effects of CsA and TAC Current study supports our hypothesis that the immunosuppression results in an increased expression of cyclin inhibitor p21 which by inhibiting the expression of cyclins controls the allo immune activation Since p21 is one of the most potent cyclin inhibitor these results may explain the significant inhibition of proliferation of lymphocytes may in part be due to the increased p21 expression The expression of cyclin E and G which controls the cell cycle progression and G0 S and G1 phase of cell cycle was decreased with TAC and SRL therapy The expression of cyclins also corresponds to the decreased lymphocyte proliferation with SRL and TAC therapy We noted an increased expression of IL 6 and IL 10 mRNA in lymphocytes from patients with concomitant therapy with TAC and SRL A number of experimental and clinical studies 23 24 have demonstrated IL 10 expression to be beneficial and correlates with increased graft survival The results from this study demonstrate down regulation of cyclins and up regulation of cyclin inhibitor p21 and IL 10 mRNA expression IL 6 like IL 10 has also been considered to possess both pro and anti inflammatory properties 25 26 In this study we observed an increase in mRNA expression of IL 6 Acute rejection has been associated with increased intragraft IL 6 protein and mRNA production 27 However other studies have failed to demonstrate any correlation between IL 6 production and rejection 28 The current study demonstrate that a concomitant therapy of TAC and SRL increases expression of IL 6 mRNA in lymphocytes and its significant remains to be evaluated We also quantified circulating levels of TGF IL 2 IL 4 TNF and IFN The results from this study demonstrate that addition of SRL to TAC therapy results in a significant p 0 04 increase in circulating levels of TGF We have earlier demonstrated that TGF in part mediates the immunosuppressive effects of these drugs 11 12 21 22 and therefore the increased levels of TGF may partially explain the increased inhibition of mitogen induced lymphocyte proliferation Though the role of TGF has been correlated with drug induced nephrotoxicity 29 it is early to speculate if this combination will also result in an increased nephrotoxic effects We are unable to demonstrate the nephrotoxicity with this combination due to short course of therapy The levels of IFN IL 4 and IL 2 were decreased substantially with SRL and TAC therapy IFN p 0 04 IL 4 p 0 02 and IL 2 p 0 03 This indicates that the inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation with SRL also resulted in decreased inflammatory response Conclusions In conclusion these results provide evidence to potential efficacy of TAC and SRL combination therapy in renal transplant recipients The addition of SRL to the immunosuppressive regimen of Tac resulted in decreased lymphocyte proliferation exhibiting decreased allo immune response Also mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines TNF Interferon and cyclins G1 and E were significantly decreased and the expression of TGF and p21 were increased The addition of SRL significantly decreased the circulating levels of pro inflammatory cytokines and conversely increased the circulating levels of TGF partially explaining the increased immunosuppression in these patients However due to short span of this treatment the nephrotoxic effects remains unclear These novel findings provide a mechanism and rationale for a concomitant therapy with TAC and SRL in renal transplant patients Author 1 initials AK planned and carried out all the studies with the help of Author 2 initials MP Author 3 initials CB assisted in collecting blood samples Author 4 initials JW
