 The International Monetary Fund and the United States are bailing out South Korea The cost is reportedly 55 billion a record including 20 billion in backup loan guarantees from the United States and Japan and another 15 billion from the World Bank This follows bailouts of 17 billion and 40 billion for Thailand and Indonesia respectively The United States and the IMF moved quickly because South

relinquish more of the West Bank to the Palestinians Two small problems The plan doesn t specify how much land would be turned over or when Palestinian cynics said the plan couldn t be serious because if it were the Cabinet wouldn t have approved it so decisively 16 0 with two abstentions Israeli cynics said that Netanyahu was counting on Palestinian cynics to reject the plan so that he d get

have been bought by fat cat donors to Clinton s reelection committee and the DNC Rush Limbaugh Ollie North and Gordon Liddy made hay of the story and several congressional Republicans demanded investigations thereby entitling the mainstream press to wade in The Army eventually released the list of those getting waivers for burials It showed only one major donor and he had served in the
