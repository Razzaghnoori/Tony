 Defining Deviance Up Dear Ester I am not certain whether we were to wrap up our conversation yesterday or today however I will send at least one more message The quote from your last message is of course the crux of the issue that Alan Wolfe raised and has been at the core of much of my thinking I too view myself as a religious person however I ve been mostly out of the church since I left a Lutheran seminary in 1958 Having studied Christian existentialism indeed all existentialism avidly in college and seminary I was wrestling with the idea of freedom from secular and religious institutions in terms of my personal morality quite early And for me morality is a very personal issue Over time however as the power of authoritative institutions waned church state even family I was increasingly struck by the reality that while many have handled their moral freedom responsibly many others have used lack of external constraints to exploit and prey on others personally financially sexually violently etc Moreover I became persuaded that society s reluctance to come down on such persons for minor incivilities and offenses in one sense trapped these people especially young persons into believing that there were no consequences for anything So we decriminalized virtually all minor offenses we refused to confront young persons meaningfully for minor offenses in New York City even burglary was for all practical purposes decriminalized police didn t even bother investigating it and to use Moynihan s phrase we defined deviance down To get into trouble one really had to be a bad ass that is be outrageously confrontational and violent Authority was a bad joke to them until they ran into three strikes you re out the disastrous outcome for both society at large and individuals when society fails to meet its responsibility to take preventive actions early both nurturing and controlling actions So I still wrestle with your phrase about moral authority How can society maintain civility when everybody is free to define personal morality on their own terms while some members of society are eager to use this freedom to intimidate exploit and prey on others To provide an answer to my own question Why now does the great disruption seem to be receding I would suggest that society in broad terms came to an understanding in the late 1980s that we had largely lost control of a relatively large number of youths and public spaces And a new idea developed We had to enforce a balance between individual liberty and personal responsibility certainly with nurturing and moral authority but even with state authority Anyway I hope that sometime we can really have breakfast I hope that your kids are well I checked on my grandchildren four yesterday and all seem to be doing well One refused to be seated in the school bus and consequently ran into a massive assertion of parental authority Be well George
