 Downsizing the Mob When after an absence of several years Al Pacino returned to the screen in Sea of Love 1989 he looked like a human filament all dark burning eyes that never seemed to blink His intensity was startling but you couldn t be sure how to take him Always an actor of moods his timing had become even more capricious He didn t speak his lines he distended them He never seemed to want to let them out of his mouth At once manic and zoned out Pacino acted in a hambone universe of his own and when he was rewarded with an Oscar for his grandstanding in Scent of a Woman 1992 well as the gangsters in his new film Donnie Brasco might say Fuh get about it In Donnie Brasco Pacino has been cast as a sad little Mafia second rater named Lefty Ruggiero who boasts repeatedly of having clipped 26 guys yet is always passed over for promotions within the family With his gold chains and fur collars Lefty is a howlingly tacky parody of a mobster and Pacino uses all his blowhard insecurities along with his patented air of electrified stupor to elicit from us an astounding degree of sympathy Nothing Lefty says or does comes out right especially his adoption of a prot g a young jewel thief called Donnie Brasco Johnny Depp who turns out of course to be an undercover FBI agent The miracle of the film which is based on a memoir by the real Brasco Joseph D Pistone in collaboration with Richard Woodley is that with so many layers of irony it s so emotionally pure and so wrenching Partly this comes from the tension between the snappy driving screenplay by Paul Attanasio and the elegiac tone of the director Englishman Mike Newell along with his magnificent composer Patrick Doyle And partly it comes from Pacino whose epic self absorption in this context makes Lefty seem heartbreakingly vulnerable even while he s blowing people s heads off It s hard to think of another American film with this range of moods satirical sometimes hilarious yet suffused with a sense of loss and riddled with the kind of violence that makes you recoil and lean forward simultaneously I knew the screenwriter Attanasio in college and later when he was the chief film critic of the Washington Post Watching Donnie Brasco I remembered that he loved to quote from a relatively obscure scene in The Godfather the one by the stove in the Corleone kitchen in which Clemenza Richard S Castellano discoursed on the art of frying sausages and peppers for young Michael Pacino Loose and giddy a relief from all the gore and gravitas the scene made even more explicit the movie s theme of family both real and extended As nightmarish as the Corleones lives came to be there was still something seductive about being taken under the wings of expansive father figures with few uncertainties about what they were put on this earth to do What a kick to see Pacino 25 years later in the Clemenza role demonstrating for Donnie how to make coq au vin This time though the scene has an undercurrent of shame Pistone knows that he s exploiting the older man s best most fatherly instincts and it tears him up Later there s a tiny but significant moment when Lefty wonders how Donnie could be a traitor when he s been a guest in Lefty s home when Lefty has cooked for him Like The Godfather Donnie Brasco revolves around families except that they re now the source of guilt instead of reassurance Lefty seems drawn to Donnie because he bears a physical resemblance to the gangster s own son a junkie who keeps his distance So Lefty s exhortations on the subject of wise guy etiquette carry your money in a wad not a wallet lose the facial hair have an unusual zeal Lefty is looking for another shot at fatherhood Pistone who dislikes the officious superiors in his FBI family boasts of having his hooks in Lefty but comes to dread and delay the moment when he ll be pulled out of Operation Donnie Brasco and called upon to bring about his mentor s demise There s another tortured family too Pistone s wife and three daughters who languish in the absence of a steady father I wasn t looking forward to the scenes with Joe s wife Maggie because the stick in the mud spouse has become such a clich although I was curious to see what the vivid young actress Anne Heche could do with a role in which she didn t have to shed her clothes As written and played however Maggie s scenes are intrusions in the best sense They gnaw on Pistone from another angle they add a point to the film s complex geometry Heche who played Demi Moore s doomed doctor girlfriend in The Juror brings a wounded poetry to Maggie s bedragglement Sagging under the weight of running a household and of her daughters unspoken but persistent disappointment she has no vocabulary to convey to her husband what she s going through She can t share his work or know his daily sometimes weekly whereabouts and you can see how the powerlessness eats at her When she finally takes action changing the family s phone number without informing him her justification has a scary force Now I know how it feels to be in control On the evidence of his book Pistone was truly torn up about having abandoned his family for the years it took him to infiltrate the mob but he didn t lose as much sleep over what he was doing to his Mafia family That s the screenwriter s conceit And the actual Lefty seems to have had much less stature The part Pacino plays is a fusion of that Lefty and the nobler aspects of gang leader Sonny Black Napolitano whom the film reduces to a remorseless hothead played by the new king of movie bullies Michael Madsen The story has been fictionalized but it hasn t been Hollywood ized Donnie Brasco gives us a novel perspective on gangsters as the bottom feeders of capitalism Underlings huddle in the cold outside a Little Italy social club waiting for the boss who emerges from a black sedan with a fat cigar in his mouth Most of the time these shabby soldiers just sit around and rack their small brains for new schemes worried that if profits fall too low they re going to find themselves clipped or whacked They re like salesmen who have to meet their quotas or they re out downsized only literally into small pieces Scenes like the ones in the social club and in the gangsters homes have a real comic authority Lefty an animal lover reclines on a ghastly blue green lounge chair in a red sweat suit watching videotapes of gazelles being pounced on and devoured by lions He longs to be the lion but he ends up as the gazelle He can t even mount a competent search of Pistone s automobile for a wire finally giving up with the stereo in a shambles and offering to buy another car You want a DeVille Sprawled on a motel sofa fielding awestruck questions from a couple of junior FBI agents Pistone expounds on the meaning of the phrase Fuh get about it which depending on one s inflection can signal fatalistic acceptance doomed resignation murderous rage enthusiastic agreement or nothing in particular in a speech that will live long in the hearts of gangster movie mavens Apart from Lefty s last line in the film which is moving but also way too pat there isn t a single element on which Attanasio hasn t put a fresh spin Nor is there a moment when Newell takes the easy way out I ve always found his films Dance With a Stranger The Good Father Four Weddings and a Funeral a little obvious but his work here has an authentic sense of place Donnie Brasco feels rooted More important Newell molds these disparate performers into a tightly knit family of their own Depp does fine believable work His Donnie is cagey and recessive and when he reverts to Joe Pistone he doesn t relax he gets wiry as if he needs to discharge all his tension If there s a problem with Depp s acting in general it s that he s so serious so concentrated so unplayful his characters almost never have more than a single dimension at a time But these are quibbles Donnie Brasco is everything it needs to be It might not have the scope of The Godfather or The Godfather Part II yet among all the gangster pictures since Coppola s epic it has no peer Goodfellas Fuh get about it Exploring a more mundane milieu it serves as the missing link between us and The Godfather a gangster movie for a mingier more cynical era when even doing good comes with a terrible cost and where every family tie is a snap of the wrist away from a garrote Fuh get about it Donnie Brasco Johnny Depp with FBI technicians Tim Blake Nelson Paul Giamatti 30 seconds A domestic spat Maggie Anne Heche and Pistone Depp 30 seconds Dreams of the future Lefty Al Pacino and Brasco Depp 30 seconds
