 The study of genetic material from ancient specimens was in its early years dominated by a race to sequence DNA from extinct species like the dodo and the woolly mammoth Now that the supply of these crowd pleasing curiosities has run dry scientists are starting to ask new questions of ancient DNA aDNA that are revealing how the genetic make up of prehistoric populations changed through time These findings look set to trounce assumptions about how evolution really unfolded However there is still concern that many studies are not paying enough attention to the exacting protocols needed to overcome the technical challenges of the discipline and to defend it from the ridicule that has plagued it in the past In 1994 while Jurassic Park was still taking in millions of dollars at the box office scientists claimed to have extracted and sequenced DNA from an 80 million year old dinosaur 1 When sceptical researchers took a look at the sequence it turned out to be of human rather than dinosaur origin To make that mistake you d have to try really really hard says Alan Cooper head of the Henry Wellcome Ancient Biomolecules Centre at Oxford University in the United Kingdom If you think you ve sequenced some dinosaur DNA the first thing you d do is run a phylogenetic analysis on it he says Had they done that properly with any mammal at all involved in the tree they would have found that their sequence was grouping with the mammals and not with the reptiles or the birds says Cooper Perhaps they d watched Michael Crichton s inventive fiction one too many times he suggests Setting the Standards It was this kind of bungling study that highlighted the need for an exacting protocol that would steer researchers around the significant pitfalls posed by DNA decay and contamination A list of authenticity criteria emerged during the 1990s aimed at preventing similarly bogus claims from entering the literature 2 This list includes stringent laboratory controls cloning of products amplified by polymerase chain reaction PCR replication of results from a second independent extract and for really new or unexpected results replication of results by an independent research group Such requirements have allowed work on aDNA to move on and mature Now it s possible to focus on the really interesting questions that aDNA can answer What we re able to do with ancient DNA is really look at evolution says Cooper The fossil record can only hint at how evolution unfolded It just shows you there s a bear and then there s not a bear he says It doesn t show you where it came from or what the relationship between the groups is By contrast aDNA can do just that giving researchers a window onto the population genetics of the past and revealing how evolution really played out And the signs are that descriptions of the evolutionary process based on the fossil record and modernday gene pools are far too simple The modern data is clearly misleading us says Cooper Evolution is much much more complex and dynamic than we would hope Thinking Big Because of the decay that occurs with time there is a limit to how far back aDNA can gaze Box 1 Your ideal preservation conditions are something that falls under ice freezes instantly and stays frozen until you get it says Cooper As soon as we get up to 2 million years ago we can t get anything to work and that s even under deep frozen conditions But within the past 60 000 years there are several major evolutionary events that are worth studying including a glacial maximum around 18 000 years ago the invasion of the New World by humans about 12 000 years ago and a global mass extinction about 11 000 years ago These relatively recent events should be a good model for working out how similar events affected genetic diversity throughout evolutionary history Cooper s latest work has analysed DNA from over 400 bison fossils from Beringia the frozen wastes between eastern Siberia and the Canadian Northwest Territories 3 What we ve done is carbon date a shitload of bison and get DNA out of them It s the largest aDNA study to date he says Figure 1 The icy conditions mean that good quality mitochondrial DNA could be extracted from most of the specimens The bison could also be dated accurately This allowed Cooper and his colleagues to trace the changes in the bison genetic diversity from 150 000 years ago to the present It was even possible to predict the effective population size throughout this period of bison evolution Our analyses depict a large diverse population living throughout Beringia until around 37 000 years before the present when the population s genetic diversity began to decline dramatically they note This finding challenges some common assumptions It has been argued that modern bison are descended from Beringian bison but Cooper s data suggest otherwise All modern bison belong to a clade distinct from Beringian bison he and his colleagues report Furthermore the dramatic decline in the numbers of bison occurs long before humans arrive on the scene scuppering the idea that hunting pressure was primarily responsible for the demise of the bison As the glacial maximum approached 18 000 years ago the cooler dryer conditions were probably responsible for the downturn in the bison population argues Cooper Climate change is giving the animals an absolute whacking he concludes A similar analysis of brown bear DNA excavated from permafrost and cave deposits in the Arctic is also challenging conventional evolutionary wisdom 4 Being able to get both a radiocarbon date and some DNA from a specimen pins a particular genetic sequence to a particular moment in time These data suggest that genetically and geographically distinct groups of bear have replaced each other relatively often during the last 60 000 years Regional extinctions and replacements seem to be tied to climate change and competition with the much larger short faced bears the authors argue Figure 2 Recent analysis of aDNA from Haast s eagle has also thrown up a surprising result This New Zealand giant had a wingspan of up to three metres and a weight of around 14 kilograms says Michael Bunce an anthropologist at MacMaster University in Ontario Canada Analysis of aDNA from 2 000 year old specimens indicates that this extinct creature is closely related to the little eagle from Australia and New Guinea which typically weighs less than one kilogram The common ancestor of these two eagles lived as recently as 1 million years ago he and his colleagues estimate 5 It means an eagle arrived in New Zealand and increased in weight by 10 15 times over this period says Bunce Such rapid size change is unprecedented in terrestrial vertebrates In addition to illuminating these natural events the study of aDNA can also show changes in the frequency of key genes that occurred during the domestication of crops and animals For example aDNA from samples of early maize reveals when certain desirable traits appeared 6 It s the first study of ancient DNA that looks at phenotype says Svante P bo an evolutionary anthropologist at the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig Germany One can actually look at specific genes that early humans selected during domestication of an important crop P bo s analysis suggests that the alleles typical of contemporary maize were already present in Mexican maize 4 400 years ago so just a couple of thousand years after its initial domestication from the wild grass teosinte Figure 3 Quite early on properties were selected that were not only the structure of the plant but also the biochemistry he says aDNA is also being used to decipher human origins Mitochondrial DNA from Neanderthals looks quite different from the mitochondrial DNA of early modern humans 7 This lends support to the hypothesis that modern humans have a single African origin rather than the alternative hypothesis of multiregional evolution where the ancestors of modern humans bred with Neanderthals aDNA could also in principle be used to shed light on the evolutionary position of the 18 000 year old hobbit recently unearthed on the Indonesian island of Flores 8 Both Cooper and P bo have offered to have a go at isolating DNA from the hominid skeleton but the early signs are that DNA has not survived The somewhat moist and tropical preservation conditions make the recovery of DNA improbable says Peter Brown the paleoanthropologist at the University of New England in Armidale Australia who led the hobbit study Efforts to extract DNA from other bones collected at the same site as this tiny hominid have not produced results We have made attempts with Stegodon molars he says but so far without success Ongoing Controversy However in spite of the authenticity criteria and this transition towards testing the big questions in evolutionary biology aDNA research continues to invite controversy In 2000 a team of United States researchers claimed to have cultured a bacterium sealed inside a 250 million year old salt crystal 9 For Cooper this is the sort of study that should require replication by an independent laboratory before publication When we repeated that work with the same primers we were pulling up halobacteria from everywhere he says We took some dust from the top of the natural history museum in Oxford extracted DNA used their supposedly halospecific primers and extracted a whole bunch of sequences including some that fell within their diversity This strongly suggests says Cooper that the bacterium that was cultured was a modern bacterium rather than an ancient specimen I can t see any logic for having 250 million years without any evolution But Russell Vreeland a microbiologist at West Chester University in Pennsylvania and first author of the salt crystal study is adamant that his methods were exacting The probability of having a contaminant in our sample was one chance in a billion he calculates If you use a Band Aid today on your skin or your children you are 1 000 times more likely to have an infection from that Band Aid than I am to have a contaminant It s completely unscientific to argue that the cultured bacterium was a result of contamination simply because it resembles modern bacteria says Vreeland That s throwing out the baby with the bathwater If you can show that nothing has penetrated your sample and the DNA is inside then the age of the DNA has to be equal to the age of that rock he says I think you can make your criteria so stringent that you miss reality Others are alert to this danger Sticking rigidly to the authenticity criteria can be a problem argues Tom Gilbert of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Arizona The criteria can both hinder the publication of good studies that do not adhere to all the criteria and also enable the publication of erroneous results that adhere strictly to them he says Part of the problem is that many referees of aDNA papers do not have a background working with aDNA so are inclined to use the authenticity criteria as a checklist rather than critically evaluating each bit of research on a case by case basis For example he says a recent high profile study that followed all the criteria found that aDNA from two Cro Magnon type humans was very similar to DNA from modern humans 10 But this could just mean that the specimens were contaminated by modern humans As no information was provided on the sample s handling history says Gilbert it becomes impossible for a reader to decide whether the sequences are authentic or contaminant Box 2 Such papers will continue to appear as long as the authenticity criteria are used by authors and referees as a checklist he says This does not mean the criteria should be relaxed he adds but they should be used in a more intelligent way But allowing authors the freedom to use the criteria as they see fit could come at a cost says Cooper The trouble with a case by case basis is that it basically equates to no standards because then people will do what they feel like doing and we re back to the 1990s again he says Agreement This ongoing disagreement over how aDNA studies should be judged does however stem from a common concern As more and more biologists come to appreciate the unique ability of aDNA to probe the evolutionary process it is more important than ever to stress the immense challenges of working with just a few fragments of degraded DNA that might have come from several different sources It is obvious why an archaeology lab might want to set up its own aDNA facility But this is like creating molecular biologists without a license says P bo You wouldn t buy an accelerator and say I will now start doing my own carbon dating he says You have to really have experience working with low copy number However in spite of the continual problem of eager but inexperienced biologists trying to extract DNA from specimens in the university museum there is a sense that aDNA is starting to fill in the gaps in our understanding of key moments in evolutionary history So at the start of 2005 as aDNA research enters its 21st year the discipline is perhaps coming of age
