 Dirty Linen Fashion mogul Tommy Hilfiger is in the news make that in the newsgroups For some months now the Internet has been abuzz with rumors that Hilfiger made racist remarks in two separate television appearances According to various postings on the Net Hilfiger confessed on Oprah that if he had been able to predict the success of his clothing among Chinamen and niggers he would never have made it so nice A shocked Winfrey allegedly cut to a commercial when the show continued she had changed out of her now tainted Hilfiger outfit and the designer was gone The second story has Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren appearing on CNN s Style With Elsa Klensch Complimented on his success in selling his goods in the East Lauren thanked his Asian customers Enter Hilfiger voicing his preference that Asians these people not wear his clothes A spotty paraphrase of the allegations appeared in a Nov 13 1996 article in the Philippine newspaper Isyu Titled Eat Your Clothes Mr Racist Designer the piece has been excerpted on the Official Philippine Anti Tommy Hilfiger site The writer tiptoes around the charges but is markedly less tentative when expressing her outrage I am shocked she fulminates If Hilfiger really did insult my people you can bet I will do every single thing I can in my power to make sure that his label never makes it here Forums ranging from soc culture african american to talk rumors and Streetsound have been thick with anti Tommy talk of late When rumors of the designer s alleged racist outbursts filtered into the mainstream media they were debunked by Time magazine USA Today and the Washington Post But that didn t stem for a boycott of his products Nor did the official response of the Hilfiger Corp Claiming to have become aware of the brouhaha only recently the company has posted a memo on various anti Tommy sites detailing the simple and incontrovertible facts Hilfiger has never been on Oprah Hilfiger has never been on Style Far from wanting to limit his appeal Hilfiger is on record about wanting to cross ethnic lines to appeal to everyone everywhere This isn t the first time a fashion designer has been so vilified Liz Claiborne was the subject of a virtually identical story promoted by Spike Lee in a 1992 interview An earlier myth had her admitting publicly again on Oprah to connections with the church of Satan Corporate collisions with racial paranoia have become quite common In the late 1980s purported connections with the Ku Klux Klan so damaged the reputation of athletic wear manufacturer Troop whose name was rumored to be a Ku Klux Klan acronym for To Rule Over Oppressed People that it was forced into bankruptcy Talk of the inclusion of sterility inducing ingredients targeting black men hobbled both Church s Fried Chicken 1989 and the soft drink Tropical Fantasy early 1990s Kentucky Fried Chicken and a host of tobacco companies including Brown Williamson R J Reynolds and Philip Morris were the subjects of similar Klan sterility related canards Shoe manufacturers Reebok Converse Nike and Puma were accused of supporting apartheid in South Africa The corporate conspiracy paradigm was easily extended to include Uncle Sam AIDS was purportedly a U S government sponsored tool for black genocide as was crack When the San Jose Mercury News recently published its findings linking the CIA and Contra drug runners the rumors flared anew Tommy Hilfiger entered fashion circles in the mid 1980s A Lauren clone read khakis at the outset he identified an underserved fashion niche urban black America which was drawn to Lauren s WASPy abstractions but alienated by their overstated inaccessibility Hilfiger saw potential for symbiosis between hip hop and the Hamptons The result He still does the khakis and the yacht shots and the polo ponies and the red white and blue stripe designs that some liken to the Confederate flag but he mixes them up with punch bright colors and exploded logos Hilfiger knew he had struck gold when he noticed black kids mixing the preppy look with sports gear on the street As he told Vanity Fair in 1996 I saw this and I said Oh my God What a great opportunity The fashion formula worked in both directions Black urban kids craved the preppy look white suburban kids wanted to be homeboys Hilfiger s creations gained credibility when hip hop artists like Grand Puba then of Brand Nubian started wearing them Tapping his friend and Def Jam Music Group head Russell Simmons for contacts the designer pursued the rap crowd aggressively Snoop Doggy Dogg wore Hilfiger on Saturday Night Live in 1994 The Fugees TLC and Doctor Dre have all donned the free threads Tommy has sent their way The Hilfiger name was featured in the rap lyrics of Q Tip and Grand Puba And the corporation has thrived Its shares have risen sevenfold since it went public in 1992 its sales are expected to rise 40 percent in FY 97 and a further 30 percent in FY 98 Who then is behind the Tommy tales As with most contemporary conspiracy stories the source of this one remains elusive Urban folk legends are invariably ascribed to a friend or better still a friend of a friend a FOAF to use folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand s acronym who is close enough to stabilize the urban legend but distant enough to escape genuine scrutiny Predictably therefore the Isyu writer takes no responsibility for her information some versions of the first inflammatory Oprah related posting by Geoff thank a friend from Texas for the information a newsgroup respondent claims to have heard from someone that irate Filipinos had razed a Hilfiger factory Less visible in the Hilfiger threads is the fact that Hong Kong textile baron and businessman Silas Chou owns 35 percent of the Hilfiger Corp Hilfiger himself owns 22 5 percent In theory the Web should be as good at eradicating legends as it is at cultivating them but in practice denials are quickly buried by new messages and updates A week ago Hilfiger s official response clogged newsgroup indexes Today it has been swamped by even newer anti Tommy postings and returning favorites Why Tommy In her pathology of rumor in African American culture I Heard It Through the Grapevine Patricia A Turner suggests that symbolically potent products like athletic gear and flashy clothes products that tote high price tags but are of dubious utility invite hostile theorizing Aware that they are paying a premium for the label rather than the quality minority consumers are bound to feel exploited Dissociation with the producer of the offending temptation a 400 jacket say becomes a coping mechanism and rumor and conspiracy theories are only a step away Yo I think White America Is messing up our mind whit all of this bullshit claims one protester in a newsgroup They are laughing at us saying if we make it thsese sic stupid ass Niggaz Will Buy it As was the case with Reebok Hilfiger s pursuit of the minority market has exposed him to a backlash it s probably no accident that Lauren whose turf he invaded was cast as the good guy in the Klensch Style story And damage control will prove a challenge Newsgroupies were questioning the authenticity of Hilfiger s official response soon after it appeared on the Net How many times can you kill the phoenix It s a tough job any takers
