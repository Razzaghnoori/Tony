 Unforgiven Seconds after the Senate voted last Friday not to remove President Clinton from office network producers stamped the words ACQUITTED and NOT GUILTY across the nation s television screens This is a real slap at the House prosecutors declared CBS correspondent Bob Schieffer echoing colleagues on other networks CLINTON ACQUITTED DECISIVELY announced the New York Times Sunday s talk show pundits scavenged the battlefield pronouncing Republicans the losers Not so fast Though the Senate has cast its votes history s verdict remains in doubt The spin war over who was right or wrong doesn t end with Clinton s acquittal And the early conventional wisdom that the GOP has lost the fight rests on three erroneous assumptions The first fallacy is that the debate over Clinton s guilt is an up or down question Actually it s a spectrum Pundits crippled by short memories focus on the public s opposition to Clinton s impeachment and removal But this was only the last stage of a gradually escalating scandal The first question unresolved until Clinton s Aug 17 confession was whether he had done something immoral The second question debated throughout the Starr investigation and the House Judiciary Committee s inquiry was whether Clinton had done something illegal The third question whether he had done something impeachable didn t come to the fore until the House impeachment debate and the Senate trial It s true that by the time the Republicans got to the third stage they had lost the public But on the first question the polls remain squarely on their side In a post acquittal Los Angeles Times survey only 24 percent of respondents say Clinton shares their moral values Likewise in a CNN poll 57 percent express a negative opinion of him as a person only 35 percent express a positive opinion 59 percent say he has diminished the presidency s stature and 54 percent say he would commit adultery if he knew he could get away with it Only 39 percent say the Senate s verdict vindicates Clinton 53 percent say it does not These numbers show how Republicans can rewrite the scandal by sliding the debate back across the spectrum to the moral question and portraying every vote to acquit Clinton as a vote to exonerate him This is why Democrats have scrambled to avoid a fight over Clinton s morals and to assure the public that he s been sufficiently castigated They denounce his conduct at every opportunity Having failed to pass a censure resolution Friday they signed it anyway and put it in the Congressional Record They denied that in acquitting Clinton they had voted to exonerate him morally They even touted the 45 to 50 Republican votes to convict Clinton which they had unanimously opposed as suitable punishment The votes for conviction confirmed the humiliation of the president Sen Frank Lautenberg D N J observed approvingly Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle D S D called the verdict a rebuke of Clinton and asserted that this whole process has been a level of punishment that was commensurate with the failures of the president to act appropriately Several Democratic senators assisted by the media depicted the House prosecutors failure to win a majority vote in the Senate as a disgraceful setback for the GOP This argument reflects a second fallacy that the Republicans are out to get Clinton and that their vindication depends on his repudiation by Congress In post acquittal comments some Republican senators did try to portray the Senate as united in its denunciation of the president We re going to end up with two thirds of the Senate either having voted to convict or to censure Sen Robert Bennett R Utah told ABC And that I think sends a very strong historic message to our children ABC commentator George Stephanopoulos seized on Bennett s remark It s the first Republican talking point you see that two thirds have voted either to convict or censure But Stephanopoulos is missing half the story There are two Republican camps The pedagogical camp led by Bennett and Sen Orrin Hatch R Utah wants to unite the country in condemnation of Clinton s behavior thereby resolving the impeachment issue The political camp led by Sen Phil Gramm R Texas and House Majority Whip Tom DeLay R Texas wants to divide the country and keep the issue alive for the next election The pedagogical Republicans want Clinton punished and repentant The political Republicans want him un punished and un repentant so the public will stay angry at him and his party They re not interested in using congressional Democrats to hurt Clinton They re interested in using Clinton to hurt congressional Democrats The political Republicans first objective was to kill the censure resolution They argued correctly that Democrats were using it for political cover But the GOP s decision to kill it for the same reason was no less political First DeLay blocked it in the House then Gramm killed it in the Senate insisting that senators render an all or nothing verdict According to the New York Times Gramm had warned his Republican colleagues that censure would muddle the partisan rift over impeachment making the issue less potent in 2000 Friday evening he got what he wanted In a tone of disbelief Schieffer told CBS viewers The trial ended without even a verbal reprimand from the Senate Gramm s allies proclaimed far and wide that Clinton had escaped untouched It looks as though as the Democrats put it a reckless reprehensible and irresponsible man will remain our president for the next two years said DeLay He won He always wins agreed Sen Bob Smith R N H Children now have the lesson that lying cheating and breaking the law are permissible moaned Christian Coalition leader Randy Tate On Meet the Press Republican strategist Mary Matalin accused the White House of gloating On This Week the chief House prosecutor Henry Hyde R Ill called Clinton s acquittal another skirmish in the ongoing culture war Former Vice President Dan Quayle signaled his intention to pound Vice President Al Gore in the 2000 presidential campaign for having defended Clinton s character Democrats think they re immune to this attack because they ve got both ends of the spectrum covered On the removal question the polls are on Clinton s side and on the moral question on which the polls are against Clinton Democrats have acknowledged and condemned his misconduct This is the third fallacy Democrats have overlooked the legal question in the middle On that question they have failed to reconcile themselves to the polls In a Gallup survey shortly before the Senate verdict 73 percent of respondents said Clinton was guilty of perjury A post acquittal CBS poll finds that 78 percent think he s guilty though only 32 percent think his crimes merited expulsion from office And in a post acquittal Washington Post survey 48 percent still say Clinton should face criminal charges at some point Yet every Democratic senator voted not guilty last Friday A few have conceded Clinton s guilt on the perjury charge but the rest have either denied that the case was proved or have dodged the question by arguing that either way the alleged crimes wouldn t merit the president s removal And while their censure resolution may immunize them against the charge of moral indifference it doesn t protect them from the charge of indifference to Clinton s apparent lawbreaking Its language pointedly avoids accusing him of perjury or obstruction of justice Republicans smell their opportunity At their press conference after the Senate verdict several House prosecutors interrupted their sermons against the polls to point out where the public agreed with them We take great satisfaction that one poll showed that 75 or 80 percent of the people recognized that the president had committed falsehoods under oath said Rep George Gekas R Pa Rep Jim Rogan R Calif cited the same figure The public by 80 percent or more believes that he s committed perjury chimed in Rep Chris Cannon R Utah The political cleansing that did not happen through the impeachment process leaves Clinton with a great and serious burden Republican strategists will make Democrats carry that burden into the elections On Fox News Sunday when Democratic Party chairman Roy Romer ritually expressed his disappointment in Clinton s personal behavior GOP chairman Jim Nicholson shot back I find it interesting that Roy Romer would say Democrats are on the high ground when 73 percent of the people say his president lied to them and over half of them say he obstructed justice On Face the Nation political consultant Ralph Reed went further calling the scandal Al Gore s albatross because he acted as an advocate for a president who 73 percent of the American people believe committed perjury and only 24 percent think is honest and trustworthy Pundits often say history is written by the winners They think this maxim shows how clever and cynical they are Actually it s half of a circular argument and their failure to grasp this irony exposes their naivet Thirty five years ago Barry Goldwater was a landslide loser Today he s the father of the conservative movement Winners it turns out are written by the historians And the contest to write the history of Bill Clinton s impeachment is just beginning
