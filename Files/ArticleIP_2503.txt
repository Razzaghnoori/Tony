 Portraits of a Political Puzzle These two images are halves of a political puzzle Fit them together and you may solve the great mystery of the Clinton presidency That mystery of course is Clinton s continued high standing in the eye of the electorate He s still enjoying high enough poll figures to have refused to answer any scandal related questions at his recent press conference even to have noted his comfort in keeping silent High approval ratings cushion even a stonewall Yet polls also indicate that the same electorate that approves of Clinton s presidency suspects that many of the scandalous allegations against him are true How can two such opinions live peacefully together in the same heads Gary Hart would probably like to know the answer to that That s him in Image No 1 Hart was running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1987 when this vacation snapshot of him with Donna Rice on his lap surfaced promptly crushing his candidacy Hart was already reeling from allegations of womanizing the photo which was exhibited often enough to be burned into our synapses closed the case against him The consensus was that as we could see with our own eyes Hart lacked the discipline and character for the presidency He was driven from public life What then does Image No 2 show us It shows us candidate Bill Clinton on a campaign flight in 1992 Seated next to him on a jump seat is flight attendant Debra Schiff she s the one with Clinton s hand between her thighs The image is from a video clip shown in February on ABC and since posted on the Internet This image has occasioned almost no comment What does it reveal about Clinton s discipline and character Apparently nothing Or rather nothing that the electorate cares to be bothered with The apparent consensus is that whatever we can see with our own eyes it s Clinton s and Schiff s business If there s any visual difference between these two images it s that the one featuring Clinton is more lurid Hart and Rice are knowingly posing for a camera you could frame the shot and display it on the coffee table as long as you had the right sort of postmodern family living in the house Clinton and Schiff on the other hand have been caught off guard the result would have a peeping Tom quality if their encounter had any personal intimacy which it does not There s a third person present a man with whom Clinton is conversing even as he rubs Schiff s thighs The effect is disturbing because Schiff is depersonalized Why then the disparity between the political effects of these two images Because one Hart s was perceived to contain vital political information and the other Clinton s apparently isn t In the decade between the public exhibition of these images 1987 to 1998 character has been largely emptied of the political significance it had throughout the postwar era as least as far as many voters are concerned In the Clinton era presidential character has been decoupled from American character Hart s problem was actually that as a symbol of American ness his character mattered more then than Clinton s does now In 1987 there was still a significant external threat to the nation and a 40 year tradition of global competition over ideas and issues Potential presidents like astronauts Olympic athletes and other Americans playing on an international stage still had to carry a lot of symbolic baggage They had to appear as forthright champions in a historic contest disciplined leaders who embodied national values Look at Richard Nixon an emotional stiff who would have a tough time competing for national office today Yet in his own era he could parlay leadership symbolism into a pair of landslide victories Leadership symbolism was pretty much what Ronald Reagan was about What is leadership minus strength of character Hart failed that test But Clinton never even had to pass it By 1991 presidential role playing was already changing dramatically The Soviets were gone and the Gulf War had seemingly solidified the U S global position The electorate was able to shrug off the Gennifer Flowers scandal rather quickly its concerns were becoming domestic Interestingly Clinton is heard on the Flowers tapes telling her that when asked she can characterize their relationship as she pleases precisely because there are no known photographs of them together But Clinton s concerns about being another Hart turn out to have been anachronistic as the limited impact of the Clinton Lewinsky embrace imagery demonstrates Even as Clinton was running for office a different presidential model was already asserting itself We ve seen this model before Whenever the country emerges from a national trauma and focuses on its piggy bank presidential expectations shrink The years following the War of 1812 were politically the Era of Good Feelings The presidents after Reconstruction were the political ciphers of Republican ascendancy In the years after World War I the business of America was business The idea that Clinton s approval represents something new and immoral in the country is historically shortsighted In 1884 a Victorian electorate shrugged off Grover Cleveland s confessed paternity of an out of wedlock son Didn t matter Cleveland s role like Rutherford Hayes and Warren Harding s was to take care of business Clinton is said to be concerned with shaping a historical legacy but as may be noted from his failed medical care program his unpopular anti Iraq saber rattling and his largely ignored dialogue on race the care of business is pretty much all that s wanted of Clinton too
