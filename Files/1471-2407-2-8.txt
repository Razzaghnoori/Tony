 Gastric adenocarcinoma GC is one of the most common malignant diseases in China Although the GC has been declined in its mortality rate it remains the leading cause of cancer related deaths in this country Parkin et al 1992 World Health Organization 1994 Nomura A 1996 Gastric carcinogenesis is considered as a multistage progressive process The early indicator for the subject predisposed to GC is abnormal hyperproliferation of gastric epithelial cells such as chronic atrophic gastritis CAG DYS and intestinal metaplasia IM which have been considered as precancerous lesions of GC You et al 1993 Correa P 1992 However the information for the mechanism of gastric carcinogenesis is very limited The growth and metastasis of tumors depend on the development of an adequate blood supply via angiogenesis Recent studies indicate that the inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF and tumor suppressor p53 are fundamental play makers of the angiogenic process Ambs et al 1994 Jekins et al 1995 Forrester et al 1996 Chiarugi et al 1998 iNOS is one of the isoforms of nitric oxide synthase that catalyzes the formation of nitric oxide a regulator of vascular permeability VEGF is a dimeric glycoprotein and has specific mitogenic activity for endothelial cells Over expression of iNOS and VEGF could induce angiogenesis in tumors P53 suppresses angiogenesis by down regulating VEGF and iNOS Mutant p53 potentiates protein kinase C induction of VEGF expression Zhang et al 2000 In a tumorigenicity model using human fibroblast cells the loss of wild type p53 and transfection of activated ras led to increased VEGF expression Devavrata et al 1995 Transient transfection of wild type p53 and of v src has been found to exert opposing effects on human VEGF gene promoter activity in human glioblastoma and transformed human fetal kidney cells Devavrata et al 1995 However because wild type p53 did not repress hypoxia induced transcription of the VEGF gene in stably transfected human colorectal carcinoma and human hepatoblastoma cells with an inducible p53 estrogen receptor fusion protein expression system Ambs et al 1998 it has been proposed that there is a need for caution in interpreting p53 function on the basis of cells transiently overexpressing this protein Nevertheless mutant p53 has been correlated with increased VEGF expression in human lung cancer Ambs et al 1994 and colorectal cancer Ambs et al 1999 by immunohistochemical staining of surgical specimens It has been reported that dysfunction of the p53 MDM 2 pathway can be found in more than two thirds of angiosarcomas thus mutant p53 influences the development of angiosarcoma not only by affecting growth and apoptosis control but also by up regulating VEGF Chinrugi et al 1998 We hypothesized that alterations of p53 iNOS and VEGF expression may contribute to gastric carcinogenesis and influence the clinical behavior of GC via angiogenesis The correlation of expression of p53 VEGF and iNOS and clinical features in gastric carcinogenesis however has not been well characterized To characterize the changes of p53 iNOS and VEGF expression in human gastric carcinogenesis the present study was undertaken to determine the protein level of p53 iNOS and VEGF in normal tissues and the tissues with different severities of lesions of CSG CAG DYS IM and GC with and without lymph node metastasis from surgically resected human GC and gastric biopsies from symptom free subjects The subjects were from Linzhou and nearby county Huixian in Henan province the high incidence area for GC in northern China Materials and Methods Patients The present investigation included 55 randomly selected GC patients and 60 symptom free subjects from the mass survey in the high incidence area for GC Fifty five GC patients were performed gastric cancer surgery at the Linzhou People s Hospital n 26 and The Second Affiliated Hospital of Henan Medical University n 29 from 1996 to 1998 Before surgery none of the patients received any kinds of chemical or radiation therapy The median age of the patients was 61 years 30 77 years Cancer specimens were classified based on TNM as stage T1 19 patients 35 T2 14 patients 25 T3 12 patients 22 and T4 10 patients 18 The tumors were histologically graded as well differentiated 15 patients 27 moderate differentiated 14 patients 25 and poorly differentiated 26 patients 47 Of the 55 patients 35 occurred local lymph node metastasis 64 Gastric biopsies were taken from 60 symptom free subjects who volunteered to participate in a routine endoscopic screening for esophageal and gastric cancer in Huixian China No selection process was involved Of the 60 subjects examined there were 35 males and 25 females The median age of the subjects was 59 years 28 70 years The biopsies were taken each from the pylorus of the stomach from each subject Tissue processing All the surgically resected specimens and biopsy samples were fixed with 10 neutral formalin embedded with paraffin and serially sectioned at 5 m The sections were mounted onto the histostick coated slides Four or five adjacent ribbons were collected for histopathological analysis hematoxylin and eosin stain and for immunohistochemical staining Histopathological Analysis Histopathological diagnosis for gastric epithelia was made according to cellular morphological changes and tissue architecture using previously established criteria Wang et al 1994 You et al 1993 In brief CSG an inflammation manifested by mild lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltration CAG glandular morphology disappeared partially or completely absent in the mucosa and replaced by connective tissue inter glandular space was infiltrated mainly by plasma cells and lymphocytes DYS characterized by nuclear atypia with or without architectural abnormalities in the gastric epithelium but without invasion IM confirmed by the presence of goblet cells in gastric mucosa adenocarcinoma

Manhasset NY The avidin biotin peroxidase complex method was used for the immunostaining of p53 iNOS and VEGF In brief after dewaxing inactivating endogenous peroxidase activity and blocking cross reactivity with normal serum Vectastain Elite Kit Vector Burlingame CA the sections were incubated overnight at 4 with a diluted solution of the primary antibodies 1 1000 for p53 1 200 for iNOS and 1 100 for VEGF Location of the primary antibodies was achieved by subsequent application of a biotinylated anti primary antibody an avidin biotin complex conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and diaminobenzidine Vectastain Elite Kit Vector Burlingame CA The slides were counter stained by hematoxylin Negative controls were established by replacing the primary antibody with PBS and normal mouse or rabbit serum Known immunostaining positive slides were used as positive controls Specific staining for each protein was categorized as either positive or negative based on the presence of brown color staining More than 10 cells positively stained were graded as positive Clear staining for nuclei p53 cytoplasm and cell membrane VEGF and iNOS was the criterion for a positive reaction Wang et al 1994 All the immunostaining slides were observed by two pathologists L D Wang and L H Jiao The slides with different diagnosis by two pathologists were read again less than 5 until the agreed diagnosis was made Statistical Analysis The X 2test was used for the percentage of samples with positive stain Spearman correlation test and linear tendency test were used for the correlation between positive rates and different severities of lesions p 0 05 was considered significant Results Histopathologically all the 55 surgically resected gastric specimens were confirmed as adenocarcinoma Of the 55 GC patients 11 cases occurred the invasion within sub mucosa 44 with whole muscle layer Of the 60 biopsy samples examined 10 were diagnosed as normal 15 as CSG 9 as CAG 16 as IM with CAG and 10 as DYS Table 1 The positive immunostaining for p53 iNOS and VEGF was observed in the gastric epithelial cells and cancer cells with different rates in the lesions of CAG DYS IM and GC But the positive immunostaining for p53 iNOS and VEGF was not observed in normal gastric epithelial tissue and CSG Figure 1 2and 3shows the representative of p53 iNOS and VEGF immunostaining in GC p53 immunoreactivity was located in the nuclei VEGF and iNOS immunoreactivity were located mainly in the cytoplasm and cell membrane iNOS immunostaining was confirmed by Western Blot on part of iNOS positive and negative slides three slides for each and consistent results were obtained for iNOS immunohistochemistry and Western Blot data not shown The positive immunostaining rate for p53 was very low in CAG and slightly increased in IM and DYS and significantly increased in GC Table 1 Similar results were observed in iNOS and VEGF Table 1 P53 positive immunosatining rate in well differentiated GC was lower than that in poorly differentiated GC p 0 012 Table 2 iNOS positive staining was similar among the GC with different degree of differentiation Although VEGF immunostaining rate in poorly differentiated GC was higher than in well differentiated GC the difference was not significant Table 2 iNOS positive immunostaining rate in the cases with deep invasion of GC through muscle layers was higher than in those with superficial invasion within submucosa but the difference was not significant Table 3 P53 and VEGF immunostaining was similar in GC patients with superficial and deep invasion iNOS immunosatining rate in the cases with lymph node metastasis was higher than that in those without lymph node metastasis p 0 014 Table 4 However there was no difference observed for p53 and VEGF between the cases with and without lymph node metastasis P53 immunostaining rate in the cases with TNM grade T1 was lower than that in those with TNM grade T2 T3 and T4 T1 T3 p 0 023 T1 T4 p 0 012 Similar results were observed in VEGF T1 T2 and T2 T3 p 0 015 T1 T4 p 0 014 T2 T4 p 0 01 Table 5 However there was no difference for iNOS immunostaining between the cases with different TNM stages A higher coincidental expression of p53 iNOS and VEGF in GC was observed Of the 55 cases examined there were 20 cases showing positive staining both for p53 and iNOS 36 23 cases showing negative staining for both p53 and iNOS 42 p 0 005 Table 6 19 cases showing positive staining both for p53 and VEGF 35 and 18 cases showing negative for both p53 and VEGF 33 p 0 01 Table 7 The correlations were significant Discussion An interesting observation in this study was that the immunoreactivity of p53 iNOS and VEGF occurred in the early stage of gastric carcinogenesis The positive immunostaining cells were invariably associated with cell proliferate activity With the lesions progressed from normal to CSG to CAG to IM to DYS and to GC the positive immunostaining rates for p53 iNOS and VEGF increased significantly the increasing tendency for p53 iNOS and VEGF had a good linear correlation with lesions progression The present results indicated that p53 protein accumulation and increased expression of iNOS and VEGF may be important molecular events involved in the early stage of gastric carcinogenesis Another interesting observation was that a high coincidental positive immunostaining rates for p53 and iNOS 36 and p53 and VEGF 35 was observed Table 6and 7 This result was consistent with the findings in human lung and colon carcinomas Ambs et al 1999 Although p53 antibody used in this study could not differentiate wild type p53 from mutant p53 previous studies have indicated that p53 protein detected by immunohistochemistry seems to representative most mutant p53 Accumulation of p53 is an indicator for a loss of p53 tumor suppressor function Both mutations and protein protein interactions can cause a p53 accumulation Wang et al 1994 Considering that p53 protein accumulation was correlated with poorly differentiation and T2 T3 and T4 TNM stage of GC we concluded that p53 protein accumulation in this study may lead to the loss of cell proliferation control and inhibition for iNOS and VEGF possibly because of p53 gene mutation Thus the high coincidental expression of iNOS and VEGF and p53 protein accumulation may be important events to enhance gastric carcinogenesis and poorly clinical features and may be useful biomarkers to assess risk for the development of GC Recent studies on Japanese GC patients have showed that increased expression of VEGF and p53 protein accumulation are associated with intra tumoral angiogenesis Takeuchi et al 2000 Saito et al 1999 and poor prognosis Skatani et al 2000 Ikeguchi et al 2000 Maeda et al 1998 Rajnkova reported that increased expression of iNOS may promote gastric cancer progression by providing a selective growth advantage to tumor cells with non functioning p53 Rajnkova et al 2001 The third observation in this study was that increased expression of iNOS and VEGF and p53 protein accumulation occurred with a high frequency in gastric biopsy samples with IM IM which may be defined as the replacement of gastric mucosa by glands which have the histological histochemical and physiological characteristics of the small intestine has been strongly associated with stomach cancer The present results demonstrated that IM was a unstable stage with active molecular changes and further analysis to compare these changes with normal small intestine will provides more information for the significance of IM in gastric carcinogenesis Finally the present study demonstrated that the positive immunostaining rates of iNOS was correlated well with GC lymph node metastasis increased expression of VEGF and p53 protein accumulation was related with TNM stages and GC differentiation These findings indicate that p53 iNOS and VEGF may be useful biomarkers for GC aggressiveness The molecular basis for the observed expression of iNOS and VEGF and p53 protein accumulation and their roles in the progression of gastric pre cancerous lesions and angeogenesis requires to be carefully investigated in the laboratory and follow up studies Abbreviations The abbreviations used are CSG chronic superficial gastritis CAG chronic atrophic gastritis DYS dysplasia GC gastric adenocarcinoma
