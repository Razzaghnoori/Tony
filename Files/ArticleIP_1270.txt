We ve visited this planet before says Time s Richard Corliss Among the elements of Lynch s self plagiarism an eerie soundtrack creepy characters femmes fatales scary thugs ghoulish freak and lots of

Rosewood Warner Brothers Based on a hitherto little known 1923 incident in which a white mob pillaged a black Florida town Rosewood is deemed important as history but insignificant as art Director John Singleton Boyz N the Hood is accused of sentimentalizing his subject and resorting to action film banalities a sorry assortment of dramatic and visual clich s that were retired from service or should have been decades ago says the Wall Street Journal s Morgenstern Rosewood s home page has video clips and the like Television Schindler s List NBC Feb 23 NBC earns kudos for its sensitive presentation of Steven Spielberg s 1993 Holocaust epic which it showed without ads under the sponsorship of Ford But the praise is tempered by the observation that the film came in a package deal with Jurassic Park and was broadcast in the middle of February sweeps Critics note two other ironies 1 Schindler s List is the most graphic program ever shown on network television 2 Ford has its own unacknowledged history of anti Semitism Henry Ford once gave his workers free copies of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion Miss Evers Boys HBO click here for times David Feldshuh s Pulitzer Prize

Didion turned the Jessica Savitch saga into the 1996 Disney picture Up Close and Personal makes the cover of the March 2 New York Times Book Review although screenwriter Larry Gelbart summarizes rather than evaluates the book Monster offers a crash course in getting a script through the hazards of the present day studio system In the Los Angeles Times producer writer Michael Crichton applauds Dunne s breezy professional tone Shock and petty moralizing are the mark of an outsider The New York Review of Books complains that Dunne is too breezy This is what makes him so readable but it doesn

moderate who neither censures the author of the Declaration of Independence for his conflicted views on race nor dismisses his political beliefs as insincere Jeffersonism is not Clintonism says historian Sean Wilentz in the New Republic The Chicago Tribune however concludes that American Sphinx makes manifest so many inconsistencies in Jefferson s thought that it may unwittingly be the most critical biography of Jefferson published in this century For more on the Jefferson debate see David Greenberg s High Concept Whittaker Chambers A Biography by Sam Tanenhaus Random House Tanenhaus elevates Chambers to the pantheon of great American postwar intellectuals and declares Alger Hiss a Soviet spy and no critics object Even The Nation famously defensive on the question of Hiss calls the biography an honest and indispensable book that goes a long way toward restoring to Chambers an elementary human plausibility gosh thanks Tanenhaus accuses Chambers of having inadvertently

be received unfairly claimed Schama as yet another formulaic contribution to the flourishing genre of painter as prick Critics have proven him right The play is Spencer s life reduced to Two Weddings and a Funeral a quaint and titillating Bloomsbury parallelogram says the Wall Street Journal s Donald Lyons All praise is reserved for the production itself The staging is infinitely inventive says New York s John Simon Actor Anthony Sher as Stanley is astonishing as though he were plugged into a power source the rest of the world had yet to discover says the New York Times Ben Brantley Update
