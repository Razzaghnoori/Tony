 Evening of the Yo yos Frank You are too generous about my Prudie credentials but judging from the New Hampshire debate tonight s being a few hours away I thought they were all displaying manners up the ying yang to the point of well being mannered Do manners matter in politics I m afraid not though if one were to cross the line in an extremely obvious way negative reaction might bubble up but not necessarily because the guy appeared to be rude but because he would appear to be desperate When it comes to the authenticity quotient I being older if not wiser have pretty much written that off All of them Democrats and Republicans are so cautious about image that whatever real characteristics seep out they serve as kind of personality tea leaves Bradley is probably the most authentic and even he s had a little coaching Since I know you have a little time to kill before you go to work tonight I ve rustled up the news equivalent of junk food to give you sustenance for the upcoming Evening of the Yo yos Stuever in the Washington Post has a dishy piece on the Kennedy Center Honors backstage if you will This interested me because a former husband not one of the Jews was on the Artists Committee and I always enjoyed the event En passant I read that the former Ritz Carlton nee the Fairfax has been rechristened the Westin Fairfax This interested me because a former husband one of the Jews used to own it Also of interest was our president recalling his visit to the Parthenon owned by no one I was married to wondering what our civilization s monument would be I m guessing a 40 story black beret There are big doings in the divorce arena The daughter of Faith Whittlesley Reagan chum and twice ambassador to Switzerland is divorcing a Rockefeller relly named O Neill Putting aside that the once happy couple might do well to reside with the attendant from whom Alan Keyes escaped the big frou fra is that heretofore secret Rockefeller Trust details may wind up in a Florida court And speaking of money another Florida couple has bought the 100 000 millennium package at the Boston Ritz Carlton Nope never married to him The wife said looking forward to New Year s Eve afternoon I ll be drinking champagne all day Well I m crossing my fingers that the dear girl is awake when it s time for dinner She has also requested Gilbert and Sullivan entertainment Wouldn t you think for that kind of money they could get Gilbert and Sullivan In any case I am not mentioning the name of this couple so the United Way people won t waylay them on their way to dinner And here s a great nugget A supermodel was tear gassed by a taxi driver driven crazy by the constant ringing of her cell phone I m with the mad macer on the phone deal but the real question is what was a supermodel doing in a cab I mean I m only a potential Oil of Olay model and I wouldn t be caught dead in one But onward Lucianne and her dot com are all het up about people dissing the Baby Jesus She says Hillary called him homeless then Al Sharpton said he was unemployed Which makes for a nice segue to my thought that you and I should perhaps cool our ethnic references It is conceivable that we could incite people in sheets to march on Slate s offices which while not actually in Seattle are close enough and I know for a fact that the riot squads there are pooped Well maybe just one more latke And do check your shoes for scorpions xxM
