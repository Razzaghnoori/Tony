 You are invited to participate in the Chancellor s Circle at Indiana University Purdue University at Indianapolis IUPUI This group of donors will directly help the Chancellor meet immediate needs of faculty students and staff These needs require unrestricted gifts that the Chancellor can use for special purposes that the usual sources of support can t cover With your personal commitment the IUPUI Chancellor will be able to act sooner and more effectively when special opportunities arise As is true at other campuses almost all of our operating funds are restricted We must use income from fees and appropriations for defined purposes and most gifts are designated Even at ivy covered well endowed universities discretionary funds are limited At IUPUI they are scarce Through annual unrestricted gifts from individual and corporate supporters the Chancellor s Circle will make it possible to respond more fully and flexibly to current needs You are invited to become a part of this important new venture to strengthen this growing partnership of two great state universities in Indianapolis IUPUI s Mission and Plans Every great city needs a first rate system of higher education both public and private anchored by a first rate public university For Indianapolis that public university must be IUPUI From its start in 1969 Indiana University Purdue University at Indianapolis has been a partner with its city and region in their shared growth and development IUPUI s contributions of teaching research and public service have helped to lift the quality of life in its community IUPUI s goals for the 1990s in the context of Indiana University s statewide plans call for improving undergraduate education enhancing relationships with the community and strengthening research that will stimulate Indiana s economic growth IUPUI envisions a complete and unified university campus one that will become a model for public higher education for the nation s cities Private gifts will play a vital role in reaching these goals The Chancellor s Circle offers distinctive ways to add momentum to further growth of this campus for Indianapolis and Indiana Faculty Recruitment and Development Discretionary funds are especially needed to attract and retain faculty members During the 1990s there will be much stiffer national competition for new faculty The numbers of Ph D holders will be down many current faculty will retire and enrollments will increase At IUPUI where we continue to face critical shortages of full time faculty we will have to make special efforts Gifts to the Chancellor s Circle will help pay travel costs to our city and campus for prospective faculty and their spouses along with some relocation costs The Chancellor s Circle also will help current faculty keep up with their scholarly and professional peers They need individual support to attend conferences present papers publish their works and keep in touch with others in their fields across the country Faculty and Student Awards Annual presentations of Chancellor s awards encourage outstanding work among faculty staff and students These awards provide chances to recognize unusual achievements and sometimes offer honoraria as incentives The Chancellor s Circle will help to defray costs of these special awards Special Opportunities No organization can anticipate every opportunity that may become available during its next budget cycle These can include unforeseen chances to enhance student and faculty learning by inviting special visitors and scholars to the campus when they happen to be in the state sometimes local events can generate chances for faculty and staff to assist the community because of their unique forms of expertise Or sudden changes in other countries can create openings for faculty research The campus also can serve as a community forum sponsoring public lectures by authorities on issues in the news Support from the Chancellor s Circle can help us take advantage of such emerging options Joining The Circle As a participant in the Chancellor s Circle you will receive reports from Chancellor Gerald L Bepko on how he puts your gifts to work You also will be invited to special events and receive mailings about campus activities Other benefits of participation are being planned Initially individuals can take part by making an annual unrestricted gift of 1 000 or more
