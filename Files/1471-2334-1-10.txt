                    Background        Rapid and accurate methods are needed for the diagnosis        of         Plasmodium falciparum malaria            as malaria is estimated to kill between  and  million        people each year     WHO South East Asian regional        office estimates  deaths due to malaria in India        annually             P falciparum infections in children        may become life threatening making rapid diagnosis of        extreme importance     No clinical diagnostic criteria        are both sensitive and specific for malaria an        undifferentiated febrile illness    which may result in        the erroneous treatment of millions of nonmalaria cases        with antimalarial drugs in the absence of diagnostic        malaria microscopy Excessive antimalarial drug use is        costly propels the emergence of drug resistant parasites        speeds the obsolescence of affordable drugs and retards        malaria control     Prompt diagnosis and effective        treatment of malaria improves prognosis     In the        absence of diagnostic microscopy in resource poor remote        villages of tribal forested belt of central India the        detection of         P falciparum histidine rich protein         Pf HRP in a blood specimen is one method by which        expeditious diagnosis of         falciparum malaria can be made on the        spot      Recently introduced rapid malaria test        Determine malaria pf Abbott Laboratories Japan have        been evaluated for its effectiveness in detecting         P falciparum malaria in Philippines           and in central India            This field study appraised the performance of the rapid        diagnostic test in assessing the impact of antimalarial        intervention measures in villages of two adjacent Primary        Health Centres of district Mandla central India For this        study we performed a blinded microscopy and splenomegly in        children as the endemicity of malaria is usually        characterized by spleen and parasites rates in children                               Material and methods                  Study area and study population          This Study was undertaken in two Primary Health          Centres PHC of district Mandla The entire region is          undulating and hilly The villages are generally located          on the slopes of the hillocks or on hill tops adjoining          perennial streams The inhabitants are gond ethnic          tribe illiterate poorly clothed health ignorant and          work in forest or road construction work etc An outbreak          of           P falciparum was recorded in          villages of Bizadandi PHC in  unpublished          observation while in villages of Narayanganj PHC in               Appropriate intervention measures were          undertaken in both the areas by National Anti Malaria          Programme NAMP which are described previously              Briefly two rounds of focal spraying with DDT  gm           along with prompt surveillance and treatment to bring the          incidence of malaria under control          For monitoring the impact of intervention measures in          these two PHCs children aged  yrs with and without          fever were examined for spleen enlargement    in          three villages of each PHC during autumn season          December  by one medical specialist by          establishing a mobile field clinic after obtaining          informed consent from their parents Treatment was given          when appropriate as per Indian NAMP The study is          approved by ethic committee of Malaria Research Centre          ICMR Delhi                          Sampling and data analysis          From these children thick blood smears were prepared          from finger prick and read by a technician unaware of the          spleen results Parasites were counted against  white          blood cells and converted into countsl assuming the          average count is  l Simultaneously rapid tests          were performed by a field lab attendant after only a          brief on the spot training according to the          manufacturers instructions taking about  minutes to          provide one result without reference to the results of          the thick smear and spleen The thick smears were          reexamined to discard a false negative results combined          infections or misdiagnosis of species by an experienced          technician who was blinded to the previous results of          thick smears The figures for specificity sensitivity          and predictive values were calculated as described          previously    using microscopy as gold standard          Briefly sensitivity was calculated as TP  TP  FN          specificity as TN TN  FP the positive predictive          values PPV as TP  TP  FP and the negative          predictive values NPV as TN  FN  TN The test          accuracy the proportion of all tests that gave correct          result was defined as TP  TN  numbers of all tests          The mixed infection of           P vivax and           P falciparum are treated as          falciparum cases for the purpose of analysis Likewise          the instances of gametocytes only are classified as false          positives since gametocytes neither cause illness nor          require treatment with blood stage schizonticidal drugs          The Ztest was used for comparison between          proportions                            Results        Spleen examination of  and  children respectively        in Narayanganj and Bizadandi Primary Health Centres PHC        are shown in Table  The spleen rate among children who        lived in the villages of Narayanganj PHC  was        significantly higher P   than that among        children of Bizadandi  Fever was found in  and          children in Narayanganj and Bizadandi PHCs        respectively without spleen enlargement

accuracy  P   were all        significantly higher when compared with their respective        values of spleen In all  cases showed positive reaction        by rapid test for         P falciparum while blood smears were        negative for malaria parasite A prolonged reexamination        of these slides who were positive by the rapid test but        apparently had negative slides did not reveal the presence        of         P falciparum asexual parasites        Further of the eight subjects with         P falciparum infection not detected        by rapid test not all had low parasitaemia five had        parasite densities between l but the three others        had densities between l Out of  gametocytes of                P falciparum only   were        positive by rapid test        In addition  subjects with         P vivax as detected by microscopy          l were found positive for         P falciparum by rapid test                    Discussion        Malaria diagnosis is often made on the basis of        presumptive symptoms although this is alarmingly inaccurate              One of the earliest methods used for        estimation of the amount of malaria in a given locality is        that of determining the proportion of person with a        palpable enlargement of the spleen This method introduced        by Dempster in India in  is commonly used although it        is admittedly a rough index for malaria diagnosis and        assessment     However it is still considered a        diagnostic aid to every physician as the spleen rate is        easier to obtain than the parasite rate            In this study large number of cases with enlarged spleen        in Narayanganj PHC were asymptomatic of which fairly large        number were having malaria parasites Thus in this        population a positive correlation between malaria and        splenomegaly was observed as recorded elsewhere             However it requires the services of a medical specialist        who is not certain whether the spleen is entirely due to        malaria On the contrary rapid test indicate the presence        of         P falciparum easily and accurately        and since it requires no laboratory or technical equipment        a diagnostic facility can be set up in the most remote        areas and in the most rudimentary way which makes it ideal        for monitoring large scale control programmes in areas        where malaria is a serious problem This diagnostic test        also gives the general practitioner a means of immediate        diagnosis which would overcome the usual delay associated        with dependence on medical laboratories Thus rapid test        could be a better diagnostic method in         P falciparum malaria than spleen and        microscopy        The fact that a small proportion of children         without         P falciparum parasites in thick        smears were demonstrated to have detectable HRP antigen        does not reduce the value of the rapid test Positive        results on the rapid test which can not be verified        microscopically have been suggested to be due to        circulating         P falciparum HRP antigen following        treatment    or from sequestered parasites            In  cases the rapid test gave false negative results        compared to the thick smear Such cases may not have        sufficient antigen in the blood for detection by rapid        test We have estimated in our earlier study that the        threshold parasitaemia for detection by Determine test to        be about  parasites l     However in this study        rapid test failed to detect          P falciparum subjects with   l        of parasites Unexplained false negative results on the        rapid test have been reported in many studies     and        rarely even with very high parasitaemia             Further during this study though we did not find the        patients with rheumatoid factor this may need to be        investigated further in other malaria endemic areas as a        relatively high false positive rate with Determine rapid        test was observed in patients with rheumatoid factor in        earlier study            Interestingly in central India the largest state in the        country also contributing highest number of malaria cases         in the country     the usual practice under NAMP        is to provide radical treatment Chloroquine and        Primaquine to all fever cases during monsoon and post        monsoon season in tribal villages due to inaccessibility        However as a results of the emergence of drug resistant        malaria when Chloroquine CQ resistant         P falciparum infections are treated        with CQ as CQ is still the first line of treatment in        India these infections may be partially controlled with        the persistence of low grade parasitaemia in the peripheral        blood     Such patients experience no symptoms or        barely symptomatic infections      We contend that        the asymptomatic infections which were recorded in this        study were mainly infections of this type These        asymptomatic carriers in remote villages are putting a        strain on malaria control activities Since the number of        febrile patients presenting at most peripheral health        facilities in central India far too high to test each        patient for the presence of Plasmodium species hence        malaria control programme policy is to provide fever        radical treatment Thus collection and examination of blood        smears from asymptomatic patients is not possible This        opens new possibilities for rapid screening of communities        at risk particularly pregnant women and children            in whom correct diagnosis and treatment is especially        important            However a diagnostic test which is to be used in        peripheral areas of developing country has to be simple and        fast to perform by unskilled staff While comparing with        other HRP Determine test has some advanced features The        ParaSight F test requires six steps and  l of blood        followed by ICT which required  steps and  l of blood        while Determine assay require  steps and  l of blood        Though final reading time is designed as  min which may        be a disadvantage particularly during malaria outbreak        generally a clear red line in patient bar is seen within         minutes in mild to moderately parasitaemic cases In our        study the reliability of field worker in reading test        results was excellent after only brief onsite training        Finally the application of the rapid test in the programme        will be determined by cost effective analysis The        population and countries at highest risk from malaria are        mainly poorest and the most disadvantaged     The price        of the test varies with quantity and source of purchase            For example the ParaSight F test sells for US          test in Uganda     US  in South Africa           and US  in Europe The costs of the ICT pf tests        ranges from US   test in developing countries           to US  for two test in developed world These prices        appear prohibitive at first sight in a country which only        spends a few dollarspersonyear for health care However        the picture may look different when the total costs to        disease management are considered for the community and the        programme The cost effectiveness advantage of rapid test        in the long term is the reduction of mistreatment in terms        of drugs costs toxicity and development of resistance            An important advantage of the availability of the        rapid test that it does not depend on just one person but        can be performed by all staff members of the health        clinic                    Conclusions        In a situation like ours where laboratory facilities are        poor or nonexistent rapid test is the best option to        support malaria diagnosis for case management in malaria        control programme However persistent positive reactions        upto  weeks following treatment    would not justify        the introduction of rapid test as a screening test by        village health workers in the region Since the sensitivity        of the rapid tests remains high on treated patients        therefore it will be important to take patients history        into consideration during routine usage of the rapid tests        Furthermore in the study area people are also subject to        other         Plasmodium infections ie         P vivax which are less common and        initially indistinguishable These nonfalciparum        plasmodial infections have important therapeutic and        prognostic implications Thus a second generation of rapid        tests are required which are intended to detect and        distinguish         P vivax from         P falciparum
