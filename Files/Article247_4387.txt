 A Preemptive Strike Mornin Dave I suppose I should begin this with a word to our readers noting that you and I are friends have known each other for nearly a decade and don t usually talk to each other this way For the purposes of this Breakfast Table we ve agreed to write to each other in Breakfast Table ese a particular idiom in which participants are cleverer and breezier and far more avid news junkies than they usually would be in real life At least I m assuming Who knows Maybe Nora Ephron and Kurt Andersen write e mails that sound Breakfast Table y all the time They probably do It may be a tad artificial but it s better than the alternative which would be our writing to one another the same way we talk to each other DAVE Hey how s it going ME Fine You DAVE Fine ME How s Abby DAVE She s good Thanks for asking etc So Where were we SUVs I drive a Honda Civic and am therefore terrified of SUVs Also a small thing I ve noticed Many street signs seem to have been designed before the advent of SUVs which means that they re too low to see if you re in say a Honda Civic surrounded by SUVs This is not admittedly a very trenchant or interesting observation But if there are any traffic engineers out there listening well you now have a problem to solve I imagine that the preceding comment will be picked over in the Fray A traffic engineer will write in noting that the signs cannot in fact be placed any higher due to some ordinance which any moron would know about Then another engineer will write in correcting that first engineer Then others will pile on Then the topic will turn to funding for NASA or libertarianism and things will get ugly I am in case you can t tell deeply afraid of the Fray I ve had nightmares of our Fray reviews worst Breakfast Table ever a disgrace is this for real this is a joke right and have come to the conclusion that instead of running scared we should try to generate the most negative Fray threads ever I ll begin I don t know why there isn t more animal testing these days Especially on puppies Your turn Tim
