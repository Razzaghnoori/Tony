 Weimar Russia Dear Dad Well I ll accept recycled platitudes as covering most political life in the United States and the U K these days and I certainly don t want to devote any more of this space to the dreadful Taki So let me turn from the ridiculous to the sublimely horrible and from Britain to a place where they can only dream of a politics of contented recycled platitudes Russia Has ever a man been a better metaphor for the society he governs than Boris Yeltsin He stands there an awesome wreck drunk corrupted angry in pain delusionary his vital organs putrifying but still possessing surprising reservoirs of strength and still capable of delivering vicious and unpredictable blows In his shambling gait and glassy uncertain stare he reminds me all too closely of another awesome wreck of a man who led another awesome wreck of a country Marshall von Hindenburg at the end of his life And that scares me because the similarities between Hindenburg s Weimar Germany and Yeltsin s Russia seem all too exact In both cases there is the society in a state of collapse the government tottering dizzily from crisis to crisis and the people increasingly gripped by resentment and rage against a West they blame for abandoning betraying and exploiting them Does Russia have a Hitler in waiting Putin Lukashenko Lebed Zyuganov It s hard to take any of them seriously But then again Hitler wasn t taken very seriously at the start either with his preposterous rhetoric and silly little moustache Of course historians easily get carried away by historical comparisons But if you forgive me for tooting my horn a little you may remember a little piece I wrote for the New Republic in 1988 called Paristroika laying out the uncanny similarities between the situation of the then Soviet Union and the situation of France on the eve of its 1789 revolution the pompous Sovietologist Jerry Hough wrote a condescending letter to the editor scolding me for my ignorance in failing to realize that the Russians would never let things get to the point where Ukraine or Lithuania might secede Oops I devoutly hope I am wrong this time But assuming things do continue to get worse in Russia what should the United States do We can always sit around and flagellate ourselves for letting it happen through our antagonizing of the Russians with NATO expansion and the Kosovo war and look Here s Thomas Friedman of the New York Times running up with a selection of nice dry leather bullwhips Personally I doubt that there was anything we could have done given the thieves and thugs thrown up into leadership positions by the Soviet collapse and the disintegration of anything that might have evolved into civil society Check out David Remnick s excellent column in this week s New Yorker for more on this and on Al Gore s willful blindness to the corruption of his good friend Viktor Chernomyrdin But regardless of how we interpret our own actions in the 1990s it seems to me that there is one critical historical lesson we can t afford to forget In the 1930s the road to appeasement was paved by Western guilt over post World War I policy toward Germany over the harshness of the Versailles Treaty and reparations The Germans have a point the statesmen said We were too hard on them Give them a little slack now and everything will even out and get back to normal Well we know how well that policy worked So by all means flagellate away Lay in with a strong will and a strong arm Howl to the heavens that our earlier Russian policy was a failure But don t let it stop us from having a strong will and a strong arm when it comes to what Putin and Yeltsin are doing in Chechnya or it will encourage them to do it again somewhere else Love David
