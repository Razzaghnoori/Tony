 Dear Have you noticed your friends mentioning Fountain Square lately It seems that everywhere I go people are making positive observations about how our community is on the upswing This shift in our neighborhood image is very satisfying after fifteen years of concerted efforts by South East Neighborhood Development SEND to reverse community decline In 1983 community residents and organizations banded together to form the organization which is now called SEND SEND s redevelopment efforts have played a major role in rebirth of Fountain Square directly investing more than 12 Million into affordable housing commercial development and beautification project since 1991 This investment has resulted in the renovation and sale of 60 homes to homebuyers of modest means and in the rehab of more than 100 affordable high quality apartments More than 500 low income home owners often senior citizens have been able to remain in their homes thanks to home repairs supported by SEND More than 20 businesses have been able to expand and employ more residents Two hundred at risk neighborhood youth have gained work and life skills to overcome the appeal of gangs drugs and school drop out which constantly threaten their future These direct investments by SEND have been a catalyst encouraging millions more in investments by residents and businesses who now hold hope for the neighborhood s future While the trends of decline are reversing our work is far from complete Thousands of residents still live in sub standard conditions our teen pregnancy rate is the highest in the state only one third of residents have high school diplomas and half of our residents have little hope of participating in community improvements because they do not own their home We need your help to continue our work particularly as we enable area families with low incomes to become home owners The cost of creating these homes far exceeds what our buyers cm pay so we rely on grants and individual donations to keep them affordable I hope you will take this opportunity to make a contribution to support SEND s homeownership work As a bonus we are now able to offer donors of 100 or more a State of Indiana Neighborhood Assistance Program NAP 50 tax credit This means that half of your contribution will be returned to you through State tax savings while the entire donation amount will remain deductible on your Federal taxes Most donors of 100 will actually be contributing less than 30 while SEND benefits from the entire gift However these tax credits are only available for a limited time so we ask that you act soon if you would like to use them Please join us as we continue to rebuild this historic neighborhood into a place of pride and community strength Feel free to call me if you would like more information on the NAP tax credit program or any of SEND s programs Yours in Service William G Taft Executive Director
