 Female Voice START OF TAPE 1 SIDE A Hello My name is Kevin McCloskey and um I m 15 years old and um I ve lived in Charlotte since I was born and um my parents are originally from KY and I have relatives up there that that have some pretty crazy stories that um my grandmother used to tell me about her brother which was he was autistic and um he did some funny stuff Like one time his sister got a doll for her birthday or something and she wouldn t let him play with it He kept bugging her and bugging her and she just wouldn t let him mess with it you know And so he threatened he said I m going to go sit in the fire And she said Go ahead So he goes and sits down inside the fireplace with the fire on He got third degree burns all up his back went to the hospital you know he s pretty crazy He keeps a goat in his front yard because he doesn t like to mow the lawn It s pretty funny I mean it s nothing to laugh about but you know Um he can play the harmonica like it ain t nobody s business Uh that s why they say he s retarded but I really think he s autistic because he s really good with musical instruments Um they tell me pretty crazy stories My mom said when she was little she had um she had a little puppy and every everyday it would run around the yard It would just run and run And she watched it everyday run run run run run until it couldn t run anymore Just fall over on the steps you know And one day she was mowing the lawn and they used to have a little push mower instead of um like an electric mower and um the dog hit it and the dog split in half Like straight down the middle And my mom she was crying and everything and she took I forgot what the medicine was called but it was that stingy medicine that really stung when they would put it against you and um she poured that all over the dog and wrapped it up in bandages and um she put it in a box and the next day she heard it barking So she ran over to the box and um when she saw the box she uh she saw that she had put the dog on backwards so its legs were facing two different directions And then because she was trying to rush it you know trying to keep him alive she said he would run on two feet he would run around the whole yard whole yard and as soon as he would get tired he would jump do a flip and go on the other two feet and just keep on running That s pretty funny I don t think it was true though And um my grandparents my father my grandfather he used to be very wealthy before the Depression and uh this one time his father played the world champion billiards player at that time And they they played about three games and he cleaned him out all three times you know The other guy didn t even get to touch the ball So but um my grandmother had 10 siblings and um she used to tell me when they were little there used to be a creek over by their house and um she used to run they used to get vines off the tree and just they would swing on them and like every week some kid just being stupid would break their arm or break their leg break fingers or something and go crying home And the parents are just they would never show them they would always have the perfect swing but they would always point to a bad one and they would just cut them down and just have it and everybody would just keep breaking their arms and stuff and um I don t know I just thought that was pretty cool There s no real end to that story Um I don t have one story in particular that they told me I mean they re kind of short but I can just tell you a bunch of short ones Um when I was little my mom used to tell me this story about a monkey that lived on a pirate ship His name was Ketchup and um everyday the monkey would always lag behind you know he would always drag when the other monkeys were running real all fast And they would always go Ketchup Ketchup And this happened everyday every single day And the monkey kept getting you know he was tired of being left behind all the time he never got to do any of the fun monkey stuff So um one day he got roller skates and uh one day they were like Ketchup Ketchup And he went and he put on his roller skates and he beat everybody back to the pirate ship And then they were like Wait up Ketchup And uh now that I think of it that wasn t the greatest story but I thought it was cool Um I my grandma always said my mom and dad they would always they said uh my grandparents said that my mom and her brother were just like the greatest children ever And my mom would tell me as soon as they got done as soon as their parents were out of the room they would just start going at it They would pull each other s hair and fight and cuss and yell at each other you know fighting and uh my grandma was always um she always thought they were real nice They still fight to this day not bad but they ll argue every so often Um and my other grandpa um he used to tell me about how he used to fly in the B 52s and he said uh he had to escape about three times One time he went and hold on sorry anyways he would he told us he had to parachute out of the plane about three or four times I can t remember But um he said he used to have a friend that could speak German and he jumped out of the plane and he landed in the French with the French Army and um he um Who you talking to he had this friend that could speak German and um his friend you know he fell in with the French and the he was like he said something in German because he thought they were the Germans and he was like Yeah I m a German I m just s spy for Germany spying on America And the French people tried to attack him because he was um because he was in Germany But um my grandpa he jumped out of a parachute one time and he told the people that his boots were too big when he got them but they were like Wear them anyways When he jumped out of the plane his boots fell off But see that s pretty serious because when you land he could break his ankles easy But uh lucky for him he fell in like a vineyard and fell into a tree and it was in the I want to say it was in the Mayor or maybe it was in the equivalent of a Mayor over in France and uh they hid him for about three or four weeks from the German from the Nazi troops um just to save him But he used to tell me often about his brother which who was a Green Beret and he um he everyday they would take him five miles out or six miles out and just drop him in a different place everyday They had to find their way back to camp Um and he said one time one time he got about seven purple hearts but um I remember one time my grandfather would tell me I thought it was pretty cool but um he um he um he was fighting you know the German army and uh not the whole German army but you know he s fighting a platoon him and a few of his Green Beret buddies Um and um he went and I m not sure if this was the Korean War or Vietnam War but um I mean not Vietnam but World War II But um whatever happened he was his whole team went down and he was around quite a few dead people and he pulled a dead person over him And the people saw him and so they shot a bullet through the dead person and it um it went through his mouth and but it didn t break any of his teeth or break his jaw it just went through his mouth and he didn t make a sound And that s how he escaped So I thought that was pretty neat Um I don t really know There s a lot of stories that he used to tell me but um I remember hearing when I went to a carnival one time a story that was pretty good It was it was about if I can remember correctly it was about a cat s tail And it was something like uh Taily Po or something and whatever would happen is whoever uh I don t even remember I think it was like who somebody cut the cat s tail off and he ate it and every night he would hear Taily Po Taily Po I want my Taily Po And finally one morning he woke up and his belly had been cut open but uh I don t think that s how it went because I was little when I heard it Maybe I made up my own things too I do that I make up my own stories sometimes You know I ll do something like I was in a baseball field one day Oh I remember what I used to do when I was little I used to the stories I used to tell The stories I used to tell my babysitter was stuff like uh well today in gym the gym teacher made everybody do back flips and I was the only one who could do it all the way around the gym when I was five years old I mean and um and I thought she believed me but um I just hadn t learned about sarcasm yet But um also another story that I used to tell people but wasn t true was that when I was little my dog my little dog ran me over and stepped on my nose and gave me a scar on the side of my nose because I couldn t think of any way to do it any cool way of making my scar of how it got there and so I just made up stories I did that a lot Um I used to um I used to like hearing stories from mostly from my mom I heard some stories from my dad about sports but um he used to tell me about when he played baseball Some of the stuff I believed it all but I mean some of stuff it was like you know you want to make yourself sound better than you really were sometimes I do it all the time Um like the other day I got a hit in a baseball game It was a hit but I just it could have been counted as an error or a hit and I just made up a story about that So but um uh I don t know too many Charlotte stuff I heard some stuff about Charlotte Um oh yeah I remember this story when I was in pre school that I really liked It was about this this uh little guy and his name was like Tee or something I don t remember And he um one day he was walking with his uh walking with scissors and he snipped his finger and cut his finger and it hurt and uh he would never let his um he would never his mom let him get his hair cut because he was scared that it would hurt too bad And I always thought that was pretty cool But um I don t know I always liked ghost stories I remember when I was at Camp Clear Creek when I was in Cub Scouts there used to be a there there s the lake Bebe Parker it s more like a big pond but we called it it was a lake It was Bebe Parker Lake And Bebe Parker was a boy that um got sucked into a drainage pipe one one day and um he died And uh every year I d go there they would take the whole troop out there and I d be so scared And they d be out there they d be like Bebe Parker Are you there And then you would always hear Help me Help me And I was really scared I was always so scared of that And I never knew how they did it And I always thought it was really scary and like the next day we would run down and try to talk to him try to talk to Bebe Parker but uh Bebe Parker wouldn t ever talk to us back And we always thought he must be sleeping And then when we were I think Webelos or whatever they re called the highest you could be in Cub Scouts they would they gave us a uh they let all the Webelos be Bebe Parker and all it was was a big storm drain behind the there was like this big opening down the hill that they couldn t see from the hill they couldn t see it from up there and you just yelled into it Help me It s Bebe Parker Help me Save me You know and stuff like that We would scare all the little kids And I was so amazed because I thought it was the coolest thing And we used to go snipe hunting when we would go talk to Bebe Parker And the Scout leaders would go I see a snipe and he would jump on it and he would shake the bag like the big trash bag around Everybody would be yelling and screaming Agh It s a snipe And then um it was pretty cool I used to always try to catch snipes too I wasn t very smart when I was little I wasn t very I don t know I was book smart but I wasn t too clever I believed people silly stuff too much But um eh I don t know I used to like to read the stories about the Berenstain Bears a lot I liked the one about where were at or he where they went to the movies and there was they went to the ballet movie They they um went to the I forgot what it was It was like I guess it was equivalent of Power Rangers pretty much and it was like a Power Ranger movie but it wasn t And um the the brother and sister bear they both had nightmares about each other s stuff and it crossed over It was really neat but um the end My name was Kevin McCloskey I was I am 15 years old and I was born in Charlotte That s all I have to say
