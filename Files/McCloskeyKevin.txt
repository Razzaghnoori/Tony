                     Female Voice START OF TAPE  SIDE A                     Hello         My name is Kevin McCloskey and um Im  years old and um Ive lived in Charlotte since I was born and um my parents are originally from KY and I have relatives up there that that have some pretty crazy stories that um my grandmother used to tell me about her brother which was he was autistic and um he did some funny stuff         Like one time his sister got a doll for her birthday or something and she wouldnt let him play with it         He kept bugging her and bugging her and she just wouldnt let him mess with it you know         And so he threatened he said Im going to go sit in the fire         And she said Go ahead         So he goes and sits down inside the fireplace with the fire on         He got third degree burns all up his back went to the hospital you know hes pretty crazy         He keeps a goat in his front yard because he doesnt like to mow the lawn         Its pretty funny         I mean its nothing to laugh about but you know         Um he can play the harmonica like it aint nobodys business         Uh thats why they say hes retarded but I really think hes autistic because hes really good with musical instruments         Um they tell me pretty crazy stories         My mom said when she was little she had um she had a little puppy and every everyday it would run around the yard         It would just run and run         And she watched it everyday run run run run run until it couldnt run anymore         Just fall over on the steps you know         And one day she was mowing the lawn and they used to have a little push mower instead of um like an electric mower and um the dog hit it and the dog split in half         Like straight down the middle         And my mom she was crying and everything and she took I forgot what the medicine was called but it was that stingy medicine that really stung when they would put it against you and um she poured that all over the dog and wrapped it up in bandages and um she put it in a box and the next day she heard it barking         So she ran over to the box and um when she saw the box she uh she saw that she had put the dog on backwards so its legs were facing two different directions         And then because she was trying to rush it you know trying to keep him alive she said he would run on two feet he would run around the whole yard whole yard and as soon as he would get tired he would jump do a flip and go on the other two feet and just keep on running         Thats pretty funny         I dont think it was true though         And um my grandparents my father my grandfather he used to be very wealthy before the Depression and uh this one time his father played the world champion billiards player at that time         And they they played about three games and he cleaned him out all three times you know         The other guy didnt even get to touch the ball         So but um my grandmother had  siblings and um she used to tell me when they were little there used to be a creek over by their house and um she used to run they used to get vines off the tree and just they would swing on them and like every week some kid just being stupid would break their arm or break their leg break fingers or something and go crying home         And the parents are just they would never show them they would always have the perfect swing but they would always point to a bad one and they would just cut them down and just have it and everybody would just keep breaking their arms and stuff and um I dont know         I just thought that was pretty cool         Theres no real end to that story         Um I dont have one story in particular that they told me I mean theyre kind of short but I can just tell you a bunch of short ones         Um when I was little my mom used to tell me this story about a monkey that lived on a pirate ship         His name was Ketchup and um everyday the monkey would always lag behind you know he would always drag when the other monkeys were running real all fast         And they would always go Ketchup         Ketchup         And this happened everyday every single day         And the monkey kept getting you know he was tired of being left behind all the time he never got to do any of the fun monkey stuff         So um one day he got roller skates and uh one day they were like Ketchup         Ketchup         And he went and he put on his roller skates and he beat everybody back to the pirate ship         And then they were like Wait up Ketchup         And uh now that I think of it that wasnt the greatest story but I thought it was cool         Um I my grandma always said my mom and dad they would always they said uh my grandparents said that my mom and her brother were just like the greatest children ever         And my mom would tell me as soon as they got done as soon as their parents were out of the room they would just start going at it         They would pull each others hair and fight and cuss and yell at each other you know fighting and uh my grandma was always um she always thought they were real nice         They still fight to this day not bad but theyll argue every so often         Um and my other grandpa um he used to tell me about how he used to fly in the Bs and he said uh he had to escape about three times         One time he went and hold on sorry anyways he would he told us he had to parachute out of the plane about three or four times I cant remember         But um he said he used to have a friend that could speak German and he jumped out of the plane and he landed in the French with the French Army and um he um                     Who you talking to                     he had this friend that could speak German and um his friend you know he fell in with the French and the he was like he said something in German because he thought they were the Germans and he was like Yeah Im a German         Im just s spy for Germany spying on America         And the French people tried to attack him because he was um because he was in Germany         But um my grandpa he jumped out of a parachute one time and he told the people that his boots were too big when he got them but they were like Wear them anyways         When he jumped out of the plane his boots fell off         But see thats pretty serious because when you land he could break his ankles easy         But uh lucky for him he fell in like a vineyard and fell into a tree and it was in the I want to say it was in the Mayor or maybe it was in the equivalent of a Mayor over in France and uh they hid him for about three or four weeks from the German from the Nazi troops um just to save him         But he used to tell me often about his brother which who was a Green Beret and he um he everyday they would take him five miles out or six miles out and just drop him in a different place everyday         They had to find their way back to camp         Um and he said one time one time he got about seven purple hearts but um I remember one time my grandfather would tell me I thought it was pretty cool but um he um he um he was fighting you know the German army and uh not the whole German army but you know hes fighting a platoon him and a few of his Green Beret buddies         Um and um he went and Im not sure if this was the Korean War or Vietnam War but um I mean not Vietnam but World War II         But um whatever happened he was his whole team went down and he was around quite a few dead people and he pulled a dead person over him         And the people saw him and so they shot a bullet through the dead person and it um it went through his mouth and but it didnt break any of his teeth or break his jaw it just went through his mouth and he didnt make a sound         And thats how he escaped         So I thought that was pretty neat         Um I dont really know         Theres a lot of stories that he used to tell me but um I remember hearing when I went to a carnival one time a story that was pretty good         It was it was about if I can remember correctly it was about a cats tail         And it was something like uh TailyPo or something and whatever would happen is whoever uh I dont even remember I think it was like who somebody cut the cats tail off and he ate it and every night he would hear TailyPo TailyPo         I want my TailyPo         And finally one morning he woke up and his belly had been cut open but uh I dont think thats how it went because I was little when I heard it         Maybe I made up my own things too         I do that I make up my own stories sometimes         You know Ill do something like I was in a baseball field one day         Oh         I remember what I used to do when I was little         I used to the stories I used to tell         The stories I used to tell my babysitter was stuff like uh well today in gym the gym teacher made everybody do back flips and I was the only one who could do it all the way around the gym when I was five years old I mean and um and I thought she believed me but um I just hadnt learned about sarcasm yet         But um also another story that I used to tell people but wasnt true was that when I was little my dog my little dog ran me over and stepped on my nose and gave me a scar on the side of my nose because I couldnt think of any way to do it any cool way of making my scar of how it got there and so I just made up stories         I did that a lot         Um I used to um I used to like hearing stories from mostly from my mom         I heard some stories from my dad about sports but um he used to tell me about when he played baseball         Some of the stuff I believed it all but I mean some of stuff it was like you know you want to make yourself sound better than you really were sometimes         I do it all the time         Um like the other day I got a hit in a baseball game         It was a hit but I just it could have been counted as an error or a hit and I just made up a story about that         So but um uh I dont know too many Charlotte stuff I heard some stuff about Charlotte         Um oh yeah         I remember this story when I was in preschool that I really liked         It was about this this uh little guy and his name was like Tee or something I dont remember         And he um one day he was walking with his uh walking with scissors and he snipped his finger and cut his finger and it hurt and uh he would never let his um he would never his mom let him get his hair cut because he was scared that it would hurt too bad         And I always thought that was pretty cool         But um I dont know I always liked ghost stories         I remember when I was at Camp Clear Creek when I was in Cub Scouts there used to be a there theres the lake Bebe Parker its more like a big pond but we called it it was a lake         It was Bebe Parker Lake         And Bebe Parker was a boy that um got sucked into a drainage pipe one one day and um he died         And uh every year Id go there they would take the whole troop out there and Id be so scared         And theyd be out there theyd be like Bebe Parker         Are you there         And then you would always hear Help me         Help me         And I was really scared         I was always so scared of that         And I never knew how they did it         And I always thought it was really scary and like the next day we would run down and try to talk to him try to talk to Bebe Parker but uh Bebe Parker wouldnt ever talk to us back         And we always thought he must be sleeping         And then when we were I think Webelos or whatever theyre called the highest you could be in Cub Scouts they would they gave us a uh they let all the Webelos be Bebe Parker and all it was was a big storm drain behind the there was like this big opening down the hill that they couldnt see from the hill they couldnt see it from up there and you just yelled into it Help me         Its Bebe Parker         Help me         Save me         You know and stuff like that         We would scare all the little kids         And I was so amazed because I thought it was the coolest thing         And we used to go snipe hunting when we would go talk to Bebe Parker         And the Scout leaders would go I see a snipe         and he would jump on it and he would shake the bag like the big trash bag around         Everybody would be yelling and screaming Agh         Its a snipe         And then um it was pretty cool I used to always try to catch snipes too         I wasnt very smart when I was little         I wasnt very I dont know I was book smart but I wasnt too clever         I believed people silly stuff too much         But um eh I dont know I used to like to read the stories about the Berenstain Bears a lot         I liked the one about where were at or he where they went to the movies and there was they went to the ballet movie                  They they um went to the I forgot what it was         It was like I guess it was equivalent of Power Rangers pretty much and it was like a Power Ranger movie but it wasnt         And um the the brother and sister bear they both had nightmares about each others stuff and it crossed over         It was really neat but um the end         My name was Kevin McCloskey I was I am  years old and I was born in Charlotte         Thats all I have to say
