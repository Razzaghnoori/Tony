 Tangled Wires So Girl Scouts can sing again ASCAP an association of music copyright owners has stopped trying to collect royalties on campfire renditions of This Land Is Your Land The girls have a new place to camp too a vast stretch of land in Utah that President Clinton recently declared a National Monument Mining s forbidden now Too bad for Andalex which owned the rights to dig for coal Woody Guthrie who wrote This Land Is Your Land was a Communist It s your land but it s my land too From California to the New York Island and probably Utah as well I d quote more but I d need permission Guthrie copyrighted the song in 1956 It remains the private property of his heirs until 2031 As I said Guthrie was a capitalist Most of us are equally two faced about property My property is mine yours is for sharing Put any two toddlers in a room with toys and you get four political theorists End of Property stories appeal to some grown ups too Karl Marx finished one in 1894 A tidal wave of workers was going to sweep aside the obstructive nuisance of private ownership The 1990s version merely announces the end of all intellectual property ownership rights in words music and so on obliterated this time by a tsunami of new technology Copying and transmitting data is becoming too easy for the law to protect anyone s private ownership The ribbon of digital highway is for roamin and ramblin Copyright is dead Digital content just wants to be free See John Perry Barlow Esther Dyson Nicholas Negroponte Wired There s an obvious technological rejoinder Digital content can be shuffled as easily as it can be transmitted Encryption puts viscosity right back into the fluid digital pipeline Curiously most of the property abolitionists seem to like this home brew form of copyright There s a strong economic rejoinder too as Bob Wright pointed out on these screens not long ago Most people won t steal digital content if buying actually remains cheaper and easier as it probably will But the free the bits view of things isn t just inconsistent or unfinished It s an analysis that hasn t progressed beyond the Pampers stage of political theory Twenty years ago the Supreme Court announced that lawmakers couldn t ban abortions in the first trimester of pregnancy but could ban them in the third A constitutional line is crossed Justice Blackmun reasoned when a fetus becomes viable outside the womb By that logic the constitutional right retreats with every advance in neonatal medicine When medics learn how to incubate a test tube baby for the whole nine months the abortion right ought logically to disappear Except that it won t Logical consistency has nothing to do with it It s a safe political prediction that the legal rights in intellectual property aren t going to be abolished however badly bits may want to be free Even Hollywood s softie lefties go all hard and capitalist when it comes to intellectual property Jack Valenti Hollywood s lead flack in Washington spent the early 80s trying to kill the new video cassette recorder which he was sure would be used mostly to pirate his clients movies Valenti didn t succeed but only because the VCR ended up delivering huge profits to the movie moguls Far more people use VCRs to rent movies than to steal them But people could steal movies if they felt like it The end of property cybersages argue that the law may say what it likes but the law doesn t matter any more Technological might makes right People with the machines will copy if they please and lawyers shouldn t try to stop them Unless of course those lawyers work for Wired which is very actively defending its own trademark But this premise is also wrong The first point to recognize is that copyright is just a commercial form of privacy law Indeed for some it s the only kind of privacy they still own Madonna can no longer stop you from gazing at her breasts Copyright at least makes you pay for the pleasure So we ve done breasts and we ve done abortion let s move on to the rest of your private life Lexis Nexis recently caused an uproar when it offered to help personal biographical stuff on its way to freedom through a database P Trak accessible at 82 a pop The Social Security numbers in the database were removed 11 days after its introduction technology trumped by popular protest Information wanting to be free doesn t seem so appealing when it includes details about all your own flesh and frailties credit history shopping habits records of where you ve been what you asked for and what you took Your modem doesn t know the difference between information called property and information called privacy And privacy cloak of night stocking mask and any digital equivalent is all that separates the thief from the law The harder it is to maintain privacy the easier it is to catch thieves It s no use responding that the law itself protects privacy better than copyright protects a Spielberg movie If you re a technological determinist there is no privacy law not in cyberspace Which means that the easier it gets to steal from Spielberg the easier it gets for his lawyers to come after you True technology empowers millions of potential copyright violators But Spielberg doesn t have to catch them all Spot enforcement well publicized with blue flashing lights is what maintains speed limits on the highway If you re enough of a pirate to be worth bothering about Spielberg s lawyers will get you And the law will then seize your property like your Pentium Pro your ISDN card and your Jaz drive That is what has got the cyberlibertarians so agitated Do you see the irony They aren t really property anarchists quite the opposite in fact They reject the new property because it threatens their absolute control of the old My high speed modem is mine so your intellectual property must be mine too If I really own my modem then I must have an unqualified right to dial up anywhere any time and suck in whatever is out there to be sucked Copyright law in cyberspace offends because it limits what I can do in physical space Encryption is OK because its authority is created in my very own machine From Marx to Lennon Imagine no possessions anti property zealots all miss the most fundamental point Property is politically neutral Sure property is the capitalist s tool But the feminist s too And the libertarian s The woman who wants an abortion says it s her uterus not Pat Robertson s The rancher says it s his land not the government protected wolf s Your supposed constitutional right to get an abortion or smoke dope or ride a Harley without a helmet all emerged from the Fourth Amendment written originally to protect houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures Whether you re talking about land abortion or environmental protection you inevitably drift into the rhetoric of property Property is an endless succession of bubbles in space or cyberspace with different people claiming an endless variety of interests in them Property is a bottle of champagne or the name of the label or the whole concept of effervescent wine or perhaps just wine in your bloodstream while you drive home in your Buick Control of each little bit of turf physical or virtual can always be made a bit more or a bit less personal and private Politicians prosecutors judges and litigators decide often one case at a time The deciding never ends because people and the things they value change Technology will never end the tug of war The only prognosis that s certainly wrong is that all boundary setting law will just somehow disappear because the Workers of the World have united or because information wants to be free
