 Roll Over Diane Keaton Dear Jeffrey What s misogynistic about saying I don t fall asleep when the Soprano women are on screen You re onto something here The women are another way The Sopranos breaks with the past What was Diane Keaton doing in The Godfather I always thought Michael married her because she was a Wasp because she embodied his abandoned dream of assimilation and also because she gave him cover In other words he married her because of what she represented rather than who she was and the story never freed her from that dehumanizing fact never gave her any individuality dignity presence which meant that we never felt compelled and maybe even didn t want to watch her Except in III and Carmela Soprano and her loverboy priest speak for all of us on that one What the hell was that Carmela s just the opposite Or at least she used to be they don t give her much to do in what we ve seen so far She s been supplanted by Tony s sister Pavarti aka Janice who as you say is an epic drag a bullying self important unsympathetic bohemian drag But back when the writers were interested in Carmela which was the first half of last season she had all the qualities that Diane Keaton lacked She was a real counterweight to Tony and Silvio and Paulie Walnuts and Pussy and all the charm they hold for the likes of you which in a mob context amounts to a giant feminist manifesto Edie Falco does the hardest thing an actor can do she makes Carmela s suburban decency both fierce and interesting Carmela sees through Tony but takes tender care of him anyway because frankly what else is she going to do She may not say much hey she s supposed to be emblematic of the mob s new yuppie isolation so who would she say it to but she s plenty smart and aware as we learned when she dressed down Father Paul for being a schnorrer who plays head games with lonely women because he likes the whiff of sexuality This being the Sopranos however which lets the moss of goodness gather on no one Carmela can also be a self deluded preening Italian JAP There was that wonderful episode early last year where she s appallingly condescending to an old friend the wife of a restaurateur who s been burned out of his restaurant She hires the couple to cater some fund raising party then in a room presumably filled with all their mutual friends waves her friend over as if bossing around some maid She s clearly forgotten upon what her higher financial status rests though the friend wastes no time reminding her Which brings us to the Soprano marriage which is as you say compulsively watchable Our editor suggested to me yesterday that it s a somewhat Clintonesque marriage Tony has a mistress whom he fucks rather joylessly and with whom he never has an actual conversation but he s really dependent on his wife although unlike with our president you have the sense that Tony screws around mostly because that s what mob bosses are supposed to do rather than out of real need In another likely Clinton parallel the two of them have a long history of hurting each other that makes it impossible for them to get the important stuff out there even though their desire to do so is palpable All this just hangs around in the air unresolved which makes you wish the writers would get back to it I dunno Maybe I m just getting my soap opera yayas out with a nighttime series But I do think their marriage has the rare distinction on television anyway of feeling like something living breathing and evolving another feminist touch in its way So here s my question to you who know so many mob children as opposed to Hasids though weren t you once friendly with some big Hasidic rabbi Didn t you cover them back in your Forward days before you abandoned the chosen people to hang out with the people you claim are the envy of the world What do you make of Tony and Carmela s kids Meadow and Anthony junior Do you buy how easily Meadow swallows her father s bullshit about what he does for a living even after she has pointedly asked about it I do absolutely I think it s an excellent dramatization of the weird state of knowing and not knowing that mob kids are forced to live in She s not deceived by her father s lies as she makes clear in lots of little sarcastic asides But if he actually fessed up then she d have to deal with his unpleasant reality which would rock her world a little more than she s ready for right now All this in fact is taking Meadow to the verge of becoming The Sopranos next great female character As far as I m concerned the best thing that happens in the second season is a major discovery we make about her in Episode 3 which for once I m not going to give away Suffice it to say that she might not be an unbearably self involved spoiled brat after all though of course she s that too Maybe I just want to see her get in on the action cause I was a huge self involved spoiled brat in my day but I think the girl has potential Spoiled or not I was taught enough manners to say It has been a pleasure doing business with you even if you did chop my herring up and stir it into onions and cream sauce I find that you are not in fact a mook Quite the opposite Love Judith
