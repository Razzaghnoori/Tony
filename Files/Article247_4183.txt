 The Crash of 2002 What Would George W Do Dear Dad Many thanks for the thoughts on technological change As for identities I suppose I could continue on the subject with a lengthy disquisition on the construction of national identities in early modern Europe drawn from my new book But somehow I think this would be getting a little too specialized for the Breakfast Table So I hope you don t mind if I change the subject and pontificate a little about the presidential campaign Living in Washington it s hard to resist the temptation I must say though that since I spend much of my time immersed in the 18 th century the crazily ritualistic aspects of the campaign strike me very forcefully The weirdest thing to my mind is the way the candidates and the media all seem to pretend that we are electing a benevolent dictator who once elected will snap his fingers and the thousands of pages of position papers drawn up by his campaign staff will automatically become the law of the land Elect Gary Bauer and abortion will be abolished Elect George W and we will get a tax cut Elect Al Gore and gays will be welcomed into the military Elect Alan Keyes and everyone will be required to wear underwear on the outside to continue my homage to Woody Allen s Bananas At the very least it seems to me that reporters could make more of a distinction between three very different types of campaign promises those it would take a constitutional amendment to fulfill e g abortion maybe campaign finance reform because of first amendment concerns those that would require congressional action health care tax cuts etc and those that could be done with a presidential order Why even waste much time on the first category Let s pretend as a thought experiment that a conspiracy of vintners contaminates the champagne supply with powerful psychedelic mushrooms just before Jan 1 and that as a result the entire country goes on a year long hallucinatory head trip and elects Gary Bauer president only sobering up after his inauguration Will abortion still be legal in 2005 Of course it will Ronald Reagan was strongly against abortion too We can be pretty cautious about the second category as well especially when it comes to the details of health care plans that will be rewritten and amended time and again before possible passage In fact one of the few big issues where the candidates specific promises really matter is gays in the military since that can be done by executive order That s why Gore s promise to end Clinton s policy and let the gays in is probably the most important campaign news today This general problem is why I get steamed when pundits moan about how candidates are ignoring the issues Get real What matters is not the candidate s position papers but their basic principles the three or four things they care most about their experience their advisors their political savvy as our shared favorite spy novelist Charles McCarry emphasized in the Times yesterday and yes their character And this is all the more the case during a time when there are no big national disasters to be faced at least not the sort that require urgent responses If peace and prosperity continue and there are no major wars pretty much any of the serious candidates now running could probably muddle through all right not counting Steve Forbes as serious that is But what about the stock market collapse of 2002 The Russian invasion of Estonia The terrorist bombing of Las Vegas All those things that the candidates don t have position papers on What really matters is to choose a president who can deal best with a real crisis rather than worry about what s going to happen to ethanol subsidies anyone care to bet the subsidies will be gone in 2004 even if John McCain is elected of course as Jacob Weisberg remarks in Ballot Box the issue itself is still a good test of character Thinking in these terms do we really want to elect George W Love David
