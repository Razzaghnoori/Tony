                                 The Crash of  What Would George W Do                        Dear Dad            Many thanks for the thoughts on technological change As for identities Isuppose I could continue on the subject with a lengthy disquisition on theconstruction of national identities in early modern Europe drawn from my newbook But somehow I think this would be getting a little too specialized forthe Breakfast Table So I hope you dont mind if I change the subject andpontificate a little about the presidential campaign Living in Washingtonits hard to resist the temptation            I must say though that since I spend much of my time immersed in the th century the crazily ritualistic aspects of the campaign strikeme very forcefully The weirdest thing to my mind is the way the candidatesand the media all seem to pretend that we are electing a benevolent dictatorwho once elected will snap his fingers and the thousands of pages ofposition papers drawn up by his campaign staff will automatically become thelaw of the land Elect Gary Bauer and abortion will be abolished Elect GeorgeW and we will get a tax cut Elect Al Gore and gays will be welcomed into themilitary Elect Alan Keyes and everyone will be required to wear underwear onthe outside to continue my homage to Woody Allens Bananas             At the very least it seems to me that reporters could make more of adistinction between three very different types of campaign promises those itwould take a constitutional amendment to fulfill eg abortion maybe campaignfinance reform because of first amendment concerns those that would requirecongressional action health care tax cuts etc and those that could bedone with a presidential order Why even waste much time on the first categoryLets pretend as a thought experiment that a conspiracy of vintnerscontaminates the champagne supply with powerful psychedelic mushrooms justbefore Jan  and that as a result the entire country goes on a yearlonghallucinatory head trip and elects Gary Bauer president only sobering up afterhis inauguration Will abortion still be legal in  Of course it willRonald Reagan was strongly against abortion too We can be pretty cautiousabout the second category as well especially when it comes to the details ofhealthcare plans that will be rewritten and amended time and again beforepossible passage In fact one of the few big issues where the candidatesspecific promises really matter is gays in the military since that can be doneby executive order Thats why Gores promise to end Clintons policy and letthe gays in is probably the most important campaign news today            This general problem is why I get steamed when pundits moan about howcandidates are ignoring the issues Get real What matters is not thecandidates position papers but their basic principles the three or fourthings they care most about their experience their advisors their politicalsavvy as our shared favorite spy novelist Charles McCarry emphasized in theTimes yesterday and yes their character And this is all the more thecase during a time when there are no big national disasters to be faced atleast not the sort that require urgent responses If peace and prosperitycontinue and there are no major wars pretty much any of the seriouscandidates now running could probably muddle through all right not countingSteve Forbes as serious that is But what about the stockmarket collapse of The Russian invasion of Estonia The terrorist bombing of Las Vegas Allthose things that the candidates dont have position papers on What reallymatters is to choose a president who can deal best with a real crisis ratherthan worry about whats going to happen to ethanol subsidies anyone care tobet the subsidies will be gone in  even if John McCain is electedofcourse as Jacob Weisberg remarks in BallotBox the issue itself is still a good test of character Thinking inthese terms do we really want to elect George W            LoveDavid
