 Background Substance P SP is a peptide neurotransmitter that has been shown to play a role in nociception smooth muscle control allergic responses inflammation and glandular secretion 1 The amino acid sequence of SP was determined in 1970 2 after being isolated from mammalian gastrointestinal tract in 1931 3 SP acts as an agonist at the SP receptor SPR known as the neurokinin 1 receptor NK1 in mammalian systems SP activation of the SPR a G protein coupled receptor has a variety of effects in the nervous system including inhibition of the M type K current I M 4 The mechanistic properties of the SPR have been extensively studied in receptor expression systems When transfected into Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells activation of the SPR results in an increase in intracellular Ca 5 accumulation of inositol phosphates and cAMP formation 6 The recent development of intense photostable and pH insensitive fluorophores along with improvements in optical detection systems has led to fluorophore labeling of many pharmacological agents Fluorescent probes can be used to directly label ligand binding sites without the use of radioactivity or antibodies Receptor labeling with a fluorophore conjugated agonist provides advantages over these conventional methods The production of antibodies to the receptor protein is not required as the labeled agonist will bind directly to the receptor Fluorescence rather than radioactivity can detect the labeled ligand which provides more information on the localization of the receptor upon SP activation In addition labeled agonists can be used in live cells Therefore the use of fluorescently labeled agents may allow a more extensive investigation into various receptor functions Molecular Probes Inc Eugene OR has recently synthesized five fluorophore conjugated analogs of SP as potential tools for direct labeling of the SPR Alexa 488 BODIPY Fl fluorescein Oregon Green 488 and tetramethylrhodamine have been conjugated to the third amino acid of SP Lys 3 The amine group of Lys provides a convenient reactive group for labeling SP without altering its original amino acid sequence Alexa 488 BODIPY Fl fluorescein and Oregon Green 488 are green fluorophores while tetramethylrhodamine is a red fluorophore We have compared the receptor activation and labeling of five newly synthesized fluorescent analogs of SP Each of the probes has been tested for 1 ability to bind to the receptor 2 receptor activation in both a heterologous expression system and in native neurons and 3 fluorescence labeling of the receptor This study provides an extensive characterization of the new SP derivatives that will provide a basis for future studies involving the fluorescent conjugates Oregon Green 488 was found to be the most useful fluorophore for labeling SP without altering its biological activity whereas Alexa 488 drastically altered the binding and activation of SP Results Spectra properties of fluorescent analogs The fluorescent properties of a fluorophore can change when the fluorophore is attached to another molecule in this case a peptide Furthermore the conditions under which fluorescence is measured such as pH ionic strength and buffer composition can affect fluorescence The absorption and emission spectra of the fluorescent SP analogs were assessed to determine their fluorescence under experimental conditions used here As shown in Fig 2 the peak excitations of Alexa 488 SP BODIPY Fl SP fluorescein SP Oregon Green 488 SP and tetramethylrhodamine SP were 490 nm 505 nm 495 nm 495 nm and 560 nm respectively The peaks of the emission curves were 515 nm 510 nm 520 nm 520 nm and 575 nm respectively Epifluorescence microscopy Direct labeling of the SPR with fluorescent ligands like those analyzed in this study would offer advantages over current methods of receptor labeling Some of these advantages include the ability to label live cells and the ability to conduct receptor labeling without antibodies or radioactive ligands Therefore an important characteristic of the fluorescent SP analogs is their ability to bind to the SPR and to fluoresce under physiological conditions In order to observe the direct labeling of the SP conjugates to the SPR CHO cells expressing the rat SPR rSPR were incubated with the SP analogs 100 nM for 2 hrs at 4 C to prevent internalization of the receptor rinsed and fixed Under these conditions all of the labeled forms of SP except for Alexa 488 SP produced bright membrane staining Fig 3 Observation of transfected cells incubated with phosphate buffered saline PBS in the absence of labeled SP conjugate showed that the transfected cells had some intracellular auto fluorescence Fig 3 F The fluorophore treated cells also show some dull intracellular fluorescence similar to the auto fluorescence seen in the unstained control cells The intensity of the staining produced by the green fluorophores was compared by quantitative analysis The intensities of the fluorescence after staining with BODIPY Fl SP fluorescein SP and Oregon Green 488 SP were significantly greater p 0 0001 than the intensity of the fluorescence of cells treated with Alexa 488 SP Tetramethylrhodamine SP also produced intense membrane staining The intensity of the staining with tetramethylrhodamine SP could not be directly compared to the others due to its different excitation and emission wavelengths The specificity of the fluorescence staining was revealed by the finding that unlabeled SP effectively prevented the fluorescent staining of rSPR transfected CHO cells The fluorescence of these cells was similar to that of transfected cells incubated in PBS alone Fig 3 F in that they possessed some intracellular auto fluorescence but lacked membrane staining Application of the labeled analogs to untransfected CHO cells did not produce membrane staining data not shown Only intracellular auto fluorescence comparable to that observed with transfected cells incubated with PBS in the absence of labeled SP Fig 3 F was seen in cells lacking the rSPR SP receptor binding An important determinant of the usefulness of the SP conjugates is their ability to bind to and activate the SPR Therefore the ability of each of the fluorescent SP analogs to compete with 125I SP binding to the SPR was assessed using a heterologous expression system rSPR expressing CHO cells The results are shown in Fig 4 The concentration of fluorescent analog required to inhibit the binding of radiolabeled SP by 50 IC 50 was calculated from the binding studies The rank order of potency for the competing peptides was unlabeled SP 2 0 nM tetramethylrhodamine SP 4 2 nM Oregon Green 488 SP 6 4 nM BODIPY SP 18 0 nM fluorescein SP 44 5 nM Alexa 488 SP Alexa 488 SP Fig 4 A did not compete with 125I SP for binding at the rSPR therefore an IC 50 value could not be determined Two way analysis of variance followed by Student Newman Keuls test showed that there was a dose dependent effect p 0 001 on the binding of unlabeled SP and the SP analogs to the rSPR Statistical analysis also demonstrated that the competition binding curves generated by the SP conjugates were significantly different than the unlabeled SP binding curve p 0 001 Further analysis showed that with the exception of the binding curves produced by tetramethylrhodamine SP and Oregon Green 488 SP a significant difference was seen between the binding curves of the different SP conjugates p 0 05 Calcium measurements Activation of the SPR expressed in CHO cells results in an elevation in intracellular Ca 7 The biological activity of the SP conjugates was tested by examining their ability to elicit Ca elevations Dose response curves for the labeled SP analogs and for unlabeled SP to produce an increase in intracellular Ca in CHO cells transfected with the rSPR are shown in Fig 5 None of the labeled SP analogs produced Ca elevations n 3 when added to untransfected CHO cells at a concentration of 10 nM data not shown When the fluorescent derivatives were added at a concentration of 100 nM they produced an increase in the fluorescence signal due to the inherent fluorescence of the probes This could also be seen in the absence of cells Due to this interference the activity of the fluorescent probes to produce Ca elevations could not be tested at concentrations higher than 10 nM Alexa 488 SP produced the most prominent increase in non specific fluorescence in the absence of cells When 1 nM or 10 nM Alexa 488 SP was added the fluorophore produced signals similar in intensity to those observed when this analog was added to transfected or untransfected CHO cells data not shown To determine if Alexa 488 SP could specifically produce a receptor mediated Ca response the average of the fluorescence signal produced by Alexa 488 SP in the absence of cells was subtracted from the fluorescent signal obtained when Alexa 488 SP was added to SPR expressing CHO cells The results showed that Alexa 488 SP did not activate the SPR to produce a Ca response However the other four SP analogs were able to elicit Ca responses in rSPR expressing CHO cells Statistical analysis two way analysis of variance followed by Student Newman Keuls test demonstrated that unlabeled SP and the SP analogs except Alexa 488 SP elicited dose dependent Ca elevations p 0 001 Analysis also showed that there was not a significant difference p 0 05 in Ca elevations generated by unlabeled SP or the various SP conjugates with the exception of Alexa 488 SP which did not elicit a calcium response Effects of SP analogs on single neurons The data thus far show that the labeled forms of SP with the exception of Alexa 488 SP can bind to and activate the receptor in a heterologous expression system It is also of importance to determine the activity of the labeled ligands in a cell that endogenously expresses the SPR The principal neurons of bullfrog sympathetic ganglia express a SPR that has been well characterized with regard to its structure and function The bullfrog sympathetic ganglia SPR bfSPR has 69 homology to the rSPR at the amino acid level Perhaps most importantly nine of the ten residues that have been demonstrated to be important for SP binding to mammalian receptors are conserved in the bullfrog receptor The effects of SP and other tachykinins at the bfSPR have been previously well characterized 8 9 5 The primary biological response following activation of the ganglionic SPR is inhibition of the M type K current I M SP produces a dose dependent inhibition of I M 9 The responses of a given neuron to a given form of labeled SP have been compared to the responses of those same neurons to unlabeled SP at a concentration of 100 nM Fig 6 At this concentration SP typically elicits a 70 depression of I M BODIPY Fl SP and Oregon Green 488 SP produced an inhibition of I M similar to that of unlabeled SP Fluorescein SP was variable in its ability to inhibit the current being effective on only two of the four cells tested At a concentration of 100 nM neither Alexa 488 SP nor tetramethylrhodamine SP inhibited I M thus they were further tested at a concentration of 1 M At this concentration tetramethylrhodamine SP inhibited I M by 57 33 n 4 however Alexa 488 SP did not inhibit I M Dose response curves for the analogs that inhibited I M and for unlabeled SP are shown in the plots in Fig 6 A dose dependency was observed for the effects of BODIPY Fl SP fluorescein SP and Oregon Green 488 SP Discussion A number of previous studies have demonstrated that fluorescently labeled ligands are useful probes for studying ligand receptor interactions 10 11 12 Improved fluorophores better optics and the increased sensitivity of detection systems have led to an increased usage of fluorescently labeled ligands It is of vital importance that additions of fluorescent groups do not alter the normal functioning of the ligand for example by changing the binding affinity or by altering the receptor activation properties of the ligand If the fluorescent group does alter the properties of the ligand it is important that these alterations be understood so that the results obtained with the labeled ligand can be correctly interpreted In this study we have examined the fundamental consequences of labeling the neuropeptide SP with five different fluorescent probes by comparing the effects of the labeled compounds with those of the parent compound SP All five of the fluorescent probes were modified at the Lys 3position with aromatic groups Alexa 488 and tetramethylrhodamine add negative and positive charges respectively to SP The remaining fluorophores BODIPY Fl fluorescein and Oregon Green 488 do not alter the charge With regard to size BODIPY Fl is the smallest of the fluorophores added whereas Alexa 488 and tetramethylrhodamine are the largest of the fluorophores The most significant alteration of the activity of SP was produced when Alexa 488 was added to SP The experiments repeatedly showed that Alexa 488 SP does not posses the same characteristics as unlabeled SP Alexa 488 SP did not compete with 125I SP in the competition binding assay Consistent with the binding data this SP analog did not stain rSPR transfected CHO cells Furthermore Alexa 488 SP did not exhibit functional activity in two different assays It failed to elicit a Ca response in rSPR expressing CHO cells and failed to produce I M inhibition at the bfSPR both of which are characteristic effects mediated by SP Like Alexa 488 tetramethylrhodamine also adds a charge to SP but tetramethylrhodamine SP generated an IC 50 that was the most similar to that of unlabeled SP This SP analog also produced intense staining and typical Ca responses at the rSPR However tetramethylrhodamine SP was ineffective at inhibiting I M at a 100 nM concentration but did so upon increasing the concentration to 1 M Therefore tetramethylrhodamine SP is capable of binding to the SPR and activating Ca responses but has a decreased potency for inhibiting I M Lys 3of SP has been shown to interact with the NH 2 terminal extracellular tail residues 1 21 of the mouse SPR 13 Though residues 1 21 of the mouse SPR are primarily conserved in the rSPR only 5 of the 21 residues are conserved in the bullfrog SPR Given the importance of Lys 3in the mouse SPR it is therefore conceivable that an alteration in the charge of the parent compound SP as is the case with Alexa 488 SP and tetramethylrhodamine SP may cause a change in the typical actions of SP The addition of Alexa 488 causes a greater change in the charge of SP which might inhibit proper ligand receptor interaction and thus hinder binding of the SP analog to the SPR Tetramethylrhodamine also alters the charge of SP but unlike Alexa 488 the fluorophore is positively charged Perhaps the addition a single positive charge to SP by tetramethylrhodamine does not disrupt proper ligand receptor interactions as drastically as the multiple negative charges that Alexa 488 adds to SP Therefore the less drastic charge alteration made by tetramethylrhodamine may allow the mechanistic characteristics of SP to be preserved albeit with a decreased potency to inhibit I M Although the structure of fluorescein is very similar to that of Oregon Green 488 2 7 difluorofluorescein fluorescein SP did not behave in the same manner as Oregon Green 488 SP or unlabeled SP Of the conjugates that competed with 125I SP fluorescein SP had the lowest binding affinity as compared to unlabeled SP The analog was also variable in its ability to inhibit I M at the bfSPR However it consistently produced Ca elevations and membrane staining at the rSPR expressed in CHO cells BODIPY Fl SP and Oregon Green 488 SP produced inhibition of I M and Ca elevations similar to that produced by unlabeled SP Thus labeling with either of these two fluorophores did not alter the functional activity of SP at the SPR in either a heterologous expression system or native cells These SP analogs also brightly stained the membranes of rSPR transfected CHO cells The IC 50 values of BODIPY Fl SP and Oregon Green 488 SP in competition binding studies were greater than that of unlabeled SP When compared to unlabeled SP Oregon Green 488 SP and BODIPY FL SP had a two fold and ten fold increase in binding affinity respectively Interestingly neither BODIPY Fl nor Oregon Green 488 is charged It is interesting to note that although there was a significant difference between the binding curves of the fluorescent derivatives of SP and unlabeled SP there was not a statistically significant in the peptides ability to produce dose dependent Ca elevations These might be explained by the differences in the mechanisms that underlie the measurements made in the different experiments The binding experiments measure the actions of the peptides at the receptor Ca fluxes indicate additional mechanisms downstream of the receptor including second messenger activation The data may reflect the fact that receptor binding and signal activation are not strictly correlated in G protein coupled systems The evidence presented here suggests that four of the analogs BODIPY Fl SP fluorescein SP Oregon Green 488 SP and tetramethylrhodamine SP are acting specifically at the SPR Binding analysis showed that the above conjugates compete with 125I SP at the rSPR These four analogs only produced Ca responses in cells transfected with the SPR they had no effect in non transfected cells Similarly membrane staining was observed in transfected CHO cells but not in untransfected cells Molecular Probes introduced and investigated seven Alexa dyes including Alexa 488 and reported that the dyes were more fluorescent and more photostable than their counterparts 14 In their study Alexa 488 was compared to fluorescein The investigators conjugated the Alexa fluorophores and other similar compounds such as fluorescein to different proteins to compare brightness and stability They showed that Alexa 488 was brighter and more stable than fluorescein when conjugated to biotin binding proteins goat anti mouse IgG and its F ab 2 fragments However they did not test for alterations in binding affinities or biological activity after the addition of the fluorophores Another study has examined the effects of fluorescent conjugation on opioid peptide activity 15 Alexa 488 and BODIPY TR were used to label dermorphin deltrophin TIPP Try Tic Phe Phe and endomorphin by adding a cysteine to each peptide at the C terminus followed by conjugation of the fluorophores to the cysteine residue The investigators found that the dermorphin and deltorphin analogs had an increased binding affinity for the and opioid receptors respectively and that the biological activities of parent compounds were preserved However when Alexa 488 was conjugated to TIPP and endomorphin the binding affinities of the parent compounds were decreased Buku et al 16 synthesized two fluorescent probes for the vasotocin receptor using fluorescein and tetramethylrhodamine These investigators had previously conjugated the fluorophores to the seventh position of vasotocin a nonapeptide and found that it had biological activity but that the biological activity was reduced when compared to the native compound 17 Therefore the investigators conjugated the fluorophores to the ninth position and found that the analog was 10 fold more potent than the analog with the fluorophores at the seventh position Thus they concluded that by moving the bulky fluorophore to the end of vasotocin and not altering an amino acid involved in binding and activation of the vasotocin receptor minimized the reduction in biological activity of the probes In summary our results along with those from other labs show that in some cases conjugation of a specific fluorescent label can be added to a peptide without altering the activity of the parent compound In other cases however the activity of the original compound may be drastically altered Therefore the biological activity of each novel fluorophore conjugate must be analyzed Analysis of labeled compounds should include assessment of binding and biological activity as well as brightness and stability Conclusions The results of our study show that there are dramatic differences in the function of SP labeled at the Lys 3position with different fluorophores Alexa 488 which was the largest and added the most charged groups to SP was unable to label the SPR and altered the biological activity of SP in live and cultured cells Oregon Green 488 and BODIPY Fl which are smaller and uncharged appear to be the most useful fluorophores for labeling SP without altering the normal functions of SP at the SPR regardless of the expression system These results suggest that Oregon Green 488 SP and BODIPY Fl SP would be the most useful fluorescent ligands for future studies of the SPR Materials and Methods Labeled peptides SP labeled with Alexa 488 S 13426 BODIPY Fl S 13425 fluorescein S 13424 Oregon Green 488 S 13427 or

Fluorophore spectral analysis was performed on a Perkin Elmer 512 Spectrofluorometer Foster City CA Alexa 488 SP BODIPY Fl SP fluorescein SP Oregon Green 488 SP and tetramethylrhodamine SP were analyzed at a concentration of 10 nM using PBS pH 7 4 as a solvent Epifluorescence microscopy CHO cells stably transfected with the cDNA of the rSPR were obtained from Dr James Krause and maintained as previously described 18 Transfected CHO cells were cultured overnight on 3 well HTC super cured glass slides Cel Line Associates Inc Newfield NJ The following day the slides were rinsed with PBS Two of the three wells from each slide were stained with 100 nM of one of the SP conjugates The third well of each slide served as a negative control in that the cells were incubated with PBS in the absence of a SP analog Slides were incubated for 2 hrs at 4 C to prevent internalization of the receptor and thus provide membrane staining The cells were then rinsed and fixed with paraformaldehyde 2 Fisher Scientific Pittsburgh PA at 4 C for 20 min Slides were viewed under a Nikon Eclipse E600FN fluorescent microscope Fryer Company Inc Cincinnati OH The green fluorophores were excited using a FITC fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set excitation 465 495 nm dichroic 505LP emission 515 555 nm The red fluorophore was excited using a TRITC tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate filter set excitation 528 553 nm dichroic 565LP emission 600 660 nm Pictures were taken with a SPOT camera Diagnostic Instruments Inc Sterling Heights MI All digital images of the green fluorophores were taken at a constant gain 16 and exposure time 0 7 s to allow for direct comparison between cells and experiments Pictures of tetramethylrhodamine SP the red fluorophore were taken at a gain of 8 and a 0 4 s exposure time The specificity of the fluorescent staining to the rSPR was analyzed in two ways First incubating untransfected CHO cells with 100 nM of each analog assessed non specific staining Secondly staining of rSPR transfected CHO cells was performed in the presence of an excess of unlabeled SP Transfected cells were pretreated with 1 M unlabeled SP for 1 hr at 4 C Then the cells were rinsed and incubated with 1 M unlabeled SP and 100 nM labeled SP for 1 hr at 4 C The cells were rinsed fixed and viewed as described above Image Analysis Epifluorescence images from the wells containing only conjugated SP 100 nM were analyzed using Scion Image Scion Corporation Frederick MD For each fluorophore except tetramethylrhodamine a line was drawn around the outside of the cell membrane of 10 cells 5 cells experiment to create a boundary the area and pixel intensity were then measured within each boundary Background as determined by measuring the intensity and area of 10 control cells incubated with PBS in the absence of a fluorophore was subtracted Cell area was used to normalize between cells thus the ratio of intensity to area was calculated for the treated and untreated cells Receptor binding Radioligand competition binding assays utilizing CHO cells stably expressing the rSPR were performed with Bolton Hunter 125I SP NEN Boston MA at a concentration of 50 pM Fluorescein SP Alexa 488 SP BODIPY Fl SP fluorescein SP Oregon Green 488 SP or tetramethylrhodamine SP was added at increasing concentrations from 100 pM to 1 M to compete with the 125I SP In order to reach equilibrium rSPR expressing CHO cells 100 000 cells well were incubated in a pre wetted Millipore Multiscreen 96 well BV filtration plate France with both radiolabeled and fluorescently labeled SP at 4 C for 2 hrs Peptides and cells were prepared in Tris Buffered Saline Binding Buffer 50 mM Tris 120 mM NaCl 0 2 mg ml bacitracin 20 g ml leupeptin 20 g ml chymostatin 0 1 bovine serum albumin pH 7 4 Following incubation cells were filtered and washed using a Millipore vacuum manifold France Filters were punched and analyzed using a Packard Cobra II series auto gamma counter Meriden CT to determine counts per minute cpm Non specific binding was specified as the counts obtained with 1 M unlabeled SP in the presence of radiolabeled SP Statistical analysis showed that there was not a significant difference between the fluorescent conjugates and unlabeled SP when 1 M of SP or its derivatives was present with 50 pM 125I SP In each experiment specific binding was determined by subtracting nonspecific binding from the original cpm measurements The data were normalized by calculating B B o for each fluorophore where B is the cpm of 125I SP specifically bound in the presence of non radioactive SP and B o is the cpm of 125I SP specifically bound in the presence of 100 pM fluorescently labeled SP The data were plotted as a function of competitor concentration vs B B o Sigmoidal Hill 3 parameter regression was then performed on the data to determine the IC 50 the concentration of fluorescent analog required to inhibit the binding of radiolabeled SP by 50 for each SP analog Calcium measurements Dose response curves for the ability of the SP analogs to produce Ca elevations upon binding to the SPR were obtained as previously described 5 Briefly transfected CHO cells expressing the rSPR were cultured onto coverslips until 90 confluent The coverslips were incubated in a Ca free solution containing fura PE3 AM and pluronic acid Texas Fluorescence Labs Austin TX for 30 min washed then incubated in a Ca containing solution for 30 min A CAF 110 Intracellular Ion Analyzer Jasco Corp Tokyo Japan was used to measure the fura PE3 fluorescence emission Cytosolic Ca concentrations were measured by taking the ratio of fluorescence emission at 510 nm by excitation at 340 and 380 nm Dose response curves were obtained by measuring the Ca responses produced by adding various concentrations 1 pM 100 nM 1 nM and 10 nM of the labeled probes Ionomycin Sigma St Louis MO was added at a concentration of 10 M at the end of each experiment to obtain the maximal Ca elevation for that coverslip Ca responses were measured by subtracting the peak of each response from the baseline Responses are expressed as a fraction of the ionomycin maximum response Two experiments were carried out to serve as negative controls In the first control experiment untransfected CHO cells were utilized to determine if any of the SP conjugates were eliciting Ca responses through a pathway independent of rSPR activation Each of the SP isoforms was added to untransfected CHO cells at a concentration of 10 nM and the signals if any were recorded If a SP conjugate caused an increase in Ca at 10 nM then 0 1 and 1 nM concentrations for that fluorophore were also tested The second control experiment measured fluorescence produced by the SP analogs themselves in the absence of cells Each of the SP fluorophores was added to the Ca solution in the absence of cells at a concentration of 10 nM and increases in fluorescence if any were recorded If a response was observed at a 10 nM concentration then 0 1 and 1 nM concentrations were also tested for that SP analog If a SP analog produced a Ca elevation in either control assay then the average n of 3 for the differences between the baseline and peak Ca signals for that concentration was calculated The average was then subtracted from the Ca responses observed when that SP analog was added to transfected and untransfected CHO cells at that concentration Electrophysiology Single neurons were dissociated from bullfrog sympathetic ganglia as described previously 19 Briefly ganglia were dissected treated with enzymes and then stored in growth medium at 4 C for 1 to 3 days The ganglia were triturated to release single neurons for daily use Whole cell recordings of isolated neurons were conducted at room temperature 21 C Drugs were applied by single cell superfusion 20 and the bath constantly perfused separately with extracellular solution Whole cell recordings were made with electrodes with

The I M relaxations were sampled on line at 2 4 kHz I M was measured as the amplitude of the current tail following a voltage step from 50 mV to 30 mV 21 To quantify the inhibition of I M the current before drug and at the maximum inhibition during each response were measured and the percentage of inhibition of I M was calculated Statistical Analysis The percent of ionomycin data from the Ca elevation experiments and the B B 0 data from the binding experiments were both subjected to two way ANOVA analysis with the independent variables being fluorescent conjugate and dose One way ANOVA analysis was used to describe the intensity to area measurements from the fluorescent images except tetramethylrhodamine These data like the data obtained from the binding assay and Ca analysis were analyzed for variance followed by the Student Newman Keuls test
