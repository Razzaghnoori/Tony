 Where to Go Many Californians would like to divide their state into two new states Northern and Southern California corresponding to what they believe to be two distinct frames of mind as represented by San Francisco and Los Angeles In fact you will find a little bit of both San Francisco s sophistication and Los Angeles sunny craziness all over the place Our journey begins with San Francisco and its nearby attractions and works its way down the coast to Los Angeles and San Diego before heading inland to the mountains and deserts of the Sierra Nevada and Death Valley You can turn this itinerary upside down if you prefer but either way you should also consider making an excursion to Las Vegas California s favorite out of state playground You can get to almost all these places by train or bus and air travel is quite cheap However the car is king and it s difficult to enjoy the full scope of this vast and varied landscape without driving San Francisco is unusual for California in that it is a walker s town with buses and cable cars to help you up and down the hills Los Angeles is undeniably car country though it is trying to alleviate its congestion and pollution by building a light rail network Out of town attractions such as the national parks and especially Death Valley are most easily reached by car although once there it s more rewarding to leave your vehicle behind and explore on foot San Francisco San Franciscans are quite unashamedly in love with their town Its natural setting nestled in the hills around the bay makes the city uncommonly cozy the zip in the air is invigorating and even the fog that rolls in off the ocean seems more romantic than chilling If you have a car one way to begin your visit is to travel along 49 Mile Drive which provides a comprehensive tour of the main sights You ll need to use a good map as the blue signposts with a white seagull in the center can be difficult to locate Stop off at Twin Peaks the road to get there starts near the southern end of Market Street for an excellent panoramic view of the city and the bay then park the car put on a pair of comfortable walking shoes and take to the city s first class public transport system see page 120 Start at the bridge The city has more than one but the one is of course the Golden Gate Bridge The name Golden Gate was given to the city s harbor entrance in 1846 by Captain John Fr mont but the mile wide channel lay unspanned until the bridge a masterpiece of engineering by Joseph Strauss was completed in 1937 At 4 200 ft 1 280 m it was the world s longest single span until New York s Verrazano Narrows Bridge surpassed it in 1964 but few would deny that it remains the most beautiful suspension bridge in the world It took four years and 35 million to build more than 40 million vehicles now cross over the span every year You can take a bus to the bridge entrance and then walk across it s just as exciting an urban adventure as climbing up the Eiffel Tower or the Empire State Building The bridge trembles underneath your feet and the lamp posts rattle as the wind whistles through swooping cables But don t worry the 746 ft 227 m high towers are well embedded in earthquake proof foundations Visible in the distance is the San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge known locally as just the Bay Bridge This silver gray structure swings across to Oakland via two suspension spans a cantilever span and a tunnel through Treasure Island It s the bridge you ll take to go to Berkeley see page 40 and is one of the routes to the wine country of Napa and Sonoma see page 41 Beneath the south end of the Golden Gate is Fort Point National Historic Site the site of the brick fort built in 1857 to protect the entrance to the harbor You can now watch surfers brave the waves here The fort lies within the grounds of the 1 480 acre 597 hectare Presidio a former army post that was converted to civilian use in 1994 You can stroll down to the yacht harbor along Marina Boulevard which fronts a mile long walkway popular with joggers On your way you ll pass the Palace of Fine Arts a restored relic of the Panama Pacific International Exposition The building s Greco Romanesque rotunda contrasts with the technological wizardry inside the Exploratorium a modern hands on science museum with changing exhibits that feature all kinds of natural phenomena The great age of sail is commemorated along the Hyde Street Pier by the majestic lines of the square rigged ship Balclutha and the many other exhibits of the National Maritime Museum The museum can be reached from downtown by way of the Powell Hyde cable car line The other main cable car route the Powell Mason line terminates at one of San Francisco s and California s most popular sights Fisherman s Wharf Geared more today toward tourists than fishing the area offers a dozen or more seafood restaurants as well as garish knick knack shops and sweatshirt emporiums Seafood stands line the wharfside though the fish is very likely to be imported and there are two shopping centers Ghirardelli Square a converted red brick former chocolate factory there are good free concerts summer weekends and The Cannery once a fruit processing plant The ferry to Alcatraz leaves from Pier 41 at the east end of the wharf Pier 39 consists of two levels of open air shopping and snacking an arcade and of course the famous sea lions who lounge and argue on platforms all day long to the delight of the crowds Just follow the barking noises Alcatraz Of the many cruises you can take on San Francisco Bay the most entertaining is a trip to the abandoned prison island of Alcatraz The name is a distortion of the Spanish Isla de Alcatraces Pelican Island National Park Rangers offer informative and witty self guided audio tours around the former home of Al Capone as well as other convicts such as Robert Stroud the famous Birdman of Alcatraz A 12 acre 4 8 hectare rock with no cultivable soil all the earth and water for the shrubs and trees here had to be shipped in by the US Army for whom it had been a disciplinary barracks until 1934 Separated from mainland San Francisco by 11 2 miles 2 4 km of treacherous ice cold water haunted by sharks and dangerous currents it was the ideal location for America s most notorious federal penitentiary However it proved enormously expensive to run and was closed down in 1963 You will see what maximum security minimum privilege meant for Alcatraz s 300 inmates each one alone in a tiny cell with three 20 minute recreation periods each day There were luxuries hot showers so that inmates would be unable to acclimatize themselves to cold water and survive the chilly waters of San Francisco Bay as well as remarkably good food One inmate returning for the guided tour surprisingly some do out of nostalgia said the food was better than he had eaten in many San Francisco hotels The prisoners named the cell rows after elegant streets of America such as New York s Park Avenue L A s Sunset Boulevard and Michigan Avenue in Chicago The gangster Al Capone s cell was on B Block 2nd tier number 200 The Hills There are around 40 of them and they re steep it s been said that if you get tired walking around San Francisco you can just lean against it but you don t have to tackle them all on foot A tour of Nob Hill from California Street or by Powell Hyde cable car Telegraph Hill bus and Russian Hill Powell Hyde cable car will give you a good sense of the past and present splendors of San Francisco s more wealthy residents The cable cars were installed in 1873 by British born engineer Andrew Hallidie one of the originals can still be seen in the fascinating Cable Car Barn and Museum at Washington and Mason streets which is also the system s working powerhouse The hand made cars are the city s best loved attraction and the system was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964 The monumental Victorian houses of Nob Hill home of the nobs possibly a derivation of nabobs burned down in the 1906 earthquake and only the imposing brownstone house of James Flood now the very exclusive Pacific Union Club survived Sadly you won t be able to get in but you can loiter with appropriate decorum in the area s two landmark hotels the Fairmont and the Mark Hopkins both at the top of California Street The panoramic view from the bars in the Crown Room or the Top of the Mark is well worth the stiff price of a drink Grace Cathedral at the corner of California and Jones is not an especially happy neo Gothic effort but it is worth a look in passing for its Ghiberti doors bronze reproductions of the Baptistery East Doors in Florence a remarkable example of San Francisco s continuing romance with Europe You may also be impressed by the 12 stained glass windows dedicated to Human Endeavor depicting among others Albert Einstein Frank Lloyd Wright Franklin D Roosevelt and Henry Ford Russian Hill is less opulent than Nob Hill but the gardens and immaculate little cottages of this fashionable residential area make it far more appealing The roller coaster dips and crests of the city s hills breaking up the monotony of the standard grid system of streets reach a crazy climax on Lombard Street between Hyde and Leavenworth After you ve negotiated all eight hairpin bends lined with gardens of hydrangeas you re not going to quibble about the claim that it s the crookedest street in the world Two blocks south is Filbert Street boasting the steepest slope a stomach churning 31 5 percent gradient with no bends It is worth climbing to the top of Telegraph Hill for the view of the bay from the top of Coit Tower built in 1934 to honor the city s fire department One of San Francisco s many landmarks its shape is not meant to resemble the nozzle of a fire hose as is so often reported Inside you will find Socialist Realist murals depicting Life in California 1934 Take a look at the cottages and gardens around the Greenwich Steps clinging to the steep slope overlooking the bay this is one of the city s most desirable addresses Downtown Market Street forms the main axis of San Francisco s city center and halfway along at the Powell Street cable car terminus is the San Francisco Visitors Information Center see page 123 where you can pick up a free map before you set off to explore the surrounding area A few blocks along Powell Street is Union Square the heart of downtown s shopping and theater district Here you can browse in specialty shops fashionable boutiques and department stores such as the famous Macy s Head down to Montgomery Street the heart of San Francisco s financial district also known as the Wall Street of the West This area was founded on the profits of the 1849 Gold Rush see page 16 and is now bristling with skyscrapers of chrome and glass Take a look at the Old Coin and Gold Exhibit at the Bank of California 400 California Street with its collection of gold coins and currency or the Wells Fargo History Room in the Wells Fargo Bank 420 Montgomery Street which displays Gold Rush memorabilia including one of the original Wells Fargo stagecoaches You re not likely to miss the Transamerica Pyramid a 853 ft 256 m tall building with a 212 ft 64 m spike at the corner of Montgomery and Washington It s one of those buildings that purists start off hating because it clashes with the spirit of San Francisco and then defend in the next generation as the very epitome of its age If it s time for lunch or dinner head to Belden Alley between Bush Pine Kearny and Montgomery streets where you ll find an entire block of excellent restaurants all with outdoor seating Walk the few blocks uphill to Grant Street and suddenly you re in Chinatown This compact district has evolved from a ghetto imposed on the Chinese in the 19th century by the city s founders into a local economic and political force There are more than 150 000 Chinese living in the city making it the second largest Chinese community outside of Asia New York s is first Chinatown is bounded by Broadway Bush Kearny and Stockton with the eight blocks along Grant Avenue making up its colorful center At the Bush Street end of Grant Avenue you will enter Chinatown through the ornamental Chinatown Gate The shops restaurants and street signs all have an English translation beside the Chinese characters for the benefit of tourists but the banks travel agencies and law offices don t always make the same concession Not that you won t see the influence of American culture in institutions such as the Catholic St Mary s Chinese School at Clay and Stockton or in the neo Gothic Old St Mary s Church Portsmouth Square between Clay and Washington streets was the city s original town square where Sam Brannan announced the discovery of gold in 1848 see page 16 But what really grabs your attention is the chatter of Chinese voices the crowds the color the smells of five spice and dried shrimp it s a little corner of Hong Kong right in the middle of California At Columbus Avenue Chinatown spills over into North Beach a Little Italy of caf s bakeries restaurants grocery stores and coffee houses This lively neighborhood the center of the Italian community was once the focus of the city s intellectual and artistic life From the days when the poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti gathered fellow Beats around his City Lights Bookstore during the 1950s North Beach has been a hangout for the bohemian literary crowd City Lights 261 Columbus Avenue open daily until midnight opened in 1953 and was America s first paperback bookshop It s still going strong today Once you ve bought your copy of On the Road cross Jack Kerouac Street and settle down with your purchase over a drink at Vesuvio s another famous literary hangout Or if it s a sunny day buy a sandwich from a delicatessen and enjoy a picnic on Washington Square a splash of green overlooked by the white spires of the Church of Saints Peter and Paul where Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio were married in 1954 The area around the south end of Columbus Avenue was once known as the Barbary Coast a seedy and boisterous waterfront district with sailors on shore leave haunting the bars and brothels while their captains shanghaied drunken civilians to make up lost crew The Barbary Coast was burned down after the Great Earthquake of 1906 but its tawdry tradition lives on in the now ever dwindling number of topless bars and strip clubs along Broadway Rather more highbrow entertainment is on offer in the angle between Market Street and Van Ness Avenue where there is a sprawling complex of municipal state and federal buildings known collectively as the Civic Center It was initiated during a burst of city planning after the 1906 earthquake and the early structures note especially the black and gold domed recently renovated City Hall form the finest grouping of French Renaissance style architecture in the country Opposite City Hall are the twin fa ades of the Veterans Building and the War Memorial Opera House where in 1945 the United Nations Charter was signed plus the curved glass front of the Louise M Davies Symphony Hall home of the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra The district to the south of Market Street was once an area of slums warehouses and railroad yards but redevelopment combined with low rents have gentrified the area SoMa as it is known short for South of Market is now home to the lovely Yerba Buena Gardens Moscone Convention Center Sony Metreon entertainment shopping complex and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art The surrounding streets have become the focus for restaurants nightlife and many an Internet start up Golden Gate Park Escape from the downtown skyscrapers by taking the number 5 Fulton Street bus to Golden Gate Park The park was once a wasteland of sand dunes and scrub but it was then transformed into lush parkland by the efforts of John McLaren the park superintendent for 50 years until his death in 1943 Today the park is a delightful landscape of woods rhododendron groves small lakes and hills with an arboretum botanic gardens sports fields bicycle routes riding stables buffalo paddock and hiking trails At the eastern end there s a wonderful children s playground and the Conservatory of Flowers a Victorian glasshouse from Britain that remains in disrepair after a particularly violent storm a few years ago Beyond the park lies the Haight Ashbury neighborhood famous as the scene of the 1960s Summer of Love when thousands of flower children flocked into the city Today you are more likely to spot yuppies than hippies shopping in the clothing boutiques and record stores although a number of homeless youth and posturing teens hang out on the sidewalks seeking spare change For a guided tour of the high points check out the 2 hour Haight Ashbury Flower Power Walking Tour offered Tuesdays and Saturdays at 9 30am Tel 415 221 8442 Situated within the park are three major museums clustered around the Music Concourse The M H de Young Memorial Museum has an impressive selection of African Art and of works by Titian El Greco and Rembrandt However it is better known for its outstanding collection of North American art from 1670 to the 20th century The Asian Art Museum next door exhibits over 10 000 magnificent art treasures donated to San Francisco in 1966 by Avery Brundage it will relocate to the old public library building in 2001 Across the way you will find the California Academy of Sciences housing an excellent natural history museum an aquarium and a planetarium The western end of the park boasts two turn of the century windmills that overlook the surf at Ocean Beach Chilly water and dangerous currents make this more a beach for strollers sunbathers and experienced surfers swimming is sternly discouraged The northern end of the beach is overlooked by the Cliff House The present building was built in 1909 and now houses restaurants serving breakfast lunch and dinner the food isn t highly recommended a bar drinks at sunset are a better idea and the Mus e M canique one of the largest privately owned collections of old fashioned coin operated arcade novelties in the world Admission is free but a pocketful of quarters will be useful There is also a fine view of Seal Rocks and on a clear day you can see as far as the Farallon Islands lying 30 miles 48 km offshore The Bay Area and Beyond The City of San Francisco covers only about 46 square miles 119 sq km at the tip of its peninsula but its suburbs and satellite communities with a population of 6 million spread all around the bay The Bay Area as it is known includes the Peninsula to the south with the cities of Palo Alto and San Jose the computer industry heartland of Silicon Valley and the fourth largest city in California the East Bay across the Bay Bridge which includes Oakland and the university town of Berkeley and Marin County San Francisco s wealthiest suburb with its mountains forests and pretty villages Further north lie the wine growing regions of the Napa and Sonoma valleys Marin County Immediately north of San Francisco are two charming waterfront towns Sausalito and Tiburon which you can reach either by driving across the Golden Gate Bridge or by taking a ferry from the Ferry Building at the foot of Market Street or Pier 41 near Fisherman s Wharf Tiburon is the quieter of the two while Sausalito is more of a tourist trap but both have a colorful Mediterranean atmosphere with art galleries yacht harbors craft shops and pleasant bistros and caf s out on the boardwalk overlooking the bay Farther inland is the woodsy residential paradise of Mill Valley and behind it rises the 2 604 ft 794 m summit of Mount Tamalpais The mountain bike was invented here in the 1970s and there are plenty of hiking and biking trails but if you re feeling lazy you can drive along the Panoramic Highway to within a few hundred yards of the summit The view from the top is memorable across the bay to the city and then beyond to Mount Diablo and on a clear day you might even catch a glimpse of the beautiful Sierra Nevada mountains Highway 1 twists through the hills to the coast past the Muir Woods National Monument named after John Muir the Scots born environmentalist who founded California s conservation movement at the turn of the 19th century The park protects several groves of magnificent coastal redwoods some of which are 250 ft 76 m tall and over 1 000 years old Hiking trails wind among the giant trees The highway continues on to Point Reyes National Seashore a large wilderness park on the coast complete with beautiful rolling hills sandy bays and exciting wild surf

among the finest in the world There are more than 250 vineyards or wineries as they are called and most of them offer guided tours and tastings Some of the more interesting wineries to visit are Mondavi Beringer Sterling and Beaulieu in Napa and Matanzas Creek and Benzinger in Sonoma You can drive to the vineyards from San Francisco via Interstate 80 across the Bay Bridge but bus tours are also available through the major providers You can also arrange a custom tour visiting wineries of your choice through Wine Country Jeep Tours Tel 800 539 5337 toll free in US The Napa Valley Wine Train is another option for a scenic hands off chug through the valley including lunch or dinner but no winery visits A note of warning The entire region and particularly the Napa Valley is inundated with visitors all year round especially on weekends You would be well advised to book lodging dining and even tours ahead of time The Central Coast Highway 1 runs for 400 miles 643 km south from San Francisco to L A along a coastline of often spectacular beauty First stop for most tourists is the Monterey Peninsula a wave battered coast of gnarled cypress trees and jagged rocks and the home of sea lions pelicans and otters The principal town here is Monterey the old Spanish and Mexican capital of Alta Upper California Monterey Bay was discovered in 1542 but it wasn t settled until much later when Father Jun pero Serra set up a mission in 1769 Serra s statue looks down on the bay from Corporal Ewin Road The town is proud of its past and offers a self guided tour of all the Old Town s historic 19th century buildings Look out for the Larkin House at Jefferson and Calle Principal home of the first and only United States Consul in the 1840s as well as the Stevenson House 530 Houston Street where the Scottish writer Robert Louis Stevenson lived for four months after his arrival in California in 1879 Some think that the nearby coastline around Point Lobos provided the inspiration for the setting of his famous adventure novel Treasure Island On Church Street you ll find the site of Father Serra s original adobe church Rebuilt in 1795 it is now the Royal Presidio Chapel or Cathedral of San Carlos de Borromeo By the waterfront is the Customs House Plaza with the Maritime Museum as well as the Old Custom House 1827 where the American flag was raised by Commodore John Sloat in 1846 when he claimed Monterey for the United States Beside the Plaza is Monterey s Fisherman s Wharf Like San Francisco s it is a collection of souvenir shops and restaurants on the dock offering a great view across the boats in the marina The fish on sale is most definitely fresh but alas no longer abundant enough to keep Cannery Row going as more than a weather beaten curiosity The famous sardine fisheries finally closed down in the 1940s as a result of over fishing but the waterfront district of timbered canneries immortalized by the novelist John Steinbeck as a poem a stink a grating noise a quality of light a tone a habit a nostalgia has found a new lease on life today as a tourist attraction with souvenir shops delightful cozy boutiques and artists studios One old cannery building has been splendidly converted to the Monterey Bay Aquarium one of the premier aquariums in the world as well as an educational showcase for the unique underwater environment of Monterey Bay The centerpiece is the stunning 30 ft 10 m deep Kelp Forest Tank a window on California s most important marine habitat Kids will love the Sea Otter Pool and the Touch Pools where they can both handle and learn about sea anemones crabs and even bat rays The 17 Mile Drive is a lovely scenic toll road starting at Lighthouse Avenue in Pacific Grove a pleasant waterside town of Victorian houses and clapboard cottages a few miles beyond Monterey The drive passes through beautiful cypress groves along a wild and rocky coastline where you can watch birds otters and sea lions in the wild before passing through the famous golf courses at Pebble Beach and finally reaching the exclusive resort town of Carmel by the Sea famous for once having Clint Eastwood as mayor It is a quaint picture postcard village full of kitschy cottages with narrow tree lined streets crammed with expensive restaurants art galleries and craft shops At the foot of Ocean Avenue lies the beautiful white sand of Carmel Beach backed by shady pines and cypress trees Southeast of the town is the peaceful Carmel Mission where Father Jun pero Serra himself lies buried At Point Lobos State Reserve you can hike right down to the ocean s edge Watch especially for the playful sea otters which can often be seen floating on their backs munching on a juicy abalone or two From December to March look out also for pods of migrating gray whales The coastal highway south from Carmel to Big Sur is only 30 miles 48 km long but it takes more than an hour of careful driving Squeezed in between the Pacific and the Santa Lucia mountains the road twists and turns along a quite narrow ledge hacked out high above the pounding surf with spectacular bridges spanning the deep canyons The numerous state parks along the Big Sur coast offer marvelous opportunities for outdoor activities like camping hiking and fishing The writer Henry Miller made his home here during the 1950s and 60s and communities of artists continue to live in cabins in the woods and canyons At Nepenthe Orson Welles built a honeymoon cottage for Rita Hayworth in the days when film stars did the romantic things expected of them by their adoring public Now it has been expanded and converted into a restaurant well worth a visit for its incomparable view of the ocean The rugged coast continues south for another 65 miles 105 km along to San Simeon where William Randolph Hearst the newspaper magnate immortalized by Orson Welles in the film Citizen Kane built his unbelievable dream castle on a hilltop high above the sea Hearst Castle now forms the centerpiece of the Hearst San Simeon State Historical Monument and is one of the most popular attractions in all California guided tours only Allow at least two hours for a tour you can book one at the Visitor Center but it s advisable to make an advance reservation especially during the summer by phoning Destinet at 800 444 4445 group tours 800 401 4775 both toll free in US William Randolph Hearst 1863 1951 was a millionaire newspaper baron He began building this grandiose retreat in 1919 on a ranch that he had inherited from his father who made his fortune mining Nevada s Comstock Lode It was still not completed by the time of Hearst s death in 1951 Here he entertained the movie star Marion Davies his mistress for 30 years and famous guests such as Charlie Chaplin Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald Greta Garbo Winston Churchill Charles Lindbergh and the photographer Herman Mankiewicz who recorded life at San Simeon for posterity You approach Hearst Castle on a tour bus that climbs the 5 miles 8 km from the Visitor Center to the hilltop passing through the parkland that was once Hearst s private zoo The lions monkeys cheetahs kangaroos and polar bears are long gone but zebra goats and Barbary sheep can still be seen The San Francisco architect Julia Morgan built the castle to Hearst s specifications as a showcase for his extraordinary collection of European art The truly mind boggling variety of that collection begins to register as you pass the 104 ft 32 m long Roman mosaic swimming pool complete with Greek colonnade and a copy of Donatello s Florentine statue of David The main building and its four surrounding guest houses with their terraces and gardens is a fantasy concoction derived from Greek Roman Gothic Baroque and Spanish styles with both fake and original artwork thrown together Genuine Spanish tilework sits beside locally made copies a Roman sarcophagus and a 3 500 year old Egyptian goddess are both authentic but the castle s fa ade with its equestrian friezes on the balcony and Gothic style canopies is made almost completely of reinforced concrete Above the huge main door in quiet simplicity sits a genuine 13th century Madonna and Child Inside the castle the hodgepodge of periods and styles runs riot The dining room has a magnificent cedarwood coffered ceiling from a Bologna monastery and is decorated with the flags from the Sienna palio pageant At the table set for 22 guests Hearst s dilettantism is emphasized by the sight of splendid solid silver Queen Anne candlesticks and wine cisterns which are set beside tomato ketchup pickles and mustard all in their original bottles and jars Beyond San Simeon the rugged coastline begins to relent and farms and oil rigs take the place of crags and canyons Rural Route 1 joins the multi lane US Highway 101 at San Luis Obispo for the final leg to Los Angeles but two places are worth a detour from the freeway The city of Lompoc Route 135 and Route 1 from Santa Maria sits prettily among the fields of flowers that have made it the Flower Growing Capital of the World On the edge of town is La Pur sima Mission founded in 1787 and rebuilt in 1813 after an earthquake It is the most extensively and authentically restored of California s 21 Franciscan missions and the old pink and white adobe walls provide a haven of peace amid the former living and working quarters of missionaries soldiers and Native Americans The garden is full of olive and mulberry trees and livestock such as burros turkeys and four horned churro sheep all contribute to the 1820s atmosphere When you get to Santa Barbara you know for sure that you ve arrived in Southern California Its palm fringed streets red tile pavements and low rise Spanish Revival buildings spread up the hillsides from the beautiful beach oozing sun tanned health and the scent of money It s a favorite weekend retreat for many of Los Angeles wealthier residents On State Street which runs from the beach up through the center of town you ll find a thriving downtown filled with stores theaters and restaurants In particular take a peek at the Arlington Theater the inside was designed to mimic a Spanish style courtyard at dusk including a star filled sky There s history on display too at Mission Santa Barbara corner of Laguna and Mission streets The mission which was founded on 4 December 1786 the Feast of St Barbara offers a self guided tour of its restored church and outbuildings Also worth a visit is the beautiful Santa Barbara County Courthouse a magnificent Spanish Moorish style edifice dating from 1927 Los Angeles Los Angeles is the quintessential 20th century city Only modern technology could have turned this former patch of desert into one of the world s most flourishing metropolises A combination of engineering genius and shady business deals brought water hundreds of miles across mountains and desert to slake the city s thirst and nurture its lush gardens and palm trees An abundance of space then allowed the city to sprawl but distance was no problem cheap oil and the car produced a vast freeway system which links the coast the hills and the farthest flung valleys in one huge metropolitan region Visitors flying into L A at night get a grand view of the network of traffic arteries with cars and trucks surging along like blood corpuscles pumping through the veins of some living organism L A covers such an immense area that the first time visitor can easily feel overwhelmed The best way to approach the city is to break it down into smaller regions and then take them one at a time Downtown Hollywood Westside the Coast the Valleys and Orange County Downtown L A s downtown commercial district is steadily becoming a more attractive and culturally active area but the activity here diminishes once the workday is over Surrounded by three freeways and the river historically this district is the heart of Los Angeles It s now also the terminus of L A s new Metro Rail system which is housed in the Spanish Mission style Union Station El Pueblo de Los Angeles State Historic Park preserves a few blocks of the original Mexican village around which the city grew up The center is Olvera Street a bustling Mexican marketplace lined with colorful handicraft and food stalls and historic buildings including the Avila Adobe L A s first house dating from 1818 Half of California s Mexican American chicano population lives in central Los Angeles but you ll find the full range of the city s ethnic population represented by comestibles at Grand Central Market north of Pershing Square Just north of the Pueblo are the crowded streets and Oriental architecture of L A s Chinatown while to the south is Little Tokyo the cultural center of the Japanese community The Japanese Village Plaza is a popular shopping spot with twisting paths lined with bonsai trees rock gardens and sushi bars Nearby is a monument to the space shuttle Challenger including a statue of the Japanese American astronaut Ellison Onizuka one of the seven who died in the 1986 disaster The most dynamic area of downtown is the commercial district around Flower Street many of the new cultural institutions that have surfaced in recent years are located here The beautiful Museum of Contemporary Art MOCA at California Plaza 250 South Grand Avenue is a striking setting for important works by Piet Mondrian Robert Rauschenberg and Jackson Pollock as well as many other innovative American artists MOCA curators keep one step ahead of the pack by commissioning new work which is then displayed beside contemporary classics The Geffen Contemporary 152 North Central Avenue is an annex to MOCA a few blocks away in Little Toyko focusing on film and performing arts The Music Center at First Street and Grand is an important L A venue for concerts and plays which are performed in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion the Mark Taper Forum and the Ahmanson Theater Tours of the Center s architecture and sculpture are available A few miles southwest of central downtown next to the University of Southern California campus lies Exposition Park the setting for the 1932 Olympics Of special note is the Natural History Museum 900 Exposition Boulevard with its child geared Discovery Center and the California Museum of Science and Industry 700 State Drive which features technological exhibits If you re heading west from downtown avoid the freeway and follow another great thoroughfare Wilshire Boulevard Once an Indian trail in its heyday this 16 mile 25 km roadway glittered with the prosperity of its department stores and luxury hotels A living museum of the Art Deco architecture that characterized Los Angeles s rise to greatness during the 1920s and 1930s the section of Wilshire between La Brea and Fairfax avenues known as the miracle mile is slowly being renovated after years of neglect Notable buildings include the former Bullocks Wilshire department store standing at the corner of Kingsley and the Franklin Life Insurance building situated at Van Ness and Wilshire The primary reason to cruise along Wilshire is to arrive at Hancock Park home of the famous La Brea Tar Pits Here petroleum deposits ooze through fractures to the surface and evaporate leaving natural tar lakes brea is Spanish for tar From viewing stations visitors may observe the excavation of fossilized remains The adjacent George C Page Museum 5801 Wilshire Boulevard has on display the skeletons of mammoths mastodons saber toothed tigers and other unfortunate creatures who became trapped in the sticky tar during the last Ice Age Next door to the tar pits is the Los Angeles County Museum of Art LACMA whose provocative modern architecture houses one of the state s best art collections including outstanding examples of Nepalese Indian and Tibetan art Japanese scroll paintings pre Columbian art and German Expressionist drawings Other highlights include important works by Rembrandt D rer Frans Hals Picasso and the Impressionists Motoring aficionados should drive another two blocks to the Petersen Automotive Museum 6060 Wilshire Boulevard which houses the largest collection of cars motorcycles and related memorabilia in the country Hollywood The actual city of Hollywood has not lived up to the idea of Hollywood for quite some time In fact it s a somewhat seedy area still surviving on its outdated reputation Tourists continue to flock to landmarks made famous over the years but don t make the trek expecting to see anyone associated with the film business The studios themselves have long since moved over the hills to set up shop in North Hollywood and Burbank and everyone else is busy cutting deals over in Beverly Hills Along Hollywood Boulevard you ll find over 2 500 actors names on bronze stars embedded in the pavement the Walk of Fame You ll pass Frederick s of Hollywood with its lingerie museum and the beautifully restored Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel site of the first public Oscar ceremony Between La Brea and Western Avenue the boulevard exhibits the fine tacky splendor of the 1920s and 30s with its low flat stucco buildings a droopy palm tree or two and even some vintage Packards and Buicks parked out on the street While the neighborhood is less than scintillating the second hand bookstores specializing in film related books and posters are excellent The hand foot and hoof prints of Hollywood stars are immortalized in the concrete courtyard of Mann s Chinese Theater at 6925 Hollywood Boulevard erected in 1927 Most stars were obliged to get on their knees and make a hand print but it was natural for Fred Astaire to leave a foot print John Wayne to leave a fist print and cowboy Tom Mix to leave his horse s hoof print A couple of freeway exits away is the Hollywood Bowl a splendid open air amphitheater where the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra holds concerts under the gigantic illuminated letters of the Hollywood sign planted up in the hills South of Hollywood Boulevard is L A s most famous street Sunset Boulevard The section between Hollywood and Beverly Hills known simply as The Strip continues to be the playground of the rich famous young and hip A drive down Sunset can be dangerous as the billboards touting the latest movies and records may make it difficult to keep your eyes on the road While you re on the north side of town take a drive around the Hollywood Hills for a superb view of the city The classic Los Angeles cruise is along Mulholland Drive On a clear day you can see Long Beach 25 miles 40 km away across the vast sprawling metropolis Another great viewpoint is the Observatory in Griffith Park off Highway 5 Fans of James Dean will recognize the Observatory it was the scene of the climax of Rebel Without a Cause The panorama from the terrace on a clear day is fantastic from the spiky skyscrapers of downtown to the distant Pacific Griffith Park is the biggest city park in the United States It sprawls across the eastern Hollywood Hills and is criss crossed with drives and hiking trails Toward sunset is the best time to go just as the city lights are coming on Westside At Doheny Drive the western edge of Hollywood merges with the slopes of Laurel Canyon and Beverly Hills dotted with the sumptuous mansions of the movie moguls While these homes are heavily guarded and hidden from view you can sense the opulent atmosphere as you drive through the plush carefully manicured avenues The architecture is an astounding mixture of Spanish Gothic Bauhaus and Renaissance in every pastel shade under the sun Don t bother slowing down for the street vendors selling official maps showing the homes of the rich and famous unless you get a kick out of security gates Rodeo Drive pronounced Ro DAY oh is the famous shopping street if you saw the movie Pretty Woman you ve seen Rodeo Drive and it s just as upscale and sophisticated as advertised If you re visiting in the summer or around Christmas take a half hour guided tour on the sweet Beverly Hills Trolley for 1 Meet the trolley on the corner of Rodeo and Dayton Way it s the only bargain you ll find in the neighborhood Nearby in Century City the Museum of Tolerance 9786 West Pico Boulevard uses high technology to explore and encourage understanding between cultures Its interactive exhibits focus on the history of racism in America highlighting Beit Hashoah the Holocaust There s a more scholarly feel to Los Angeles around the campus of UCLA University of California Los Angeles at Westwood Village The Village is a fine place in which to see a movie new films always open here first At the edge of Westwood the UCLA Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center 10899 Wilshire Boulevard features a fabulous collection of paintings personally collected over the last fifty years by Hammer If your visit to Hollywood has filled you with nostalgia for the great days of cinema then you might like to pay homage to Marilyn Monroe in Westwood Memorial Park 1212 Glendon Avenue south of Wilshire Boulevard where a modest plaque bears silent testimony to the actress West of the campus in Brentwood on a bluff high above the 405 freeway is the Getty Center 1200 Getty Center Drive opened in 1997 The major attraction among the impressively designed arts education and research buildings is the J Paul Getty Museum which contains all the art and more formerly housed at the Getty Villa at Malibu Among the paintings are superb works by Raphael Rubens van Dyck and Rembrandt Visitors can also see a selection of Greek and Roman antiquities housed here until the year 2001 when they are scheduled move back into the newly renovated Getty Villa at Malibu J P Getty had a coherent idea of the kind of art he wanted to collect Greek Roman Renaissance Baroque and French Rococo His antiquities collection is impressive highlighted by the Getty bronze a fourth century b c statue of an Olympic champion believed by some experts to be the only remaining work of Lysippus court sculptor of Alexander the Great The Coast The beach as locals refer to it stretches some 72 miles 115 km from Malibu through Santa Monica Venice Marina del Rey Hermosa and Redondo to Palos Verdes before the white sands run into the pollution around the San Pedro and Long Beach shipyards There s no better way to get the special feel of Los Angeles than by heading right down to the beach because in L A the beach is not just for holidays and weekends it s a year round playground community center gymnasium solarium and singles bar Malibu is the favored residence of the more relaxed members of Hollywood s film community Rather than barricade themselves behind electrified fences guarded by huge Dobermans as they do in Bel Air and Beverly Hills film actors and hot young directors can be seen here jogging along the seashore or simply gathering their groceries at the local supermarket Perhaps the most famous attraction here is the Getty Villa at Malibu formerly the J Paul Getty Museum at 17985 West Pacific Coast Highway Malibu At first the museum buildings awaken echoes of Hearst Castle at San Simeon see page 45 It is undoubtedly a serious art collection but its setting in a vast replica of a palatial Roman villa has something of the pretentious inclinations of San Simeon without Hearst s pick and mix flamboyance The museum is currently closed for renovations and will reopen in the year 2001 with only Greek and Roman antiquities Malibu s Surfrider Beach attracts surfers from all over the world as well as the locals many riding the old fashioned big guns boards at least 10 ft 3 m long Malibu Pier is a good place to fish but sunbathing and swimming are a little more peaceful down the road at Las Tunas and Topanga beaches The only natural hazard that can disturb Malibu s cheerful complacency is the odd storm tide or landslide that washes the precarious beach houses into the Pacific In contrast Santa Monica is built on more solid ground befitting the upper middle class community that inhabits it This attractive seaside town one of the most pleasant places to stay in L A is very popular with people in the arts and entertainment industries At night there are many good restaurants clubs and theaters to enjoy and by day there is the glorious beach complete with an amusement pier antique carousel and the nearby shopping arcades However it is neighboring Venice that attracts all the only in Californians The beach and boardwalk here are a non stop open air circus of L A s extroverts and eccentrics all vying with each other to be the center of attention In 1892 a millionaire Abbot Kinney planned construction of a replica of Venice here but shortly after work started oil was discovered and the idea was abandoned The neighborhood has now been revived as a diverse community of artists writers and bohemian types Venice artists are among those who have pioneered the street painting that has spread throughout L A the trompe l oeil murals covering whole fa ades often three or four stories high some creating optical illusions by depicting mirror images of the street on which they appear South of the more staid Marina del Rey the world s largest small boat harbor the beaches continue in an unbroken golden curve Dockweiler Manhattan Hermosa Redondo to the rocky bluffs of Palos Verdes

Valleys The great mass of Los Angeles s population lives in the sprawling suburbs of the valleys the San Fernando Valley north of the Hollywood Hills and the San Gabriel Valley stretching east towards San Bernardino It s composed mainly of suburbs and uninspired strip centers block long low rise shopping malls but there are a few reasons to drop by One of the most enjoyable is a tour of the film

national parks as well as the Death Valley National Park In these magnificent stretches of wilderness the mountains of the Sierra Nevada the huge silent redwood forests and the awe inspiring emptiness of the desert you can begin to recapture the adventurous spirit of the earliest American experience These parks are naturally immensely popular with Californians and tourists alike Yosemite more so than the others but they all have ample room for everyone to escape the crowds Certain regulations must be observed within the national parks There are strict speed limits usually lower than on normal highways It is forbidden to feed or otherwise interfere with the wild animals and it is essential that food storage regulations are followed in any parks where bears are found Hunting is illegal and you are required to have a state license to fish Hikers intending to camp in the back country must first obtain a wilderness permit see page 108 Camping is allowed only in designated campsites and fires are restricted to certain areas None of the regulations is a real burden however as there are excellent public campsites picnic areas and barbecue facilities to be found in all the parks Yosemite National Park The scenic Yosemite Valley is a perfect example of a glacier carved canyon with its sheer granite walls 3 200ft 975m high plunging to a flat floor of woods and wild flower meadows enclosing the waters of the Merced River Your base camp could be a plush hotel room more modest lodge accommodation or even just a tent From the valley meadows you can hike bike rentals at Yosemite Lodge or Curry Village or take the shuttle bus to all the principal sights You can grade the hikes according to your fitness and experience if in doubt seek advice at the Visitor Center but

part of the John Muir Trail see page 39 which heads past Merced Lake and on to the lovely Tuolumne Meadows up in the high country The final destination of the John Muir Trail is Mount Whitney more

and the High Sierras beyond is breathtaking as is the other way to get here a steep hike up the Four Mile Trail You can see Yosemite Creek drop down half a mile from the opposite wall in the spectacular Upper Middle and Lower Yosemite Falls and you ll get an outstanding view of the majestic Half Dome a granite monolith sliced in two by the Ice Age glaciers From here you may feel like leaving the bus and hiking back down to the valley along the Panorama Trail via the Nevada and Vernal Falls a trip of 8 miles 13 km most of it downhill A beautiful and easy hike goes out to Mirror Meadow tucked in underneath the vertical northwest face of Half Dome The trail is especially good during early spring or summer mornings when the waters are perfectly still capturing the most breathtaking colors from the trees and the cliffs of Mount Watkins behind it Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks These two parks lie adjacent to each other and are usually visited together one entrance fee covers both The main attractions are their giant sequoias many of them approaching 3 000 years old and the spectacular rock scenery of Kings Canyon The forests offer a gorgeous array of dogwoods sugar pines and white and red firs and a rich flora of orange leopard lily lupine bracken fern chinquapin and white corn lily Start at the Visitor Center at Lodgepole or Grant Grove where you can pick up a map and information about the best forest walks and back country hikes and perhaps watch their interesting audio visual presentations about the parks The best introduction to the forest is Congress Trail It s an easy 2 mile 3 km walk but worth lingering over for a couple of hours to absorb the beauty of the largest living creations in nature The trail begins at the General Sherman Tree the biggest of them all Measuring 274 ft 84 m tall 103 ft 31 m around its base and still growing it s one of the largest living organisms in the world Reaching up for light well above the rest of the forest the first branches start 130 ft 40 m above the ground Another beautiful walk and by no means an exhausting one is out to Crescent Meadow passing on the way such venerable trees as the Bear s Bathtub the Shattered Giant and the Chimney The real back country is found 11 miles 18 km along the High Sierra Trail beyond Crescent Meadow at Bearpaw Meadow The hike is not too formidable and the meadow has a rudimentary campsite though spaces are limited Within a day s walk are a lake and streams with good fishing especially for trout and you ll have a fair chance of spotting some of the park s wildlife too bobcats coyotes golden eagles black bear spotted skunk and cougar Death Valley National Park Of all the wonders of California the high desert is perhaps the greatest surprise The desert is no monotonous expanse of sand dunes but a beautiful variegated land full of color and space In summer it is a bizarre landscape of jagged rock and gravel naked mountains and salt lakes baked and shimmering in the desert heat Go in winter and you may see drifts of spring flowers blooming in the wake of the sparse rains that make it over the snow dusted Panamint Mountains in the west Unhidden by vegetation the colors of the rocks brick red ochre green and purple brown are dramatically deepened at sunset and dawn creating unforgettable views Don t be put off by the name Death Valley It is a legacy of the bitter hardships endured by Gold Rush hopefuls who set out to cross the desert from Arizona and Nevada Some never made it Today s travelers however are well catered to with motels and campsites at Furnace Creek and Stovepipe Wells Begin at the Furnace Creek Visitor Center where you can pick up maps and information on the road conditions hiking trails and general desert safety Driving is the only way to get around but remember that distances are great and gasoline stations few and far between Make sure your car is in good mechanical condition and that the tank is full before you begin each day s tour Also you would be well advised to carry spare water just in case the radiator boils over Get up at dawn you won t regret it and drive out to Zabriskie Point As the sun rises behind you the light hits Tucki Mountain and the tips of the Panamints to the west before plunging into the valley s primeval salt lake far below Continue to Dante s View altitude 5 745 ft 1 750 m where you can look out westward to Wildrose Bennett and Telescope peaks Down in the valley in front of you lies the salty puddle called Badwater at 282 ft 86 m below sea level which is the lowest point in the western hemisphere The crazed and pinnacled surface of the salt caked lake bed has earned it the nickname of Devil s Golf Course Take a walk out across that glaring expanse of baked salt the atmosphere of desolation is almost exhilarating If you look closer at the salt under your feet you ll discover that the expansion of the crystallizing mineral has heaved it into bizarre funnels swirls and other intricate patterns On the way back toward Furnace Creek lies Artist s Drive where the road one way only from south to north carves its path through a canyon of multi colored rocks culminating in the very aptly named Artist s Palette Here oxidization has turned the rocks bright mauve ochre green vermilion turquoise and purple Death Valley was an irresistible magnet for prospectors who once scoured the hills and canyons for signs of copper lead gold and silver Thus the mountains are riddled with old mines and exploratory shafts but only a few of the miners struck paydirt You can explore the remains of the Keane Wonder Mine on the east side of the valley and the ghost town of Skidoo in the west where 3 million worth of gold was dug out of the ground over a period of two years At the northern boundary of Death Valley 52 miles 84 km from Furnace Creek lies the remarkable Scotty s Castle a luxuriously furnished 1920s Spanish style mansion that rises improbably from the bed of Grapevine Canyon It was built for a Chicago millionaire Albert Johnson who spent his winters prospecting for gold with his partner and friend Walter Scott known to all as Death Valley Scotty Guided tours take you round the lavish interior you can wander the grounds at will Nearby lies Ubehebe Crater the spectacular result of a volcanic explosion A short trail leads to the floor of the crater Excursion to Las Vegas Inland from the urban jungle of L A lies the dry and desolate expanse of the Mojave Desert a vast empty landscape that stretches 200 miles 322 km to the Nevada border Interstate Highway 15 slashes through the desert and before reaching the neon sprawl of Las Vegas passes through Stateline a smaller resort area with hotels casinos and a theme park The city of Las Vegas grew out of a stopover at a natural oasis which burgeoned after Nevada s legalization of gambling in 1931 Today visitors converge on Vegas from all over America Many are still here

international troupe of performers reaches mystical heights If it s the traditional Las Vegas you dream of the best time to arrive is at sunset when the city lights loom out of the desert darkness For
