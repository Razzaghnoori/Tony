 okay do you want to go first well i could barely hear what the switchboard operator was saying as what was the topic fitness and exercise oh God No why don t you go first okay um i like to do uh weight training and and cycling and just walking uh and swimming i i used to do a lot of basketball and running and volleyball until i had some knee surgery last fall and the doctor said that running and jumping isn t real good for my knee anymore so i had to kind of change my lifestyle a little bit well let me ask a personal question how old are you thirty eight oh well then you you get the over thirty five everything goes downhill flop uh well the the rest of me is in pretty good shape it s just that left knee that just doesn t want to do everything it used to oh well you re lucky then because i ve battled arthritis all my life i mean even since i was like about two or three that s when they diagnosed it and usually most people are just absolutely crippled and uh i do water aerobics really ooh oh i bet that helps religiously do water aerobics um hum i used to do it about six times a week and now i m down to about four but it s about the only thing that keeps my mobility in shape in in there uh i tried weight training and i m telling you you just i just can t lift the things yeah and the shock on the system is is just too much so i have stuck to water aerobics basically you know the weightless thing and yeah trying to keep in shape that way but you know it s hard to find i mean it s really hard to find a place that s going to offer water aerobics because what i m finding is that if they do offer it you get the crowd of women that are i think they feel this is going to be an effortless sweatless way that s right that s right to get in shape without having to spend anything or it s the geriatric crowd that s right so i ve considered even becoming licensed to teach it well i mean if if you know what your routine is you can do that by yourself and you probably do yeah but you have to have an indoor pool this is true so to find an indoor pool where either you can do this by yourself without you know drawing a lot of looks means you re really going to do a strenuous workout activity you look very odd in the water that was the one place where i was also able to do weight training well now at and that does look very odd in the water i can believe that have you tried the uh the pool at the Spring Creek Fitness Center no and you know that s the only place i haven t tried and people have told me now that s the Texan facility yes i have been told that thing is just lovely it is they keep it at eighty one degrees year round huh have do you use that facility a lot um a fair a fairly a fairly good amount uh more on the weekends uh i try to beat the traffic in the mornings when i workout in the mornings i try to come down to the Dallas Fitness Center hum do you know if they have child care there um have you done your attitude survey for this year yet you need to put that on there seriously they don t i don t i don t work at TI oh you don t no i used to work at TI as matter of fact i was the only woman that they had in the field in a management position actually when i was working there i was the only woman that was pretty much in the industry and i used to fill out those attitude surveys and uh oh yeah uh me and the uh insurance adjusters adjusters are are very familiar with each other and my husband still works there and uh yeah i get my attitude expressed through them but i find it to be very sometimes it s kind of shoot yourself in the foot short sided mentality to save a few bucks uh and this is true never having lived in Texas before i started to work for TI and i came down here and you know they did an attitude survey like six weeks after i had been working here and i asked about you know day care for the shift workers and yeah boy i was pulled in by my manager and told that you just don t say that you know and it s not applicable to me and i was kind of horrified well it s not now what year are we talking about we re talking nineteen seventy eight okay uh things have become much more enlightened since then they couldn t have gotten anymore in the dark ages yeah you know we still don t have a day care facility but people are more sympathetic to it i understand i understand that they re now covering women s preventative health care and uh the reason i m at home is when i had my kids and i was scheduled to go back and i tell you how much in the dark ages it was um yes yes i had been rated number one in the field and then i took uh when i became pregnant i also got meningitis and then delivered the first baby three months early ooh my gosh and they put the baby on a heart lung monitor when i took her home and the insurance carrier was not going to cover this because it was considered preventative treatment sure could you hold the phone for one second thanks okay i m back and then they used to uh and then i had a second one eighteen months later they told me to put them back to back and of course to maintain and i was flat on my back for the last five months with the second one because that s when i go into labor that s like four and a half months and i don t even know it wow of course it s real easy to take care of the first one when you re on your back oh yeah very easy very easy and they they put me on twenty four hour fetal monitoring then to to you know to to try to control the labor and see how far it was going and after the baby was born since it wasn t premature then they said they wouldn t cover the cost of the monitor i think that s kind of when my husband hit the roof because it was a uh thirteen thousand dollar really bill but after the second baby was born i was going to go back to work and that was when they had God it would have been the eighty five layoff yeah yeah and i ll tell you how they handled this and i was just outraged i did not know that since i was on personal leave of absence that i had been uh terminated until i filed my insurance claims about four months later and they didn t have any coverage under my name and i went back and i said what the hell is going on here you know and they told me that uh oh well you know you know your husband works here and he s got a good salary we didn t think that you d be coming back anyway and uh yeah really you know we ve got people here that really you know need to be working and so that we had just you know it was this way we didn t have to layoff an active person and we d just let you go and it took me about a year of arguing i said you know you ve got to put this in writing to me and because until they put it in writing i couldn t get my insurance benefits and i couldn t get my uh termination benefits either yeah there you go i was just pissed as hell that they could do that i i can believe that but i i guess things have gotten better i ve been told that there s flex hour and those kind of things oh yeah flex time is great i still don t think that they after my experiences that they could you know get me to go back ever again i i can understand i can understand well it s been good talking with you but let me ask you this since you use T exans how much is it a month yeah oh shoot it s only about ten bucks a month now is that for an individual yeah i mean uh to add dependents is is you know maybe another dollar or something it s no big deal that s it yeah now are if you if you if you pay your your monthly charge do you then pay separately for classes you re taking uh you do for classes for classes but to i mean to use any of the facilities is is no extra charge God that s cheap yeah it is that s really cheap do you have to be an active TI employee to join Texans or or or a dependent or a dependent of one or the dependent on God i am so dependent these days it s offensive to me alrighty well i i m seeing that my my codependents have turned on the hose and are getting my neighbors fence really wonderful yeah so my uh position from management to domestic goddess has been an adjustment but boy i think i m going to go contact Texans i really think i am i mean that beats any offer i ve heard in a long time yeah oh yeah it s great huh alrighty when you re there on weekends is it crowded as hell uh well it would depend on when you go it s not it s not excessively crowded on the weekends see i d want to be there in the mornings like from nine thirty to ten thirty oh i don t think that would be bad at all if you re in Richardson you d probably wanted to come to the to the Dallas site oh i i m actually right on the Plano line oh well then you could go either one the Spring Creek one is a lot more modern has a lot more yeah niceties amenities and you d probably like the pool there oh God it sounds like i would i might do that then okay i learned something here well i m good i m glad well thank you you have a good day bye bye you can go back to work now thank you bye bye
