position where I meet a lot of different people a few times a year I have real problems remembering names Have you heard this one before I ve tried several ways to compensate The one that works best for me is to review the list of names I should know and visualize their faces But I still fail So my question to you is What is the best way to handle the introduction of somebody whose name you should know but don t when they join a small conversational group you re with Sign me Bill From La Jolla Dear Bill Far worse than picking up the wrong fork is stumbling around with an introduction But take heart you have a lot of company falling into this particular social pothole Prudie does not recommend an association technique For example years ago a certain woman s name would not stay in Prudie s memory The woman wore crazy hats often sporting fruit so Carmen Miranda seemed a useful aid until Prudie addressed the woman as Mrs Miranda You are luckier than most in that your elevated position gives you something of a pass Many individuals will assume that you meet so many people that name recollection would be tough at best Actor Robert Wagner R J to people who could remember his name got around this by calling everyone Pallie This stunt only works however in direct address and is no help with introductions Prudie is willing to blow her cover and offer you her trick When stuck just say Tell me your whole name implying alas fraudulently that she remembers one name but not both Happily most people pick up on someone s difficulty and introduce themselves When nothing happens to relieve the situation you can say forthrightly I m so sorry your name has gone right out of my head Prudie forgetfully Dear Prudie I have long wanted to ask your advice concerning a problem that is certainly not new to me I have been in a committed relationship with a man for four years We have everything going for us and I feel it s time to marry It seems to be the next logical step We ve been talking about this for over a year so this is not a new subject Last week we had a huge fight about our relationship and getting married It ended with him storming out and me crying My question is If a man keeps saying he s not ready to marry is this his way of saying I ll never marry you In other words should I just move on Impatiently Waiting Dear Imp Oh dear the beloved is having trouble with his feet They re cold It s the old commitment problem which seems to afflict more men than women The goings on you describe sound like a cross between psychodrama and dating never good for the nerves You have these options as Prudie sees it You can stick it to him and force a decision you can coast along and see if he starts to feel more ready or you can make a deadline spoken or unspoken at which time you will either call a caterer or tell him it s been lovely What some women have done though Prudie doesn t recommend it is to make the beloved jealous with other men This is sometimes effective in extracting a proposal but it is also a little like lassoing a calf and who wants a groom one is dragging to the altar The dilemma on whose horns you ride is that sometimes not ready means just that and at other times it really does mean not you The hell of it is that often the real meaning is unknown to the gentleman himself As one of the French philosophes put it Men and women deserve something better than each other If things work out do let Prudie know so that she can wish you mazel ton tons of luck Prudie hopefully Dear Prudie So one of Prudie s hot buttons is the government s failure to provide clean needles to addicts May I suggest you take your finger off the button calm down and review the history of Vancouver s 10 year experiment doing just such a thing The results are not encouraging The number of addicts has risen and the percentage infected with AIDS has gone from around 3 percent to 24 percent if memory serves Compassionate sounding ideas do not always pan out it s good to look at the evidence and be willing to change your mind if necessary Concerned but Skeptical Dear Con Your giving Prudie the needle pardon the expression is understandable As with all studies there are opposite findings to be offered Alas it is the nature of the statistical beast Your figures for the Vancouver study are correct but there is no way to know if the number of users would have gone up without a needle exchange Some experts have also quarreled with the design of the Vancouver program The complaints have to do with the low limits on exchanges per addict and poor timing That is the crack epidemic had just taken hold and according to the Toronto Sun injected cocaine and crack use often require 30 to 40 needles a session With impaired judgment a guaranteed result with injected drugs one would not know how many or whose needles one was using Prudie thinks it best we agree to disagree and err on the side of humane considerations Prudie agreeably
