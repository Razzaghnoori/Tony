 Background Recent studies have shown that maitotoxin MTX a potent cytolytic agent isolated from the dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus toxicus is an important new molecular tool for the study of oncotic necrotic cell death 1 2 In a variety of cell types MTX initiates a cell death cascade that involves a sequence of cellular events essentially identical to those activated by stimulation of purinergic receptors of the P2Z P2X 7 type Initially MTX causes a graded increase in cytosolic free Ca 2 concentration Ca 2 i This is followed closely in time by the opening of cytolytic oncotic pores COP that allow the exchange of large organic molecules of molecular weight less than 800 Daltons across the plasma membrane COP activation can be monitored by the cellular accumulation of ethidium or propidium based vital dyes which are normally excluded from the cytoplasm but gain access to cellular nucleotides via COP and exhibit an increase in fluorescence In isolated bovine aortic endothelial cells BAECs the opening or activation of COP is associated with formation of spherical membrane blebs with a diameter of 3 5 microns 3 The final stage of MTX induced cell death is cell lysis as indicated by the release of large cytoplasmic enzymes such as lactate dehydrogenase LDH Using time lapse videomicroscopy we have shown that MTX induced release of LDH from vascular endothelial cells is associated with massive bleb dilation and rapid staining of the nucleus with vital dyes 3 The initial MTX induced increase in Ca 2 i reflects the activation of a Ca 2 permeable non selective cation channel CaNSC 1 4 5 6 7 8 This channel which has a reported conductance in the range of 12 40 pS depending on ionic conditions 5 9 10 11 causes rapid membrane depolarization which in excitable cells leads to activation of voltage sensitive channels Although it appears that a rise in Ca 2 i is necessary but not sufficient for activation of COP 1 the molecular mechanisms by which this occurs remains unknown Likewise the subsequent steps leading to membrane blebbing and cytolysis are poorly understood It is however well established that MTX causes the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides in some cell types presumably via activation of phospholipase C PLC 12 13 Activation of PLC by MTX appears to be indirect resulting as a consequence of increased Ca 2 i These results suggest that PLC may be involved in activation of COP and or in the cytolysis phase of MTX action Thus the initial purpose of the present study was to determine the role of PLC in MTX induced cell death To accomplish this goal the effect of U73122 a specific inhibitor of mammalian PLC was examined This compound selectively inhibits mammalian PLC but has no direct effect on bacterial PLC bacterial or mammalian phospholipase A 2 or adenylyl cyclase 14 U73343 a structural analogue of U73122 that differs by only one double bond has no direct effect on PLC and is commonly used as a negative control However both compounds have been shown to produce non specific effects presumably unrelated to inhibition of PLC 15 16 17 18 19 20 The results of the present study show that both U73122 and U73343 inhibit MTX induced change in Ca 2 i ethidium uptake and LDH release in BAECs Although these results suggest that blockade of MTX induced responses by the U compounds is independent of PLC they identify these compounds as novel potent and rapid blockers of MTX action Interestingly in experiments designed to examine MTX reversibility we discovered a rather stunning change in the pattern of membrane blebbing Specifically cells rescued from MTX by subsequent application of U73343 exhibit a blebbing pattern known as zeiosis Zeiosis which comes from the Greek word Z meaning to boil over 21 is characterized by violent cytokinesis with continuous bleb extension and retraction Zeiosis has been associated in many cell types with apoptosis 22 23 24 The results of the present experiments suggest that following a brief exposure to MTX U73343 rescues cells from oncotic cell death Cells that survive the initial insult may ultimately die by apoptosis Results U73122 and U73343 inhibit MTX induced change in Ca 2 iand ethidium uptake in BAECs To test the hypothesis that MTX induced cell death requires PLC the effect of U73122 a specific inhibitor of PLC was examined Addition of MTX to fura 2 loaded BAECs suspended in a cuvette in normal Ca 2 containing buffer at 37 C produced a time dependent increase in Ca 2 i Fig 1 upper panel Addition of either U73122 or U73343 the inactive analog 3 min before MTX produced a concentration dependent inhibition of the change in Ca 2 i U73343 exhibited a 3 fold greater potency compared to U73122 Fig 1 insets Since U73343 has no significant effect on PLC over the concentration range employed 14 25 26 27 these results suggest that inhibition of the MTX induced response is independent of PLC Studies in BAECs have shown that following elevation of Ca 2 i MTX causes the activation of large pores i e COP that allow the flux of ethidium and propidium based vital dyes into the cell As previously reported 3 MTX induced uptake of ethidium in BAECs was biphasic in the absence of the U compounds Fig 1 lower panel The first phase which extends for 5 min after addition of MTX reflects the activation of COP whereas the second phase is temporally associated with LDH release and thus reflects cell lysis 3 Addition of either U73122 or U73343 3 min before MTX produced an inhibition of ethidium uptake Fig 1 lower panel Both phases of ethidium uptake were attenuated by the U compounds and U73343 again appeared to have a greater potency compared to U73122 These results suggest that inhibition of MTX induced change in Ca 2 i prevents or attenuates both the activation of COP and cytolysis To determine if the effects of the U compounds are reversible BAECs were pre treated with U73343 5 M for 5 min washed and resuspended in normal extracellular buffer in the absence of U73343 As seen in Fig 2 BAECs pre treated with U73343 partially recover responsiveness to MTX following washout of U73343 but the response failed to recover further over the subsequent 10 min Thus the ability of U73343 to block the effect of MTX appears to reflect both a rapidly reversible and slowly reversible component U73343 partially reverses the effect of MTX To determine if U73343 could reverse the action to MTX the compound was added to the cuvette after MTX As seen in Fig 3 upper panel addition of U73343 at various times after MTX immediately stopped further increases in Ca 2 i and resulted in an immediate recovery of Ca 2 i back towards basal resting levels Over the time course examined however Ca 2 i never fully returned to the level observed before MTX addition The same experimental protocol was employed for evaluation of ethidium uptake Fig 3 lower panel Again MTX induced uptake of ethidium was biphasic in the absence of U73343 trace a Addition of the U compound shortly after MTX i e at 200 sec trace e blocked both phases of the response Addition of U73343 towards the end of the first phase i e at either 400 or 500 sec traces b and c had only a small effect on the magnitude and time course of subsequent ethidium uptake However when U73343 was added during the first phase of ethidium uptake i e 300 sec trace d dye accumulation in the cells was immediately blocked After a short delay dye uptake again increased with time to a value that was substantially less than maximum These results suggest that U73343 is able to rapidly block both the MTX induced change in Ca 2 i and COP formation when added shortly after MTX When U73343 is added at longer times a large proportion of the cells challenged by MTX have apparently passed a point of no return and are destined to die by oncosis However the percentage of cells that either die or survive depends on the time of U73343 addition after MTX U73343 rescues cells from MTX induced oncotic cell death To directly determine the effect of U73343 on MTX induced cell lysis LDH release was correlated with the change in Ca 2 i and ethidium uptake in paired experiments As previously reported 3 and as seen in Fig 4 bottom panel black circles MTX induced LDH release in the absence of U73343 correlates in time with the second phase of ethidium uptake demonstrating that the second phase reflects cell lysis Addition of U73343 during the first phase of the MTX induced response immediately reversed the rise in Ca 2 i and blocked dye uptake However at 400 sec ethidium uptake resumed and increased to an intermediate value as was seen in Fig 3 This secondary uptake of ethidium correlated in time with a partial LDH release Fig 4 bottom panel red triangles U73343 alone had no effect on LDH release Fig 4 bottom panel green squares These results directly demonstrate that a percentage of cells within the population died by oncosis but perhaps more importantly that a significant number of the cells are rescued from MTX induced oncotic cell death when U73343 is added within a short time window after MTX U73343 alters MTX induced bleb formation Our previous studies showed that MTX causes a specific change in cell morphology In particular MTX causes dramatic time dependent membrane blebbing in BAECs 3 An example is shown in Fig 5 BAECs attached to glass coverslips and superfused with a solution containing ethidium bromide were simultaneously monitored by phase and fluorescence microscopy Selected images pairs merged phase fluorescence images are shown in Fig 5 At time 5 min the cells were superfused with a solution containing MTX No change in cell morphology was noted at 10 min but by 25 min i e 20 min after addition of MTX large membrane blebs were observed on essentially all the cells within the field of view Fig 5A see examples indicated by blue arrows Additionally clear staining of the nucleus and cytoplasm by ethidium was observed at this time The graph shown in Fig 5Aquantifies the fluorescence change in individual cells as a function of time Note that uptake of ethidium in response to MTX is biphasic at the single cell level and that heterogeneity between cells primarily reflects the time of entry into the second phase of dye uptake i e the cell lysis phase The dynamic nature of the MTX induced bleb formation bleb dilation and ethidium uptake can be observed by viewing the time lapse movie associated with this experiment see Additional File 1 As previously reported blebs form during the first phase of dye uptake whereas rather dramatic bleb dilation is seen during the cytolysis phase of rapid dye uptake In the continuous presence of MTX blebs continue to swell and in many cases seem to disappear as they dilate and extend out of the focal plane Addition of U73343 10 M 2 3 min before MTX 0 3 nM completely blocks ethidium uptake and the associated change in cell morphology As seen in Fig 5B essentially no blebs are observed at 25 min i e 20 min after MTX and little or no dye uptake is seen out to 40 min Thus the major morphological changes associated with MTX challenge are blocked by U73343 However by time 40 min some of the cells 11 out of 53 detach from the glass coverslip and round up Fig 5B see examples indicated by blue arrows The time lapse movie of this experiment revealed that these detached cells were actually undergoing a novel type of membrane blebbing called zeiosis see Additional File 2 As can be seen from the movie Additional File 2 zeiosis is characterized by cytokinesis with time dependent bleb extension and retraction Note that during zeiosis no ethidium uptake is observed i e there is little or no change in cell fluorescence This result suggests that COP is not activated and the cells do not undergo a gross change in plasmalemmal permeability during zeiosis At 1 nM MTX the number of BAECs that undergo zeiosis in the presence of U73343 is increased see Additional File 3 As seen in this movie Additional File 3 the majority of the cells in the field of view 16 out of 24 undergo zeiosis yet there is no ethidium uptake over the time frame examined despite the higher concentration of MTX employed Little or no zeiosis was observed in the absence of MTX i e in the presence of either U73343 alone 4 zeotic cells out of 113 or vehicle alone DMSO 5 zeotic cells out of 146 examined for 40 min Thus the ability of MTX to cause zeiosis is specific but requires the presence of U73343 presumably to block or prevent rapid oncotic cell death The cuvette experiments suggest that BAECs challenged with MTX can be rescued from oncotic cell death if U73343 is added to the bath solution within a narrow time frame after the addition of MTX To further test this hypothesis paired experiments were performed at the single cell level BAECs attached to coverslips were first challenged with MTX and subsequently rescued by addition of U73343 The percentage of a dead cells indicated by nuclear staining with ethidium b cells undergoing zeiosis and c surviving cells indicated by the lack of membrane blebbing and lack of nuclear staining with ethidium was quantified at time 40 min Fig 6 All of the cells treated with vehicle alone DMSO before MTX exhibited the typical blebbing profile and nuclear staining indicative of rapid oncotic cell death BAECs treated with U73343 before MTX were essentially protected from cell death but 35 of the total population exhibited zeiosis The same pattern was observed when U73343 was added 4 min after MTX i e full protection from oncosis with 40 zeiosis However 15 of the cells died by oncosis when U73343 was added at 6 min after MTX see Additional File 4 and this percentage increased to 90 when U73343 was added at 7 min after MTX see Additional File 5 Addition of U73343 10 min after MTX was the same as vehicle control i e all the cells lyse by time 40 min These results are consistent with the cuvette studies and directly demonstrate that within a narrow time window after MTX challenge U73343 can rescue BAECs from oncotic cell death BAECs rescued from oncosis by U73343 die by apoptosis Zeiosis is a type of membrane blebbing associated with apoptosis 22 23 24 Since U73343 protects cells from MTX induced oncosis and causes zeiosis we considered the possibility that the cells surviving the initial insult may ultimately die by apoptosis To test this hypothesis BAECs were treated with vehicle alone DMSO U73343 alone or MTX followed by U73343 and specific caspase 3 activity was determined after 48 hrs by the fluorescence substrate assay Fig 7 A significant increase in caspase 3 activity p 0 035 n 3 was observed in cells challenged with MTX and subsequently rescued by U73343 consistent with increased apoptotic cell death Additional file 1 MTX induced EB uptake and membrane blebbing in single BAECs The time lapse video of the experiment shown in Fig 5Awas created from the captured images as

support two major conclusions First U73122 and U73343 compounds that are commonly used to examine PLC dependent mechanisms potently inhibit MTX induced change in Ca 2 i vital dye uptake and oncotic cell death in BAECs The fact that U73343 which has essentially no effect on PLC at the concentrations employed 14 25 26 27 is more potent than U73122 on MTX induced responses clearly shows that the effect of these agents is unrelated to inhibition of PLC Since U73343 can rapidly block and reverse the increase in Ca 2 i induced by MTX it seems likely that these compounds directly block the MTX activated channels in BAECs perhaps acting as pore blockers However since the effect of U73343 appears to be slowly reversible there may be additional sites mechanisms of blocking action for these agents Another class of compounds known as imidazoles of which SKF 96365 is the best studied have also been shown to block MTX induced responses in many cell types 5 7 12 28 The imidazoles which are antifungal agents that inhibit cytochrome P 450 are relatively non selective and are known to block voltage gated Ca 2 channels and receptor activated Ca 2 influx through so called store operated channels SOCs 29 but their mechanism of action in this regard remains unknown U73343 appears to be relatively more selective than SKF 96365 with respect to Ca 2 influx pathways Most studies find that U73343 has no effect on receptor mediated increase in Ca 2 i However Berven and Barritt 15 report that U73343 partially blocked vasopressin induced Ca 2 influx but did not inhibit release of Ca 2 from intracellular stores in hepatocytes And Wang 16 reported that U73343 suppressed elevation of Ca 2 i in neutrophils challenged with FMLP in the presence but not the absence of extracellular Ca 2 Both reports are consistent with a lack of effect of U73343 on receptor mediated activation of PLC and a direct inhibitory effect on Ca 2 influx pathways in these cells The results of the present study therefore suggest that the MTX sensitive channel may be responsible for the rise in Ca 2 i produced by receptor stimulation in some cell types but not in others In this regard Worley et al 8 showed that SOCs in pancreatic cells have characteristics essentially identical to channels activated by MTX in the same cell type Thus U73343 may be useful for the ultimate identification and characterization of the physiological role of MTX sensitive channels Lastly because MTX is one of the toxins associated with ciguatera seafood poisoning the identification of U73343 as a potent and relatively specific blocker of MTX induced cell death cascade may ultimately lead to improved therapeutic interventions The second major conclusion supported by the results of the present study is that MTX apparently has an effect on BAECs that is independent of the rise in Ca 2 i We previously showed that MTX causes the appearance of membrane blebs on the surface of the endothelial cells 3 Initially these blebs are of small diameter 3 5 microns and bleb formation correlates with the first phase of vital dye uptake However during MTX induced cytolysis as indicated by the release of LDH the membrane blebs actually exhibit a dramatic increase in diameter This bleb dilation phase is clearly associated with rapid intense staining of the nucleus with vital dyes It is well established that the acute effects of MTX on Ca 2 i uptake of vital dyes and membrane blebbing require extracellular Ca 2 1 3 but the role of cytosolic Ca 2 remains unknown Preliminary studies in fibroblasts suggest that vital dye uptake via COP is attenuated in cells loaded with the Ca 2 chelator BAPTA 1 but the effect of BAPTA loading on MTX induced bleb formation has not been examined The results of the present study show that despite a blockade of MTX induced change in Ca 2 i addition of U73343 either before or within a short time after MTX produced a blebbing profile known as zeiosis The term zeiosis was first used by Costero and Pomerat 21 50 years ago to describe the appearance of membrane vesicles on the surface of nerve cells in culture as visualized using time lapse cinematography Although the cellular mechanisms remain poorly defined it is now clear that zeiosis is associated with apoptotic cell death for review 24 30 In static images the morphological changes associated with apoptosis appear as membrane blebs covering the surface of the cells 31 32 33 However time lapse images reveal that blebs protrude and retract in a dynamic fashion a hallmark of zeiosis 22 23 Dynamic membrane blebbing appears to involve a dramatic change in the cytoskeleton and may be induced by a caspase 3 mediated cleavage of ROCK I a Rho activated serine threonine kinase known to stimulate actinomycin based contractions 31 32 33 A similar profile can be seen in the videos of MTX induced cell death in the presence of U73343 Files 2 and 3 The cells first lose adhesion to the coverslip retract and roundup This is followed by zeiotic membrane blebbing Vital dyes are excluded during this time suggesting that COP is not activated and that there is no gross loss of membrane integrity during blebbing It is important to note that these MTX induced events are only observed in the presence of U73343 and occur in the absence of a measurable rise in Ca 2 i To our knowledge this is the first evidence that MTX has effects independent of a rise in Ca 2 i Perhaps more importantly the results of the present study suggest that U73343 converts MTX induced oncosis into apoptosis and that a rise in Ca 2 i is necessary for oncotic cell death Conclusions In conclusion U73343 blocks the MTX induced cell death cascade in BAECs and converts the normal blebbing profile seen with this toxin into zeiosis a form of dynamic membrane blebbing commonly associated with apoptosis and characterized by bleb extension and retraction U73343 may prove useful for identification and characterization of MTX activated cation channels and for understanding their physiological role in cell signaling and cell death Materials and Methods Solutions and reagents Unless otherwise indicated HEPES buffered
