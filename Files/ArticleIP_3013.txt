 Future Shock John Updike is at bottom a religious novelist but when you try to identify what exactly his bottom most religious beliefs may be the whole murky lot of them playfully slither away which gives his writing a touch of theological suspense Typically he conjures a Lutheran or Presbyterian setting for his novels and his enthusiasm for those particular creeds induces him at moments of crisis in one plot after another to plunk his guilty male culprit of a hero Updike s heroes are almost always guilty males down on a hardwood pew and to subject him to a vigorous Sunday sermon on biblical themes His new novel Toward the End of Time takes place in a futuristic Massachusetts in which nuclear war has leveled half of civilization strange new metallic animals are threatening to gobble mankind government has collapsed and a gangsterish network of uniformed thugs called chillingly FedEx is establishing a government network of its own Yet even in this most bizarre of Updike s novels the guilty hero eventually finds himself sitting primly in a pew listening to a lady minister declaim on Mary Magdalene and her womanly tears What do these Sunday sermons amount to though Life is drab in Updike s novels and sins are vast and the Christian pieties that come tumbling down from the pulpit never seem adequate to the case And so Updike in his fervor goes on a search for God to thus label the object of his desires directly by means of an intimate unblinking examination of the world in front of his own nose He becomes a maniac of miniature observation Atomic particles dance in his eyesight The world shimmers at him and after a while encouraged by what he sees he shimmers back ecstatic He is something very close to a mystic in that respect a transcendentalist in the old New England literary tradition agog at the indescribable radiance of the lawn at his feet or at the white brilliance of the refrigerator door or at the ever dazzling dust motes floating through the sunbeams He is Emerson except that like a lunatic in an asylum he has spent a lifetime in the mistaken belief that he is Hawthorne Toward the End of Time might seem different from his other novels because of the sci fi trappings which do get rather fantastic Updike s hero Ben a 66 year old retired financial manager is suddenly transposed across the ages to ancient Egypt then to the time of Jesus then to medieval Ireland He begins an affair with a young call girl who on some other plane of existence may be a deer and then a new affair with a girl so young as still to be a child Strange astronomical weirdnesses roam across the post nuclear sky It s all very puzzling and the urgent hope that Updike will explain these many mysteries keeps you faithfully turning the pages Arguably he does offer an explanation by means of a theory about how time can branch off in different directions and perform different operations like a computer program Alternatively you could regard some of those strange doings as the addled fantasies of the aging suburban hero whose journal of a year filled with rants against his wife and pornographic musings and notations about his deteriorating health constitutes the novel But either way once you get past the sci fi extravaganzas Toward the End of Time tells a story exactly like that in any number of Updike s novels of a man unhappy in marriage blue with remorse and unable to figure out what to do except by attending closely to the radiant surface of the visible reality in front of him And so Updike s Ben observes the passage of seasons life bursting into blossom in early spring for instance There are suddenly children wild on the streets clogging the doorway to the convenience store raucously scraping their skateboards and roller blades along the sidewalks flaunting their pasty winter skins in shorts and baggy untucked T shirts Where have they been all winter these children They are spontaneously repulsively hatched like the flies that now buzz and bump on the inside of the kitchen windows drunk on warmth Driving out to Route 128 I see a weeping cherry tree no less spectacular for being familiar making its annual splash of purple pink and even along the driveway my poor little spindly pear trees have devised a few blossoms at one of which I saw a sleepy bee bumbling my first bee On Route 128 for no practical reason there is a thickening of traffic another spring phenomenon garaged cars released In Toward the End of Time these descriptions never quite rise to ecstatic levels though Ben remembers how as a child the pulp magazines Amazing and Astounding with their remote radiant exploding facts used to relieve the pressure of everyday bleakness for him But facts seem to have lost that power Ben s dutiful recording of miniscule new shifts in foliage slips ever deeper into sadness At the beginning of the year he finds or imagines a tiny shred of second rate love with his call girl deer and later on finds or imagines an even tinier shred of a preposterous less than love with his child girlfriend But by the end he cannot imagine being loved by any human being at all and comforts himself with the pathetic idea that perhaps the fungus growing on the late autumn soggy ground is offering him in some spongy vegetable manner of its own the acceptance he craves At times curled beneath its soft beige gills of thallic matter a kind of breath hints of love And it becomes poignantly clear that Updike s hero is beginning to die not just because his physical self is deteriorating but because he has a soul which is shrinking It s not a great novel Updike scatters too many leafy sci fi fantasies across his pages and never does get around to raking them up again which is disappointing I don t entirely believe those sci fi notions anyway The cast of characters is a little thin But Updike even in this book is a great writer the greatest we have in his particular areas of strength in the control of visual details in his rhythmic intensity in the colors and shapes that come pouring syncopatedly from his mischievous pen I fear that too many people will throw up their hands in exasperation at Updike s way of appealing for love by presenting his heroes as ever more odious or cantankerous and too many other people will celebrate the book mostly for its secondary virtues its astronomical wonders sailing through the futuristic sky the human chomping metal animals a few political jokes But there is a primary virtue to this book subtler than its other traits and this primary virtue is to be ever so quietly heartbreaking
