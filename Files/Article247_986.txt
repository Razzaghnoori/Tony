 Cold War and Coffee Dear Katha No I don t think Russia is heading for elysium or that the free market solves every problem it just bypasses some of the more avoidable ones But nor do I think some wrenching social and economic difficulties in a still nascent constitutional democracy are comparable to forced starvations reigns of terror and the Gulag They re a necessary evil like a de tox tremor not like an arbitrary jack boot in the head Nor do I think there is or was any faint comparison between the evils the U S sponsored during the Cold War and the U S undoubtedly sponsored some and what the Soviets did Sorry but what the West imposed on Western Europe was nothing compared to what the Soviets did in Eastern Europe or the entire Eurasian continent I thought given what we now know that this was uncontroversial I m interested to see you still don t think so As to my win win situation I don t get your point My view is that Thatcherism largely worked and was therefore all but coopted by New Labour Yes the Tories had been in power too long and got kicked out for sleaze and exhaustion But the difference between what another Major government would have done and what Blair has done is I think infinitesimal So I m disappointed the Tories didn t go on for ever but hardly worried And so far Blair has been terrific on most of the important issues Maybe I should apologize for my distemper this morning I didn t mean to re fight the Cold War over coffee Something just came over me I certainly think the Right has plenty of post ideological problems of its own and Safire is as cranky about Russia as many on the Left But I think the Left has some even more thorough accounting to perform than the Right It seems to me that in France and Britain that process is underway But in America it still lags Meanwhile nihilist Clintonism rules and populist Gingrichism yaps Could it be that the Left s refusal to pore over its often shameful and mistaken past has something to do with this political impasse Andrew
