 The Overblown B2B Hype Even by the standards of this hyperactive stock market Friday s initial public offering for FreeMarkets was staggering The company had originally planned to go public at a price of 16 to 18 a share but by the time it came to market the offering price had tripled to 48 a share That was still too low though still impressive The first trade was at 248 a share and unlike the way most IPOs trade FreeMarkets shares kept rising during the day closing at 280 a share The shares were down 11 today I ll take a guess and say that was profit taking FreeMarkets performance came as no surprise to anyone When investment banks triple the offering price on a stock it s a good sign that the IPO isn t going to crash and burn That s not so much because of the company itself which essentially runs online business to business auctions for corporations like General Motors Rather it s because investor appetite for Internet business to business B2B stocks has suddenly become voracious B2B is we re being told the true wave of the future on the Web and so companies ranging from professional services firms to infrastructure providers to database managers are now the darlings of the Street Most in fact nearly all of these companies remain unknown to just about everyone in America But over the past few months you could have made a huge amount of money in stocks like Akamai Ariba Sapient and Viant There are as usual a host of studies by various research groups to justify the swing in sentiment toward B2B stocks There have to be because many of these companies are currently so tiny that estimating their present value on the basis of their internal numbers alone would be futile FreeMarkets for instance did 7 8 million in revenue last year but now has a market capitalization of 9 1 billion In any case these studies all show that the B2B market for goods and services on the Web will soon dwarf the B2C business to consumer market One recent estimate cited by FreeMarkets in its prospectus has the B2B market growing from 109 billion this year to 1 3 trillion in 2003 If you can get even a tiny slice of 1 3 trillion then you re in great shape The idea then is that within five years B2C e commerce that is what all the investors piling into Amazon com and eToys are hoping to capitalize on will be only a small part of the overall e commerce market perhaps as small as 10 percent This doesn t necessarily mean that e tailers like Amazon are doomed as stocks that is But it does suggest that you d be better off looking at B2B stocks for the next true Internet titan But there is one problem with this whole theory which is that the companies that are going to be doing all of the B2B buying on the Web have to make the money with which they pay for all their purchases somewhere And it can t just be from selling to other businesses In other words at the end of the B2B daisy chain there have to be consumers On CNBC last week one analyst hyped B2B by saying I paraphrase Think of all the parts that GM has to buy every day just to keep its business going and multiply that by all the giant companies out there that have to buy parts But let s remember this GM spends less on parts in a year than consumers spend on GM cars That s by definition Otherwise GM would go out of business In fact if you add up all the money GM and its suppliers spend on parts and databases and infrastructure it s less than consumers spend on GM cars again by definition In other words the hype surrounding B2B has depended on the idea that businesses that sell to other businesses are going to migrate to the Web while businesses that sell to consumers are going to stay offline But while B2B businesses will probably migrate more quickly and while obviously there s a lot of business that will always be offline unless we figure out a way to get a virtual haircut it s illogical that B2B on the Web will explode while B2C will remain stagnant Especially when the former ultimately depends on the latter The real message of the whole B2B craze in fact may be that we should take another look at companies like General Motors How much longer can it be before cars are actually being sold online instead of through the archaic dealer structure And when that happens imagine how much better GM s business will be
