 Kwitcherbellyachin Do you worry that the national debt will impoverish your children Are you incensed about paying thousands in taxes just to cover the government s interest costs And do you long for a political hero who will dare to close the budget gap even if it means raising taxes If so I have one word for you I learned it from Ann Landers The word is kwitcherbellyachin Your share of the debt is an entirely voluntary burden If you don t want it you can dispose of it this afternoon You can do the same with your children s share All you have to do is pay off what you or your children owe Be careful though There s a wrong way and a right way to handle this The wrong way is to send the U S Treasury a contribution earmarked for debt reduction They ll accept your gift all right but they won t credit your personal account Instead your share of the burden like everyone else s will fall by a tiny fraction of a cent Here s the right way to retire your share of the debt First calculate how much you owe Suppose for example that you re the average American Your share would be about 15 000 All you have to do is lend 15 000 to the government The easiest way to do this is to buy a 15 000 Treasury bond From that moment on you will owe 15 000 to yourself which is as good as owing it to nobody at all Each year you ll pay taxes to cover your share of the interest on the debt and each year that money will come right back to you as interest on your bond For all practical purposes you ll have opted out of thedebt burden entirely If it s your children you re worried about give them the bond Let them collect interest until the day of reckoning when that political hero finally arrives to raise taxes and retire the debt Then they can sell the bond and use the proceedsto pay their taxes The only possible objection to this scheme is that you have to come up with 15 000 to buy a bond But on the other hand if the politicians take your advice and raise taxes in order to pay off the national debt you ll have to come up with that same 15 000 to pay your share of those taxes So buying bonds is no more attractive than being taxed for debt reduction but it s no less attractive either If your mantra is Go ahead and tax me but spare me this debt burden it s time to stop chanting and essentially tax yourself Ageneration ago economics textbooks used to dismiss the debt burden by asserting that we owe it to ourselves meaning that some of us the taxpayers owe it to others of us the bondholders That was scant comfort to those who paid taxes but didn t hold bonds But the old semi wisdom becomes genuine wisdom when embellished with the observation that anybody who wants to can become a bondholder and that buying bonds is no more painful than paying taxes to alleviate the debt Whenever I hear somebody griping that the national debt is too high I nod in apparent agreement and point out that the problem is more general than that Not only is the debt out of control I say but so is my front lawn The grass is ridiculously high When will the politicians finally face reality and force me to mow it This usually has one of two desirable effects Either the griper moves to the far end of the room or he asks Why not just mow the lawn Why would you need the government to force you In that case I reply Well why not just buy a bond and eliminate your share of the national debt Why would you need the government to raise your taxes I don t mean to say that everyone should buy Treasury bonds I m saying only that everyone who complains about the debt should buy Treasury bonds and then stop complaining In dismissing bogus concerns about the national debt I do not mean to dismiss legitimate concerns about government spending Your share of government spending is something you can t opt out of short of emigrating or resorting to felonious tax evasion That makes government spending a fair target for your indignation Suppose a reckless Congress decides to appropriate 10 000 of your money to finance a worthless aircraft carrier or a worthless social program Then one of two things must happen Your taxes will rise by 10 000 or else your share of the debt will rise by 10 000 Either way you ve got a legitimate gripe But if Congress opts for debt over taxation you can count on thoughtless commentators to denounce the interest payments on that debt as a second and separate outrage That s wrong because you can if you wish buy a 10 000 Treasury bill that will bring all your interest payments right back to you thereby in effect taxing yourself to pay off the debt right away and limiting your damage to the initial 10 000 The great burden of government is that it spends your money Those politicians who have devoted their lives to exacerbating that burden like Bob Dole and Bill Clinton would prefer to divert your attention to relative nonissues like the deficit Don t fall for it
