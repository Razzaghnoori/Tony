        will i return anything     well really the only things that i have returned have not been faulty its been because of the size or     right   some problem like that i really havent had to return things because they didnt perform the way they were supposed to   most the time they have a pretty good guarantee uh only thing ive had lately is uh my kids got all these Barbie kind of toys for uh Christmas and uh it it takes them less than a day and theyre broken in one way or another but i dont know if thats just kids or if thats uh maybe those type of parts should should be for older kids   umhum what age are your children   i have a five and a half and a three and a half year old that play with them   umhum   and uh i dont think theyre unduly rough but maybe they are i dont know but uh a lot of the little Barbie sets they come with real  little pieces   i   and theyre easily lost and easily broken but   umhum  well my daughter  is twenty one now so its been a while since weve had Barbie things   but you know its been a while since theyve uh gone through the Barbie stage doll stage huh   but we did have Barbies we did have Barbies and things and there seems to me that that became a craze when she was already oh like you know third fourth fifth grade   right   so she wasnt in it for very long before she was out of it but uh i dont remember her breaking a lot of stuff   dont remember her breaking the   no i dont but i also dont remember lots of little pieces theyve got so many different things with it now   right well thats one thing theyve got theyve got every type of imaginable camping on the beach and all of these come with oh like little tiny tiny little plates and little sunglasses and uh my three and a half year old has wanted this   goodness   Ken doll and so i finally got her a Ken doll and uh less than a week later the arm was broken   oh dear   but they were real good about replacing it thats one nice thing is theyre real good about replacing it   well uh i guess if theyll replace them then they assume they shouldnt have broken   right well the the you know those little arms are supposed to twist almost any way and shes not that strong that i would   any direction um umhum   shes not that big of a girl that i think could really  take a grip on it like a bigger kid could you know   right yeah the main thing that theyve they had when my daughter was playing with Barbies was just clothes you know that was about it   yes that was about it and the Barbie doll itself is usually pretty durable   umhum   and that kind of stuff but   and the main thing my kids are seem to be into nowadays are electronics my my children are twenty one and twenty five and twenty eight   oh is that right well do you see that theres a little big problem with electronic things   umhum and so no not really we uh havent had that much you know problem with things that we have bought they seem to to last in fact when they offer us extended warranties we we dont buy them because weve   dont buy them because you dont need them   we dont we find we dont need them and uh it seems like its just a an added tack on plus a lot of their credit cards now you know will guarantee   yes   if you purchase on your credit card you know then they extended put an extended warranty on it if it doesnt work and and uh or if you have a problem with it in a certain period of time so it seems like its a waste of money   oh yes thats the way yes well you almost assume if youre gonna have problems with it its usually before before that warranty would expire any the first one   umhum and like ive even bought on a recliner once i bought you know a a an extended warranty for cleaning and stuff like that and i never used it   you never never even needed it   and so they it seems ridiculous and like  washers and dryers and things like that ive never had one go out in fact they usually when they do go out its either something my husband can buy the part and fix and we dont even have a repairman come or it means its old enough that its time to replace the whole thing umhum   its time to replace it yes i i think these extended warranties are gimmicks really   so i mean theyre i do too   a lot of it we bought when we first married we bought one on our TV and that there was it was a five year after the first five years and that was ridiculous   umhum and they charge you a pretty good price for them too   yes theyre a pretty healthy price and youre trying to think oh maybe ill need this you never you always think gosh if i say no then i wont you know   umhum   but   well my husband finally just put his foot down and he said were not gonna buy any of these anymore and if it goes out well you know   i dont know if you probably got your time worth out of it anyway   umhum and uh so uh we really have been fairly happy with with things but now we take good care of things and we dont um run out and buy a lot of of things either and since our kids arent little anymore im not buying a lot of those little things that can get broken   yes the little well you probably are real careful of the brands you buy and the when you do buy things you probably watch what kind of type of quality yes   well you look at the consumer guide and uh you go around and you look at the different ones and find the ones that have the
