                okay so Frank what uh type of uh budget do you or your family have   well uh i dont know that we really have a budget i have a set amount that i that i save actually well actually there is a a way uh we budget our our money apparently uh my wife uh has so much uh you know gets so much to do shopping with every couple of weeks and uh we allot each of us so much money per week for our personal stuff gas and things like that and besides that i uh you know i have a set amount that i save every every month   right thats thats sounds like uh probably a tighter controlled budget than what i have  im single so i guess   uhhuh uhhuh   uh i dont know if thats an excuse for not having a tight budget but i basically   really dont need to   right i dont need to im the only that i have to keep track of so it makes it a little bit easier   uh thats right   um and also i you know i try to save a certain amount each month as well and uh   umhum   i kind of i kind of have an idea of what my expenses are and i im pretty consistent from month to month   uhhuh   and uh whenever i need to uh you know whenever that changes im pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it   right well i found that uh you know things as as ive gotten older im in my fifties now but before we use to have to have to very have a very strict budget i had four kids and uh you know we we planned out how much were going to spend for food and how much for for this and for that and kind of anticipate how much things were going to be and uh i guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting i do now is that i set aside uh like i kind of fence off areas of my check book for instance there are certain things that i know will come up uh every so often every six months i have to pay car insurance uh every six months i have to pay my taxes so i take a set amount ive got a money market account that i do a lot of uh saving in and i also have got a checking account besides that but   umhum   what i do on my money market account for my taxes for instance which amount to uh an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month ill just take two hundred and twenty out and i put it in parenthesis i take it out of the right line total   umhum   and put it in parenthesis in there and let it build up every month i add two hundred and twenty dollars to it and then when the tax bill comes in ive got that much set aside   right   and i guess thats a way of budgeting   yeah thats i guess i kind of do a similar thing more medium uh medium or longer range i just have a maybe a target amount that ill save for like im probably within a year id like to buy a new car   umhum   so i kind of have uh an amount in my mind and im making every effort to to  put a little bit away and you know increase the amount i need for a down payment or whatever   uhhuh yeah uh cars are are definitely something that you have to figure into your budget not only for buying them but for for keeping them on the road too   right   um you know weve got two cars my wife has a car and i and i like to drive a pick up truck so were on a schedule where i try every uh three or four years to to buy a new one and you know im constantly making car payments but i figure thats got to be the story of my life anyway is making car payments   umhum   so uh you know i get one paid for and uh actually im saving up for another one besides so   hm   its you you know its its kind of a never ending thing but you try to you try to schedule those things so that   right   uh youre only youre not paying for two at the same time i guess what im saying   right have you thought about uh leasing   well ive thought about it but leasing wouldnt i you know i dont use it for my business my wife uses hers just for pleasure and i use mine just to go back and forth to work which is only ten miles away so   i see right but if youre rolling it over every three years it might be advantageous to do that     yeah i guess uh   you know typically you  if you purchase your own car you tend to make uh the best returns after you pay it off of course you know the longer you keep it beyond that point the more profitable it is to own it yourself   uhhuh right yeah youre right um i i have uh been know to keep trucks or cars for oh ten or twelve years but i find that after about four years they kind of start going down hill and you got to put put stuff into them you know   thats right  yeah mines uh seven years old and i think last year was that was a rough year for it i had expenses a number of expenses     uhhuh   but uh im hoping that most most of them were just kind of uh you know the as you get to a certain number of miles you have to get everything replaced brake shocks and all that so i just went through that whole set last year   umhum   and im hoping ill be have a slow period before i need that again   those things can really upset your budget when they when they come in uh you know its nice to have a little bit set aside for the for the unexpected shall we say   right   so that it doesnt uh kill you all in one month   right what line of work are you in
