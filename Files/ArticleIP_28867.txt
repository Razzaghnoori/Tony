 Pronouns and Transsexuality Please send your questions for publication to prudence slate com Dear Prudence Here is an odd one for you I am a transsexual woman postoperative many facial surgeries voice surgery I am a manager and programmer Most of the time people have no idea but in the work environment everyone eventually knows Most people are fine with it but a few always men choose to act out in spectacularly inappropriate ways The worst is in meetings with clients where a male manager will refer to me repeatedly as he This of course makes no sense to the client who has no idea why the professional woman across the table is being referred to as a man Things I have tried include taking the offender aside to ask that he use my given name Jess or Jessica as he wishes instead of pronouns If we re not in a client meeting and I have the clout I sometimes take the person down on the spot in the nicest way I can Any cool suggestions or ideas Jess Dear Madame If anyone has earned the right to the feminine title it is you Prudie offers the following ideas to eliminate the insensitive hostility You could send a memo in house stating that if the pronoun problem persists you will take your gussied up self along with your skills to another firm If it is a practical impossibility to leave you might consider going to the person s superior and registering a formal complaint If you have the figurative stones for it you might respond to the digs made in front of clients with a remark such as You have to make allowances for so and so English as a second language can be so confusing In other words throw the discomfort on the other guy The outsiders will not know what to make of the byplay and Prudie guesses the needler will clam up Maybe with the head on sparring you can train these jerks one by one Prudie supportively Dear Prudence My 24 year old girlfriend has a roommate also 24 The roommate s boyfriend has lived in their apartment 2 br 1 bath for four months He is 30 gainfully employed Price Waterhouse and pays no rent Not a pizza not a thank you The roommate s defense is He is my BF and stays in my room How do you collect rent due And how much Concerned in Atlanta Dear Con Who wants to know You have no standing in this deal If however you have been deputized to ask on behalf of your GF she s in a bit of a bind unless the lease stipulates how many people may occupy the flat Her only hope if she is unhappy with the perpetual houseguest is to advise the official roommate that 1 the threesome is not a comfortable arrangement for her or 2 the guest is a de facto resident and should share the expenses to the tune of one third She might also consider moving Prudie practically Dear Prudie I am a Ph D psychologist who does consulting at a local psychiatric hospital While most of the staff there call me Dr Moore there are some who call me by my first name I wouldn t mind this so much in private but it s not good in front of the patients Much of my work is with severely disturbed people and requires that I testify in court to request civil commitment For reasons of both ego and personal safety I would prefer to be called by my title particularly in front of my patients I can t think of a way to request this without seeming overly impressed with myself and my degrees Keep in mind that none of them would ever call the psychiatrists by their first names How do I request this politely and without appearing to be a snob Sincerely yours Stymied Dear Sty You request it in a memo and with an explanation It is quite likely that those calling you Joe are unaware of your reasons for wishing to be called Dr Prudie does not grasp however how use of your last name provides greater safety than your first It is the last name after all that is listed in a phone book Perhaps your concern is that some patients are hearing both names used In any case good luck It should not be too difficult to get things your way Prudie honorifically Dear Prudence My son is being married in October One of my dear friends is not invited because she is my friend not my son s I did not feel it was appropriate to invite her due to the limitations placed on my son and his fiancee with respect to the number of guests invited Two other friends who have been very much a part of my son s life are livid that I did not insist on this woman being invited I feel any pressure I can take off these two kids is in their best interest What do you think Also I wondered when having a wedding shower if it s appropriate to invite people who are out of state and obviously aren t going to come to a shower Some friends say it s fine I feel it s soliciting a gift I d be interested in your feedback Wanda Dear Wan As to the good friend of yours who doesn t particularly have any relationship with your son Prudie understands the constraints when putting on a wedding But she also thinks there s got to be a way to squeeze in just one more Bear in mind that all those invited surely will not come And of course both the bride s and groom s side can keep expanding the just one more ploy but if it s really just one more Prudie thinks it is doable If you are close to this woman she ought to be there As for the shower invitations to out of state friends Prudie agrees with you that such invitations are really invoices Though the happy day is some months away Prudie sends best wishes and congratulations to the young couple and tranquil thoughts to both sets of parents Prudie matrimonially
