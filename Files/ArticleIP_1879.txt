 Forgetting the Present George Santayana predicted an unfortunate fate for those who cannot remember the past What would he say about political leaders who cannot even remember the present Take for example President Clinton s promise in his Democratic Convention speech repeated more than once in Sunday night s debate that he would offset the harsh effects of the recently passed welfare rollback by giving businesses a tax credit for every person hired off welfare and kept employed What a can t miss idea The very words fairly glow tax credit businesses off welfare employed Trouble is we already have such a tax credit it just got renewed as part of the minimum wage bill and it s a proven failure The Targeted Jobs Tax Credit a k a the Work Opportunity Tax Credit has been a ghastly disappointment ever since it was enacted in 1978 Early analysis showed that most employers using it didn t hire more or different people Instead they simply got their accountants to review personnel records at year s end to see who among recent hires might qualify for the tax credit Tighter rules have presumably curbed that abuse but far more damaging findings emerged from a couple of controlled experiments in Dayton Ohio and two cities in Wisconsin To their surprise and dismay researchers found that when eligible job seekers welfare recipients and other categories of disadvantaged workers were sent off to potential employers bearing in hand the tax credits or vouchers that labeled them as high risk cases they were less likely far less likely to find jobs than if they just applied on their own And that was back when the tax credit was considerably more generous than it is now From these and other studies says Brookings economist Gary Burtless who participated in many of them we can safely conclude that sending someone out in the market saying Hire me I m for sale is a bad idea For that matter so are all the efforts to engineer social and economic behavior through the tax code of which Clinton is so enamored the embellished tax preferences for buying and selling homes having a child or putting one in day care sending the kids to college or going back yourself saving up for a nursing home and so on There s so much evidence on this point that in 1986 both parties in Congress agreed that tax subsidies are at best an inefficient way to promote desired behavior since most of the money goes to pay for things that are going to happen anyway At worst they are a complete rip off since they are almost impossible for the IRS to monitor Congress gave the tax code a much needed cleanup job with lower rates as the reward and everyone promised they wouldn t junk it up again But that was 10 long years ago and no one would expect a politician to remember that far back Let s return to the forgotten present Attention deficit disorder is also afflicting the Dole team On the campaign trail Dole was still calling for the misbegotten Homemaker IRA a week after it had passed into law Dole has apparently not forgotten his own past record on taxes he correctly if ineffectually pointed out during Sunday s debate that his 1982 tax bill was not a true tax hike as normally understood but primarily a canceling of corporate tax breaks not yet in place and crackdowns on cheaters to collect taxes already owed He did fail to note that the Social Security bailout of the early 80s about which he also bragged repeatedly included a large tax increase But Dole s grasp of specifics seemed a lot less secure when it came to defending his current plan to cut taxes by some 550 billion over the next six years while still balancing the budget Clinton also managed to forget the incredible elements in his own seven year budget balancing plan as he touted it repeatedly during the debate The architects of Dole s tax plan argue that critics have paid far too much attention to the relatively modest supply side feedback effects counted on to pump up tax collections by promoting growth and reducing tax avoidance The real guts they contend lie in the promised budget cuts which since they amount to a mere nickel out of every dollar of cut able programs over the six year period are surely an easily achievable target A mere nickel Piece o cake Or at least you might think so if last week s action in Washington escaped your attention Congress and the president indulged in a round of mutual self congratulation over their agreement on an appropriations package for the new fiscal year You guys did such a great job President Clinton told congressional leaders as they finished up on their work You should really be proud Gee and they didn t have to close down the government even once Just one small detail that might have given Dole and his illustrious advisers a moment s pause The appropriations measures while restrained by recent standards nonetheless weigh in at probably 16 billion over the target the GOP Congress set for domestic discretionary spending only a year ago The Republicans will argue the shortfall isn t that big because they are going to cover some of it by onetime savings dipping into the bank insurance funds never mind the S L collapse that was eons ago and of course selling off part of the broadcast spectrum the most oversold commodity since the Brooklyn Bridge Didn t anyone remind them that Dole had already reserved the spectrum sale to help pay for his tax cut plan A 16 billion discrepancy may not seem much when measured against the total budget with all its sacrosanct or unavoidable obligations But it s a significant shortfall if you are sufficiently present minded to recall that Congress and the president have separately committed themselves to mammoth and almost entirely unspecified cuts in the magical year of 2002 when the budget is to alight if only for a moment on balance And it is on top of these cuts before the first small step of which the Congress and the president just blinked that the additional Dole cuts are to be made an amount totaling close to 40 percent of the vulnerable part of the budget Assuming the bare bones basic functions of government are to be maintained where then will be the room for any border control guards or anti terrorism measures or Head Start or education grants or peanut subsidies or national parks or disaster relief let alone the enhancements that Congress deemed so necessary this October No doubt as former Congressional Budget Office Director Bob Reischauer points out with all the election year pressure on Republicans to show they really aren t so bad and the temptation for Clinton to show his newfound muscle the final appropriations package isn t bad That is as Reischauer quickly adds if budget balance is your prime desire and you believe that cuts in discretionary spending are the way to go But that of course is the real and present issue that neither congressional party addressed transfixed as they and the media are by the fantasy budgets offered on the campaign trail by their respective standard bearers A budget is not a mere political prop Whether by design or inadvertence it s the end product of politics the actual blueprint for government s role in society This budget makes some big if dubious choices if only implicitly The Pentagon gets an extra 9 4 billion this year with more to come for weapons systems and other sundries it doesn t want only a few weeks after another set of committees decided to cut 21 2 billion from programs for the needy over this and the next two years But most important choices were not made Social Security s problems won t be manifest until the next century but it would be both easier and kinder to start making modest reforms now Medicare on the other hand is exploding right now So for that matter is the world s population But overseas family planning programs despite minor restoration were left at a funding level more than a third below that of a few years ago Political leaders are often faulted for living in the past or ignoring the future We d be lucky if ours simply got a firm hold on the here and now
