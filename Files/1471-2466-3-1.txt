 Background Human T lymphotropic virus type I HTLV I has been associated with sporadic cases of chronic bronchiolitis and alveolitis especially in patients with concurrent HTLV associated myelopathy HAM 1 2 HTLV type II HTLV II has been epidemiologically associated with increased incidences of bronchitis and pneumonia among HTLV II infected persons 3 4 Biological studies have demonstrated increased levels of CD3 CD25 lymphocytes 5 HTLV I proviral load and HTLV I tax rex mRNA expression 6 7 HTLV I specific IgA 8 soluble interleukin 2 receptors 9 beta chemokines 7 and soluble intracellular adhesion molecule 1 ICAM 1 10 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from HTLV I infected humans In addition mice transgenic for HTLV I p40 tax had lymphocytic infiltration of peribronchial and perivascular lung tissues associated with intrapulmonary expression of tax mRNA 11 In general patients with HTLV myelopathy or uveitis had more pronounced biological changes but some of these studies also found biological changes in the lungs of asymptomatic HTLV I carriers However whether HTLV I or HTLV II alters pulmonary function is unknown Such information is important because the pathologic spectrum of these chronic human retroviral infections has not been completely described In addition such information would be useful to physicians who must counsel or treat persons found to be HTLV I or II seropositive by serologic screening at the time of blood donation military service or as part of clinical care associated with injection drug use We therefore performed standardized pulmonary function testing PFT on HTLV I and HTLV II infected persons participating in the HTLV Outcomes Study HOST a prospective multicenter cohort study of the health outcomes of HTLV infection that was initiated as part of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study Methods Study design and patient population The enrollment and follow up procedures of the HOST have been described in detail elsewhere 4 In brief persons found to be seropositive for HTLV I and HTLV II at the time of routine or autologous blood donation in 1990 1992 at five United States blood centers were eligible for enrollment HTLV I and HTLV II infection status was confirmed with type specific serology and or polymerase chain reaction testing Subjects have been followed approximately every two years with health history questionnaires physical examinations and blood testing At the third biennial visit in 1995 1997 we performed PFT on a randomly selected subset of HTLV I and II positive subjects at four of the five HOST centers American Red Cross Blood Services Southeastern Michigan Detroit MI American Red Cross Blood Services Southern California Los Angeles CA Blood Centers of the Pacific San Francisco CA and the Oklahoma Blood Institute Oklahoma City OK We also selected seronegative subjects at the same four centers by strata based upon the age sex and racial distribution of the HTLV positive subjects and asked them to undergo PFT PFT Procedures In performing the PFTs we followed standards published by the American Thoracic Society 12 Spirometers were calibrated according to these standards and subjects performed three forced expirations We measured forced vital capacity FVC in liters forced expiratory volume at one second FEV 1 diffusing lung capacity corrected for hemoglobin DLCO corr and diffusing lung capacity corrected for hemoglobin and alveolar ventilation DLCO corr VA Each subject s best effort as judged by the highest sum of vital capacity and FEV 1 from among three expiratory efforts was used in the analysis Statistical analysis For each of the pulmonary function measures means and 95 percent confidence intervals were calculated The mean of each parameter was compared between the HTLV I HTLV II and seronegative groups using ANOVA tests PROC GLM Outcome variables FVC FEV1 DLCO corr and DLCO corr VA were all treated as continuous variables in the model Multivariable analysis was performed using linear regression adjusting for age quartiles 40 41 47 47 53 and 54 gender male or female race ethnicity White Black Hispanic Asian other smoking history nonsmokers ex smokers and current smokers and weight study population quartiles 66 kg 67 78 kg 79 88 5 kg and 88 5 kg The model evaluated differences in pulmonary function parameters and their statistical significance when all important confounders such as smoking and characteristics of the study subjects were taken into consideration Due to the limited number of subjects we were unable to stratify the analysis by center Nonetheless power calculations revealed that the study was able to detect a 10 percent difference compared to seronegatives in the parameters measured with power 1 beta of 0 65 to 0 85 for HTLV I and 0 82 to 0 96 for HTLV II All analyses were done using SAS SAS version 6 12 Cary NC For each of the pulmonary function measures means and 95 percent confidence intervals were calculated The mean of each parameter was compared between the HTLV I HTLV II and seronegative groups using ANOVA tests Multivariable analysis adjusted for age gender race ethnicity smoking history and weight was performed using linear regression Due to the limited number of subjects we were unable to stratify the analysis by center Power calculations revealed that relative to the seronegatives the study was able to detect a 10 percent decrease in the parameters measured with power 1 beta of 0 65 to 0 85 for HTLV I and 0 82 to 0 96 for HTLV II All analyses were done using SAS SAS version 6 12 Cary NC The Committee on Human Research of the University of California San Francisco San Francisco CA USA has approved the study Results Among the 258 subjects enrolled in the study one subject had only one instead of three expiratory efforts recorded This subject was eliminated from further analysis leaving a study population of 257 none had adult T cell leukemia or HTLV associated myelopathy The HTLV I and HTLV II subjects were comparable to seronegative subjects with regard to age gender and race ethnicity except that HTLV I subjects were somewhat older and more likely to be of black race ethnicity and to be former smokers Table 1 Although the three groups were of similar height HTLV I infected subjects had a non significant trend toward lower body weight Thirty one percent of the HTLV II subjects were current smokers compared to only 11 percent of the HTLV I and seronegative groups Dating from study enrollment in 1990 92 incident cases of medically diagnosed pneumonia or acute bronchitis were reported by 22 percent of HTLV I 33 percent of HTLV II and 21 percent of seronegative subjects in the current analysis Data on log 10 proviral load were available from 38 of 46 HTLV I subjects mean 2 97 standard error 0 24 copies per PBMC and from 67 of 84 HTLV II subjects mean 3 46 standard error 0 21 copies per PBMC Mean standard deviation pulmonary function values among all 257 subjects were as follows FVC 3 74 0 89 L FEV 1 2 93 0 67 L DLCO corr 23 82 5 89 ml min mmHg alveolar ventilation VA 5 25 1 20 L and DLCO corr VA 4 54 0 87 ml min mmHg L These data were comparable to mean values for men and women combined reported by the First National Health and Nutrition Examination NHANES I of FVC 3 82 FEV 1 2 94 and DLCO corr 26 605 13 In our study FVC and FEV 1 were also corrected for height squared in meters yielding values of 1 34 0 24 L m 2and 1 05 0 20 L m 2 respectively There was also no significant difference in small airway flow FEF 25 75 between HTLV infected and seronegatives p 0 47 data not shown Figures 1through 4show the raw pulmonary function values stratified by HTLV status The HTLV I group had slightly lower mean FVC FEV 1 and DLCO corr than did the seronegative group but no such difference was apparent for the HTLV II group The results of the multivariable linear regression analysis are presented in Table 2 For both FVC and FEV1 adjusted for height squared mean values were only minimally smaller for the HTLV I group and no different at all for the HTLV II group both compared to HTLV seronegatives For DLCO corr the HTLV I group had mean values that were about ten percent lower and the HTLV II group about five percent lower compared to seronegatives However these differences narrowed after adjustment for potential confounding variables and neither was statistically significant although there was a trend toward lower adjusted DLCOcorr for the HTLV I group DLCO corrected for alveolar ventilation DLCO corr VA showed no differences between both HTLV groups and seronegatives in either the unadjusted or the multivariable analysis Finally there was no association between DLCO and the level of HTLV I or HTLV II proviral load among the HTLV seropositives data not shown Discussion This study did not reveal significant differences between HTLV I or II infected and uninfected persons in pulmonary function or diffusing capacity after adjustment for confounding variables This normal pulmonary function data are in contrast to previous reports of bronchio alveolitis and differences in biological measurements in broncho alveolar lavage fluid among persons with HTLV I infection 1 7 Most previous reports of HTLV I bronchio alveolitis reported more frequent and severe pathological and biological abnormalities of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in patients with HTLV myelopathy or uveitis compared to HTLV I carriers without apparent disease 6 8 14 Since our patients were without overt inflammatory disease we cannot comment on potential pulmonary function abnormalities in patients with clinical inflammation Likewise a rare case of bronchio alveolitis among our study group could have had pulmonary function abnormalities that were masked by our comparison of mean values among the HTLV I HTLV II and seronegative groups Finally our subjects could have had clinical or subclinical pulmonary inflammation due to HTLV I or HTLV II infection but this inflammation was not of sufficient severity or duration to manifest measurable decrements in overt pulmonary function Data from the cohort study from which these subjects were drawn has revealed an increased incidence of pneumonia and acute bronchitis among HTLV II and to a lesser degree HTLV I infected humans 3 4 Those results were based upon analyses of reported physician diagnoses of these illnesses and were adjusted statistically to account for differences in socioeconomic status cigarette smoking and alcohol intake between HTLV infected and uninfected subjects Although we initially attributed these illnesses to an increased susceptibility to bacterial infection we now propose the hypothesis that these diagnoses may have been due to immunological mechanisms as in cases of HTLV I bronchio alveolitis The negative results of current study although reassuring to persons with HTLV I or HTLV II infection cannot exclude either of these hypotheses Strengths of the current study include its setting in a well characterized cohort study of humans with laboratory confirmed HTLV I and HTLV II infection and the inclusion of an appropriate control group Due to information gathered in the cohort study we were also able to control for other potential confounding variables such as cigarette smoking and alcohol intake Weaknesses include moderate size of the study which made us unable to detect PFT differences that were less than about ten percent PFT s were done at four different sites which could have resulted in increased variability of the results The PFTs that we used may be insensitive to minor degrees of pulmonary damage and with this cross sectional data we may have missed a progressive loss of pulmonary function over time in the HTLV groups Conclusions In conclusion this moderate size study did not reveal any statistically significant differences in pulmonary function between generally healthy HTLV I or II infected persons and comparable HTLV seronegatives However it could not rule out subtle differences in lung inflammation that might lead to functional impairment over a longer follow up period Further studies of the immunologic characteristics of bronchoalveolar lavage cells from HTLV I or II infected humans are needed especially in persons with a history of recurrent pneumonia or acute bronchitis but without myelopathy or uveitis Competing interests None declared Author s contributions Study Design Murphy Ameti Patient Accrual
