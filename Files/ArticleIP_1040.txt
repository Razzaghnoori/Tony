 The IRS Besides taxes themselves Bob Dole has made a campaign issue of the tax collector And along with taxes he pledges to cut the tax collection bureaucracy In fact he has compared the Internal Revenue Service to the KGB the old Soviet secret police and promises to end the IRS as we know it Apart from the taxes themselves does the process of collecting them impose an unreasonable burden on the American citizenry Tax forms About one third of filers use either the 1040EZ or the 1040A forms Both are for people with taxable incomes of less than 50 000 and few or no complications and some people can fill them out in a few minutes The regular 1040 the long form is for those with taxable incomes over 50 000 a year who claim credits or deductions realize capital gains and or file separately from their spouses The IRS estimates that this form takes almost 12 hours to complete About half of the total taxpaying population 58 8 million files the long form In recent years the IRS has adopted faster high tech methods of filing If you qualify for the 1040EZ form are single with no dependents and live at the same address as you did last year you can file over the telephone using the TeleFile system a process that takes about 10 minutes In 1996 the first year in which TeleFile was widely available 2 8 million people 2 4 percent used it Taxpayers can file any type of 1040 form electronically and 10 percent of taxpayers did so in 1996 Another 6 percent filed a 1040PC form meaning that they worked out their taxes using a personal computer About three quarters of taxpayers get a refund meaning that they paid too much over the course of the year For tax year 1995 the IRS received 116 3 million returns and sent out 88 7 million refunds The average turnaround for refunds is 38 days for paper forms and 21 days for returns filed telephonically and electronically Dole has promised to rein in auditors calling their methods crass and callous Since the IRS relies on self reported income it audits returns to ensure payment Compliance is far from perfect In 1992 the most recent numbers an estimated 94 billion went unpaid out of about 551 billion owed in personal income taxes In other words 17 cents almost one fifth of every dollar of personal taxes owed goes uncollected In fiscal year 1995 the IRS completed 1 9 million audits an audit rate of 1 67 percent But 1995 was unusually high especially for low income filers because of two special compliance programs including a crackdown on widespread abuse of the Earned Income Tax Credit The audit rate usually averages just above 1 percent or one out of every 100 taxpayers In 1995 the IRS audited 2 percent of those with incomes of less than 25 000 1 percent of those between 25 000 and 100 000 and almost 3 percent of those whose incomes topped 100 000 Owing the government money is not like owing anyone else The IRS has special weapons for collecting taxes that are overdue plus penalties and interest These weapons include a tax lien on the taxpayer s property In 1995 the government filed 799 000 notices of federal tax liens The government can also levy property held by third parties such as wages or money deposited in a bank and served 2 7 million notices of levy in 1995 A lien claims property only as security against a debt while a levy actually takes it Finally the government can seize property and sell it to collect what it is owed It made 11 000 such seizures in 1995 The IRS can also sue for tax fraud It initiated 3 698 criminal fraud investigations in 1995 The courts convicted 1 945 people and 1 387 went to prison Taxpayers who feel they re being cheated can also take the IRS to court which happened 11 000 times in 1995 Bob Dole proposes to cut the number of IRS bureaucrats by 30 percent by 1999 At the close of 1995 114 000 people worked for the IRS These people will collect about 1 4 trillion in taxes this year About 19 000 17 percent are auditors and another 8 000 are revenue officers charged with collecting unpaid taxes interest and penalties The remaining 74 percent process tax returns provide help to taxpayers and carry out other administrative and adjudicative functions The budget of the IRS in 1995 was 7 63 billion 4 24 billion of which went to tax law enforcement Recent congressional actions have moved the IRS in the direction Dole wants to take it The fiscal year 1997 budget shrinks the IRS appropriation by 342 million Furthermore Congress recently passed a Taxpayer Bill of Rights that makes it easier for taxpayers to sue the IRS and increases the amount of damages that can be collected in these suits It also increases the IRS responsibility to notify taxpayers when it is going to conduct enforcement action and creates other new procedural rights for taxpayers In 1982 Dole called for increasing the IRS staff in order to collect more unpaid taxes According to the IRS every dollar spent on enforcement brings in a return of 4 in revenue
