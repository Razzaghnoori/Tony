 Weld vs Helms Bill Weld the former Republican governor of Massachusetts wants the Senate to consider his nomination to be U S ambassador to Mexico Jesse Helms the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee wants to stop him Last week Weld quit his job to go to Washington to lobby for his cause Through surrogates interviews and press conferences the two men are waging a war of words This war isn t bound by strict rules of logic but it s more intellectual than an arm twisting match It s a contest of conceptualization and persuasion Whichever player successfully frames the questions at stake will capture public opinion and political support and thereby win So far the war has been waged on four fronts 1 Drugs vs social policy Helms has stuck doggedly to a single issue drugs He points out that Weld favors legalizing marijuana for medical purposes which conservatives place on the slippery slope toward complete legalization favors providing addicts with clean needles to prevent the spread of AIDS and that he prosecuted few drug cases as a U S attorney In short says Helms Weld is soft on drugs the last thing we need in an ambassador to Mexico Weld could reply that he had opposed California s medical marijuana initiative because it was too lax or that Helms is a pusher for tobacco or that it might be a good idea to stop treating Mexico s drug problem as a war But Weld hasn t touched the drug question How come One rule of the frame game is to avoid issues on which you re guaranteed to lose This isn t an Ivy League debating society where you can win by ingeniously defending a difficult position In politics you re in deep trouble as soon as you question the war on drugs This is particularly true if you re fighting for a job in the Clinton administration where insecurity over the drug war runs high Just ask Joycelyn Elders Rather than answer Helms charge Weld shifted and broadened the conflict On July 15 he called a press conference to declare Sen Helms opposition has nothing whatsoever to do with drug policy It has everything to do with the future of the Republican Party In plain language I am not Sen Helms kind of Republican I do not pass his litmus test on social policy Nor do I want to Overnight the Weld Helms standoff became a media sensation This wasn t just about drugs reporters concluded It was about Helms distaste for Weld s moderate views on social issues such as abortion With that the advantage swung to Weld While Helms has the more popular position on drugs Weld has the more popular position on abortion Helms spokesman Marc Thiessen resisted this maneuver He insisted Helms concern was drugs not ideology The evidence backs Thiessen up Helms supported pro choice Republican Bill Cohen of Maine for secretary of defense and has offered to confirm Weld as ambassador to a country without a major marijuana problem such as India But in the frame game such petty facts are easily overwhelmed by larger themes Weld s spin prevails for several reasons To begin with Weld s argument fits nicely into the context of recent Republican infighting Having come apart over foreign policy trade with China and fiscal policy the House leadership coup the Republicans seem ripe for a civil war over social policy Furthermore the Washington press corps never tires of writing about Republican troubles on abortion and gay rights though Helms hasn t mentioned either issue in connection with Weld since the confirmation fight began Above all the press loves to personalize debates Drug policy is boring but a fight between a saucy blue blood and a surly redneck is fun Helms wasn t even the first member of Congress to oppose Weld s nomination Others who oppose Weld have pleaded that Helms isn t the point It s a futile argument Helms and his famous wedge issues are just too colorful 2 Ideology vs competence Congressional Republicans who support Weld s nomination don t want their party torn asunder in the process Their solution is to separate the question of Weld s ideology from his competence They point out that he speaks Spanish knows Mexico and is smart and accomplished This is not about the heart and soul of the Republican Party argued Rep Chris Shays R Conn in a TV debate July 28 It s about whether this nominee is competent to serve in Mexico Helms supporters accept this distinction because it subverts Weld s campaign to broaden the ideological confrontation They argue that Weld s indifference toward the war on drugs has affected his competence as a law enforcer and will do so again if he becomes ambassador to Mexico Weld however maintains the fight is about the party s soul even as Republican moderates protest it isn t The Helms Shays argument for a distinction between ideology and competence is analytically more sophisticated but viscerally less compelling Which means it will probably prevail in a confirmation hearing but lose in the court of public opinion vanquished by Weld s campaign for libertarian martyrdom In the frame game nuance is almost always a loser Remember the last guy to argue for a distinction between ideology and competence was Michael Dukakis Perversely Weld lost the ideology competence battle by winning the drugs morality battle Not only did he attack Helms July 15 but he deliberately embarrassed the White House which had refrained from quarreling with Helms by calling on Clinton to speak up for his confirmation Weld s caustic apostasy handed his enemies a persuasive argument against his fitness for the job that he s undiplomatic 3 Who started the fight Every kid knows that when a parent catches you fighting with another kid the first thing to do is accuse the other kid of starting it Weld should have been able to play the victim since Helms arguably started the fight by announcing in June that he would deny Weld a hearing But Weld blew this moral advantage by attacking Helms July 15 It wasn t the first punch thrown but it was the first one most people saw This allowed Helms spokesman to cast his boss as the victim Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott R Miss latched on to this as an excuse to side with Helms Weld hurt himself by attacking the chairman unfairly and with political rhetoric that was just uncalled for Lott complained Belatedly Weld is trying to regain the moral high ground On July 29 he pleaded Before I had ever met Helms before the man really knew anything about me he said I was unfit to be ambassador had loose lips and was soft on drugs And I said Where does Jesse Helms get off saying all these mean things about me And people in Washington threw up their hands in alarm and said My goodness he attacked the chairman Weld also has claimed to be a victim of Helms ideological extortion The ideological extortion argument is particularly ingenious Typically extortion means that you re threatening someone with harm or embarrassment to extract a concession Helms has no illusions that he can make Weld concede anything His vow to kill Weld s nomination is a promise not a threat It s Weld who s trying to scare Republicans into supporting him by threatening to turn his fight with Helms into an ideological civil war His charge of ideological extortion is part of his ideological extortion And it s succeeding On Aug 3 Sen Dick Lugar R Ind rescued Weld by demanding that he get a hearing lest his jihad against Helms ignite civil war in the Republican Party 4 Substance vs process Having lost the advantage on fronts 2 and 3 Weld has opened a fourth more promising front recently He has stopped debating the substance of his quarrel with Helms and has focused instead on his right to a hearing At a July 28 press conference Weld repeated his favorite question six times I m going to be asking that one insistent question Why should there not be a hearing Why should one man in a democracy block the conduct of the people s business This new message helps Weld in the Senate because it allows Republicans to defend him without exacerbating the party s internal conflicts It certainly emboldened Lugar A Senate chairman cannot be dictatorial ultimately when a majority of the committee a majority of the Senate a majority of the American people want action Lugar said of Helms Aug 3 Likewise the procedural argument allows the White House to challenge Helms obstinacy without appearing to foment the GOP s identity crisis Clinton spokesman Mike McCurry who had refused July 21 to comment on matters in the other party was so moved by Weld s new plea for a fair hearing that he repeated that phrase six times at his July 31 press briefing But the true beauty of the give him a hearing argument is that it capitalizes on anti Washington populism In his July 28 press conference Weld decried the Washington rules that allow a single senator to thwart the people s will by refusing to schedule a hearing Framed this way Weld s apostasy becomes a virtue instead of a vice suggesting candor instead of a lack of diplomacy Which player will win the game Helms allies say the nomination is doomed They think Weld overlooked the game s cardinal rule that Congress has its own rules including the absolute power of committee chairmen over supplicants such as Weld Why he s not even a governor anymore they scoff He s just a lowly citizen But maybe they re the ones who have misjudged the game Maybe the era of Ross Perot satellite feeds and blast faxes has ended the invisibility and the certainty of the congressional back room kill Maybe every political fight is a frame game now Even if Citizen Weld can t reach Mexico he can still reach America And maybe that s been his game all along
