                    Background        Translation termination is a crucial step in the process        of information decoding Its accuracy reaches about         and ensures that only very few abnormal products are        synthesised under normal conditions   Conversely        translation termination is widely used by both animal and        plant viruses as a mean of controling expression through        recoding events    Readthrough is the process by        which a stop codon is misread as sense by the translational        apparatus allowing the synthesis of an extended        polypeptide which carries novel activities   Up to now        no specific gene products have been implicated in the        control of translational readthrough strongly suggesting        that only normal interactions between the mRNA and        components of the translational machinery are involved        This differs from the mechanism of selenocysteine        incorporation which requires a whole set of specific        partners including a specific tRNA and a particular        elongation factor   Readthrough can therefore be seen        as programmed translational errors occurring at specific        sequences on the mRNA        Several studies either in vivo or in silico have        analyzed the termination context in mammalian cells            In particular it has been demonstrated that the        nucleotide following the stop codon defined as  is non        random with purines overrepresented for the three stop        codons This   nucleotide in fact plays a key role in        termination efficiency leading to the proposition that        termination is directed by a four base signal          Clearly some programmed readthrough events are based on        alteration of these interactions This is the case in        Sindbis virus where the UGAC sequence which is a very        poorly used stop context in mammals is sufficient to drive        an efficient readthrough    More generally it        has been demonstrated in numerous experimental systems that        the nucleotide at position  plays an important role in        suppression efficiency                 Other nucleotide biases are found around stop signals        nonrandomness being observed at up to eight positions        downstream of the stop codon and three positions upstream          Such biases possibly reflect the existence of        interactions between the mRNA and other components of the        ribosomal machinery which are important for termination        efficiency        Elucidating the mechanisms at play during readthrough        may help understand normal translation termination To        achieve this goal we have analyzed the rules governing        readthrough in mouse cells in culture We focused our        studies on the sequence CAA UAG CAA UUA derived from the        plant Tobbaco Mosaic Virus TMV   This sequence was        previously shown to drive a high level readthrough both in        in vitro systems   and in vivo in plant cells           and yeast    This sequence is also functional in        mammalian cells in culture   We used a highly        sensitive luciferase reporter to study the role of amino        acid identity codon frequency and nucleotide context at        the  and  triplets flanking the stop codon                    Results                  Effect of upstream mutations          An important methodological problem is that changing a          nucleotide could modify several parameters in addition to          nucleotide identity mRNA secondary structure codon          frequency amino acid identity and luciferase molecular          specific activity To overcome the problem of possible          changes in molecular specific activity of the modified          luciferase control constructs were designed in which the          stop codon has been replaced by a CAG glutamine codon As          shown in Table  the activities of the modified          luciferase proteins vary from  to  compared to the          wild type pRSVL reporter emphasizing the importance of          this type of control To differentiate at least some of          the various structural parameters that may be involved in          termination efficiency we generated series of comparable          constructs harboring synonymous codons One can thus          analyze the effect of amino acid identity on readthrough          and assess the effect of codon frequency for a given          amino acid finally the effect of nucleotide identity at          a given position can be studied in different contexts          This last point is crucial since the occurrence of          complex interactions between nucleotides located at          different positions would prevent a consensus sequence          to emerge when analysing the stop codon context at a          genomic level A series of mutations were introduced in          the CAA codon preceeding the stop CAA was changed for          the other glutamine codon CAG for the two histidine          codons CAU and CAC and for the four glycine GGN codons          Results are shown in Figure AB We first examined          whether amino acid identity could interfere with          readthrough In this case one would expect to see only a          weak variation between constructs harboring the same          amino acid Conversely variation should be higher for          different amino acids Comparing the results within a          series and between different series showed that          variation between synonymous codons of the GLY family was          greater than variation from one amino acid to another          These observations ruled out that the identity of the          last amino acid was the main determinant of readthrough          level          Another parameter that might affect readthrough is the          availability of the tRNA decoding the last sense codon          for example through a different ribosome pausing          kinetics Since rare tRNAs generally correspond to rare          codons we checked whether a bias in codon frequency was          correlated with readthrough efficiency Results shown in          Table demonstrate that codon frequency and readthrough          efficiency were not correlated either in the whole set          of data or within a given set of synonymous codons                     As shown by Tate and coworkers nucleotides          surrounding the stop codons are not randomly distributed              In particular a strong bias is observed at          the  position see Figure C Comparing Figure ABto          Figure Cshows that although the infrequent A was          associated with the highest readthrough no correlation          was observed with the other nucleotides          Finally the only parameter that could be correlated          with the readthrough efficiency was the nucleotide          identity at the  position Adenine was associated with          the highest readthrough and uracil with the lowest          Guanine and cytosine gave intermediate values guanine          being in both cases higher than cytosine although this          difference is only significant in the CAN series                          Effect of dowstream mutations          The same two series of constructs were analyzed for          the CAA following the stop CAN and GGN Figure          ABillustrates that in this case the pattern was          strikingly different between the two series For the CAN          series the readthrough efficiency followed the hierarchy          AGUC with A showing a  fold higher          readthrough level than C By contrast for the GGN          series the hierarchy was CUAG with C showing a           fold higher readthrough than G As above we examined the          correlation between nucleotide usage at the variable          position and readthrough efficiency The histogram shown          in Figure Cdemonstrates no correlation between these two          values                          Are these results related to readthrough efficiency                    In this last set of results the readthrough          activities measured for many constructs were very low          around   This raised the general point of whether          the measured enzymatic activities might reflect other          translational events such as sliding internal ribosome          entry or reinitiation To determine whether the observed          patterns were relevant to leaky translation termination          we repeated the GGN upstream and downstream series of          experiments which gave the lowest readthrough values in          the presence of an amber suppressor tRNA   The          experimental scheme was exactly the same except that a          construct allowing expression of the suppressor tRNA was          cotransfected along with the test constructs The results          are shown in Table  A  to  fold increase in          readthrough activities was observed demonstrating that          very high levels of suppression were reached Strikingly          Figure illustrates that the same pattern was obtained          either in the presence or in the absence of UAG          suppressor tRNA This indicates that the results observed          under basal conditions actually corresponded to bona fide          translational readthrough                            Discussion        The mechanisms involved in translation termination are        still not completely understood partly because more        interactions than those required for codonanticodon        recognition are involved In particular proteinRNA and        proteinprotein interactions are other potential targets of        translation termination control Since in vitro translation        may not always accurately reflect the in vivo conditions        we chosed to perform such analyses in living mouse cells        This requires the use of a system that allows the detection        of very low readthrough levels Thus we used a reporter        system bearing i the highly sensitive luciferase reporter        gene ii the powerful RSV LTR promoter           We used the sequence CAA UAG CAA UUA that drives a high        level of translational readthrough in mouse cells in        culture   and introduced targeted mutations in the        sequences surrounding the stop codon We found that single        changes in this sequence were sufficient to decrease        readthrough by up to  fold in vivo We constructed a set        of mutants where changes corresponded to synonymous codons        In this case one can analyze separately at least some of        the different parameters  amino acid identity codon        frequency nucleotide identity  that may be involved in        termination efficiency We were also able to analyze        nucleotide effects in different contexts ie determine        whether a given change would give the same effect in        different sequence environments This last point is crucial        to assess the physiological significance of nucleotide        usage found in stop signal regions        We focused our analysis on two positions which have        already been shown to be involved in termination or        readthrough in eukaryotes but which have not been studied        in mammalian cells so far the nucleotide preceeding the        stop  and the third nucleotide following the stop                  Two sets of modifications were introduced in the CAA        triplet preceeding the stop CAN and GGN We found that the        same amino acid can drive very different readthrough        efficiencies  fold differences between GGA and GGU        suggesting that the amino acid itself does not play a major        role in readthrough efficiency Availability of the tRNA        preceeding the stop is another parameter that could        modulate ribosome pausing   and thus may affect        readthrough Since rare tRNAs generally correspond to rare        codons   we checked whether a bias in codon usage was        correlated with readthrough efficiency This seemed to be        the case for some of the mutants presented here For        example the rare CAA glutamine codon gave a higher        readthrough than the frequent CAG codon However when we        systematically examined codon frequency in parallel with        readthrough efficiency no correlation could be found see        Table  Although we cannot rule out a marginal effect of        codon frequency it is unlikely that it represents the main        determinant of readthrough efficiency        Readthrough efficiency is clearly correlated with the        nucleotide immediately preceeding the stop codon Hence an        adenine in the  position is associated with a high        readthrough while a pyrimidine is associated with a low        readthrough Taken together these results show that there        is a gradation in the observed effect on readthrough        efficiency by which AGY The fact that a rule could        be drawn suggests that relatively simple interactions are        involved possibly between the tRNA in the P site the        incomming potential suppressor tRNA and the message as it        has been shown in yeast   However since the        information on the Glycine Histidine or        Glutamineisoacceptor tRNAs in mouse is not yet available        see M Sprinzl KS Vassilenko J Emmerich F Bauer        Compilation of tRNA sequences and sequences of tRNA        genes        httpwwwunibayreuthdedepartmentsbiochemietrna        this possibility cannot be explored further for the time        being        In a second series of experiments two sets of mutations        were introduced in the triplet following the stop codon        CAA was changed for CAN and for GGN A drastic effect on        readthrough up to  fold was observed In this case        however no uniform rule emerged the hierarchy being        AGUC in the CAN series but CUAG for the GGN        series These contrasted results imply that complex        interactions are taking place downstream of the stop codon        Although the nature of these interactions cannot be deduced        from our results one possibility would be that mRNA        structure is involved in this phenomenon as it is in        numerous translational events   Another obvious        candidate potentially interacting with the stop context is        the release factor eRF   If this is the case one        would predict to be able to obtain mutant forms of eRF        showing a better recognition of poor codon context The        three dimensional structure of eRF has been published        recently and could help to design mutants affected in stop        codon context interaction          It is striking that the CAA UAG CAA UUA sequence directs        a high readthrough in several very different eukaryotes In        plants the readthrough efficiency reaches    a        level similar to what is observed in mouse cells  In        the yeast S cerevisiae it is even more efficient driving        a readthrough of  in a psi strain   and up to         in a PSI strain Olivier Namy and JeanPierre        Rousset unpublished results Furthermore when our        results are compared with those obtained in plant cells and        yeast a similar effect of the nucleotide context is        observed     By contrast this sequence is unable        to drive a significant readthrough activity    in        E coli JPR MC unpublished results see also                      Conclusions        Altogether our results indicate that different signals        are involved in the interaction between the translational        machinery and the upstream and downstream stop codon        contexts In addition they also suggest that the        mechanisms involved in readthrough are common to        eukaryotes pointing to either an ancient origin of the        translation termination machinery or to very strong        structural constraints at the level of the eukaryotic        ribosome Another implication of these observations is that        the readthrough sequence analyzed here although first        described in a plant virus might be used as a recoding        signal also in mammals and yeast Analyzing DNA sequence        data bases should help in identifying such putative        physiological recoding events                    Materials and Methods

   double stranded oligonucleotides were inserted in the          oriented NheIBclI cloning site of the vector In the          pRSVL derived plasmids the luc gene encoding the very          sensitive

Olivier JeanJean it carries the          entire coding sequence and promoter region of a human          tRNA Sergene in which the anticodon has been replaced by          CUA therefore recognizing the UAG stop codon                            Cells          NIH T cells were cultured in Hams F or DMEM          medium supplemented with   fetal calf serum at C in          humidity saturated  CO            in air                          Transfection          One million cells were transfected with  g of each          test vector and  g of the pCH vector using          DNAphosphate coprecipitation Cells were rinsed after          overnight incubation with the DNA and the medium was          changed the next day Cells were harvested on day  and          crude extracts were prepared as described   To check          the effect of suppression the same protocol was used          except that  g of the ptRNAam vector was added just          before the step of DNAphosphate coprecipitation                          Enzyme assays          galactosidase and luciferase were assayed using          standard methods                             Readthrough efficiency quantification          To evaluate readthrough efficiency the luciferase          activity obtained from a test construct was compared to          the activity of the wild type pRSVL vector which was          used as an internal control of each individual          transfection experiment The galactosidase activities          driven by the cotransfected pCH plasmid reflected          transfection efficiencies and were used to standardized          luciferase activities The readthrough level was          expressed as the ratio of standardized activity from the          test construct to the standardized activity from the wild          type pRSVL construct Since luciferase molecular specific          activity may vary depending on the amino acid sequence of          the protein control vectors in which the UAG stop codon          has been replaced by a CAG glutamine codon were similarly          transfected and their activities standardized for          transfection efficiency
