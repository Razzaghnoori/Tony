 Background Major histocompatibility complex class II molecules MHCII are heterodimeric transmembrane glycoproteins that bind antigenic peptides and present such peptides to CD4 T cells Although MHCII are not expressed by the vast majority of studied mouse and human tumors CD4 T lymphocytes specific to MHCII restricted tumor antigens have been found in various cancers 1 Those lymphocytes are believed to be generated in vivo following the recognition of MHCII tumor peptide complexes expressed by host antigen presenting cells and can cause regression of MHCII negative tumors indirectly via secretion of cytokines such as IL 2 or IFNg 2 The released cytokines can recruit and activate cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes and or accessory cells eosinophills macrophages which further mediate tumor destruction It has been recently appreciated that sufficient concentrations of secreted IFNg may also induce susceptible tumors to express the MHCII molecules potentially leading to increased direct contact with CD4 T cells 3 Even though some reports indicate that tumor sensitivity to IFNg is not required to elicit tumor regression 4 it is conceivable that the IFNg induced MHCII expression on tumor cells may boost the effector phase of antitumor responses through additional cytokine release or direct tumor eradication by CD4 T cells Indeed the CD4 T cells that directly destroy MHCII positive tumors were identified 5 In the clinic the expression of MHCII on colorectal carcinomas is correlated with more favourable prognosis 6 Adoptive transfer studies show that ex vivo activated CD4 T cells are able to recognize and to eliminate MHCII positive tumors either by themselves 7 or in co operation with CD8 T cells 8 It has been also demonstrated that the increased MHCII expression on tumor cells and macrophages following treatment with IFNg in vivo was associated with enhanced efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy in a mouse model of metastatic sarcoma 9 Unfortunately the induction of MHCII on tumor cells by IFNg in vivo is difficult 10 In fact the reported inducible tumors seem to be limited to freshly transplanted tumor cells 9 11 or malignant cells present in the ascitic fluid 12 Many tumors do not express MHCII after treatment with recombinant IFNg in vitro either 13 Given the role that MHCII may play in tumor immunity further attempts to restore inducibility in IFNg resistant tumors appear to be warranted In this regard several substances have recently been tested using in vitro models of noninducible tumor cell lines It was reported that some agents e g histone deacetylase inhibitors 14 or DNA methylation inhibitors 15 can rescue the IFNg inducibility of MHCII in cultured tumor cells In this study we explored whether the effect can be achieved by yet another category of modulators the PKC agonists chosen because PKC has been shown to function as an upstream regulator of the MAPK pathway 16 that is involved in both IFNg signal transduction 17 and regulation of gene expression 18 Specifically the influence of a potent PKC activator PMA and clinically tested drug Bryostatin 1 on the IFNg induced MHCII expression in several IFNg resistant tumor cell lines was examined Previously PMA was shown to augment IFNg mediated MHCII expression in MHCII inducible tumor cell lines 19 20 Here we report that the presence of PMA in tissue culture restores IFNg dependent MHCII expression in the poorly responding LS1034 colon carcinoma cell line but fails to produce this effect in two other IFNg resistant cell lines MSTO 211H mesothelioma and HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma We also show that the IFNg dependent MHCII expression in LS1034 cell line can be rescued by clinically acceptable concentrations of Bryostatin 1 Results Induction of MHCII molecules by IFNg in four different tumor cell lines We first compared the induction of MHCII molecules in SW480 LS1034 MSTO 211H and HepG2 tumor cells in response to different concentrations of IFNg MHCII antigens were initially undetectable in all cell lines tested Incubation with as little as 10 2IU ml IFNg induced a 10 fold increase of MHCII specific fluorescence in SW480 colon carcinoma cell line In contrast LS1034 demonstrated only weak 1 4 to 1 6 fold increases in level of MHCII and remained weakly inducible even when concentration of IFNg was increased to 10 4IU ml Figure 1 MSTO 211H mesothelioma cell line also showed a weak induction of MHCII in response to IFNg and HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma was completely non inducible data not shown It should be noted however that we observed a small population of LS1034 cells about 5 10 of all cells that demonstrated a modest 3 to 4 fold increase in MHCII specific fluorescence after incubation with 10 2 10 4IU ml IFNg data not shown This could suggest that a small subset of LS1034 cells might acquire an inducible phenotype at a certain stage of cell differentiation PMA rescues IFNg inducibility of MHCII in low responding LS1034 colon carcinoma cell line We next attempted to restore IFNg inducibility of MHCII in poorly responding tumor cell lines by adding PKC agonist PMA into culture medium containing variable concentrations of IFNg PMA did not improve IFNg inducibility of MHCII in MSTO 211H and HepG2 cell lines data not shown The LS1034 cells on the other hand demonstrated a robust increase in MHCII expression The magnitude of response of LS1034 cells varied greatly from experiment to experiment depending not only on concentration of IFNg but also on concentration of PMA and even on type of the PMA agent DMSO or ethanol Therefore the experiments were arranged in a factorial design for accurate analysis of possible interactive effects For each combination of treatments a 3 letter alphanumeric code was assigned Table 1 Four dose levels of IFNg combined with 5 dose levels of PMA and 2 dose levels of ethanol generated 40 groups and the design was replicated 4 times The results demonstrated a substantial increase in MHCII expression in LS1034 cell line following combined incubation with PMA and IFNg Figure 2 Two factor analysis of variance revealed that the magnitude of MHCII induction in LS1034 cells was almost totally determined by concentration of IFNg F 2 36 29 3 P 10 6 Higher response to IFNg tended to be associated with higher concentration of PMA in some experiments but the overall effect of PMA did not reach a commonly accepted level of significance F 3 36 1 9 P 0 14 Interestingly the effect of PMA did reach significance in cultures supplemented with 172 mM ethanol F 3 36 3 0 P 0 043 groups 09b 12b 15b 18b 21b 24b No interaction effect between PMA and IFNg was found F 6 36 0 14 P 0 99 Since there were no 2 factor interactions several single factor groups were added and data were re analysed by using one way ANOVA Different combinations of PMA and IFNg were compared to the highest dose of IFNg used without PMA group 20a or 20b Multiple comparisons were made using Tukey s HSD test and Scheffe s test the latter test is more conservative Results demonstrate that the expression level of MHCII reached a plateau at 10 3IU ml IFNg in the presence of 10 2 10 4ng ml PMA and 172 mM ethanol Further increases in concentration of IFNg to 10 4IU ml did not result in statistically significant increases of MHCII expression Figure 2B Figure 2also demonstrates that ethanol was totally inactive alone compare group 20a vs 20b but it significantly improved the MHCII induction in the presence of PMA Because of variation between experiments the effect of EtOH could not be seen clearly in Figure 2 For that reason pair wise comparisons were made between cell cultures incubated either with PMA or with a combination of PMA and EtOH Specifically group 09a was compared to group 09b etc Data shown in Figure 3confirm that EtOH significantly improved PMA potentiated response to IFNg Linear regression analysis also revealed that the effect of ethanol was more pronounced at 10 2IU ml IFNg Taken together the above results showed a strong potentiating effect of PMA on IFNg induced HLA DR expression in LS1034 cell line and no changes in two other poorly inducible cell lines Expression levels of IFNg receptors in four different tumor cell lines do not change following incubation with PMA It has been previously shown that potentiating effect of phorbol esters on IFNg dependent MHCII induction in THP 1 monocytic cell line was associated with the increase in synthesis of IFNg receptors 19 For that reason we questioned whether PMA could produce similar changes in LS1034 colon carcinoma cells We compared the expression of alpha and beta chains of IFNg receptor IFNgR1 and IFNgR2 in LS1034 carcinoma and three other tumor cell lines before and after 48 hr incubation with 10 3ng ml PMA and 172 mM ethanol Results plotted in Figure 4 show that untreated and PMA treated tumor cells express about the same levels of IFNgR1 and IFNgR2 Moreover the level of IFNgR1 in HepG2 cells actually drops after exposure to PMA Therefore we conclude that it is unlikely that PMA action in LS1034 carcinoma is mediated through increased synthesis of IFNg receptors Expression of the retinoblastoma protein is not lost in LS1034 MSTO 211H and HepG2 cell lines A substantial percentage of human tumors lose the expression of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein Rb important as a necessary condition for IFNg mediated induction of MHCII 21 Therefore we wished to determine whether the poor IFNg inducibility of MHCII in LS1034 MSTO 211H and HepG2 cell lines could be explained by the loss of Rb Immunofluorescent staining with a Rb specific mAb clone G3 245 demonstrated that all cell lines tested expressed Rb Figure 5 A closer look at Figure 5reveals that the 4 cell lines can be ranked according to their Rb contents in the following order SW480 LS1034 MSTO 211H HepG2 This ranking would be valid only if fluorescence intensity correlates closely with the absolute contents of Rb protein per cell However this may not always be the case For example the number of epitopes recognized by G3 245 mAb may be reduced if tumor cells express viral oncoproteins that bind and inactivate Rb 22 It is important to note that certain mutations greatly reduce transport of newly synthesized Rb molecules into the nucleus where Rb performs its function 23 As the flow cytometry protocol does not allow us to discriminate between cytoplasmic and nuclear staining the question about the presence of functional Rb protein in the examined cell lines remains open Effect of protein kinase inhibitors on physiological and PMA potentiated response to IFNg The discovery of novel non kinase phorbol ester receptors challenges the use of phorbol esters as selective PKC activators 24 Therefore we were interested in whether a member of the PKC family mediated the effect of PMA in LS1034 cells or whether some other proteins could also be involved Specifically we investigated whether two inhibitors staurosporine and GF 109203X could abrogate PMA potentiated response of LS1034 cells to IFNg Staurosporine is a wide spectrum kinase inhibitor and its specificity for PKC isoforms is limited to the 0 1 1 nanomolar range In the 10 100 nM range staurosporine inhibits more than 20 different kinases 25 Data shown in Figure 6demonstrate that staurosporine caused about a 50 inhibition of PMA potentiated response in LS1034 cells at a concentration of 10 nM Complete inhibition occurred at 100 nM A much higher concentration of GF 109203X was required to completely suppress PMA potentiated response in LS1034 cells Physiological IFNg response in SW480 colon carcinoma cells was resistant to inhibition with 1 M GF 109203X and was suppressed only when staurosporine concentration was increased to 1 M We conclude that the PMA effect in LS1034 cell line is most likely mediated by a PKC isoenzyme but other protein kinases that are sensitive to inhibition with 1 M GF 109203X Bryostatin 1 rescues IFNg inducibility of MHCII in LS1034 colon carcinoma cells To evaluate potential clinical implications of our findings we asked whether the IFNg dependent MHCII expression in LS1034 cells could be restored by clinically achievable concentrations of PKC agonists Bryostatin 1 is a potent PKC activator that has undergone extensive clinical testing for the treatment of hematological malignancies and solid tumors 27 Animal studies show that the concentration of Bryostatin 1 in various tissues after a single intraveneous injection stays in a range of 10 50 ng g for a period of more than 72 hr 28 Data plotted in Figure 7 demonstrate that 10 ng ml Bryostatin added into the culture medium containing 10 2 10 3IU ml IFNg induced a 5 to 6 fold increase in levels of MHCII expression The potentiating effect of Bryostatin first becomes noticeable at 1 ng ml and then reaches a plateau at 10 100 ng ml At low concentration of IFNg 10 2IU ml the effect of Bryostatin was comparable to that of PMA At a higher concentration of IFNg 10 3IU ml however PMA was much more effective This may suggest that either the two PKC activators act through different isoforms of PKC or PMA also activates enzymes outside the PKC family such as MAPK 18 Whatever the mechanism it appears possible to restore the IFNg dependent MHCII expression in LS1034 cell line by clinically acceptable concentrations of Bryostatin 1 Discussion The effect of PKC activators PMA and Bryostatin 1 on IFNg inducibility of MHCII in three resistant tumor cell lines of different histological origin has been examined We found that PKC activators rescued high levels of MHCII expression in colon carcinoma cells and failed to do so in mesothelioma and hepatocellular carcinoma cells A poor response of tumor cells to IFNg is in agreement with previous observations that many tumors acquire such resistance upon malignant transformation possibly important as a mechanism of tumor escape from immune surveillance 29 The nature of this phenomenon is complex and multiple defects that can prevent IFNg responses in tumor lines have been described Most frequently poor MHCII inducibility in response to IFNg has been attributed to alterations in the IFNg signalling pathway and epigenetic silencing of gene expression reviewed in Ref 13 The cascade of IFNg signalling events leading to transcription activation of MHCII genes has been characterized in great detail reviewed in Ref 30 Binding of IFNg to its receptor results in JAK mediated phosphorylation of STAT1 on Tyrosine 701 In addition IFNg interaction with the receptor leads to p38MAPK mediated phosphorylation of STAT1 on Serine 727 17 The phosphorylated STAT1 dimerizes and translocates into the nucleus where it activates transcription of several other factors including CIITA 31 Although the results of this study do not allow us to describe the exact mechanism of PMA involvement in IFNg signalling in LS1034 cell at least two non mutually exclusive scenarios can be hypothesized 1 PMA could act through the JAK STAT signalling pathway It has been established that to achieve its maximal transcriptional activity STAT1 must be phosphorylated on both Tyr701 and Ser727 32 Phosphorylation of STAT1 on Ser727 occurs in response to LPS UV irradiation and other agents that activate the p38MAPK pathway 33 As phorbol esters can also stimulate the MAPK cascade through activation of PKC 34 it is tempting to speculate that combined treatment of cells with PMA and IFNg could increase the pool of STAT1 molecules phosphorylated on both Tyr701 and Ser727 This effect is most likely mediated by PKC delta isoenzyme as this particular PKC isoform appears to be critical for phosphorylation of STAT1 on Ser727 and activation of p38MAPK 16 2 Alternatively PMA treatment could initiate a cascade of protein phosphorylation leading to the increase in transcriptional activity of chromatin at the type IV promoter of CIITA and or promoter of MHCII genes Expression of many genes can be modified by treatment with agents acting at the level of enzymes and nuclear receptors that modify transcriptional activity of chromatin Thus histone deacetylase inhibitors Butyrate and Trichostatin A can rescue MHCII inducibility in bladder carcinoma cells 14 and restore constitutive MHCII expression in plasmacytoma cells 35 In addition to acetylation transcriptional activity of chromatin is also regulated through phosphorylation reviewed in Ref 36 It has been shown that treatment of cells with phorbol esters leads to accumulation of phosphorylated H3 histones 37 Therefore it seems possible that in LS1034 cells PMA could enhance transcriptional activity of chromatin at promoters of MHCII and or CIITA genes This possibility appears particularly important since the specific lack of CIITA inducibility was cited as the most common basis for lack of IFNg induced MHCII expression among Rb positive human tumor lines 13 21 Another reported mechanism of IFNg resistance in tumor cells is associated with down regulation of IFNg receptors 38 The relevance of this mechanism to MHCII inducibility was recently supported by the evidence that PMA is able to enhance IFNg dependent MHCII expression in THP 1 human leukemia cells through the up regulation of IFNg receptors 19 In our experiments however the incubation of LS1034 cells with PMA and ethanol did not lead to any changes in IFNgR expression as determined by flow cytometry Figure 4 Therefore it is unlikely that up regulated IFNgR contributed to the phenomena reported here It should be emphasized that we determined the expression of both IFNgR1 and IFNgR2 receptor subunits since it has been shown that in certain experimental systems an IFNg resistance was due to a lack of cellular expression of IFNgR2 chain alone 39 We also found that the effect of PMA in LS1034 cells can be significantly augmented by co incubation with 172 mM ethanol In certain types of tissues ethanol has been shown to induce membrane translocation of PKC isoforms through activation of phospholipase A and release of diacylglycerol 40 This mechanism however does not appear to be significant in our case as ethanol without PMA failed to potentiate IFNg induced MHCII expression in LS1034 cells Alternatively ethanol can modulate the activity of mitogen and stress activated kinase cascades It has been shown that hepatocytes exposed to 100 mM ethanol for 16 hr have a higher activity of p38MAPK induced by EGF treatment 41 If in our experiments PMA did act through Ser727 phosphorylation of STAT1 the potentiating effect of ethanol can possibly be explained by its ability to stimulate the MAPK kinase cascade It remains to be determined whether the restoration of IFNg induced MHCII expression by PMA is unique to LS1034 cells A potentiating effect of PMA has been reported in thyroid carcinoma cells 20 but in contrast to LS1034 cells normal IFNg response in those cells was only partially lost as a result of malignant transformation Whether or not this phenomenon may be reproduced with other IFNg resistant colon carcinoma cell lines is of particular interest since colonic epithelium is physiologically exposed to PKC activators that enhance cytokine signalling in enterocytes during inflammatory responses within the intestinal mucosa 42 It is well established that besides the MHCII molecules IFNg can induce susceptible tumors to upregulate the expression of MHC class I antigens 43 tumor associated antigens 44 costimulatory molecules 45 and heat shock proteins 46 In addition IFNg may have antimetabolic and antiproliferative influence on certain types of tumor cells 47 It has also been suggested that IFNg may cause responding tumor cells to secrete angiogenesis inhibitors 48 As it is not known which of those IFNg effects are missing or restored by PMA in LS1034 cells a thorough evaluation of the possible clinical implications of our in vitro findings is quite difficult However if clinically tested PKC agonists such as Bryostatin 1 are able to rescue the IFNg induced MHCII expression within the tumor bed it might be appropriate to consider them for trials to improve the clinical efficacy of cancer immunotherapy Conclusions In this study we showed that IFNg inducibility of MHCII antigens in weakly inducible LS1034 colorectal carcinoma cell line can be rescued by concomitant incubation with PKC agonists Bryostatin 1 may be considered for further investigation of IFNg dependent

supplemented with 25 mM HEPES 10 fetal calf serum 200 mM L glutamine and 40 g ml Tobramycin When cells were in exponential growth phase they were removed from plastic by trypsinization and seeded into the wells of 6 well trays 9 cm 2 well at a concentration of 3 10 5to 5 10 5cells 4 ml well When cell cultures reached 40 60 confluency usually on the next day growth medium was replaced with 2 ml of fresh medium containing variable concentrations of IFNg Ten minutes later another 2 ml of medium containing variable concentrations of PMA were added into the wells and the incubation continued for the next 48 hr Experiments involving protein kinase inhibitors were performed in a similar way except that Staurosporine and GF 109203X were added first and IFNg or PMA plus IFNg were added 1 hr later Staurosporine and GF 109203X were not washed away so the cells were incubated with IFNg PMA in the constant presence of inhibitors In a first group of experiments stock solution of PMA was prepared at 1 mg ml in ethanol and the final concentration of ethanol in culture medium was adjusted to 10 l ml 172 mM In all subsequent experiments stock solution of PMA was prepared at 10 mg ml in DMSO and the final concentration of DMSO in culture medium was adjusted to 1 l ml Immunofluorescent staining of cell surface antigens Cellular monolayers were rinsed 3 times with Ca Mg free PBS and incubated for 20 min at 37 C in Hanks balanced salt solution containing 0 25 trypsin 1 mM EDTA and 25 mM HEPES Detached cells were washed twice with staining buffer PBS containing 10 FCS 0 1 sodium azide and 25 mM HEPES pH 7 4 and stained as described previously 49 Briefly cells were transferred into the wells of round bottom 96 well plates the plates were centrifuged at 200 g for 30 seconds the supernatant removed by shaking and the cell pellets resuspended in 50 l of staining buffer containing saturating concentration of anti MHCII FITC After 30 min incubation at 4 C cells were washed twice resuspended

dead cells Matching isotype control mAb IgG2a FITC was used at the same 0 25 g well or a higher 1 0 g well concentration as the specific antibody The lack of staining of controls demonstrated that non specific binding of IgG2a FITC to PI negative cells was negligible in all experimental groups Fig 8B 8E 8H Staining for cell surface IFNg receptors was performed similarly except that cells were first incubated with biotin conjugated mAb s specific or isotype matched for 30 min washed 2 times and then stained with SA Alf488 Staining of fresh and trypsin treated monocytes demonstrated that epitopes recognized by the mAb s against MHCII IFNgR1 and IFNgR2 were resistant to 30 min digestion with 0 25 trypsin Immunofluorescent staining of cytoplasmic antigens Cytoplasmic IFNgR1 and IFNgR2 receptor subunits were detected by using a procedure described for intracellular cytokine staining 50 Briefly cells were fixed in ice cold 4 formaldehyde for 5 min washed 2 times permeabilized in staining buffer containing 0 2 saponin for 60 min at 4 C incubated with biotin conjugated mAb s specific or isotype matched for 30 min washed 2 times incubated with SA PE and washed again saponin was present in staining buffer at all times After the final wash cells were resuspended in buffer without saponin and kept on ice until analysis Monocytes expressing high levels of IFNgR1 and IFNgR2 receptor subunits served as a positive control Expression levels of Rb protein was measured using a procedure described elsewhere 51 Flow cytometry Fluorescent emission of FITC and Alexa Fluor 488 was collected on the FL1 detector 530 30 nm log mode and fluorescence of PI stained DNA was collected on the FL3 detector 650 nm log mode Incubation of tumor cells with PMA or staurosporine dramatically increased cell to cell adherence and number of cell clumps To deal with this problem the FL2 detector 585 42 nm linear mode was used to measure area and width of electronic pulses PMT voltage of the FL2 detector was set high enough to minimize the number of FL2 width events appearing in channel 1 Regions R1 R2 and R3 were drawn to exclude debris Fig 8G dead cells Fig 8A 8B 8C and cellular
