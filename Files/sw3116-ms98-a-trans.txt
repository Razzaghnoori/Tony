        okay talk about uh what kind of restaurants we we like to go to and what uh makes us go back and ill start talking about it so usually i just kind of like uh places that are family style kind of things because its a a casual atmosphere and you usually get good portions of food and stuff and and uh but  we were in California recently and i went we went to a couple of very uh i guess expensive extravagant restaurants because it was kind of the thing to do and we just wanted to see what it was like and we got to get some real good food more exotic and uh we thought that the service was very good and uh that kind of makes me want to go to those places again even though it is expensive you know like maybe once a year or once every six months go to it or something like that   umhum   but how about you   yeah i i enjoy going out but my husband goes out for dinner a lot with his company you know with his work   uhhuh   so its something that i end up kind of experimenting with with my girlfriends or maybe taking my girls out when hes gone and   uhhuh   and so we end up usually finding something thats uh quick service and uh thats hopefully economical and uh certainly tastes good i hate to uh pay any kind of an amount and then have the food be real mediocre     uhhuh   um  as far as to really go out for an evening though i do like to have a place thats not real real formal but kind of on a formal side just because usually their atmosphere is more on a quiet atmosphere and its real relaxing and then uh the quality of food is usually kind of is affected by how the mood is set so   uhhuh   um i guess my favorite kind of foods foods would be uh the ones that well i dont know favorite is just going out for a good good hearty steak but   yeah   i i i find it amazing around here we dont have too many good steak houses it doesnt seem and i i find that amazing being in Texas im from another state originally and   umhum   i always thought Texas was supposed to be such a good meat state   umhum   and it seems to be a tough thing to do is to find a place that cooks up a real good juicy steak so   umhum you know what we have around here too is uh a place where you uh you pick your own meat and you cook it yourself   oh really   yeah and they they have everything else cooked you know but baked potatoes and all that but you you pick your meat and you know whether its marinated or or just regular   uhhuh   and uh then they have a big grill and you grill it yourself you know and then have all the stuff to put on it you know like if you want to   huh   i dont know butter on it or whatever or garlic and stuff like that   huh   you can you can do it thats kind of interesting it was really good   yeah its kind of an interesting approach   yeah we we thought that was that wasnt too bad but most of the time you know i was really surprised like i say going at these   so   fancier restaurants and and i thought i really liked the food you know it uh it was different because you know you see all these things like you see all these chefs chefs shows and stuff like that   uhhuh   and uh and you know i always watched and thought well i wonder if thats any good you know it looks kind of small but actually it wasnt bad at all   yeah yeah   you know when they have like seafood dishes uh but its just kind of kind of sparse with different things put in it that that really uh that really taste pretty good you didnt you wouldnt think it goes together you know   umhum   but uh but mostly around here now we just kind of just do family family type of things you know   yeah   because its uh its easier to go with two kids two young kids now   yeah thats what we have too yeah and yeah you do have to kind of decide well are we there to get a good meal and and just   yeah   be comfortable as a family or are we looking to spend a lot of time and a lot of money which doesnt work with kids   right right yeah thats true   so what would make you go back to a good restaurant   well i think uh some of the things that i liked were uh uh well i would see the food and whether or not it tastes good uh the service if theyre you know courteous or if they just kind of are hasty you know if they just get your order and go and you never see them again or they coming talk you know talk with you a little bit or something   umhum uhhuh and do you find that when you have children that its it really makes uh you can really tell the difference between a good and a mediocre restaurant by the way they treat you with kids     yes i have we have we have noticed that   yeah   yes so uh you know if they more you you can tell when theyre oriented towards kids now if they bring something for them to play with or to write with something you know   yeah   to occupy them you can really tell   yeah   the other thing ive liked too is uh now this isnt you dont have this at at family restaurants but uh is some type of a like a a pianist or something   umhum   that will play some music while your eating and stuff and that was that that was kind of neat   oh yeah yeah we have a restaurant over here called Gershwins that has a piano player always during your mealtime and it   uhhuh   it just makes for a real classy feel and uh it kind of carries over the conversations next to you so youre not concentrating what someone else is saying next to you but i mean but you know at the next table but   yeah   just within your own little group so it makes for a nice nice place to go   there was two places that we went to one in San Francisco and one in uh in Monterey California   oh yeah   and uh the one in San Francisco is the top of one of the downtown big skyscraper buildings and it was really neat because you could had a great view you know of San Francisco and everything   uhhuh yeah   and uh and thats another thing that would bring me back to a restaurant is the view and the one in in Monterey was really nice because it was overlooking the water too so that was that was a couple things that we liked   yeah   but   well sounds good   okay you have anything else to say   no i think we covered everything     okay well thanks a lot   well thank you for being home okay byebye   okay byebye
