RULE ISSUED BY THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION ENTITLED SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME DETERMINING DISABILITY FOR A CHILD UNDER AGE 18 INTERIM FINAL RULES WITH REQUEST FOR COMMENTS RIN 0960 AE57 i Cost benefit analysis The Social Security Administration performed a cost benefit assessment of the impact of the interim final rule The assessment which is summarized in the preamble to the rule in the Federal Register was submitted to our Office in its entirety SSA estimates that reduced program outlays resulting from the rule will be 4 7 billion dollars over the next 6 years with 34 7 billion spent during that 6 year period on childhood disability benefits In addition it is estimated that there will be a reduction in Medicaid program outlays of 590 million during that period The cost of conducting the medical redeterminations is expected to be 185 million in fiscal year 1997 and 130 million in fiscal year 1998 After that time SSA estimates that administrative costs will be 10 million less each year from 1999 through 2002 The redeterminations are expected to result in 135 000 children having benefits terminated as a result of these changes in the law The assessment also discusses the costs involved in two alternatives that were considered but were found not to adequately reflect the intent of the legislation as reflected by the legislative history of Public Law 104 193 ii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 U S C 603 605 607 and 609 The Commissioner has certified that the interim final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a

The interim final rule does not impose any unfunded mandates upon state local or tribal governments or the private sector under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 iv Other relevant information or requirements under acts and executive orders Administrative Procedure Act 5 U S C 551 et seq The Commissioner determined under 5 U S C 553 b B that good cause existed for dispensing with the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act and has issued the rule as an interim final rule with a request for comments by April 14 1997 Since sections 211 and 212 of Public Law 104 193 were effective upon enactment and section 215 required the Commissioner to issue regulations to carry out the amendments within 3 months after enactment the Commissioner found that it would be impracticable and contrary to congressional intent to follow the NPRM procedures SSA will consider the comments received by April 14 1997 and will issue revised regulations if necessary Paperwork Reduction Act 44 U S C 3501 3520 The rule contains a new information collection requirement which was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget OMB under emergency procedures and OMB has approved the collection requirements and issued OMB No 0960 0568 The new collection of information is the completion of the Childhood Disability Evaluation Form by the State Disability Determination Services The submission to OMB lists the yearly usage rate of the form at approximately 800 000 and there is a one time disability redetermination workload of 266 000 to be processed in 1997 The submission estimates the burden per response to be 20 minutes for an annual hour burden of 355 333 The cost to the federal government is estimated to be 8 7 million Statutory authorization for the rule The interim final rule is issued pursuant to section 215 of Public Law 104 193 to implement sections 211 and 212 of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of
