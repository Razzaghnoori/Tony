 Arlington National Cemetery Arlington National Cemetery the nation s most hallowed military burial ground was born in an act of theft The U S government confiscated it in 1861 from Gen Robert E Lee and his wife Mary Custis Lee after he took command of the army of Northern Virginia The first of the Union dead buried there was Pvt William Christman a member of the Pennsylvania regiment who saw as much combat as did now disgraced Ambassador M Larry Lawrence none Of the United States 114 national cemeteries only Arlington is administered by the Department of the Army All the rest fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Veterans Affairs Arlington contains the remains of 240 000 dead It also contains several monuments including the Tomb of the Unknowns and the Tomb of the Unknown Dead from the Civil War the latter a granite tomb that holds the remains of 2 111 Civil War soldiers There are also monuments honoring women in the military the victims of the failed Iran rescue mission the slain Kennedy brothers the victims of the space shuttle Challenger mission the Rough Riders and the victims of the USS Maine its mast was salvaged from Havana harbor and brought to Arlington The event that thrust us into the national spotlight was the burial of President Kennedy in 1963 says cemetery superintendent John C Metzler Jr Only 1 million people visited the cemetery the year before JFK was assassinated the Washington Post reports During the six months following the assassination 9 million came and by 1968 the Kennedy shrine was attracting 7 million people a year Requests for burials rose by 400 percent following JFK s televised burial the Post continues As late as 1967 any veteran with an honorable discharge was eligible for burial in Arlington and the cemetery had only a year s worth of plots in reserve To conserve space the government adopted new eligibility rules that made the cemetery a more exclusive and therefore more attractive address for the dead Although Arlington remains the prestigious address any veteran with an honorable discharge automatically qualifies for burial with military honors in one of the nation s veterans cemeteries Last month the Associated Press reported the arcane rules currently in effect for who can be buried in Arlington Military personnel who died on active duty The heavily decorated including those who won the Medal of Honor Distinguished Service Cross Navy Cross Air Force Cross Distinguished Service Medal Silver Star or Purple Heart Long timers with 20 years of active duty or active reserve service who qualify for retired pay upon retirement at age 60 Those retired for disability reasons Those honorably discharged before Oct 1 1949 for at least 30 percent disability The other rules read like the fine print on an insurance policy The spouse or unmarried child 21 years or younger of those listed above or those already buried in Arlington An unmarried dependent student qualifies before age 23 as does any adult child who acquired a physical or mental disability before age 21 A veteran who is the parent brother sister or child of an eligible person already interred Interment must be in the same grave as the primary eligible the veteran s spouse must waive his or her eligibility for Arlington and the veteran can have no dependent children at the time of death Those not eligible include The remarried widower widow of an eligible person unless he she is no longer married at death Those whose last discharge was less than honorable After adopting the new eligibility rules the government established a waiver system for exceptions granted by the president or by the secretary or high ranking officials of the Army Secretary of the Army Togo West has granted 58 exceptions since November 1993 High ranking Army officials have granted seven during that time President Clinton has granted four The Carter administration granted 17 exceptions in four years the Reagan administration 53 exceptions in eight years and the Bush administration 34 exceptions in four years West explains that the increased demand for Arlington plots helps account for the record number of waivers he has approved Ambassador Lawrence apparently lied about having served in the Merchant Marine during World War II Besides the Merchant Marine is not a part of the armed forces Other ambassadors who did not serve in the military but are buried in Arlington anyway Former U S Ambassador to the United Nations John A Scali 1995 and Arnold L Raphel 1988 he died in an air crash while serving as ambassador to Pakistan Other envoys who received burial waivers but did serve in the military William R Rivkin 1967 Cleo A Noel Jr 1973 Phillip K Crowe 1976 and Adolph A Dubs 1979 Clinton s four waivers Justice Thurgood Marshall Elvera Burger the widow of Chief Justice Warren Burger Army veteran and Drug Enforcement Administration agent J W Seale killed in Peru while on a mission and Marine veteran and Washington D C police officer Henry J Daly killed in a shootout While not a secret the waiver program is not publicized Secretary West has acknowledged He outlined the waiver rules in a November press conference Ambassadors who die in office merit consideration for a space in Arlington Cemetery superintendent Metzler told the Washington Post that he would have recommended a waiver for Lawrence given the fact he died in office and was serving actively in a post at the time of his death Also qualifying under waivers are U S government employees who are killed in the course of their service to America those who have performed unique service to the nation and reservists who die while on active duty for training Humanitarian concerns for the family requesting an Arlington burial are also acknowledged said West citing a World War I veteran who didn t automatically qualify under the rules but whom he would have waived in and a Tuskegee airman who had flown 22 combat flights Waiver requests often are forwarded to the superintendent and the secretary of the Army from members of Congress although individuals can make the requests directly Because corpses have a short shelf life the decisions are made quickly The Los Angeles Times reports that Clinton issued an Arlington waiver in advance for former Surgeon General C Everett Koop who is still alive Koop is the only person to have been so honored Arlington s 612 acres will be filled with corpses by 2020 if the rate of 20 burials a day continues According to West one Arlington gravesite can hold three caskets Of the 58 burials approved by West 42 were in existing graves There is plenty of room for cremains Arlington added a columbarium in 1980 it accepts the cremated remains of any veteran who received an honorable discharge The cemetery overlooks the Potomac River and has more than 14 000 trees Most graves are marked with simple tombstones The major exception the turn of the century Officers Section which is crowded with lavish markers These stone angels huge crosses marble cannonballs and even a cannon were paid for by soldiers families The Union had buried about 7 000 soldiers on the Lee estate by 1864 deliberately planting tombstones in Mrs Lee s rose garden right up to the Lee house s back door After the war a freedmen s village was established on the Lee plantation and included a hospital a school and a church More than 3 800 former slaves are buried at Arlington under headstones that say either civilian or citizen Arlington National Cemetery expansion which pushed the freedmen s village out may also claim a 24 acre plot of woods around Lee s old home The parcel would add 10 years worth of burial space Also eyed for annexation is part of Fort Myer adjacent to Arlington and a parcel owned by the Department of Defense Robert E Lee s son George sued the U S government in the 1870s for the return of the family estate The Supreme Court upheld his claim and the government paid him 150 000 for it The general never returned to his plantation He is buried in Lexington Va in Washington and Lee University s Lee Chapel Jack Shafer
