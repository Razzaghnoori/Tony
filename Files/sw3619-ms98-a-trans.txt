              youre in a little different situation i think were going to set the record in Dallas this year for murders   oh really   yes uh   theres been a lot   yes uh the uh and theyre mostly drug linked here but   oh   we have   um i really i think we had like four hundred and eighty   uhhuh   more than one a day   my word is that an increase over any of the previous years is that the highest   oh yeah it just keeps going higher and higher were going to have a were going to set a record for us but possibly will be the deadliest place to live in the nation   my word   uhhuh in the whole nation   yes   wow thats terrible does that does that worry you at all   yeah extremely i carry tear gas yeah   do you thats great do you are you out alone at night often or   that not for for that reason no   oh now does now is it mostly in certain areas that it happens or just   oh yes um you know crime is um i think crimes against property are more common uh you know theyre common fairly common all over uh   right   you know the some its kind of funny uh weve just moved from a a low crime area because its got great police to a higher crime area   oh   but   oh   i had a i had a pickup truck sitting out by my house with uh all my furniture in it for a week and it wasnt touched   uhhuh my word huh   so i dont know what you define as uh you know uh for being in an unsafe a less safe area   right uhhuh   its there no telling uh   my word huh well that i know that um were a little bit in the same Salt Lake City is   umhum   is about an hour away from us and they have had an increase a big increase in the number of murders this year too and they said that um the murders have been on the rise where some of the other crimes have either stayed the same or declined but the more violent crimes like rapes and murders have you know increased and i and i think like you said its a lot linked to the drugs to the drug   uhhuh   scene and um of course the little community we live in we dont  have too many   you dont well you have it believe me but you might not you dont its not as prevalent i dont   right right im sure that theres uh we do have one policeman you know that that runs the that is the law enforcement here and um   one   right       were real small and hes only been hired for about a year before that we didnt even have one     how big whats the population     um i think theres a hundred and seventy families and im not sure eight hundred maybe seven hundred seven hundred or eight hundred is the population   well the one person who might snort cocaine in town probably isnt very violent   so no  no we do have um        just up to the south of us theres an area called Docks Flat and its up in the mountains and a lot of the the kids go up there for their beer parties and   uhhuh uhhuh   you know drugs and that and thats probably the biggest problem we have right here in the community is is these kids coming up up a canyon here and going up south for that kind of a thing and that brings a lot of   are they local   no no theyre from oh from the communities around us   uhhuh   mostly so so theyre not in town folks and that that brings in a lot of problems spots but um have you ever been the victim of any type of a crime whether a burglary or   oh i had a i had a two eighty or three hundred Z X that uh i used to have the windows replaced on that that i say monthly three times though   umhum youre kidding   they were stolen from i have three dogs three large barking fierce looking not fierce but fierce looking dogs   uhhuh    oh uhhuh   that um that sleep very soundly it would appear but uh just from my driveway     oh oh thats a good idea that probably deters a lot of   oh well my truck i was telling you about was next to the dog pen     uhhuh oh  that was probably the reason   but i think it does but its um that you know these are nice they dont they dont catch a lot of things   oh   i think if its uh if someones coming to case your house and they knock on the door theyre going to draw a response from the dogs but if someone walked around my house   uhhuh oh yeah   my dogs sleep so soundly during the day too that they wouldnt know   oh oh well do you um do you have signs posted that you know say   yeah ive got signs that say my house is protected by a security system   oh thats good   theyre lies but you know   it might deter them well they say that that deters a lot a lot of would be you know burglaries     that whats a whats a crime like there     um id probably have to go to one of the bigger
