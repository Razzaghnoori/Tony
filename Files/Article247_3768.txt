 Some Protests Are More Equal Than Others Dear Mick I am utterly utterly serious when I say that Buffy the Vampire Slayer and seriously felt and thought through opposition to the death penalty existing as they do cheek by jowl in my life I consider them to be perfectly compatible and cohesive elements of a unified world view Or maybe not so unified since although I still don t agree with you about Miramax I see that I agree even less with myself in that I don t actually think that the political protests of Catholic feminist and gay rights organizations regarding their portrayals by the mass media are really of comparable weight seeing as only one of these special interests is allied with an extraordinarily wealthy institution with one of the most coherent and cooperative global network of outlets in history I mean of course Disney Kidding I mean of course the Catholic Church The New York Post reported yesterday and even David Bowie could probably learn a thing or two about self promotion from the Post which today did a story on a Giuliani reference to yesterday s story that Arnold Lehman the director of the Brooklyn Museum has led the church into the sin of wrath before when as director of the Baltimore Museum of Art he co sponsored a series of films on religious extremism that included Hell s Angel a scathing critique of Mother Teresa written and narrated by Christopher Hitchens As I recall his writings on this subject are eminently rational While in Baltimore Lehman also did an exhibition involving Warner Bros cartoons which seemed to bug the Post writer Rod Dreher almost as much To prove my initial point about sociopolitical cheek by jowlness I would like to conclude by saying that if I have to hear Lenny Kravitz sing Fly Away on that Nissan ad one more time I am going to consider starting a personal little war and like St Augustine I would consider it just Love Mim
