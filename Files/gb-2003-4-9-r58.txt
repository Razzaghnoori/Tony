 Background The rapid rate of sequence acquisition has revolutionized molecular biology The sequencing of entire genomes in addition to new computer based search tools has allowed us to identify and analyze large sets of data very rapidly The acceleration of data acquisition in fields such as whole genome sequence determination and genome wide gene expression profiling has opened the door for the study of model organisms and organisms of importance to the study of medicine and disease states by allowing for the analysis of the entirety of genetic information in a given organism The recent completion of the sequencing of the Anopheles gambiae genome provides us with the entire genetic makeup of this organism Furthermore the completion of the sequencing of both the Drosophila melanogaster 1 and Anopheles gambiae 2 genomes provides the first opportunity for genome wide comparisons from two metazoans from the same order Diptera This presents new opportunities to detect synteny groups and facilitates the comparison of splicing patterns and orthologous sequences between these two organisms The first K channel gene identified was cloned from Drosophila The Shaker gene was isolated by positional cloning of a gene for which a mutation causes a leg shaking phenotype in anesthetized flies 3 4 This gene encodes a six transmembrane protein Figure 1 subunit which assembles as a tetramer This gene provided a molecular probe by which other K channel genes could be isolated by hybridization and later by computer based homology search This led to the cloning of different K channel subunits and the discovery of different K channel types 5 Subsequent to the cloning of Shaker K channel genes from the Shab Shaw and Shal families later renamed Kv2 Kv3 and Kv4 respectively for clarity 6 were identified in Drosophila These sequences are shown in the alignment in Figure 2aand a tree is shown in Figure 3a Later other types of K channel subunits were identified by hybridization with the conserved pore region generally used as a probe or by positional cloning using neurological mutants in Drosophila melanogaster and other organisms Among these channel types were KQT channels calcium activated K channels inward rectifier K channels and the two pore K channels 7 The sequencing of the Drosophila genome provided evidence that the vast majority of K channel genes in the fruit fly have been identified since certain domains within K channels particularly the pore region are readily identifiable by homology Other K channel types possess the same conserved pore domain sequence as the Kv and KQT channels Among the six transmembrane channels there are two additional families The Eag gene family consists of eag erg seizure and elk one of each is present in the Drosophila genome 8 The other 6TM K channel gene family is the Slo family These genes encode Ca 2 activated K channels of large conductance intermediate conductance and small conductance these are thought to be mediated by Slo slack and SK channels respectively These K channels are shown in Figure 2b Another family of two transmembrane K channels called inward rectifier K channels exists as well Although these channels lack a voltage sensor domain they play an important role in controlling resting potential and K homeostasis Between the two transmembrane domains these channels possess a pore sequence homologous to the pore domain found in Kv Eag and Slo channel types Three Kir genes have been reported in Drosophila 9 Two of these genes Irk2 and Irk3 are quite similar at 54 amino acid sequence identity while a third member is roughly 27 identical to the other two Finally although they will not be investigated in this study a group of four transmembrane two pore K channels exists These tandem pore channels may be involved in a wide range of physiologic processes but are generally thought to mediate leak conductances which influence resting membrane potential All the K channel genes mentioned here contribute to K channel conductance in excitable and or non excitable cells In the nervous systems of insects and other metazoans K channels are known to play an important role in perception learning and locomotion This paper will investigate the genes encoding K channels of two distantly related Diptera now that their entire genomes have been made public Results Neutral evolutionary distance values In addition to amino acid identity we looked at neutral evolutionary distance NED values Values for f2 the percentage of identical codons for conserved twofold redundant amino acids Cys Asp Glu Phe His Lys Asn Gln and Tyr between two aligned proteins are calculated by looking at the codons third position in positions at which amino acids with twofold degeneracy occur These values may be more useful for evaluating divergence dates than amino acid sequence identity because they are silent and mutation occurs in a clocklike fashion rather than in the bursts that are thought to accompany rapid environmental changes The f2 values for Kv1 Kv2 and Kv4 orthologs in the fruit fly and mosquito were as follows 0 69 for Anopheles Kv1 vs Drosophila Kv1 0 73 for Anopheles Kv2 vs Drosophila Kv2 and 0 69 for Anopheles Kv4 vs Drosophila Kv4 The f2 values for Shaw vs Shaw and other K channel genes were calculated as shown in Table 3 Anopheles Kv3 1 vs Anopheles Kv3 2 gave a f2 value of 0 74 Anopheles Kv3 1 vs Anopheles Kv3 3 gave an f2 value of 0 75 whereas Anopheles Kv3 2 vs Anopheles Kv3 3 gave a value of 0 69 The f2 value of Anopheles Kv3 3 vs Drosophila Kv3 2 gave a value of only 0 52 The f2 value for the two Shaw genes in Drosophila Kv3 1 and Kv3 2 was 0 60 Discussion Anopheles gambiae is the most important vector of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Africa where nearly 90 of the world s malaria specific mortality occurs DDT has been used extensively to control this mosquito Because the target of DDT and pyrethroid insecticides is the voltage gated Na channel 15 and considering that the anti malarial quinine blocks K channels insights into the ion channels in the genomes of this mosquito and other insects may be useful for investigating how DDT and other pesticides may be used with greatest efficacy and safety Using the conserved K channel pore as a probe I screened the entire A gambiae genome for the presence of voltage gated K channels Ca 2 activated K channels and inward rectifier K channels as all these channels possess a homologous pore domain I have identified eight voltage gated K channels three Eag family three Slo family and six inward rectifier channel genes using this search A greater number of genes within a given family in Anopheles compared to Drosophila can be a result of gene expansion in Anopheles or alternatively gene loss in Drosophila I considered the likelihood of either possibility for these cases based on the trees that were constructed using neighbor joining parsimony and maximum likelihood algorithms K channels are dispersed throughout the genomes of both Drosophila and Anopheles although multiple members of a given family are most often clustered Comparing the gross homology of the two species both the Anopheles and Drosophila have two major metacentric autosomes and an X chromosome five chromosomal arms in total Of the channels focused on here only Shaker is located on the same arm in both species namely the X chromosome however the locations of other K channel genes in Anopheles and Drosophila are consistent with previously reported regions of major interarm homology between these species Table 2 This was true for Shab Dm 3L Ag 2L Shaw Dm 2L Ag 3R Shal Dm 3L Ag 2L KCNQ Dm 2R Ag 2L and Slowpoke Dm 3R Ag 2R as well as for Slack eag erg elk and the three inward rectifier genes as shown in Table 2 The translocations between autosomes and chromosome X observed for eag and Hyperkinetic are notable these examples raise questions about dosage compensation which will need to be addressed in future studies There is 78 98 amino acid sequence identity between the six transmembrane K channel gene products in Drosophila and their orthologs in Anopheles a value significantly greater than what other studies have calculated 62 identity and 56 in separate studies 16 17 as a mean value for sequence identity between orthologs in these two organisms Amino acid sequence identity of 78 98 is an impressive figure given that these two organisms are thought to have diverged 250 million years ago 16 Although this value may be slightly higher than the true value as uncertainties resulting from splicing boundaries led us to disregard the more variable amino and carboxy terminal extreme ends the sequence identities for the Drosophila and Anopheles K channel orthologs over the core regions for K channel sequences are well above the mean values calculated by the other groups for orthologs between these species It suggests that K channel genes are subject to a stricter selection pressure than other genes in these organisms This is consistent with the observation that transporters and channels are among the proteins with highest sequence similarity between Anopheles and Drosophila 17 Of the four voltage gated K channel types Kv1 4 the Shaker or Kv1 channel gene is from a genomic perspective arguably the most complex Shaker from Drosophila is a gene with at least 11 exons and spanning over 16 kb Exons are short in the Anopheles ortholog of Shaker as well as it was not possible to find an exon encoding more than 75 amino acids in this gene The presence of more than one pore region in Anopheles Shaker suggests that sequence diversity can be generated in an integral part of the internal segments of the channel rather than what has been reported for Drosophila Shaker splicing at the 5 and 3 ends 18 19 Alternative splicing at the pore region occurs in another arthropod the lobster Panulirus interruptus Functional channels translated from genes with either of the two splice variants were expressed and exhibited different electrophysiological and pharmacological properties 13 It is tempting to assume that the two transcripts with the two variable pore regions in Anopheles would encode channels with different properties as well although this would be premature until it is shown that both exons are transcribed An exon encoding the region containing the pore exists in Drosophila yet no transcripts could be found containing this putative exon 20 In the coding region the Shal and Shab genes from Anopheles and Drosophila are made up of longer exons than the Shaker gene The lack of more than one splice variant at central regions of the Shal protein suggests that splicing may be confined to the 5 and 3 regions of this gene Although evidence of microsynteny was found for the region surrounding Shal flanking genes of the other channels did not provide evidence of microsynteny between Anopheles and Drosophila at these regions The identification of three Kv3 Shaw family K channel genes in Anopheles but only two in Drosophila is intriguing In mammals this family of K channels activates at potentials considerably more positive than observed in other K channel types these channels have the ability to produce currents that can specifically enable fast repolarization of action potentials without compromising spike initiation or height 21 Also these channels are localized at specialized regions in mammalian brain associated with higher order cognitive functions such as the thalamus and cortex 22 Furthermore Kv3 channel sequence identities are lower between Drosophila and mammals than are other K channel types The identification of multiple Kv3 channel genes but only single members of the Kv1 Kv2 and Kv4 families in Diptera two in Drosophila and three in Anopheles raises questions about the evolutionary history of Kv3 K channel genes In some organisms with very primitive nervous systems such as Polyorchis penicillatus jellyfish phylum Cnidaria at least two Shaker Kv1 family genes exist 23 moreover in the electric fish Apteronotus the Kv1 Shaker family is the most diverse with at least 10 members 24 One can predict from the protein and DNA similarity that Kv3 1 and Kv3 2 from Anopheles diverged recently The previously published Drosophila Kv3 Shaw protein is 88 identical to the Anopheles Kv3 1 and Kv3 2 sequences but only 70 identical to the Anopheles predicted Kv3 3 gene product Regarding the relationships between Dm Kv3 1 and the two Anopheles genes Ag Kv3 1 and Ag Kv3 2 this paper has already stated that the ancestral sequence at the node representing the divergence of these two Anopheles genes is the true ortholog of Dm Kv3 1 gi 158460 Given the awkwardness of comparing an extant gene for example Dm Kv3 1 to its ancestral ortholog it may suit the genomics and or evolutionary community to devise new terminology for such cases In relation to the Drosophila Kv3 1 the terms novolog corresponding to Ag Kv3 1 or Ag Kv3 2 and archaelog corresponding to the ancestral gene represented by the node from which the two Anopheles genes diverged might be useful these terms as presented here would apply to cases in which contemporaneous orthologs do not exist between two organisms as opposed to the general phenomena of duplication and divergence In the light of the high amino acid identity roughly 87 the low f2 value of 0 51 for Anopheles Kv3 3 and its ortholog in Drosophila as opposed to an f2 value of 0 69 for Anopheles Kv1 vs Drosophila Kv1 0 73 for Anopheles Kv2 vs Drosophila Kv2 or 0 70 for Anopheles Kv4 vs Drosophila Kv4 suggests these two genes diverged longer ago than would be predicted by the amino acid identity alone and that selective pressure has prevented the two sequences from diverging homoplasy may explain their high amino acid identity and low third position f2 identity The f2 value comparing Kv3 1 vs Kv3 3 from the mosquito is 0 75 higher than expected considering that amino acid identity between the two 64 is significantly lower than that observed between Anopheles Kv3 3 and its Drosophila ortholog It is likely that different K channel subunits within the same family would provide the potential to generate many K channel tetramer combinations This would allow greater variation and specificity of Kv3 channels as K channel subunits within a family can readily form functional heteromultimeric channels 25 The number of XXR repeats of the voltage sensor where X is a hydrophobic residue and R represents arginine within the voltage sensor in non vertebrate Kv3 K channels is of interest The presence of four such repeats in invertebrate Kv3 channels and six in vertebrate Kv3 K channels may help explain the difference in voltage dependence observed between the mammalian and fly Kv3 channels as even single amino acid mutations in this domain can affect voltage dependence of K channels considerably 26 The greater PAM distance between Drosophila and mammalian Kv3 channels PAM distance 65 compared to Kv1 Kv2 or Kv4 for which the intra family PAM distances between Drosophila and mammalian channel sequences range from 25 40 shows that Kv3 channels have undergone more extensive adaptation than other K channel families It can be inferred that the greater complexity of the vertebrate brain made necessary a rapidly deactivating high threshold K channel type which has not evolved in protostomes indeed given the biophysical properties of Kv3 channels in mammals the amino acid replacements that have occurred in mammalian Kv3 channels seem to have provided exactly this Like the Kv3 Shaw family KQT KCNQ K channel genes are more abundant in Anopheles than in Drosophila Sequence analysis suggests these channels evolved before other classical voltage gated K channels Kv1 K4 The neighbor joining Figure 3a and maximum likelihood trees we constructed in combination with the fact that mammalian KCNQ1 and Anopheles KCNQ2 gene products share a striking 75 identity despite the divergence of protostomes and deuterostomes close to 700 million years ago suggest that gene loss in Drosophila specifically loss of an ancestral KCNQ2 mammalian KCNQ1 is the cause of this difference rather than gene expansion in Anopheles which may be the case for the Kv3 and Irk3 Figure 3b gene families Alternatively lateral transfer of KCNQ1 from mammals to Anopheles must be considered given the intimate relationship of these organisms Although the genome size of Anopheles is twice the size of the Drosophila genome the numbers of genes in both organisms are nearly equivalent 17 suggesting that gene duplication depends on the advantage of additional genes in distinct families rather than a general consequence of possessing a larger genome Unlike other K channel types for which amino and carboxyl termini are highly variable KQT channel sequences are even more highly conserved in some regions of the cytoplasmic carboxy terminal region than in the conserved pore region The presence of two potential splice variants within the carboxy terminal tail raises questions about the role of this domain in channel function Although the physiologic significance of this region is not yet known evidence suggests it may be involved in calmodulin binding 27 For this region one homologous gene product can be found in Drosophila KCNQ which raises questions about whether products of this gene mediate the M current as has been postulated for KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 in mammals 28 The greater number of inward rectifier K channel genes in Anopheles compared to Drosophila is striking given that these organisms belong to the same order Our analysis based on maximum likelihood and neighbor joining algorithms suggests that gene duplication in Anopheles is the most likely explanation for the greater number of Irk3 genes in mosquito This also appears to be the case for Irk2 1 and Irk2 2 however from the tree Figure 3b it appears that the divergence of Irk2 3 from Irk2 1 and Irk2 2 in the mosquito occurred earlier than the divergence of Drosophila Irk2 and the two Anopheles genes Irk2 1 and Irk2 1 suggesting that gene loss in Drosophila may have occurred The same tree topology was supported by both neighbor joining and maximum likelihood trees though lack of a clear ortholog from a more distant organism for example a deuterostome makes this type of assessment regarding gene history more difficult Future studies may help explain why the mosquito has twice as many of the inward rectifier genes as the fruit fly Gene expansion in Anopheles has been observed for genes involved in hematophagy and insecticide resistance it is unclear to what extent these two factors are involved here although ion channels are clearly targets of insecticides The overall compositions of K channel genes in Anopheles and Drosophila are strikingly similar in some respects such as conservation of sequence and intron exon boundaries of orthologs and strikingly different in others such as the number of Irk homologs and lack of microsynteny The genome projects of other insects such as Manduca sexta and Bombyx mori will help paint a broader picture of the composition of ion channel genes within the genomes of these related organisms Conclusions Within the Anopheles genome there are orthologs for the four major voltage dependent K channel gene families in Drosophila Kv1 Kv2 Kv3 and Kv4 Shaker Shab Shaw and Shal respectively In addition we have identified genes that encode the Shaker subunit two members of the KQT family of K channels as well as three Slo family genes three Eag family genes and six inward rectifier K channel genes In Anopheles the Shaw family is more diverse than in Drosophila three genes from this family are located next to one another along chromosome 3R in contrast to two Kv3 family genes in Drosophila The greater number of genes for three K channel types inward rectifier KQT and Kv3 Shaw in Anopheles is intriguing given that these organisms have roughly the same number of genes both gene expansion in Anopheles and gene loss in Drosophila in separate cases may account for these differences The high level of amino acid sequence identity as well as the conservation of intron exon boundaries in combination with the chromosomal proximity of these genes in Anopheles and Drosophila provides a greater understanding of the molecular diversity and evolutionary history of K channel genes in the order Diptera Materials and methods I used BLAST 11 and PSI BLAST at the NCBI website to find K channel homologs using the Shaker K channel pore sequence as a query initially and then other longer K channel family specific query sequences for verification The predicted splice sites were compared with results of the TBLASTN to help confirm intron exon boundaries Increases in nucleotide position number from one putative exon to the next were used to deduce the size of introns This study utilized the Ensembl Anopheles gambiae server 29 to search for homologs of various K channel types and to identify and visualize their respective chromosomal locations The DARWIN server 30 was used to calculate the f2 values for the sequences as well as a phylogenetic tree for the Shaw sequences along with PAM distances and ancestral sequences Figures were visualized and optimized using Adobe Photoshop Sequences were aligned using ClustalX version 1 81 Phylogenetic trees were generated using ClustalX for neighbor joining and PHYLIP for neighbor joining parsimony and maximum likelihood using Protdist Protpars and ProML respectively The resulting trees were then visualized and evaluated using Treeview Bootstrap values were calculated using ClustalX and PHYLIP
