 Hillary and Rudy The Coming Mud Bath Dear Jodi I came back from lunch in such a merry mood and no the lunch wasn t the three martini kind brimming over with joy that we live in a land so bountiful that the Republicans in Congress can give away 792 billion Then I got your e mail and my heart sank Jodi do you really find Rudy Giuliani a complex and appealing guy Are all your friends really hyper for Hillary thrilled that the first lady will bless the lucky voters of New York with her divine presence Maybe I should have sensed the warning signs yesterday when you partially praised Giuliani s there will be no public information given to the press while I m mayor media strategy Now I will admit that I voted for Rudy in the 1997 mayoral election based on the premise that the drastic improvement of life in New York outweighed his obvious personality flaws But Jodi surely you will agree with me that temperament alone not to mention his future vote to re elect Trent Lott as Senate majority leader makes Giuliani cosmically ill suited to serve in a legislative body especially since he would be required to work and play well with others You also find me jaded because I fail to grasp the promise of a Hillary Rudy Senate race Jodi do you really expect a high minded debate on public housing and the plight of upstate dairy farmers The Giuliani Clinton campaign would be fought out on your TV screen with dueling negative ads about Whitewater billing records and police brutality Such a down and dirty contest would make last year s Schumer D Amato mud bath seem like Periclean Athens in comparison What politically would interest me How about a presidential race between Bill Bradley and John McCain As a political reporter I desperately long to watch two candidates with enough self confidence and authenticity to resist the prefabricated political dictates of the campaign consultants For all my apparent grumpiness one of the joys of this e mail correspondence is that you find things in the papers that I had missed like Johnny Apple s succulent tribute to cookbook writer Richard Olney But as someone who alas had to compose one of those formulaic Times death notices let me provide a bit of explanation The problem is not the Times which I think would print anything that wasn t obscene or libelous in these paid notices but the bereaved themselves As you look at this sad eyed page of agate type amidst your grief you find yourself deciding that this is not a moment for creative writing Jodi please write me back with joyous tidings on happier topics
