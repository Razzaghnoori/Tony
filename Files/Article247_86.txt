 Poster Boys David I Made Paula Jones Famous Brock who wants everyone to know that he deeply regrets single handedly bringing down the president isn t the only journalist to have reported the allegations of Arkansas state troopers who claim to have procured women for then Gov Clinton In addition to the Los Angeles Times the American Spectator in April 1994 printed a long well documented piece by Daniel Wattenberg recounting the tale of Trooper L D Brown who claims to have solicited over a hundred women for Clinton Does Wattenberg who quit the Spectator that same year still stand by his story Yes I do he says In a phone interview Thursday night Brock was not as oily as Chatterbox had hoped he d be But he was quite disingenuous on the subject of whether he still believes the troopers essential allegations In his well hyped Esquire apology the most recent one not last year s I was a hatchet man number in which he defended his Troopergate reporting Brock merely says he s had occassional pangs of doubt about the trooper story Not exactly a recantation What reporter doesn t have occasional pangs of doubt about controversial pieces Pressed on this point Brock paused then paused some more then would only say There may well be some truth in what the troopers say I don t know I m not ruling it out I m not standing by it At least that is his position on the record You get the sense that he doesn t want to say anything that might annoy his new White House friends If he thought the gist of the troopers story was false of course he could just declare that he thought it was false Asked if he still defends his earlier anti Anita Hill sexological snooping Brock unenthusiastically says Yeah Stand Up Backstabbing Paul Begala is emerging as Mr Loyalty in the Flytrap scandal Is that the same Paul Begala who leaked nasty little tidbits about fellow Clintonians to Bob Woodward for use in the latter s 1994 book The Agenda Like the detail that in a meeting with Begala Deputy Budget Director Alice Rivlin was eating a chicken salad sandwich which was dripping from her chin That s loyalty Begala also called his colleague then Budget Director Leon Panetta The Poster Boy for Economic Constipation Of course in the great 1993 debate between Begala s don t tax the middle class populists and Rivlin and Panetta s Wall Street pleasing budget balancers Rivlin and Panetta have been proven right and Begala proven wrong The Sabato Scorecard In the early stages of Flytrap University of Virginia media critic Larry Feeding Frenzy Sabato was all over the tube promoting his view that 40 percent of all that facts that come out in the early stages of a scandal will always turn out to be wrong Call it Sabato s Law Chatterbox would like to pose a contrary hypothesis in Flytrap virtually all the stories that get criticized as the false products of a Sabatovian feeding frenzy will turn out to be essentially true Here are four of them Did Clinton give Monica a dress Did Clinton seemingly coach Betty Currie with leading questions as reported in the New York Times Did steward Bayani Nelvis see Clinton and Monica alone in the study near the Oval Ofice as reported in the Wall Street Journal Did a Secret Service agent see Clinton and Monica in a compromising situation as the Dallas Morning News initially reported In an ambiguous situation as the paper s second watered down version had it Keep score at home Add new stories to the list as they come out and get knocked down with carefully worded denials by Clinton affiliated lawyers as was the so far perfectly accurate New York Times story on Currie see Chatterbox for 2 18 Remember that to win Sabato has to get four out of 10 Or maybe his own pontifications were part of that inaccurate 40 percent The same way all those ordinary voters who are telling pollsters they think it s OK to lie may be lying to the pollsters about what they think Of course even if all the feeding frenzy stories turn out to be true by the time they are proven true the public may already have come to the unshakable conclusion that they re suspect or the public may be so accustomed to the scandal that it doesn t care This is the genius behind the knock it down today forget about tomorrow Clinton strategy DOX KNOX BROX CROX Chatterbox would love to dismiss the idea that a president s function is to be a role model as opposed to simply an effective president Alas the evidence keeps coming in that the role model effect is real The latest This week s study in the Journal of the American Medical Association confirming that mastectomies increased after Nancy Reagan chose to undergo that radical procedure rather than have a less drastic lumpectomy Indeed lumpectomies dropped 25 percent The conclusion medical care can be influenced substantially by the behavior of celebrity role models And sexual behavior can be influenced substantially by Which brings us to the CHATTERBOX LEXIS NEXIS FIND OF THE DAY Let me say that there is a lot of talk about personal responsibility What we have to do is practice it There s a lot of talk about valuing family and work and community What we have to do is value them President Clinton remarks before the 25th anniversary dinner of the Congressional Black Caucus Sept 23 1995 Chatterbox is already feeling occasional pangs of doubt about all of the above items
