 FDA Smoke Rings My father was the supreme regulator in our family promising each of his six children a 100 cash subsidy from the family treasury if they did not partake of nicotiana before age 21 Dad was a Camel man and his offer usually came as he filled the air with smoke and ash He so despised his deadly habit that he routinely thumped any kid caught sneaking puffs in the attic Tomorrow s parents won t have to regulate their tobacco tempted teens because the federal government has taken the job President Cigar I mean Clinton made teen smoking a federal affair two years ago when he unleashed the Food and Drug Administration on the problem And there is a problem A recent study shows that 34 percent of high school seniors now smoke compared with 25 percent of adults Clinton s FDA commissioner David A Kessler inserted the federal government into the fray by diagnosing teen smoking as a pediatric disease Assuming regulatory control over the noxious weed for the first time in the agency s history he defined tobacco as a drug and tobacco products cigarettes cigars chew as drug delivery devices under the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act Discovering these regulatory powers which had escaped the notice of other FDA commissioners for more than 80 years Kessler issued a slew of rules designed to suppress teen smoking most of which were upheld by U S District Judge William L Osteen Sr late last month Although Osteen s decision is currently under appeal he approved Kessler s ban on tobacco sales to anyone under 18 as well as the commissioner s various prohibitions on cigarette vending machines self service cigarette displays and free samples of tobacco He also approved the FDA s new warning label for cigarette packs Nicotine Delivery Device for Persons 18 or Older Of course the evil tobacco bastards recoiled from Kessler s rules In court they argued that the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act limits the FDA s regulatory powers to drugs and medical devices that provide medical benefits The tobacconists perverse logic held that poisonous products like cigarettes for which no health claim is made should fall outside government regulation The tobacco bastards didn t actually call their product poisonous in court but that s their take home message Regulate us if our product heals but don t regulate us if our product kills And make no mistake about it tobacco kills The average cigarette smoker lives eight fewer years than the average nonsmoker But just because the tobacco companies are evil doesn t mean that we should sympathize with the FDA which has convoluted the law to wound its foe If the FDA were consistent it would leapfrog the Drug Enforcement Administration and start regulating marijuana The drug here is THC and the delivery system is a joint Or it would police whiskey and shot glasses Or it would go after the Big Mac as an unhealthful fat delivery device You laugh The FDA currently regulates that nonfat delivery device olestra So how did the FDA succeed in regulating tobacco In the guise of protecting children Don t get me wrong Some of my best friends are children but I don t want to live in a childproof world and most kids don t want to grow up to inherit such a safe place either The joy of being an adult lies in the freedom to take chances even if you have to pay the consequences Osteen s decision proves that almost any liberty can be nibbled away if suffering children can be associated with it But even the judge approved only the most overt nanny state measures requested by the FDA acknowledging the agency s power grab by rejecting the proposals that don t directly deter teen smoking For instance the FDA wanted to bar tobacco companies from sponsoring sports events or placing Marlboro Man and Joe Camel logos on T shirts caps and other gear The FDA claims that its ad busting rules are the best way to achieve the administration s goals of halving teen smoking in the next seven years But young Americans aren t as helpless in the face of the tobacco industry juggernaut as the Clintonites would like to imagine Black teen agers are already hitting the president s goals A1995 government study found that while 38 percent of white teen age boys smoke cigarettes only 19 percent of their black contemporaries do Young black girls are even more resistant to tobacco Forty percent of young white girls smoke vs only 12 percent of young black girls It wasn t always so Just 20 years ago young blacks and young whites smoked in equal percentages What changed One theory holds that young white girls unlike young black girls subscribe to a cult of thinness and smoke to block their appetite Some black teens tell researchers that they feel that society has so thoroughly stacked the deck against them with racial discrimination crime and poverty that their very survival depends on resisting tobacco And still others maintain that young blacks are quicker to see through Joe Camel s charms than young whites To the sociologists speculations add mine Everybody likes a little danger in their lives but perhaps most black kids are already experiencing all the hazards their psyches can take Meanwhile kids of all races who live inside elaborately constructed safety cones airbags mandatory bicycle helmets mommy pagers home security systems anti drug campaigns anti sex propaganda and sanitized for your protection suburbs yearn for something to rebel against At 15 cents per protest smoking is a cheap ticket to danger The buzz ain t bad either Another reason the FDA got away with the power grab is because the Zeitgeist has been moving in the agency s direction for some time Our culture now interprets nearly all pleasures as addictions or potential addictions Case in point Time magazine s reductive cover story of May 5 on the neurotransmitter dopamine According to Time dopamine explains how and why we become addicted to sex drugs booze gambling food cheap thrills and yes tobacco Shall we call in the FDA regulators to protect us from our addictive desires The FDA may have no current plans to dispatch referees to our bedrooms to enforce safe sex but when it does you can be sure it will be in the guise of protecting children My mom and dad eventually quit the cigarette habit as did my oldest brother and my baby sister The juvenile delinquent in the brood smoked for 12 years before he died in an accident at the age of 26 Two of my brothers still smoke although both would press the magic button and quit tomorrow if they could I alone collected the 100 bounty posted by my Dad I ve still never smoked a cigarette although I ll enjoy a Cuban cigar if you re buying I collected my C note at my 21 st birthday party Dad planted it in my birthday cake on a makeshift flagstaff I don t remember what I spent the money on but I do recall how I rebelled my way through high school I drank to howling puking excess
