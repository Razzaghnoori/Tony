 The Blues One thing that separates intuitive artists from hacks and players is their difficulty doing even mediocre work when their cylinders aren t firing In the absence of true inspiration they can t fall back on a crafty understanding of what the audience wants because they don t really know what the audience wants They follow their instincts and pray that they ll connect When they don t the result is something like The Muse which left me more dispirited than any movie in ages has Albert Brooks is my hero and I don t like the thought of people seeing this dud satire and concluding that he has lost his way More to the point I don t like the thought that he has lost his way At least The Muse tackles this subject head on the loss of one s way in a culture as venal as Hollywood s The protagonist Steven Phillips Brooks is a middle aged screenwriter whose three picture deal is terminated by a callow executive Mark Feuerstein who tells him he no longer has his edge When other studios show no interest Steven goes to cry on the shoulder of an old friend Jack Warrick Jeff Bridges a vastly successful writer producer Tanned and beaming after a string of recent triumphs Jack decides to introduce his old buddy to his muse Sarah Sharon Stone a goddess of inspiration supposedly descended from the ancient Greeks Sarah we learn played a part in the latest hits of Rob Reiner Martin Scorsese and James Cameron all of whom show up to pay homage and bring expensive gifts Although he s incredulous Steven can t afford to pass up a chance to get his edge back especially with a wife Andie MacDowell and kids and a house in Pacific Palisades to maintain In no time Sarah orders him to put her up in a 1 700 a night suite on a high floor of the Four Seasons she s an ultrasensitive sleeper provide a limousine and be ready to work at whatever hour she feels the urge to inspire him In the first half hour The Muse plays a little flatly but that s not too troubling artful flatness has always been a component of Brooks genius The camera stares unblinking at Steven in conversation with uncomprehending or contemptuous superiors The message is that there s no escape from the ignominy not even through the often lame one liners he employs to win them over When he goes for a meeting with Mr Spielberg Steven is denied drive on privileges the camera holds on him as he makes the long grueling hike through the studio compound and a passing tour bus driver draws attention to his lowly walk on status Then he finds the meeting is with Stan Spielberg scraggly haired Steven Wright who hasn t seen his famous cousin in a year and doesn t even know what he s supposed to be doing there This is familiar Brooksian territory impotence prolonged and stylized until it turns into Theater of the Absurd The universe exists to humiliate Brooks protagonists to remind them of the precariousness of everything that they d smugly assumed was fixed the steadiness of a job the permanence of a relationship the support of a mother the benign regard of the universe In The Muse however the masochism feels a little too reflexive and the picture s flatness gets flatter by the minute Brooks is baking with dead yeast As it turns out the movie isn t about the mystery of creativity but rather the New Age idiocy of people who d accept the idea of a muse or by extension of gurus or smart drugs or the power of cabala For some reason Brooks and his co writer Monica Johnson have made their protagonist an unbelievably uninteresting man a mopey scattershot hack Brooks might disagree He told Gavin Smith in Film Comment that Steven is a good screenwriter going through the exact period that tons of screenwriters are Ninety nine percent of writers write for hire They all get scared when the executives become younger than their children they get worried that they re not going to get those jobs anymore so they start writing things that maybe they don t love or they re not close to But Brooks hasn t provided any evidence that Steven was ever a decent writer His screenplay ideas in the company of the muse are pathetically feeble and when she encourages them and when they find favor with Steven s agent and the executives who d previously spurned him the point seems to be that everyone in the film industry is a moron Brooks who is often accused wrongly of playing himself has left himself too far out of The Muse At least I hope he has How else to account for this bland pasty not terribly funny protagonist The heroes of Real Life 1979 Modern Romance 1981 and Lost in America 1985 have their jerky sides emotionally squeamish viewers tend to find them repellent but they also have compensatory gifts chiefly Brooks urgent babble in which pleas are made and then restated and then turned inside out in a way that brilliantly and hilariously distills neurotic thought processes His advertising executive in Lost in America has zero insight into himself but he s still an idealist who boldly attempts to live out the escapist fantasies of his generation He has as buffoons go enormous stature With his next film Defending Your Life 1991 Brooks tried to make his alter ego more palatable to a mass audience to seem vulnerable instead of insecure See my Slate of Brooks 1996 movie Mother for the quotation The result was often charming but the upbeat go for it ending felt simple minded Brooks best scenes operate on an X ray level of honesty so that shortcuts formulas easy ways out of dramatic jams stuff that slicker filmmakers can get by with seem in his work embarrassingly exposed Lost in America is a road movie that suggests the impossibility of travel perhaps Brooks conceived of The Muse as a movie about the creative spirit that would subversively suggest the impossibility at least in Hollywood of creation That might have worked if his characters showed signs of having deeper yearnings the way they do in many of Paul Mazursky s Los Angeles set satires so that there would be some tension between what they think they want and what they actually need But the characters in The Muse are dull witted materialists and limp encounter follows limp encounter until the movie seems populated by pod people A hint that something is off comes early when Steven receives a humanitarian award A nice touch It s presented by Cybill Shepherd who did some of the most attractive scenes of her career opposite Brooks in Taxi Driver 1976 Steven gives a winning perhaps too self deprecating speech then holds his plaque high and crows I m king of the room And no one laughs the audience stares at him puzzled Brooks has spent too much time by himself if he thinks people in Los Angeles wouldn t get that joke even the non English speaking busboys would be cackling How is Sharon Stone at comedy That s a trick question because her best performance in Basic Instinct 1992 was essentially a comic turn a lusty glittery eyed sendup of film noir femmes fatales Here she starts promisingly looking odd and imposing in her caftans childishly impervious to the absurdity of her demands But she s heavy spirited and it isn t long before she runs out of invention and starts pulling goofy faces like the one where she sucks a drink through a straw and rolls her eyes skyward like a distracted 5 year old She isn t mercurial enough to be funny She s just a narcissistic dope and you come to feel contempt for anyone who d swallow her bull Stone s scenes with MacDowell whom she inspires to bake cookies are the deadest that Brooks has ever directed and his own with MacDowell are only marginally more lively If you want an actor to flesh out an underwritten character don t hire MacDowell who tends to sound as if she learns her lines phonetically Jeff Bridges does a relaxed and confident turn but he s acting with his tan The only scene that completely works is between Brooks and an Italian guy Mario Opinato who doesn t understand a word he says an exhilarating throwback to the radio comedy days of Brooks dad Harry Einstein also known as Parkyakarcas Since I saw The Muse I ve been struggling to figure out why it went so wrong why the muse deserted the movie s maker Has Brooks like Steven lost his edge Maybe the reasons aren t so dire Brooks obviously shares his protagonist s insecurity about his position in the industry in common with Steven he never knows if he ll get the money to make another film but the two have little in common where it really counts artistically They barely overlap From the start Brooks impulses have taken him to the source of his darkest anxieties As a stand up comic he was less interested in jokes than in the desperate needy impulse behind the jokes As a writer and director he has been less preoccupied with gags than with the fear and helplessness out of which they spring How could he possibly be inspired by Steven Phillips who thinks of nothing but writing a summer blockbuster comedy set in a ramshackle aquarium and starring Jim Carrey I m not saying that Brooks doesn t dream of being popular and having status only that he d have to do it his way working outward from the bone Maybe it s reassuring that The Muse is so bad since a lot of other people could have made it and made it better Maybe Brooks muse is showing him what happens when you satirize people who are so far beneath you
