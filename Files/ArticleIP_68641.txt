 Question the Question In the first five minutes of Friday s Republican presidential debate in South Carolina three of the six candidates refused to answer questions as posed They rephrased queries rejected scenarios and chose options other than those offered by the moderators When politicians revise questions this way as they do with increasing frequency journalists accuse them of ducking But if someone swings a bottle at your head what s wrong with ducking If the answer is fair game for scrutiny and dispute why isn t the question Think about how politicians manipulate discussions of issues They insert hidden assumptions to rig the dialogue in their favor They narrow the range of options under discussion to force their opponents into embarrassing dilemmas They frame lopsided yes no questions and squelch attempts to articulate a middle ground When reporters use these tactics why shouldn t they too be called to account That s what the Republicans did Friday For every artfully framed question they demonstrated a way to escape and counterframe it 1 Reject the premise The first question of the debate went to Alan Keyes If you had a choice between eight more years of a Democratic president or eight years of a pro choice Republican asked co moderator David Stanton of WIS TV which would you choose Keyes replied I don t think that has to be our choice We have to choose to stand forthrightly for the pro life position So your hypothetical is of no matter to me We will not face that alternative A hypothetical question is no more important than the likelihood of the scenario it assumes Imagine that Al Gore were asked to choose between a Republican president and a pro life Democrat who had pledged to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe vs Wade Since no leading Democratic presidential candidate is pro life Gore could reasonably dismiss the question arguing that the Democratic Party is too principled to nominate a pro lifer Why can t Keyes make the converse argument about the GOP 2 Add an option The third question of the debate went to Gary Bauer Stanton asked If someone in your family was raped and became pregnant and wanted an abortion and at the discussion with you they were adamant in their decision to have an abortion would you support that decision Or would you try to prevent it Bauer replied If my daughter or somebody that I loved was raped that would be the most horrible thing I would comfort her I would pray with her I would explain to her that she couldn t make right the terrible thing that had happened to her by taking the life of her innocent unborn child But the most important thing sir is not what I would do under those circumstances but what I would do as president And as president I would throw rapists in jail for a long time so America s women wouldn t have to worry about it The question is designed to make Bauer choose between two terrible answers hypocrisy he d allow the abortion because the woman is in his family or cruelty he d force the victim to suffer the lifelong consequences of her rape In his answer Bauer begins by amending what he deems the less awful of the two options He wouldn t just prevent the abortion he would comfort and counsel the woman Then Bauer steps outside the two option scenario forced on him and argues for a third option which he claims would prevent the scenario The efficacy of the third option can be debated But until Bauer enlarged the question this option wasn t even on the table 3 Choose a process not a position The fourth question went to George W Bush A few blocks from here on top of the state Capitol building the Confederate flag flies with the state flag and the U S flag said co moderator Brian Williams of NBC The question is Does the flag offend you personally Bush replied What you re trying to get me to do is to express the will of the people of South Carolina Williams persisted No I m asking you about your personal opinion Bush elaborated I don t believe it s the role of someone from outside South Carolina to come into this state and tell the people of South Carolina what to do with their business when it comes to the flag Williams repeated As an American citizen do you have a visceral reaction to seeing the Confederate flag And Bush concluded As an American citizen I trust the people of South Carolina to make the decision for South Carolina The prolonged exchange made Bush look evasive and he was criticized afterward for dodging the question But why is Williams formulation of the issue better than Bush s Suppose Williams were to ask Bill Bradley A few blocks from here women are walking into a clinic every day and receiving abortions Does abortion offend you personally And suppose Bradley were to reply I don t believe it s the role of a politician to go into that clinic and tell those women what to do with their bodies I trust the women of South Carolina to make that decision Most people would agree that the process Bradley is endorsing let the woman decide is more relevant than his visceral reaction as to whether abortion offends him personally Why can t Bush make the same argument 4 Insert a caveat Halfway through the debate Williams announced a brief phase of short questions and rapid fire answers We will settle for one to two sentences in length if you must All gentlemen will answer this first question Has affirmative action made America a better nation McCain answered first Yes but quotas have made it worse Bauer answered second The idea behind affirmative action was legitimate and decent But when you start counting by race you divide America you don t bring it together Bush answered third Only if affirmative action means equal opportunity for everybody The question seems to demand a yes no answer Instead the candidates reply with but and only if This kind of qualification is often ridiculed as evasiveness by those who demand no ifs ands or buts But why is a policy of ifs and buts worse than a policy of no ifs and buts Most people prefer a morality of ifs and buts and most real life laws and regulations are riddled with ifs and buts Affirmative action in particular cries out for such moral and legal nuance What voters really needed from the candidates on this question were longer answers not shorter ones For example what does Bush mean by equal opportunity 5 Change the question By the time the affirmative action question got to the sixth candidate Keyes it was being completely rewritten It may be more important to ask whether it s helped the people it was supposed to help he began And I think it has actually hurt them by damaging the reputation of many minorities in this country and not giving them credit for their real achievements Keyes answer didn t precisely address the question but which was more interesting and enlightening When the question is more specific than the answer a candidate can be accused of evasion But what s wrong with an answer that s more specific than the question Keyes wasn t ducking the pitch He was tossing back a weak hanging slider and demanding a fastball so he could hit it harder 6 Reject the topic A few minutes later Stephanie Trotter a local NBC reporter asked the candidates Gentlemen I m curious As an adult what is the biggest mistake that you ve made and what lesson did you learn from it The crowd booed and when Trotter was asked to repeat the question she rephrased it Our viewers are curious On a personal note what is the biggest mistake you made as an adult and what lesson did you learn from it Others answered the question but Keyes stuffed it The biggest mistake I might make as an adult would be to treat that as if it s a question that is appropriate to be asked he said There ought to be in our public life a certain decorum a certain dignity There are things that I ll tell my priest in the confessional that I will not tell you or any other American However Keyes added In terms of what I think we believe to be relevant for the purposes of running for president maybe the biggest mistake I had made in my public life was not to have spoken out on the issue of the right of the unborn before I did Keyes overreacted but his answer illustrated three lessons First sometimes the propriety or significance of a question is a more important and instructive topic than the question itself Whether the question was improper can be debated as it turned out Keyes comments about his mistake on abortion were more interesting than his comments about the question but viewers benefited from considering both Second challenging questions is a healthy way to hold the press accountable Questions are instruments of power Who gets to choose them Notice how Trotter changed her question after the crowd booed her First she said I m curious Then she said Our viewers are curious Obliged to account for her question she appealed to the notion of a popular mandate Whether her station s viewers wanted her to ask that question can be checked What questions should be asked why they should be asked and who gets to choose them are now open subjects for scrutiny Third even if the question was really about Keyes public life he ended up answering it Believing that it was framed too personally he didn t just dismiss it He reframed it the way he thought it should have been asked and he answered it Questions don t have to be answered with a yes or no Neither does the question of whether to answer them
