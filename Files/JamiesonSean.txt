 Testing one two three four I m here with Sean Jamieson he s going to be the third subject and I m just making sure this recorder s working good OK we re here with Sean Jamieson he is the third subject here in the um project and Sean is from Chicago originally And uh how would you describe your your accent the way you speak or To to well I guess I I of course I don t think I have an accent Ah I speak like ah everybody I grew up speaks so speaks the same way but ah to the extent I have one it s a would be Midwestern I I think more generically Midwestern than specifically Chicago Chicago to me sound is is more nasal and more pronounced and sounds like ah sounds surprisingly close to Chi New York Uh But I don t think I speak like that however you may prove me wrong But you re from the suburban area Suburban Chicago that s right So that may have something to do with that Um hum And and how about living in the South Do you think that s actually ah I mean when if when you go back up North do people say Hey I can tell you re picking up some y alls or something I have not heard that to the to the best of my knowledge I have never knowingly used the term y all But ah maybe maybe the words are slightly as far as you know They might be I don t know ah you know the people I hang out with in Charlotte by and large are are not Southerners because the people I work with and the people who are my friends tend to be transplants as well The newspaper business recruits nationally and so the people I work with are from all over the country That s right And only a minority I guess are Southerners and uh my friends here are tend to be people from other places as well and rather than rather than ah Southerners or Charlotteans so I don t ah I m not although when I m in the store and when I m out and about in other places yeah I hear the Southern accent but I don t I think my speech patterns are probably pretty much set at this point and and I don t think I m picking anything up OK so and we re talking we re talking about um I guess going back to Chicago and um your you want to talk about your family um on your dad s side Yeah I was Trying trying to think of a subject to talk about and I I m I m not good at remembering stories I don t remember jokes and I don t remember stories which is which says something about the way my brain works but I do remember you know hearing about family history and such and and uh had asked about it since then to to figure out how everybody ah came to be in Canada which is where is where my dad s side of the family is from and my dad came down to the United States in the middle of the 60s when he was working for a company in Guelph Ontario which is outside of Toronto and met my mom in at that time and he settled down they settled down in the Chicago suburbs and and spent their whole lives there Ah but my dad both my grandparents on my dad s side were born in Europe My grandfather was born in Edinburgh Scotland and my grandmother was born in County Cork Ireland They both immigrated well my grandmother immigrated to New York I believe and then made her way up to Rhode Island where I believe she worked as a domestic And my grandfather ran away from home as a very young boy and became a sailor and sailed back and fourth across the Atlantic I know that much and I don t know where all else he sailed but ah eventually got tired of that and left his ship in New York and and was spending was in New York and this was I guess about the time of WWI Do you think he was fishing or was he doing He was working he was doing some sort of work I don t know exactly what this is this is a little bit ah hazy I don t know if my dad s if I ve ever if my dad s told me that I don t recall exactly what it was and then my so my my grandfather was living in New York I believe in an immigrant community in New York and the Canadian Army was recruiting from among immigrants because I believe at the time the Canadians did not uh did not draft did not draft during WWI and try need but they needed to help the British fighting in Europe and so the they decided that a good place to recruit would be among the immigrant communities in NY particularly among people who had immigrated from the British Isles And the promise was that if you made it through the war you would have a shot at some ah you know there would be money for you at the end ah you d be able to settle in Canada And so my grandfather joined the Brit and joined the Canadian army fought in France was wounded and eventually made his way back to I guess New York and then up to Rhode Island where he met my grandmother I don t know the exact sequence of events here but he met my grandmother and then moved to to ah Ontario Canada where He had a farm waiting for him right Where he had a where he became tried to become a farmer and this was an area about 60 miles southwest of Toronto in what at the time must have been a pretty remote part of part of the province Turns out he was not very successful as a farmer and gave that up and moved into the city of Guelph which was a decent sized a free standing city outside of of Toronto but much smaller than Toronto and build a house there and became did a variety of jobs ah I don t believe I don t know if he had a particular trade other than being a sailor so he worked in a variety of jobs I know during the Depression he worked as a as a night watchman at a factory and he was my dad talked about how he how my grandfather felt very fortunate that he didn t lose his job during the Depression that at least he was able to keep a job all through the Depression working as a night watchman and they built a house which the family owns as of today In fact my aunt who just died within the last month was living in the house that my grandmother and grandfather built when they first moved to Guelph very old wood framed house on two lots and at the time this wasn t a big deal but now it is there s about a hundred yards of a hundred yard wide strip of forest behind the house and then behind that is a private country club and a very nice one and so the land the land has become very valuable At the time obviously it wasn t a big deal to live on a golf course and now it is so that that property is still in the family um as a kid my I used to go we used to go up there every year for family reunions we would ah drive from Chicago through Detroit up to Guelph To the same house To the same house that my grandmother and grandfather had had built and uh attend the family reunion my dad was one of eight kids and I guess six of them married and everybody had at least three kids The number of kids that my aunts and uncles had varied I guess from three to six So there was a pretty good good crowd at the reunions Typically about 75 to 80 people at each at each reunion which is held in August of every year You ever count how many first cousins you have Um I m not sure I know Somebody has these numbers but I m not sure but ah but my dad s my dad s siblings were so ah spread out in age they re at least 20 years at least 20 years from the oldest to the youngest so my oldest uncle had married fairly young he had fought in WWII and he was married during WWII and I believe he and my aunt had their first child during the War and that that was a cousin of mine named Dave who I oh when I first met him and his wife I thought they were my aunt and uncle but when I got older I realized that they re actually my first cousins they were just old enough to be my parents and so it seemed to me like they were too old to be cousins because the people I associated with being my cousins were my age or relatively close to my age uh and they were a large group of these kids but these other two were like um my parents age and hanging out with my parents at the reunion and you know drinking beer under the tent and shooting the crap and I just thought they were my aunt and uncle but they were actually my cousins uh and that was because It s like their ah dad s ah brother or sister beared children other Yeah exactly exactly Your dad s probably ah oldest brother Right that was my dad s oldest brother and his wife s oldest kids so there was and then then there would be different people who would show up at different reunions so every year there would be people there who I didn t know and then I would we re fairly close relatives but I didn t know who they were and so I would always have to be asking or would kind of wait for an introduction of some sort So it was quite you needed a scorecard to keep track of who was who And it got even more confusing when my cousins got older and would bring girlfriends or boyfriends or spouses who I never met before to oh the reunions and it all just ah so it s still uh these days I was at one about two years ago a reunion and there are still about 75 to 80 people who show up consistently every year although it s it s a different group of people they ll be you know there s a group of maybe 20 or 25 who don t come to every reunion like me but there ll be a different 20 or 25 in there So the number of people who show up is pretty consistent it s just that the group changes somewhat from year to year as the people are are available to make the weekend or aren t Um Is it every year they have the reunion Every year yeah we do a reunion every year And it was was my my aunt who owned my Aunt Pat who had the ah my grandparents old house who was instrumental in getting these started and keeping them going because she realized she told me this just within the last couple of years that she thought it was very important to have the reunions every year so the family would stay in touch with each other cause otherwise I would never have known my cousins because the only things we might have gotten together for would be maybe at weddings and funerals which are not good opportunities to do much mixing and mingling because there are other things on the agenda At a wedding or a funeral it s really hard to catch up with people So my aunt had been had been real smart about about scheduling those every year and trying to get as many people there as possible so that we all ah kept in touch and we all know who our cousins and our relatives were So who s going to ah start doing that who s going to be coordinating that now that she s Ah one of my cousins apparently is well two of my cousins are are keeping it going in fact I just had a phone message tonight from my dad saying that the date has been set for this August on the reunion and ah it s not clear who s going to host it but ah there s still quite a large group of family members in this city of Guelph and somebody is going to end up hosting it Ah the reason that one of the reasons my Aunt Pat was always good at being the hostess for it is that the family had there are two small houses on four big lots on this dead end street so there was a lot of room for everybody to kind of spread out put up a couple of tents or shelters or whatever have barbecue grills out there and uh a couple of houses to run in and use the bathroom whatever so there s just a lot of room and uh but it s not clear if that house is going to be sold or not now that my aunt has ah passed away Apparently in her will she said that the house should be sold and the money given to a ah couple of my aunts and it s not clear if a family member is going to buy the house and sort of keep it in the family or what s going happen to it but I m hoping that they keep it because it s it s ah there s so many family members there that you think somebody would want to hang on to it and it s such a nice set up with really sort of an extended family that always sort of lived right on this block and uh I m thinking would probably want to keep hang on to the house How many of your um um I guess that s these are all the ah brothers and sisters of your your dad Of my dad yeah How many of them live in is it Guelph It s the name of the city is Guelph Yeah it s named for a city in Belgium I believe and I m not sure How do you spell it G U E L P H OK And I m not sure why it s named for a city in Belgium but it is There is let s see I ve got an aunt and an uncle and two of their kids are still there I ve got an aunt who s a widow and a cousin I I m running out of fingers here but ah and then an aunt or ah a a cousin and his wife and their three kids and let s see that s about a dozen people right there that I can think of off the top of my head and then quite a few cousins and their and their families and kids are in the Toronto area some of some of them have moved away and come back ah but everybody most of them have sort of settled in and around the Toronto area in the suburbs in one direction or another Oh there s in fact there s a cousin and her husband and their ah their six kids who just moved back to Guelph after having been ah ah his business had taken him away for a couple of years but now they re back in Guelph so that s number six So I d say there must be at least 20 uh immediate relatives that are still living in Guelph Um now how big of a city is that I want to say it s 90 or 100 thousand or something like that There s a couple of other cities of similar size nearby so it s almost getting to be like its own metropolitan area small metro area Right So it s um almost like you ll you ll meet ah if you go to Guelph you ll meet someone will probably know a Jamieson there Yeah yeah because some of like my aunt who just died was a bookkeeper who worked at a lot of local businesses and was extremely gregarious so I think she was probably on a first name basis with a awful lot of the people who shopped downtown or whoever went downtown she was she lived there all her life and just knew a lot of people and they sort of come out of that kind of that Irish tradition like everybody s your friend everybody s your neighbor and even people that ah should be fairly casually she d greet those people by name and know a little bit about them ah and so yeah she s ah and my cousin one of my cousins has a couple of businesses in town and I think is relatively well known is on some sort of city board or something like that Yeah the family is big enough and the city is small enough I think that you would run into a decent number of people who would know a Jamieson or two Or at least somebo dy married to a Jamieson That s right Interesting Uh huh And then ah I guess the family reunion is when is the next one you re going to go to It s August 12th of this year August 12th of 2000 and uh don t know don t know too many more details about it and don t know if I ll be able to go I went a couple of years ago and didn t make it last year and I m I m now I m kind of sorry I didn t because my aunt passed away in the meantime and I knew she was in poor health last year Oh but there s just um just a couple of my dad s generation left It s they re starting to get up there and and a lifetime of bad eating habits is starting to catch up although my aunt was about 75 when she when she died so she had a she had a long run Sounds like she was getting out and meeting a lot of people She was yeah right up right up to the day ah when she fell and I think she fell and broke her hip if I recall what put her in the hospital She was ah I think she was ah downtown I think she had taken the bus or a cab downtown and had uh met with her lady friends to have lunch or something She did almost every day and I recall that she slipped and fell and then as happens with a lot of older people developed complications while she was in the hospital and ah never never recovered unfortunately It sounds simple breaking your hip but you just it is I I m sure you know older people who ve had that happen to them you get into the hospital and you end up catching an infection or something like that from somebody else and your immune system is kind of weakened and she just um um didn t make it unfortunately It sounds like a big loss for the community just because there was so many people and she organized the family reunions but you know at least you know you ve got somebody that s going to take over and start putting that back together there Yeah but Aunt Pat was definitely the matriarch of the family Matriarch huh Matriarch That s a good that s a good vocabulary word You can you can probably add a whole chapter in the report of my use of the word matriarch That and a couple of others too I m sure OK I m not sure if I said ah Sean s name but this is Sean Jamieson from Charlotte and um and uh you know he s the third um subject I think you did say that You might have said my name at the beginning I m just not positive Is it And uh I think we did a little background on your dialect or how you think you speak That s right that s right OK that s that s and that should wrap it up there Thanks Sean
