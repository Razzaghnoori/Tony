 Disordered Diana Editor s note Some of the letters below originally appeared in The Fray Slate s reader feedback forum Who s Deliriously Mean Spirited Your review of my book Diana in Search of Herself was so confusing that I scarcely know how to respond see the Sept 2 posting Your writer asserts in the first sentence that it was deliriously mean spirited a surprising statement given that reviewers for Time Newsweek and the Washington Post among others have remarked on the even handedness of my book In fact Judith Shulevitz is herself deliriously mean spirited and I resent the fact that she relies on material from my book in an effort to make her arguments Your writer assesses the book in only one other place noting that Diana suffered from what Smith dubiously diagnoses as a borderline personality disorder The review promptly lists seven psychological problems that plagued Diana all of which are common in those afflicted with borderline personality disorder For the record I used the term as a framework for understanding Diana in particular how its symptoms interacted to produce the chaotic behavior that so many close to her witnessed over the years I emphasized that while I couldn t say with certainty that Diana had the disorder the evidence as presented throughout the previous 363 pages was compelling As it happens a number of psychiatrists have approached me since the book s publication to say that Diana was a classic borderline I suppose that I should be flattered that the three meatiest paragraphs of five in the review were drawn entirely from my biography But as someone who read a vast amount of what had been written about Diana conducted 150 interviews many with her intimates and included 60 pages of detailed footnotes I find it dismaying that Slate would run such a disingenuous review Sally Bedell Smith Sucking Up to the Boss always makes for interesting reading whether or not it really gets anyone to give besides maybe Bill Gates is open to question but I m sure it can t hurt At least it s better than trying to rank colleges I have a question about that 225 million gift that heads the list though As far as I can see the gift was made by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation not the Gateses themselves Obviously most all of the foundation s assets have come from the Gateses and I don t want to diminish the generosity of surrendering 17 billion for the public good But strictly speaking there doesn t seem to be any other foundation on The Slate 60 list nor are Henry Ford Andrew Carnegie or the very living Walter Annenberg listed In truth I don t know how much the Annenberg Foundation gave away last quarter but let s pro rate its annual giving and guess that it was around 25 million based on 1998 s figures Here is the summary if you want to look it up In fact if I understand the rules a 17 billion foundation will have to give away roughly 170 million per quarter and in today s market and economy ought to have considerably more than that to spend even after hedging against inflation Aside from the occasional Ted Turner bombshell the Gateses seem to have just about guaranteed themselves the top slot on The Slate 60 for the rest of their lives even if they never give another nickel away As I said I don t want to suggest that Bill Gates isn t a generous person nor even that his giving doesn t represent considerable sacrifice on his part though it must be nice to be able to give that kind of money away But as this edition is constituted it looks an awful lot like sucking up to the boss Of course if it helps keep you in business by all means carry on Chris Hammett New York Ann Castle replies You re right that the head of the list gifts come from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation The funds in that foundation were given by the donors themselves so they meet our criteria as gifts from living individual Americans The Gateses use the foundation as their giving vehicle as do some others on the list You mention Henry Ford Andrew Carnegie and Walter Annenberg as examples of foundation founders who are not on the list Ford and Carnegie are easy to explain they are no longer living and we decided to list family foundation gifts only when one of the original donors is still alive The Annenbergs Walter and Leonore have appeared on the list previously But according to a cursory search done today the Annenberg Foundation announced gifts totaling 1 78 million in July 1999 a total that under our terms would not have met the minimum for the second quarter of 1999 This total was composed of 24 gifts ranging from 40 000 to 150 000 Our method looks for single large gifts There s nothing sacred about that technique others have ranked cumulative giving over a lifetime etc We count pledges as well as paid gifts I look for gifts announced by the donor or the recipient as gifts from individuals that s why you saw the Rockefeller name appear for the first time on The Slate 60 this quarter I also search for foundation gifts from individuals and have set an arbitrary minimum of 1 million We don t list gifts that we can t verify A gift was announced earlier this year from James E Beasley to Temple University Law School as the largest endowment in the history of the university to the law school which has been named the James E Beasley School of Law in his honor We couldn t verify any amount so this gift was not included in The Slate 60 although it almost certainly would have qualified Some people make all their gifts through their foundations others do a portion of their philanthropy that way Some give at a particular time of year others spread it out Many of the same people making announced large gifts also give anonymously and I don t try to ferret those out Our goal is to celebrate both donors and recipients so we list gifts as they are made out of a foundation to a separate nonprofit That s why the Gateses were not credited with the even larger amount that was announced in all the papers If we recognize them for the 6 billion they put into their foundation then we can t recognize the organizations that receive that money down the road or we d be double counting The fact is that the Gateses now have created the largest personal foundation in the United States and will probably continue to make the top or near the top of the list However as Jack Shafer noted in there are plenty of other people out there who could meet and exceed their 1999 running total of 255 million and not even wince At Lager Heads Don t get me wrong I vastly enjoyed James Fallows deep probing piece on blind beer tasting But Fallows does perpetuate a few common mistakes that should be cleared up 1 Lagers are the light colored relatively lightly flavored brews that make up most of the vattage of beer consumption in the United States 2 Sam s success could reflect its quasi mislabeling presenting a strong flavored beer as a lager Both of these statements are incorrect in their definition of lager Lager is one of the two main types of beer the other being ale Lager beers come in all varieties of flavors strengths and colors from the pale crisp Pilsener what most American beers are modeled on albeit weakly to thick deep brown rich strong 8 5 percent doppelbocks What defines a beer as lager is its method of fermentation at cool temperatures using a specific type of lager yeast with an extended cold maturation period Ales on the other hand tend to experience warm rapid fermentations Sam Adams is a lager beer that happens to be brewed in a slightly fuller flavored style something akin perhaps to mainstream American beers in the 40s and 50s But it is as much a lager as any of the other beers in Fallows tasting Ben Myers Author Best American Beers Defending the First Boy Scout Geoffrey Wheatcroft s article portrays all adult scout leaders as pedophiles who are involved with scouts for nothing more than a steady diet of young boys How tragic that this is the legacy that our prurient minds attach to one of the finest civic minded organizations of the century I was a Boy Scout throughout my childhood years I attained the rank of Eagle and never once did I feel as though I was in danger of being molested attacked leered at or otherwise harassed by an adult leader The men who were adult leaders while I was a scout were in many ways more influential on my life than my own parents were To lump these pillars of respectability in my life and in my community with the few bad seeds that slip through the cracks of the organization is a grave disservice to the thousands of men and women who willingly give their evenings weekends and dollars to an organization whose core goal is to mold impressionable boys into upstanding moral men In the future please research a story more before sniggering and laughing at a man in a scout uniform he s trying to make his son and boys like his son into better men something that articles like yours will never do Bill Maly Cedar Rapids Iowa
