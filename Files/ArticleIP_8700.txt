 Eyes on the Prize These days studios are inordinately attentive to my viewing habits As a member of the National Society of Film Critics which votes a slate of year end prizes I m fielding calls from eager publicists who want to make sure I ve seen all those award worthy movies featuring all those award worthy performances I ve tried to stay mum so as to keep my voting options open but it s hard for a guy brimming with opinions to be circumspect Beloved A worthy effort Oprah Worthiness incarnate I feel unworthy even to sit in judgment Meryl Streep in Dancing at Lughnasa Ian McKellen in Gods and Monsters Leonardo DiCaprio in Celebrity Damn worthy actors I enthused about DiCaprio when the sour Celebrity opened the New York Film Festival in September since it shows up in theaters this week you might want to click here so that I don t have to quote myself Streep should be awarded a rubber chicken for irradiating us with her yokel devotion in One True Thing 1998 but in Dancing at Lughnasa she goes a long way toward winning back her good well pretty good name As Kate Mundy the stick in the mud schoolteacher who presides over four younger unmarried sisters in 1936 Donegal Ireland she holds her facial muscles tense and signals with her eyes her exhaustion from keeping them so fiercely in place It is a terrible responsibility upholding her society s values and preventing her siblings and Michael the illegitimate son of her youngest sister Christina Catherine McCormack from descending into chaos and impoverishment Not to mention the fact that she s regarded by all as a stupid goose or as they call her in town mocking her sexlessness the gander Streep s performance is layered and compelling but the film doesn t click Closely based on Brian Friel s play it wilts in translation the way Friel s potent but static dramas always do On stage every character every prop every interjection has a precise symbolic function on film those elements no longer stand out in relief In Dancing at Lughnasa it s pronounced LOO nassa the sisters reside in a sterile and repressive Ireland but one in which the pagan past continues to bubble up most visibly in the harvest feast of Lughnasa when peasants take to the hills to build fires drink to even greater excess than usual and dance orgiastically The rite is liberating but also frightening Remove a cork from a bottle so pressurized and the contents are apt to explode The story narrated by the now grown Michael in the shopworn manner of The Glass Menagerie is set in motion by the return of the boy s Uncle Jack Michael Gambon from Africa where he has toiled as a missionary priest Delusional barely remembering his English Jack becomes a rambling and to the local priest horrific spokesman for paganism encouraging all his sisters to emulate Christina and have children of love There isn t much else in the way of a plot Kate s position at the school which is overseen by the local priest is imperiled by the subversive presence of her brother Michael s handsome dad Rhys Ifans roars back on a motorcycle to flirt with marriage to Christina Will he stay or go fight the Fascists in Spain Each sister chafes in her own way under Kate s oppressive rule especially Rose Sophie Thompson the simple one who might or might not be having an affair with a man whose wife and children have abandoned him for London A weaving factory is opening nearby and threatens the household income In venerable Chekhovian fashion what happens on the surface only hints at the titanic plates that shift beneath but the actresses especially Streep Thompson Kathy Burke and Brid Brennan are supreme at conveying what s at stake They create an indelibly glowering ensemble So why isn t Dancing at Lughnasa more involving It s probably because the director Pat O Connor can t tell the difference between images that express Friel s themes and Hibernian wallpaper and because his idea of expansive pictorial beauty proves no substitute for Friel s powerfully compressed stage pictures In the theater the radio that crackles on and off signals a world elsewhere and when it s repaired and the stage is flooded with music and the sisters beaten down confronted with only the grimmest of economic and social prospects begin to dance and then lose themselves in the freedom of the dance the moment is truly cathartic On screen it means the movie s almost over People think I m kidding when I say that my favorite film is The Bride of Frankenstein 1935 but I can t imagine how I d have survived an especially grisly puberty without the comfort of watching Boris Karloff express his anguish to an uncomprehending world through a misshapen body and halting language Few films have ever offered so inspired a blend of sentimentality Grand Guignol horror and sophisticated camp or such deliriously inventive laboratory bric a brac The film s director James Whale has long been venerated for this and other droll 30s entertainments among them The Old Dark House 1932 and The Invisible Man 1933 Lately he has also been scrutinized for being openly homosexual in an era when gay directors such as George Cukor kept that part of their lives rigidly compartmentalized But not even David Ehrenstein in his trenchantly gossipy new book on the Hollywood closet Open Secret wants to make the case that Whale was penalized for his sexual preferences If anything the director seems to have suffered from a surfeit of dignity proving too proud to overcome the loss of a powerful patron and a couple of ambitious flops Comfortably rich he took to painting and traveling before a series of strokes drove him to drown himself in his swimming pool a suicide though that fact was concealed from the public for 25 years Gods and Monsters based on Father of Frankenstein a novel by Christopher Bram explores the last days of the director Ian McKellen through the prism of a fictional friendship with a handsome muscular and heterosexual groundskeeper Boone Brendan Fraser Critics have been unanimous in predicting statuettes in McKellen s future Why The movie is psychologically thin artistically flabby and symbolically opaque Whale s Frankenstein films weren t personal testaments but in Gods and Monsters they re raided for murky fantasy sequences In one the groundskeeper is the monster staggering around with Whale in his arms in another Whale is laid out on a laboratory slab being operated on by the groundskeeper What s the metaphor The script meanwhile is the stuff of bad two character plays with spurious excuses for conflict Boone storms out when Whale speaks tenderly of the naked young men who once populated his pool and a long climactic monologue about a fictional wartime trauma that ostensibly shocked Whale into keeping his past under wraps In Bram s novel Boone is vaguely dangerous a plausible suspect in Whale s death but Fraser plays him ingratiatingly as a lovable lunk and the conception removes whatever tension the material might have had As Whale McKellen wears his elegance lightly His face is fascinatingly two tiered lean in long shot in close up its features distend to the point of acromegaly the mouth going slack with lust But Whale s plangent ruminations are slack as well I ve spent much of my life outrunning the past and now it floods all over he tells Boone in what is surely the most generic line for a memory play ever written Something about your face makes me want to tell the truth All this mawkishness would likely have annoyed the real Whale who exited the world on his own terms and steered clear in his art of banality W aking Ned Devine is this year s stab at The Full Monty 1997 which made more than 100 million and even snagged an Oscar nomination Set in a quaint olde Irish seacoast village it tells the story of an elderly lottery player Jackie O Shea Ian Bannen who learns that one of his fifty odd neighbors holds the winning ticket to a 7 million pound drawing By a process of elimination he and his buddy Michael O Sullivan David Kelly end up at the remote stone house of Ned Devine whom they find dead in his armchair with the ticket between his fingers the shock of his windfall having felled him As Devine has no living relations it makes sense for the impoverished old men to cook up a scheme by which Michael will assume the dead fisherman s identity and the pair will divide the money between themselves It was no surprise to read that Kirk Jones the film s writer and director doesn t hail from a small town in the Irish Republic or anywhere close He makes TV commercials in London Deciding he d like to make an eccentric regional comedy with universal themes he journeyed to a village in Ireland set himself up in the pub and took notes on what he saw and heard Then he wrote a script that s one part Bill Forsyth s Local Hero 1983 one part Preston Sturges Christmas in July 1940 and about five parts synthetic whimsy The movie is a passable entertainment call it The Half Monty It has standard issue but funny farcical sight gags and a score of panpipes to provide the requisite undercurrent of Celtic melancholy There s a witchy Margaret Hamilton type Eileen Dromey who rides some sort of electric wheelchair and attempts to spoil the whole caper There s also a stock ing nue Susan Lynch who loves the town s endearing pig farmer James Nesbitt but won t marry him because he smells so bad and I m not oversimplifying Waking Ned Devine might have been a snooze if Jones hadn t stocked it with a slew of old actors with magically lived in visages The owlish Bannen can twinkle without looking dear there s something saturnine in that face As his Ed Norton ish sidekick Kelly walks off or rather rides off with the picture his skeletal frame planted buck naked on a motorcycle as he rushes to reach Devine s house before the man from the lottery I see a future for elderly male actors willing to shed their clothes for laughs but I don t see myself in the audience The term slice of life has come to mean dreary naturalism but for the superb Richard LaGravenese who wrote and directed Living Out Loud that slice includes fantasy fairy tale connections sultry musical interludes bridges that lead out and bridges that lead nowhere The movie one of the year s most pleasant surprises is the antithesis of Todd Solondz s Happiness a humanist s answer to Solondz s evident conviction that life is all dead ends When her cardiologist husband Martin Donovan leaves her Judith Nelson Holly Hunter goes out into the world her pain making her receptive to everything and everyone from the elevator man Danny DeVito who returns her friendship with uninvited amorousness to the torch singer Queen Latifah who takes her to after hours clubs where she dances ecstatically with young women Living Out Loud becomes an ode to openness to letting in everything that the world throws at you The movie made me remember why I like Holly Hunter I don t always remember Her delivery isn t moist it s prickly and blunt and she can jabber convincingly so that the jabbering takes on a life of its own and leaves her sometimes horrified in the dust I might even vote for her
