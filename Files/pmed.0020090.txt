                            What is the level of medical evidence that should be used to inform medical practice At        the bottom of the hierarchy of evidence are anecdotes expert opinion case reports and        case series and at the top is the systematic review of published and sometimes        unpublished evidence By necessity systematic reviews come many years after hypotheses        are first raised and in the interim recommendations for practice may sway back and forth        One example of this is the debate over the role of uric acid in heart disease which has        been going on for more than  years It started with a paper published in  in the         Annals of Internal Medicine that found higher serum uric acid        concentrations in patients with coronary heart disease CHD compared with controls Since        then measurement of serum uric acid has been suggested as a predictor of CHD But many of        the studies on serum uric acid are epidemiologic studiessomewhere in the middle of the        hierarchy of evidenceand have come to different conclusions about how useful measurement        of uric acid is        Dissecting out the role of uric acid is further complicated by three things high levels        of uric acid are associated with hypertension and being overweight other risk factors for        CHD levels of uric acid can be altered by drugs such as diuretics that people with CHD        often take and finally alteration of renal function can affect uric acid levels Another        problem is the type of studies that have been used to address the question of uric acids        role in CHD Retrospective studies may be unable to control adequately for other risk        factorshence prospective ideally populationbased studies would be the best to answer        the question of whether there really is an association between high uric acid and CHD        In this months         PLoS Medicine  John Danesh and colleagues from the University of        Cambridge along with investigators from the Icelandic Heart Association report the single        largest prospective study addressing the role of uric acid in heart disease Further their        systematic review combines their findings with those of  previously published prospective        studies of serum uric acid cases of CHD and  controls in all        The paper answers the question of the role of uric acid in prediction of CHD clearly        the risk ratio for prediction of disease was   but it was only          in the eight studies that had the most complete adjustment for possible        confounders What this paper does not do is directly address the question of whether or not        serum uric acid is involved in causing CHD through intermediates however it does suggest        that serum uric acid levels are unlikely to be a major determinant of CHD        Where does such a result leave patients Well it is likely that improving diet losing        weight and controlling blood pressure may all contribute to reducing both ones risk of        CHD and ones serum levels of uric acid The role of uric acid in CHD is now likely to be        of interest only to those studying basic science for now the clinical question seems        closed
