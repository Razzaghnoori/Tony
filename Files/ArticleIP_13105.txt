 The Horses To hear Robert Pinsky read The Horses click Edwin Muir 1887 1959 is a mysteriously neglected gorgeous and emotionally penetrating poet Of all the many pieces of writing spurred by the Cold War and the threat of nuclear apocalypse and of the other kinds of 20 th century apocalyptic writing his poem The Horses may be the most effective perhaps because it is the most calm and gentle The plainness of the writing the persuasive speech rhythms under the almost hidden iambic pulse manifest immense art culminating in a last line that could be incised in stone Robert Pinsky Barely a twelvemonth after The seven days war that put the world to sleep Late in the evening the strange horses came By then we had made our covenant with silence But in the first few days it was so still We listened to our breathing and were afraid On the second day The radios failed we turned the knobs no answer On the third day a warship passed us headed north Dead bodies piled on the deck On the sixth day A plane plunged over us into the sea Thereafter Nothing The radios dumb And still they stand in corners of our kitchens And stand perhaps turned on in a million rooms All over the world But now if they should speak If on a sudden they should speak again If on the stroke of noon a voice should speak We would not listen we would not let it bring That old bad world that swallowed its children quick At one great gulp We would not have it again Sometimes we think of the nations lying asleep Curled blindly in impenetrable sorrow And then the thought confounds us with its strangeness The tractors lie about our fields at evening They look like dank sea monsters crouched and waiting We leave them where they are and let them rust They ll molder away and be like other loam We make our oxen drag our rusty plows Long laid aside We have gone back Far past our fathers land And then that evening Late in the summer the strange horses came We heard a distant tapping on the road A deepening drumming it stopped went on again And at the corner changed to hollow thunder We saw the heads Like a wild wave charging and were afraid We had sold our horses in our fathers time To buy new tractors Now they were strange to us As fabulous steeds set on an ancient shield Or illustrations in a book of knights We did not dare go near them Yet they waited Stubborn and shy as if they had been sent By an old command to find our whereabouts And that long lost archaic companionship In the first moment we had never a thought That they were creatures to be owned and used Among them were some half a dozen colts Dropped in some wilderness of the broken world Yet new as if they had come from their own Eden Since then they have pulled our plows and borne our loads But that free servitude still can pierce our hearts Our life is changed their coming our beginning
