 Y2K Computer Shrug The New York Times leads with new Russian President Vladimir Putin s visit to troops fighting in Chechnya a story run above the fold in the Los Angeles Times and on Page A17 in the Washington Post The Post and LAT lead with pieces on Y2K computer glitches or rather the lack thereof a story fronted by the NYT technically the Post story is part of a Y2K package serving as the top non local lead While the LAT labels Vladimir Putin s visit to Chechnya a presidential campaign style tour and the NYT calls it unexpected the Post relates that the new president had planned the trip months ago long before Boris Yeltsin decided to step down this important detail probably pushed the story off the Post s front page As proof of this prior scheduling the Post notes that the engravings on the souvenir hunting knives given by Putin to soldiers near Grozny bore the title prime minister but not president With not much else to report about the presidential visit the three stories wander in different directions The NYT gives behind the scenes details of Yeltsin s resignation announcement and analyzes the legality of his immunity deal the LAT speculates on the March 23 presidential election and the Post reports on the status of the Grozny siege A think tank expert tells the LAT that Russia s casualty rate exceeds that of both its 1994 96 Chechen campaign and the Soviet Union s ill fated war in Afghanistan The headline of the Post s piece on the Y2K computer glitch asks How Did It All Go Right The answer Good preparation in the developed world and a low reliance on technology in the developing world The LAT U S Firms Overreacted to Y2K Fix Critics Say and NYT Vast Efforts to Fix Computers Defended and It s Not Over take a more provocative angle that the U S spent too much to fix the problem But the two papers can dig up only three sources between them two corporate PR men and an anonymous Internet newsgroup participant willing to argue this However the LAT does lay out some plausible reasons why America may have overprepared fear of litigation and the bureaucratic imperative to simply upgrade software rather than fix it The only major computer foul up in the U S the papers report was the temporary malfunction of a Pentagon spy satellite The Post abandons Y2K sobriety by devoting much of its Sunday Style section to the lighter side of millennial madness There is an amusing dispatch from Las Vegas and a report on several memorable midnight kisses Miss Manners announces with tongue in cheek that she will begin to employ the phrase Oh that s soooo 20th century A computer consultant says of the anti climactic changeover It s like coitus interruptus You know Is that all there is Another Post article begins We realize that you are almost certainly reading this article by candlelight and we regret that our experiments with glow in the dark ink have failed The NYT and LAT both pan the millennial celebration in Los Angeles blaming the city s lack of a geographic center of signature iconography and of community spirit To read Slate s dispatch from Times Square by policeman Lucas Miller click here The NYT and LAT run fascinating accounts of last week s hijacking of an Indian Airlines jet as told by several of the passengers The terrorists who identified themselves as Muslims fighting for Pakistani control of Kashmir escaped

without runway lights and with only a minute and a half of fuel left Although the hijackers slit the throat of one passenger in private they did not disclose this murder to the other passengers who at times joked and conversed with their captors Near the end of the eight day odyssey the toilets were overflowing and on the seventh day the gunmen announced that in 30 minutes every passenger would be shot One hijacker who called himself Burger recited Urdu poetry gave a passenger a birthday gift and before escaping ordered all passengers to say they had forgiven him A NYT Week in Review article details the apparent failure of boot camp rehabilitation for juvenile delinquents Launched in the early 90s with much fanfare these paramilitary prisons for youths had expanded to 27 states by 1997 But inmates are routinely beaten and suffer recidivism rates higher than those of juveniles in adult prisons Colorado Arizona and North Dakota have dropped their programs and Maryland will likely follow An article in the NYT describes the surrender in Pakistan last week of a man whom authorities believe has murdered 100 boys there in the past six months Question Why does the Times repeatedly call the man a mass murderer when he has yet to be tried Are accusations against a defendant qualified with words like allegedly only when the crime is prosecuted in the United States In his inaugural NYT column Paul Krugman recently poached from that renowned repository of writing talent Slate notes that the much heralded global economy of the late 20th and now 21st century is really the second of its kind The First Global Economy as he dubs it occurred in the late 19th century when companies started laying telegraph cables beneath the ocean blasting railroad tunnels through mountains and linking the seas with canals A combination of jingoism among political elites and insularity among the business elites who spearheaded this new international commerce provoked a near 50 year reaction against free trade and global communications The big economic question for the next century Krugman concludes is really political Can the Second Global Economy build a constituency that reaches beyond the sort of people who congregate at Davos If not it will eventually go the way of the first To read Krugman s defense of the World Trade Organization in Slate click here Dueling NYT headlines from
