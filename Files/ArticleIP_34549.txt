 Body on the Brain When the larva hit the omelet pan Curling warping maybe even Sizzling a bit I wanted more Data to connect my ruined home Fries to the moths I d been applauding All summer into dust But when I saw its kin threading up the collar Of the Colavita Extra Virgin Olive Oil I scrubbed the cupboards with all The Formula 409 to be found finding Larvae in the flour in the corn Meal last used in the late eighties The creamy style Skippy the Basmati rice The sesame seeds and Aunt Jemima Lite I swabbed I purged I itched The way I m itching now to get this right So you ll scratch too Do you Believe your body merely feels When it blinks and recoils figuring It may have eaten grubs or do You think as Freud did that each Twitch or catch in the throat Constitutes a thought I marvel How the body we re wired to adore Disgusts us when we cast it Out into the world Spit Repeatedly into a juice glass drink it Every day you drink a hundred times This half cup of saliva We get Our lessons in otherness where we can How else could I stare into the porridge Of my daughter s diarrhea swallowing To keep from puking into it yet grateful She s still mine enough to let me check Or when we add our stink to a stranger s Stink from the next stall two stinks Stink less than one don t they and isn t this How mind and body mate when we re in love
