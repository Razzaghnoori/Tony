 Cheer By Stanley Plumly posted Wednesday Sept 10 To hear the poet read this poem click Like the waxwings in the juniper a dozen at a time divided paired passing the berries back and forth and bynightfall wobbling piping wounded with joy Or a party of redwings grazing whatfalls blossom and seed nutmeat and fruit made light in the head and cut by the light swept from the ground carried downwind taken It s called wing rowing the wing burdened armsunbending yielding striking a balance walking the white invisible line drawnjust ahead in the air first sign the slur the liquid notes too liquid the heart in the mouth melodious too close which startsthe chanting the crooning the long lyricsilences the song of our undoing It s called side step head forward raised crown flap and glide flight aggression though courtship isthe object affection the compulsion love the overspill the body nodding still standing ready to fly straight out ofitself or it s bill tilt wing flash topple over wing droop bowing tail flick and drift back ruffle wing spread quiver and soar Someone is troubled someone is trying in earnest to explain to speak without swallowing the tongue to find the perfectword among so few or the too many to sing like the thrush from the deepest partof the understory territorial carnal thorn at the throat or flutelikein order to make one sobering sound Sound of the breath blown over the bottle sound of the reveler home at dawn light of the sun a warbler yellow the sun insong flight lopsided pose Be of good cheer my father says lifting his glass to greet a morning in which he s awake to bewith the birds or up all night in the sleepof the world alive again singing
