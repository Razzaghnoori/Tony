 All You Can Eat It is a truth universally acknowledged that a man in possession of a good fortune should not upon returning from his honeymoon let his wife work out at the gym with Jerry Seinfeld This is the lesson learned by Broadway theater heir Eric Nederlander 32 when a week after coming back to New York from a honeymoon in Italy his new wife Jessica Sklar 26 met Seinfeld 44 at the Reebok Sports Club Before the newlyweds had time to unpack all their new china the National Enquirer and the Star had photo spreads of Sklar and Seinfeld around town in full lip lock According to the Globe Nederlander who will now save a fortune on anniversary gifts contemplated an alienation of affection suit against the comedian but finally decided to simply file for divorce The publication also reveals why Seinfeld would behave so perfidiously He hadn t had good sex since last year when he broke up with his young girlfriend Shoshanna Lonstein The tabs also tout the shocking resemblance between the two women but are uncharacteristically restrained in neglecting to mention that there is one or more accurately two crucial difference in the physiques of slender Jessica and bounteously well endowed Shoshanna Shoshanna who became a tabloid celebrity in her own right by dating Seinfeld while she was still in high school has recently launched her own line of lingerie Lingerie says the Globe will be the focus of Monica Lewinsky s next career move It reports that she would like to confer with Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss who had her own lingerie company when her fellow Santa Monica College alumna gets out of jail The Globe does not reveal if Monica s merchandise will come pre stained There is not surprisingly even more Lewinsky news According to the Enquirer during her affair with Clinton Secret Service agents feared her more than they did a possible assassin Citing grand jury testimony the publication describes how last Christmas the Secret Service became frantic about the possibility of Monica turning up at a White House holiday reception hosted by the First Lady and attended by some 400 guests An employee in the White House social office testified that an agent at the party upon discovering Lewinsky s name on the guest list rushed up to the employee and said We have to find her before Mrs Clinton sees her It is presumed the agent was successful as there are no reports that either Hillary or Monica tried to dunk the other s head in the wassail bowl Of even greater concern to the Secret Service were the times the temperamental Lewinsky spent alone with the president The Enquirer reports that agent Steven Pape told the grand jury of a conversation he had with another agent If she Monica was going to do any harm to the President I said she would do the you know it would be something along the lines of Lorena Bobbitt if she was going to hurt him Had that happened MSNBC would have had to change the name of The White House in Crisis to The President s Penis Is Missing But even that is not as shocking as the photos all three tabloids have run of Lewinsky in exercise clothes Since she was last seen in public the former White House intern has ballooned to almost 180 pounds She has joined a gym and has hired a 75 an hour personal trainer to help her peel off 55 pounds reports the Star Now imagine how much more happiness and how much less heartache there would be in the world if only Jerry Seinfeld liked full figured gals and Monica Lewinsky not Jessica Sklar had joined the Reebok Sports Club As inverse images of the wages of fame Lewinsky and Ally McBeal star Calista Flockhart make a perfect pair Under pressure Lewinsky has expanded Meanwhile Flockhart has shrunk So shocking is her appearance that the tabs which luridly chronicle every celebrity chin waddle and thigh dimple are now expressing concern about her and other stick figure actresses According to the Star the 5 foot 6 inch actress is down to 95 pounds having lost about 15 pounds in the past year She is so weak from dieting and compulsive exercising that the show s producers have cut back on her screen time says the publication Flockhart and her representatives deny she has an eating disorder The actress even called a Los Angeles radio station to say that she enjoys gorging on junk food Such denials are usually a prelude to hospitalization recovery and a tearful interview with Oprah Barbara or Diane The tabs also report that two celebrity spouses couldn t quite wait until their dearly beloved s bodies were fully cold before finding that they could learn to love again A few months ago at the funeral of singer Tammy Wynette her fifth husband George Richey perhaps stealing some moves from the finale of a James Brown concert had to be repeatedly held up by friends to keep from collapsing He even threatened to take the body of his dead wife home Perhaps he could have stashed her in the backseat of her Rolls Royce which according to the Globe he has now given to his new girlfriend a former Dallas Cowboys cheerleader 30 years his junior And Rep Mary Bono R Calif the widow of Sonny started dating nine months after his skiing accident death Mary who won Sonny s congressional seat has been seeing Brian Prout drummer for country group Diamond Rio reports the Star Although the congresswoman says I feel like this weight has been lifted off of me Bono s mother calls the relationship disgusting But according to the Globe there may be more heartbreak in the widow s future It reports that Prout is a womanizer with more notches on his bedpost than Casanova The Globe even says that the drummer is already romancing a Nashville waitress And a book that is portraying the late Princess Diana as neurotic jealous and out of control is causing new grief for Prince Charles and his lover Camilla Parker Bowles They have released a joint statement denying any involvement with Charles Victim or Villain the Enquirer reports but royal watchers say the author Penny Junor would not have won the cooperation of so many of their friends without the couple s tacit approval The book charges that Diana was the first to cheat with her bodyguard that she used to call Parker Bowles and make death threats and that Charles was relieved when she died But Diana may yet get her revenge The Globe relays a startling report transmitted on the world wide internet that Diana has been cloned by a mad scientist and that the baby will be born by the end of the year at a secret laboratory on an island off the coast of China The tabs are getting fed up with women who have become rich and famous by telling everyone else how to be better All three tabs have run stories about the nude photos of Dr Laura Schlessinger 51 radio host and moral arbiter that have appeared on the Internet The Globe reports that at first Schlessinger claimed the more than 20 year old photos were not of her She subsequently filed suit claiming that she owned the photos and they were temporarily taken off the Web site The photos were released by Bill Ballance 80 a former radio talk show host who says he and Schlessinger were once lovers who in his memorable phrase used to thrash around like a couple of crazed weasels And the Globe is at the forefront of an anti Oprah Winfrey backlash this week with the story Oprah Revolt Fans charge You re too big for your britches Actually part of the problem is that fans liked the talk show host better when she was bigger britched before she became the Vogue cover model They are also sick of her constant preaching on self improvement says the publication One insider at her production company is quoted as saying Oprah s always been religious but she s gone overboard thinking she s been given a specific mission on Earth If Oprah s not safe no one is To prove it the Enquirer reports that the ghost of mild mannered Ozzie Nelson is haunting his former Hollywood home He s a very friendly ghost The publication says female residents wake in the middle of the night when they feel the late Ozzie nuzzling their necks Sounds like a premise for a sitcom
