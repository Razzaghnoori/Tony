 Clinton s Catch 96 When Bob Woodward s byline appears on Page One of the Washington Post it generally means It s time to pay attention And indeed Woodward s April 8 story an it s even worse than you thought piece about the Clinton campaign finance scandal sounded pretty sordid It reported that White House officials had tipped off the Democratic National Committee in 1995 about Grigori Loutchansky a bad egg Latvian businessman with alleged ties to the Russian Mafia Loutchansky who had been invited to meet the president at a 25 000 a plate fund raiser with a ticket paid for by an American business associate was promptly uninvited The reason this is troublesome is that the news about Loutchansky s background came indirectly from the National Security Administration and that folks at the DNC who lack security clearances were thus recipients of an unauthorized leak of highly classified information CNN played this revelation all day and the other networks reported it on the evening news If this allegation proves true and this disclosure actually took place it constitutes a felony violation said Rep Porter Goss a Republican from Florida who chairs the House intelligence committee I am very troubled by the implications for breaches of long standing security controls at the White House and the apparent misuse of intelligence information for political purposes In this furor a few significant details were overlooked however The first was that the essence of Woodward s scoop had been reported two and a half weeks earlier in the Washington Times The Times relied on what looks to have been the same source a leak from Indiana Rep Dan Burton s Government Reform Oversight Committee which had apparently got wind of the issue via DNC documents handed over in response to a subpoena When the story appeared in the Moonie owned Times no one cared Only the Woodward imprimatur made it national news A more significant problem with Woodward s story is that the DNC didn t need any classified leaks to find out that Loutchansky who had met the president at an earlier fund raiser in 1993 was trouble Before the 1995 dinner even took place none other than William Safire had written about Loutchansky in the New York Times noting that the Latvian had been refused entry into Canada the previous year because of suspected Mafiya connections Safire s source was Comrade Criminal a book about the Russian Mafia by the journalist Stephen Handelman that was available months before the fund raiser at the Hay Adams to which Loutchansky was given the invitation that was then withdrawn The DNC could have spared itself the need for NSA intercepts by reading the paper or visiting the library But the larger irony of this turn in the scandal is that when Woodward wrote his story the Clintonites were still being beaten up in the press for not having communicated similar information about Chinese bad guys trying to sidle up to the president A month earlier the hot new revelation in the scandal was that officials at the National Security Council had neglected to pass on to their superiors the contents of a briefing by FBI officials who warned that the Chinese government might be trying to funnel money into the 1996 campaign Incidentally the Chinese influence story had been broken by the same Bob Woodward What would have constituted proper handling of the FBI disclosure to the NSC Presumably the same type of procedure that draws bitter denunciations in the Loutchansky episode The NSC might have told White House officials some of whom were supervising fund raising for the campaign to be on the lookout for Chinese bearing gifts For this warning to be effective those White House officials would have had to tip off the DNC which was soliciting the money directly In a separate but related episode the administration has been pilloried for failing to heed exactly such a warning from NSC officials about Johnny Chung a Beijing connected hustler who got six Chinese friends into the taping of a radio address by the president You really are damned if you do and damned if you don t says one anonymous source quoted in the most recent Woodward story It s good of Woodward to acknowledge this irony if briefly A more prominent quote from one senior official is less sympathetic to the double bind that the Clintonites now find themselves in This was top secret and it further demonstrates the total politicization of all intelligence and White House operations Anything and everything was done in the name of fund raising Had Loutchansky got to see the president Woodward would probably have written a story about lax screening procedures at the White House In fact this story was written though not by Woodward In February Tim Weiner of the New York Times reported that the administration was no longer using vetting procedures put in place by Ronald Reagan to keep foreign ghouls away from the president In their eagerness to raise campaign money DNC officials invited friends of the President s fund raisers including China s biggest arms merchant favor seeking Indonesian businessmen a reputed Russian mobster and other dubiously credentialed dealmakers to meet with Mr Clinton Weiner writes Nor did the White House check the suitability of Americans invited by the Democratic National Committee to meet the President allowing among others a twice convicted felon to sip coffee with Mr Clinton The procedure Weiner complains was dropped was essentially what Woodward complains happened with Loutchansky The most vociferous journalistic critics of the president preach it round or preach it flat when it comes to these kinds of contacts The Wall Street Journal s editorials now oscillate between accusations that the administration abused sensitive information on the one hand and allegations that it ignored intelligence warnings on the other Safire too has ricocheted between lambasting the administration for abusing quasi independent intelligence and law enforcement agencies and blasting it for ignoring intelligence so it could raise gobs of money In the case of the FBI NSC China warning Safire thinks that the Justice Department behaved too cautiously because it didn t wish to tip off Chinese agents lurking inside the administration So what s a president or an attorney general to do Safire suggests that Janet Reno should have asked to see the president alone warned him unequivocally of the penetration enlisted his aid in the investigation or if she thought it necessary read him his rights Read him his rights for what crime Being a Chinese spy That bit of hysteria aside it s not hard to imagine Safire and the Journal waxing apoplectic if the attorney general had asked for a private meeting to warn the president Clinton s critics would surely have portrayed such a meeting as a corrupt politicization of the Justice Department reminded us again of the misuse of the FBI in Travelgate and Filegate and called once more for an independent counsel The Clinton administration has done plenty to fuel suspicion of all kinds But at some point the skeptics have to choose Did the Clintonites abuse power by trafficking in classified information or by ignoring it You can t commit both crimes or at least not at the same time
