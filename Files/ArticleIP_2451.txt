 Kids as Status Symbols So you ve got the beach house compound on Nantucket the 63 foot Hinckley sailboat the corporate jet the nanny and the gardener and your stay at home spouse with the advanced academic degree heads up the local United Way campaign What other acquisition might serve your high economic and social status How about having some more kids It has long been a demographic truism that richer means fewer not more kids And as far as it goes census data seem to bear this out As the average incomes of Americans have increased the smaller their families have become Since the height of the baby boom in the 1950s the number of children born to an American woman has dropped from an average of 3 76 to only 1 98 today And this phenomenon is not confined to the United States The average number of children born to women in Western Europe has fallen from 2 5 in 1960 to 1 6 today People have lots of reasons for choosing to have fewer children including the expansion of opportunities for women in the workplace but it is an undeniable fact that rearing children in the modern world is an expensive activity Throughout most of history children were net assets they toiled in the fields mucked out the barn and cared for their parents in old age But modern parents don t really expect much of a return from the resources they spend on their children Sure Johnny may mow the lawn and Jenny might run the dishwasher but in general kids today do little to contribute directly to a family s bottom line The U S Census Bureau confirms that women in households with the lowest average annual incomes those under 10 000 have had the most children 2 3 on average By contrast upper middle class households those making more than 75 000 have an average of only 1 8 kids One interpretation of these numbers is that poor parents still think that children are a reasonable investment In a poor rural family children still do chores on the farm And before welfare reform at least an additional child usually meant an increase in a poor urban family s benefits Meanwhile for the upper middle class providing for progeny is expensive Parents try to pay for private school educations soccer club and pool memberships and French piano and dance lessons Of course these parents are spending this money in an attempt to assure the future success of their children But even with an income of 75 000 per year they can afford only so much for Skip and Buffy s tutoring so they limit their family size in order to bestow more on fewer kids But recently I have noticed that many of my wealthier acquaintances people who live in tonier suburbs like Potomac Md or Darien Conn are bucking the trend toward smaller families Many have three or four kids Some intriguing if sketchy data suggest that at the highest levels of wealth and income the trend is toward larger not smaller families For example Mendelsohn Research a company that supplies consumer research to advertisers advertising agencies and publishing companies offers some suggestive data Mendelsohn s most recent annual survey shows that those households with children where the annual family income exceeds 250 000 are blessed with an average of 2 3 children currently at home That is 0 5 kids more than the upper middle class average and the same number as the lowest census income category And because the Mendelsohn data don t include kids who have left home while the census data do the number of children born in these very wealthy families could be even higher One other interesting figure comes from the very tiptop of the wealth scale The households that compose the Forbes 400 richest Americans average 2 88 children That s 1 08 kids more than the upper middle class can afford These added kids provide many opportunities for status signaling Wealthy parents can talk endlessly at the country club about the costs of Maine summer camps high school semesters abroad little Andrew s sailing trophies and what hunt Sarah rides with regularly And of course there are schools and universities Did they prep at St Albans or Choate How well are they doing at Harvard Yale or Middlebury Being able to provide lavishly for a large number of children shows that you ve really got it made This is not to say that rich people don t love their kids Rather kids today are not only little bundles of joy but also are perhaps the ultimate symbols of worldly success and status Perhaps we are now seeing a new social phenomenon trophy kids
