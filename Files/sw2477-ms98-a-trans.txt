 okay so which uh what basketball teams are you interested in well i guess i m a big Laker LA Laker fan when it comes to pros um hum uh uh the college ranks um i guess i really of course i try to follow my alma mater that s uh BYU um hum in Utah but they don t have much of a team usually no they re more of a football team than they are basketball team yeah yeah they you see them in football on TV once in awhile but you but you never see them on a yeah on nationally basketball you know that s true i don t think i ve ever seen them nationally on basketball they uh last year they had a really good team was the year that Danny Aines was there um hum that s about five six years ago by now hum so they made it to the sweet sixteen once or twice in their history and that s um yeah that s not too bad and they usually lose in the first round what they get um hum how about you well i m uh originally from the Saint Louis area so the only basketball team pro anyway in that part of the country is Chicago so i i do pull for Chicago uh huh uh i mean of course this year is a good year to be a a Chicago Bulls fan i guess because they re doing pretty good isn t the the Bulls you re talking about yeah the pro yeah yeah um as far as college teams uh i know it s really easy to say but i ve been pulling for uh Duke for about four years now so uh is that right so i finally am feeling better about myself as far as college teams although i ve i ve really you know again being from Saint Louis i pull for Missouri uh but they re on uh probation this year so you can t do much about that uh huh no no but um so did you watch the uh final four this year oh yeah i watched every uh i watched all three games of that and uh i was very pleased with all three games because Kansas uh you know i was pulling for Kansas on the other side so it was it was real nice to have the the teams that were there every game right right of course i wasn t really i mean i i UNLV kind of gave me the impression of being a uh um oh i don t know a macho team you know they just didn t seem they seemed to think they were better than everybody else and and maybe they were but um i was real happy to see them get knocked off so yeah that i i watched that game um hum and uh it was a good game it was a very close game and hard fought game oh yeah and it just i don t know it looked like UNLV may have had more uh talent but as far as playing together as a team that day it didn t Duke seemed to have them off balance yeah um hum and that uh they didn t just couldn t aren t aren t they more of a running gun team UNLV yeah their their they play the pro style is the way i ve always called it and uh you know the fast breaks and and right fast breaks and things and they shut all that down and made them pay half court it seemed and right and uh UNLV wasn t used to that of course i ve i knew whenever UNLV went in at half time see i don t know if they were necessarily behind but they weren t ahead as much as they normally are and what right uh and you know that meant that they had to play a second half and they ve not they ve not had to do that all year and uh right right they didn t have they didn t have to go through some tough games during the year and that and that and so that s the you know it s a terrible time to have to deal with one right in it when when it counts so much yeah that s right i mean Duke s schedule was was so much harder than UNLV s that it uh it just made them a much tougher team overall and uh that had to help them a lot right i think i think that that probably was the difference in that game because it really could have gone any either way down to the end you know um hum so do i take it you think though that the Lakers will uh will win or well i don t know i mean Portland s pretty good um probably not since Kareem s retired yeah they haven t had a center and uh they ve got Perkins yeah but i don t think he s really been a super star for them no well he s uh i don t i he to me is not a center he s more of a a real tall forward uh and yes it s right right so i think Magic does a i uh they ll make it you know i it s it s it s going to be a war between uh between Chicago and uh and uh and uh Boston Celtics oh yeah that s going to be a war it s going to be a great series that sure is if i think that s going to be one of those that s uh that s won by the home team you know whoever has home court advantage is going to win that one i think uh huh one of those two will probably be um in there um let me see where does Detroit fit in Detroit s in that same uh that that same uh division uh huh so i don t know those three uh Detroit hasn t been having that great a year this year no but as i heard Isaiah came back this week so uh that might help them uh huh yeah they have the they have the play off experience well so does so does Detroit i mean so does Chicago oh yeah so do they all three of them do with Larry Bird back uh you can never count the Celtics out when Larry Bird s oh yeah that s true uh starting to click on all cylinders they say he s starting to do starting to play um hum he s yeah but he s been kind of up and down all year uh you know one game and he ll be playing to where everything he throws up goes in and then the next time he ll you know he can t seem to hit the side of a barn so i don t know i m i m kind of i m not sure about him this year right right right last i ve heard is that he s starting to peak right now um hum well that s when you do it and he s starting to be more consistent you know right at the right time of the year yeah oh oh any any dark horses i you know well the dark horse yeah that s San Antonio San Antonio the dark horse that could could really flip in there i think somewhere yeah anybody who has Davi d Robinson got to have a chance anyway yeah he s got to be pretty much you know i use to say Akeem Olajuwon was the dominant player you know when against any team he would dominate but um hum Robinson s getting up there where that s right every game he s just i mean it looks like he s going in for a dunk and they kind of just scoot out of his way or take a step back you know nobody s um hum got enough beef i guess to challenge him when he s when he s driving hard to the hoop hum he s uh he too bad the Mavericks couldn t get him yeah that s true with Roy Tarpley they re in big trouble yeah well then he s gone now so they re going to have to do something about that well i thought he was gone period i i didn t read the story but i i read that uh yeah for awhile anyways i heard he was suspended well that might have been what it was but i i guess the headlines said something about him you know that the Mavericks you know released him or something i m maybe i misunderstood what they meant because of his um if they did they d still have to pay his contract well yeah they may have done it you never know yeah but it was a lot of money he was making like i heard on the radio it was sixty three thousand and change a month that s what he was being paid you know he wasn t even playing yeah oh boy what a good job he had that s what i think he ruined ruined his sweet position yeah yeah i m looking forward to the the pro play off uh yeah it s coming up isn t it yeah LA yeah San Antonio who s the other one that s doing so well this year Portland is that Portland Portland i haven t seen them on much TV at all much at all but all i you do is hear about boy they have the scene the you know what do they have Walter Davis and Portland yeah Portland um hum they ve got two the two Johnson brothers or they re not brothers but i mean there s two guys named Johnson on their team that are really good doing good or something i forget exactly how that worked but yeah um hum um they re like i said they re doing extremely good right now Phoenix isn t doing too bad so it s it ought to be a real interesting play off yeah right right yeah yeah i don t i don t think there s any clear pick that you know um hum i guess i guess the two teams that i just you know think you can t count out are the are the Celtics and the well because of Bird and and Lakers because of Magic Johnson they they re two guys that seem to find a way when there s when there s when it s on the line they seem to find a way um hum when it s on the line um hum you know uh so those are what makes makes a champion i guess yep that s true yeah well it s been nice talking to you all right well take care bye well nice talking to you take care bye
