 Scam of the Century After weighing the relative merits of Franklin Roosevelt Winston Churchill Mohandas Gandhi and other great figures Time has named Albert Einstein the Person of the Century How do you become the POC There are two steps First do something great And second get your pals and admirers in the punditocracy to rig the contest in your favor by fiddling with the meaning and sequence of the judging criteria 1 Influence At first glance this seems the most obvious criterion for choosing a POC Trouble is it s been a nasty century two world wars Holocaust Communist purges so if you look for who did the most to cause it you ll end up with a monster In the POC debate this has become the Hitler Problem Colin Powell Richard Holbrooke and former Time Editor Henry Grunwald have identified the F hrer as the century s most influential person and in Time s online poll with 4 5 million votes cast Hitler is in third place for POC trailing only Elvis Presley and Yitzhak Rabin The Los Angeles Times makes fun of Time s deliberations about Hitler In a story on the POC debate the paper leads with Time Managing Editor Walter Isaacson saying You can t write off Hitler since many people argue that he had the most influence on the century by far To not consider him would intellectually dishonest Time ends up crediting Hitler with all similar evil calling him F hrer of the fascist genocides and refugee floods that plagued the century So why doesn t Hitler win POC Not for the obvious reason that he was a really really bad person but because as Time puts it He lost He wasn t influential enough If only he had won the war he d have bagged POC Time also offers two other reasons why Hitler doesn t get the award First he was derivative of Lenin who sort of begat him And second if you check the stats Stalin and Mao actually killed more people Then there s the populist elitist debate over what sort of influence counts most According to Isaacson Darwin the great theoretician was originally going to be Time s person of the 19 th century but the magazine dumped him for Thomas Edison who invented gizmos that had more impact on our lives The populists have the upper hand in this debate because the media want to please their mass audience by naming somebody whose contributions most people can relate to That s why U S News World Report s 25 Shapers of the Modern Era features world historical figures such as Lucille Ball Levi Strauss and former National Football League Commissioner Pete Rozelle Time rigs the debate in favor of its nominees by defining influence to include the spread of their ideas and sentiments While conceding that Gandhi failed to establish peace and justice in India Time argues that his doctrine of nonviolent resistance has overtaken the world Never mind that two of his other big ideas sexual and material abstinence went nowhere And while admitting that the New Deal was confused and failed to halt the Depression the magazine argues that Roosevelt restored Americans faith and hopes and thereby saved them from fear itself Never mind that a similarly artful case could be made for Ronald Reagan but isn t In general the interpretation of influence as the dissemination of ideas improves the POC chances of cultural figures On Meet the Press William F Buckley Jr nominated Pope John Paul II as his POC for providing the special spiritual animus that made all the difference in the 70s and 80s in overcoming the greatest threat of the century which was the Soviet Union 2 Virtue You d think this was the obvious criterion for choosing a POC by something other than body count Virtue favors guys like Gandhi and JP II But since this factor confounds Time s choice of Roosevelt over Churchill who was more brave and honest Time makes it a team game arguing that Eleanor Roosevelt supplied the earnestness and uncompromising principle her husband lacked The spin job on Einstein is even more egregious On Meet the Press Doris Kearns Goodwin argued that Roosevelt s courage unlike Einstein s brains teaches a lesson In Einstein s defense Time turns his physics into philosophy saying he taught the greatest humility of all that we are but a speck in an unfathomably large universe Furthermore says the magazine Einstein believed in divine harmony and often invoked God One of the great tricks of the virtue debate is the reciprocal blurb To prove that Einstein Gandhi and Roosevelt are worthy POC finalists Time quotes them praising each other What better way to validate a great man than to quote another great man calling him a great man Goodwin plays the same game between Roosevelt and Churchill Churchill s fatal mistake it turns out was giving Gandhi a negative blurb He called Mohandas Gandhi nauseating and a half naked fakir sniffs Time crossing Churchill off its list 3 Themes This is the most convenient way to pick a POC List the top themes of the century and then select figures who embody them Time explicitly uses this method to pick Einstein science and technology Roosevelt the struggle against totalitarianism and Gandhi liberation and justice Others personify the theme with a composite POC such as the American GI submitted by Powell Rosie the Riveter submitted by Goodwin and Uncle Sam submitted by U S News Once you re a finalist representing a theme the trick is to elevate your theme In principle this is how Einstein wins Science gets the nod As Time puts it He serves as a symbol of all the scientists who built upon his work He gets credit for the Big Bang the bomb the PC and above all television In practice it s more complicated The ideal POC represents all the big themes of the century This triathlon kills Churchill who wins the defeat totalitarianism contest but flunks the liberation and justice contest He bulldoggedly opposed the women s rights movement other civil rights crusades and decolonization objects Time Roosevelt has better crossover appeal since in addition to defeating Hitler he expanded economic opportunity through the New Deal and gets credit for his wife s contributions to feminism and social justice But Einstein wins the triathlon because in addition to acing the science test he prodded Roosevelt to build the bomb 10 points for defeating totalitarianism fled Germany and immigrated to the United States five more points for defeating totalitarianism and five for liberation and justice and preached pacifism and praised Gandhi 10 more points for liberation and justice As the century s greatest thinker as an immigrant who fled from oppression to freedom as a political idealist he best embodies the century says Time 4 Causality The debate over whether to pick a politician scientist philosopher or artist often turns on which of these fields drives the others Those who think culture drives politics e g Buckley argue that Gandhi and JP II overthrew tyranny Those who think politics drives culture e g Goodwin argue that Roosevelt spawned the civil rights and feminist movements by putting everyone to work regardless of race or gender Those who think politics determines the course of technology e g Bill Kristol argue that technology built Hitler s power and that brave politicians defeated him And while some such as Goodwin argue that the wars against totalitarianism made economic progress possible others such as Sen Pat Moynihan D N Y argue that economic progress made possible the end of world wars Time seals the case for Einstein by arguing that science drives everything Not only did it promote freedom more than any statesman or soldier did by creating CNN faxes and e mail but furthermore Einstein s theory of relativity paved the way for a new relativism in morality arts and politics influencing James Joyce Pablo Picasso Igor Stravinsky and others The press of course has its own causal theory The press drives everything That s why This Week panelist Linda Douglass picked Johann Gutenberg the inventor of the printing press as the man of the millennium The written word enables us to preserve our laws 5 Indispensability The best way to rig the debate in favor of an artist is to stipulate that the POC should be someone whose accomplishments would never have happened without him Since art is infinitely various and complex it s particularly implausible that anyone else would have written Shakespeare s plays This is how George Will justifies his selection of William Shakespeare as man of the millennium while dismissing scientists on the grounds that science has its own logic and is going to get where it s going regardless of which scientist gets there first Scientists counter this spin by arguing that the inexorable logic of their field makes it more significant than art or politics Time quotes Einstein on this point Politics is for the moment An equation is for eternity 6 Timing If your POC nominee scored his achievements early in the century stress his long term influence By this standard Einstein s timing was excellent earning him credit for subsequent decades of technological progress JP II and Reagan by contrast showed up too late to get much consideration If your nominee showed up later stress the immediacy of his achievements since most people can relate to today s breakthroughs and gizmos and have forgotten those from the first half of the century This dynamic explains why Will picked James Watson and Francis Crick who discovered DNA in 1953 as his men of the century why Kristol picked Abraham Lincoln as his man of the millennium and why end of year movies score well in the Academy Awards What has the POC done for us lately If your nominee showed up too late for this year s contest don t worry Nominate her for next time If she s worth it she ll still be in the running 100 years from now And if she s not you won t be around to explain your goof By its nature the POC debate is retroactive No wonder the pundits love it
