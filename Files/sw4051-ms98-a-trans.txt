        okay you wanna start     yeah i might as well uh one of the things im very concerned about the air pollution is the uh this this the ozone layer uh uh  uh issue uh i used to own a heating and air conditioning business and handled lots of freon different types of freons and it uh rather bothers me that uh i was in in effect uh contributing to the delinquency of the the environment so to speak   uhhuh yeah now thats stuff we never even thought about three years ago   right right and one of the reasons they fixed up the freons eleven twelve and thirteen in in in that area was because they were inexpensive uh they could be made uh you know cheap inexpensive and lots of it uh and in that and its properties were great uh with uh the machinery didnt have to have lots of expensive machinery to uh get your heating and cooling cycles to work so   uhhuh so have they stopped that practice now   well  course theres only a a  tremendous number of a refrigerators and freon excuse me refrigerators and freezers both commercial and residential uh utilizing freon twelve and of course the the new cars i guess starting with nineteen nineteen ninety three will not have freon twelve in their systems but uh theres you know theres the ton of after market machines and et cetera et cetera     yeah yeah   and thats got me very concerned you know highly concerned that uh   its gonna be quite a while before we can uh       undo this now that could spawn several good industries and help pull us out of this recession but you got to have people that can make you know earn a salary to pay for this conversion       so were so i see us in a kind somewhat of a catch twenty two unless we unless the banks or industry and or the government go together and and come up with a way to uh have us uh as a an unemployed the part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again converting all this freon twelve stuff into uh the new nonpolluting uh compound   oh   because as i say there is a theres a tremendous well how many uh uh families own a refrigerator and then do you know that number and then how many own a a freezer separate from   uhhuh   and how many people especially here in Texas own cars and trucks with air conditioning   yeah   i mean this is there there are people that that make it have a thriving business uh that do nothing but heating and air conditioning on on automobiles and trucks and uh the only reason i didnt uh get into that more when i was had my little business was because uh most of your uh air conditioning in in on vehicles tend to be greasy and dirty to the Nth degree   uhhuh   and i mean       so uh thats why i stayed in stayed more towards towards uh uh and thats a polluting polluting type deal too is the excessive um you know uh petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth and the dirt and grit and the those two mixed together with with water and uh  really make a uh make a mess   um yeah yeah i hate to see a car going down the street or even a truck or bus for that matter that thats putting out a lot of dark   umhum   smoke and i know theres a lot of pollutants we cant even see coming out of cars but that that particular bothers me   right well most most of the time when you see bus uh you know the buses with the diesel thats uh those are carbon particles and uh carbon dioxide and water vapor   uhhuh   uh because when you when diesel diesel is burned its it you know diesel fuel is burned in a in a in the diesel engine its burned so completely that you dont have any uh uh nitrous oxides uh or oxides of nitrogen uh to uh form   oh   because of by virtue of the very combustion process of the diesel engine because diesel oil is uh is not very volatile   umhum   you know where gasoline if you leave a little pail of gasoline out before long its gone   yeah   diesel is going to be around because it doesnt evaporate easily and its got uh you know its its latent heat is high but its slow burning at at uh normal pressures thats why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios   oh i see   as the as the air is heated you know by virtue of the compression process to like one to nineteen or nineteen to one ratio   umhum uhhuh   and so if it the car sucks in uh fifty degrees
