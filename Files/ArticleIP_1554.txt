First highlight Lewinsky sought President Clinton s help in getting a new job before she was subpoenaed in the Paula Jones case Pundits spin This undermines Kenneth Starr s theory that Lewinsky sought Clinton s help in exchange for lying to protect him in the Jones case Second highlight On the tapes Tripp apparently encourages Lewinsky to obsess about Clinton to ask him for help getting a job and to send him letters via a courier service owned by the family of Tripp s literary agent Pundits spin This supports the moral argument that Clinton was set up and it might support the legal argument
