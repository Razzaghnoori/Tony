 In the Name of Elian The Washington Post leads with the Food and Drug Administration s suspension of all programs at the University of Pennsylvania s Institute for Human Gene Therapy Independent investigations by the National Institutes of Health and the FDA into the death last fall of Jesse Gelsinger a participant in the program raised questions about the ethics and procedures at the Institute The New York Times goes with yesterday s board meeting at Procter Gamble that revolved around a possible merger with two large pharmaceutical companies American Home Products and Warner Lambert The merger would make P G one of the most formidable consumer products and drug companies in the world Although the deal is far from certain investors reacted skeptically and P G s stock fell 9 percent The Los Angeles Times reefers the gene therapy story and leads with the forced resignation of Ecuador s President Jamil Mahuad After 6 000 indigenous protesters and several disgruntled military officers seized the congressional building and the presidential palace Mahuad fled to an unknown location The protest against Mahuad centered around his inability to implement structural economic reform for Ecuador and his government s ongoing neglect of its indigenous people The WP stuffs the story but fronts a two column photo of the protests All three papers front the investigation into Penn s gene therapy program The NYT focuses on specific violations of the program Most damning is that Gelsinger was technically ineligible for therapy in the first place and should never have received treatment at the Institute In addition none of the 18 people enrolled in the gene therapy program had filled out eligibility forms to participate which should have been routine nor were they ever made fully aware of the risks involved with what they had submitted to The WP closely scrutinizes the ethics of for profit scientific research highlighting the fact that the lead researcher at Penn s Institute for Human Gene Therapy James M Wilson had a significant financial stake in the results of the study a circumstance that may have compromised his judgment The LAT reefers the story The NYT off leads and the WP and LAT front the investigation into a Chinese smuggling ring Throughout the 1990s a vast syndicate that included prominent Communist party officials members of the Chinese military and business leaders smuggled an estimated ten billion dollars worth of cars oil and high tech hardware into China through the port of Xiamen The Communist Party views the smuggling as a breakdown of political order and therefore as a grave threat to party rule It has vowed to prosecute without leniency all those involved The NYT notes that when a similar smuggling operation was recently uncovered in China the ringleaders were sentenced to death The NYT fronts Gov George Bush s revision of his abortion stance as the Iowa caucuses approach Responding to the accusation of his main challenger in Iowa Steve Forbes that he hasn t taken a strong enough stance against abortion Bush more firmly asserted that he disapproves of Roe v Wade But he stopped short of saying that the decision ought to be overturned suggesting instead that it is an issue best ruled on by state legislatures The LAT fronts the Group of 7 finance ministers expression of concern that the global economy has become precariously dependent on over valued U S dot com stocks A sudden downturn could result in a world wide economic contraction Nonetheless the G 7 is unlikely to issue any grim warnings for fear of instigating a sudden and violent panic The off lead in the LAT reports that the Confederate flag is causing all sorts of problems for Bush especially in his home state of Texas If he doesn t renounce the flag he risks losing the support of African Americans If he does renounce it he ll infuriate those who cherish it as a part of Southern history If he withholds his opinion and remains opaque on the issue as the LAT reports he has Bush risks the accusation that he s incapable of making tough decisions The WP fronts the Elian Gonzalez story exploring the mythology that has arisen around the young boy Anti Castro Cuban expatriates have inserted him into a messianic narrative in which Elian plucked from the sea stands as Moses discovered among the bulrushes Just as Moses led the Jews out of slavery in Egypt so to will Elian free Cubans from Castro s rule The LAT stuffs the story but fronts a two column photo of Elian s two grandmothers in New York upon their arrival from Cuba to ask for the return of their grandson The NYT also stuffs the report on the arrival of the grandmothers With political negotiations at an impasse both women made emotional pleas at a press conference for Elian s return to his father in Cuba By noting that both women shivered in the unfamiliar 16 degree cold as they got off the plane was the NYT pointing to the fact that Elian has been removed from his native temperate country to suggest that perhaps he ought to be returned there The WP reports that Bush and Sen John McCain have broken their agreement to refrain from negative campaigning and attack politics The truce was shattered when Bush ran an ad that assailed McCain s proposed tax plan To paraphrase the explanations of how the hostilities resurfaced each man vehemently asserted that the other one started it
