 Background Mycobacterium infections are frequent opportunistic pathogens associated with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS Its relative virulence and potential for person to person transmission distinguishes Mycobacterium tuberculosis Persons infected with the human immunodeficiency virus HIV are particularly susceptible to tuberculosis either by the reactivation of latent infection or by a primary infection with rapid progression to active disease 1 2 3 4 The annual incidence rate of tuberculosis in Colombia during 1998 was 19 6 per 100 000 persons 5 but rates 1 000 fold higher have been reported in some HIV seropositive populations 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 In addition disseminated infections with Mycobacterium avium complex are increasingly common in advanced human immunodeficiency virus HIV disease and cause substantial morbidity 15 16 Persons with HIV infection and CD4 lymphocyte counts less than 100 cells mm 3have a probability of 10 to 20 per year of developing M avium complex disease or bacteremia 17 18 Bacteremia involving M avium complex produces a wide array of clinical signs and symptoms including wasting fever and night sweats and is associated with decreased survival 17 18 19 20 The recovery of mycobacteria in blood cultures can help to discover bacteremia that frequently goes unrecognized We undertook a prospective survey in three AIDS health care units in Bogota Colombia in order to determine the prevalence of Mycobacterium species in HIV infected patients and to evaluate the diagnostic value of different types of body fluids to detect the presence of mycobacteria Methods Patients and study design This study was a multicentric prospective study of the frequency of Mycobacterium infections in persons infected with HIV The study was conducted in three major AIDS health care programs of Bogota Hospital Universitario San Juan de Dios Hospital Regional Simon Bol var and Centro Atenci n B sica Chapinero del Seguro Social From October 1999 to March 2000 a total of 289 HIV seropositive patients were recruited Most of the participants met the definition of AIDS or were in clinical stage C CDC 1993 The institutional review board at each site approved the study and each participant gave written informed consent Specimen collection and culture media For all patients blood urine stool and sputum samples were collected In brief 5 to 8 mL of blood was obtained in previously labeled Vacutainer tubes containing 1 7 mL of heparin as anticoagulant All patients attempts were made to collect two paired blood cultures samples n 648 2 urine cultures n 497 2 stool cultures n 374 and 2 sputum samples n 101 In one patient a sample of ascitic fluid and in other case cerebrospinal fluid CSF were obtained Bacteriologic methods were used as previously described 21 22 Briefly blood samples were centrifuged 15 min at 2 000 g and leukocytes recovered by standard methods with Ficoll Hypaque Pharmacia Fine Chemicals Piscataway NJ and then mixed with a lysing solution that contained 0 45 sodium deoxycholate After manual mixing tubes were centrifuged at 3 500 g for 30 minutes in a refrigerated centrifuge at 4 000 g and the supernatant was discarded The pellet was resuspended and 0 2 bovine albumin was added to yield a final volume of 2 5 mL One gr of stool samples was placed in 5 ml of albumin Dubos media and mixed in Vortex for 2 min then incubated at room temperature overnight Afterwards equal volumes of a solution of 2 NaOH were mixed in Vortex for 2 min and incubated at room temperature in continuos mixing for 15 min Distilled water was added to complete 50 ml and the mixture was centrifuged at 6 000 g for 30 min One drop of phenol red was added to the pellet and then neutralized with 2 drops of HCl 2 N The pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of saline solution mixed and finally 0 2 ml used for culture Urine samples were mixed in a ratio of 3 1 with a solution of 20 Na 3 PO 4 12H 2 O The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 2 h and then centrifuged at 6 000 g for 30 min The pellet was used for culture after being decontaminated by Ogawa Kudoh method Briefly sterile slabs were placed in a solution of 4 NaOH during 1 or 2 min and then used to culture samples Sputum was mixed in equal volume with a solution of 4 Na 3 PO 4 12H 2 O incubated at room temperature during 2 h and centrifuged at 6 000 g for 30 min The pellet was decontaminated by the Ogawa Kudoh method as described above and used for culture The same procedure was used for the ascitic fluid and CSF samples All samples were placed in 2 tubes with a biphasic medium a solid phase Ogawa Kudoh with iron citrate and a liquid phase of Sauton Twen albumin modified medium and 2 tubes with Stonebrink Giraldo medium Readings were made after day 6 and at 2 4 6 8 12 and 16 week A positive culture was identified following the criteria of the Centers for Prevention and Disease Control CDC 22 Resistance assay was applied at all Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates using the proportion method for streptomycin S isoniazide H thioacetazone Tb ethambutol E and rifampicin R All samples were stained and examined for AFB after centrifugation Statistical analysis Statistical significance for comparison of rates was determined by an exact test when sample sizes were insufficient and by an asymptotic test when sizes were sufficient All tests were two sided and a P value of 0 05 was considered significant Exact 95 confidence intervals CI were calculated for rates by assuming the numerator to be a Poisson variable 23 and for rate ratios using a modified binomial model 24 Adjusted rate ratios for comparisons among groups defined by demographic variables were calculated by using a Mantel Haenszel type estimator for incidence rate data with approximate 95 confidence limits based on the tests 23 Results Demographic characteristics In total 286 patients were studied 251 87 8 were men and 35 12 2 were women The men women ratio was 7 1 The age range was 3 to 78 years with a median of 35 years Table 1 Ten patients 3 were from Hospital San Juan de Dios one hundred thirty nine patients 49 were from Hospital Sim n Bol var and one hundred thirty seven patients 48 were from the Instituto de Seguro Social Fifty eight patients were hospitalized at the time of enrollment 20 and two hundred twenty eight patients 80 were enrolled at an outpatient clinic One hundred ninety five patients 68 5 were in treatment with antiretroviral medication Sexual preferences were informed in 269 94 patients as follows in males ninety 33 4 were homosexual eighty six 31 9 were bisexual and sixty one 22 7 were heterosexual Of the women twenty nine 90 6 were heterosexual and three 9 4 were bisexual CDC staging in these patients is shown in Table 1 Viral load was obtained in 180 patients and results varied in a range between less than 50 and 13 millions copies mL The median of viral load was 23 420 copies mL The symptoms most frequently complaint of at the time of initial enrollment were headaches 48 loss of weight 43 and mental status changes 38 The frequency of each symptom is showed in Figure 1 29 patients complaint of respiratory symptoms 13 patients had a history of diagnosis of tuberculosis and 12 gave a history of previous treatment with antituberculous drugs Mycobacteriuminfection Overall sixteen of 286 patients 5 6 were positive for any Mycobacterium species by acid fast staining or culture of any of their samples In these sixteen cases fifteen 94 were positive by culture and one patient was detected only by acid fast bacilli staining 6 Fourteen patients 87 5 were men and two 12 5 were women M tuberculosis was identified in four cases 1 4 M avium was isolated in thirteen patients 4 2 Two patients presented simultaneous infection by M tuberculosis and M avium Tuberculosis was diagnosed in its pulmonary form in two cases and in another two patients as extrapulmonary In the patients with pulmonary tuberculosis the AFB smear of the sputum was positive in one case and in another case the AFB smear was positive in his stool sample Culture of stool samples was positive in both cases of pulmonary and in one case of extrapulmonary tuberculosis M tuberculosis was detected in different samples of body fluids as well in sputum urine stool samples and in ascitic fluid Table 2 All isolates of M tuberculosis were sensitive to the drugs assayed streptomycin S isoniazide H thioacetazone Th ethambutol E and rifampicin R The only species identified as non tuberculous mycobacteria was M avium which was detected in 13 patients 4 2 Two patients had coinfection by M tuberculosis and M avium in their sputum culture One patient was positive only for acid fast bacilli staining in two stool samples but no growth was observed in culture tubes after 16 weeks of incubation Interestingly in three patients the direct AFB staining in blood was positive and M avium was later identified in these blood cultures Table 3 M avium was also detected in other clinical samples urine stool and sputum Table 4 The percent of positive AFB smears and cultures was greater in samples of sputum followed by the samples of stool Table 5 Samples of urine and stool were valuable to identify most of patients with a M avium infection only three patients infected by M avium were identified solely by blood cultures Table 6and 7 Association between Mycobacterium aviuminfection and clinical data The following factors Table 6 were significantly associated with a culture positive for M avium infections death during time of follow up odds ratio OR 9 7 95 CI 2 8 32 loss of weight OR 8 95 CI 1 6 54 and diarrhea OR 3 9 95 CI 1 1 14 The mean time of survival during the study was significantly reduced in patients infected with Mycobacterium avium compared to the ones not infected 154 44 versus 170 37 days p 0 01 There were no statistically significant differences in age sex clinical stage CD4 cell count viral load use of antiretrovirals drugs or time of diagnosis since HIV infection between patients with or without mycobacterial infection Table 7 However there were no patients with M avium infections in clinical stage A or with a CD4 cell count higher than 500 cells mm 3 Tables 8and 9 Discussion Our study was a prospective study in HIV infected patients in whom an indiscriminate search Mycobacterium infection was done Clinical suspicion of tuberculosis existed previous to enrollment only in the two patients with pulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection but not in the other two patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis Most of Mycobacterium species isolated were M avium The frequency that we found was lower than that of previously reported studies for Mycobacterium in HIV infected patients in Colombia A previous study at the Hospital San Juan de Dios in 1996 performed in 92 HIV infected patients found a prevalence of 8 for M tuberculosis infection 25 In another study in 101 patients in Cali Colombia the prevalence was only 2 26 In the present study it was 1 4 The prevalence of non tuberculous Mycobacterium species in Cali was 5 27 and in the current study it was 4 The lower prevalence of M tuberculosis can be related to the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy HAART that was practically absent in the previous study in Bogota in 1996 but that was being used to treat 68 of the patients in the current study Our results are also different to the ones reported in a General Hospital AIDS reference center in Rio de Janeiro Brazil 28 where mycobacteria were recovered from 20 6 313 of 1 517 of all patients and M tuberculosis was identified in 94 2 295 313 and non tuberculous mycobacteria in 5 8 18 313 Our results suggest that when antiretroviral therapy is introduced the relative frequency of M tuberculosis infections is reduced and the one of M avium infections increases 28 We found that Mycobacterium avium infection was related to symptomatic diarrhea and greater mortality as has been reported previously 29 Our study shows that frequency of isolation of M avium was greater in urine and stool samples This emphasizes the need to take multiple body fluid samples in order to enhance the opportunity of isolation increasing the microbiologic diagnostic sensitivity Interestingly we found that blood AFB smears can be useful to rapidly confirm a clinical diagnosis of disseminated Mycobacterium avium infection In the present study there were no resistant strains of M tuberculosis found In a previous survey in Colombia it was found that M tuberculosis isolates among new cases in patients without HIV infection showed resistance in 9 5 4 of 42 30 Conclusions Our study found that 5 of HIV infected patients in Bogota were infected with Mycobacteria and that M Avium was the predominant species It becomes evident the need to improve the preventive measures and prompt treatment of this type of opportunistic infection in the HIV infected individuals Competing interests None declared
