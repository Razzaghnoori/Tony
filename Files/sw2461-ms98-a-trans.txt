 okay we re gonna talk about the public school system what s wrong with it and or if anything is wrong with it and what we can do about it what should be done about it okay fantastic one one thing that pops into my mind real quick is uh about the uh funding of the the school system right now evidently uh that s that s a big problem yeah yeah it s amazing um i always thought that teachers never got paid nearly enough i mean to be doing what they re doing right uh when i was in college i like i enjoyed teaching because i did some teaching part time and i really enjoyed that but i wouldn t wanna go teach high school or junior high it just you know too many problems oh Lord i mean yeah and you talk about stress and pressure i tell you what it s uh yeah they re putting in fifty sixty hours a week i m sure because they got to grade papers and get class stuff ready and you know and they re being paid probably half what most people being paid do right exactly and uh hey we re paying basketball people you know millions of dollars a year for for what you know that s right and then they uh poof it off you know just like Tarpley but um yeah i don t know it what gets me is i can t believe that Congress um or our state legislature can t come up with uh some kind of workable means to have funds for the school you know it s uh i just don t understand that yeah it s uh i don t do you have little kids or what no uh sure don t my wife and i have just been married about two years but i have a sister that s a uh school teacher and uh yeah yeah my wife and i have a a three year old almost four and a and a two year old so we re looking at uh the older one going to school next year not not well not this coming fall but the year after that and the year okay okay so it s getting close yeah he s gonna be going to kindergarten so so you know we re we re thinking about that what that what that gonna be like are they gonna be taught nothing are they gonna be taught something we re gonna we re gonna be involved in our child s education we re gonna be teaching him what we can at home of course right right because uh i guess we don t trust the school systems which is really sad um but but it if it doesn t start at home it s not gonna go anywhere exactly right that s true uh and we re gonna try to teach him good values because you know when when when they get to upper level school and they start teaching well hey if you can play football or basketball that s what s important not if you can read or write or do or understand understand some science you know i mean give me a break that s that s that s bogus exactly right right well and uh you know one thing my wife and i ve talked about it are uh private schools yeah you know whether uh uh we would want to invest in in private schools as they re growing growing up because you know just in the Dallas area um we re not real comfortable with the with the public schools and Dallas uh school district just recently got an advised status because of their low quality schooling i couldn t believe that right right you know the one that s one reason we bought a house here in Plano we were hoping you know well the school district s gonna be good you know for resale value and so on and so forth but yes um i can definitely uh see on down the road you know when we do have kids and are getting to that age that s gonna be a definite concern yeah we talked you talked about before about uh the school funding i think there s only gonna be one solution to school funding which i i don t think will be necessarily the best way but i think what s what s gonna have to happen is there s gonna have to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids that s the only way they re gonna fund it because they start raising taxes for property and people are gonna throw a fit that s yeah and you know that s taxes is right now are political suicide you know and i don t think any politician s gonna do that so oh yeah yeah and the only thing they they would would think of would be tuition you know if it works at colleges it ll work down below and you know that s gonna that s gonna affect the people that are having kids in school of course which is probably the only fair thing to do right but it ll be hard for those that people have have in school because they have to pay out even more exactly and you know it s gonna really hurt the the middle class uh people i think because uh they re the ones that ll probably have to uh uh carry the brunt of the load oh yeah that s right so uh and most the problems with kids in school carrying guns and and knives and everything i mean good grief what s with yeah now that s that s just unbelievable to me you know i can t believe that i mean when i was in junior high and high school that never happened you never heard about that well yeah we didn t we didn t even think about it you know no and now you know what we have now you know got kids that Rusty because he like you know a a Magnum gun in school like good grief right i mean i would i d be afraid to be in school i mean be teaching or even a being a student and think what s what s it gonna be like for my my youngest and my oldest son when he goes to school what what s gonna happen i mean i i m afraid for him to go but on the other hand you can t hold them back exactly right well no and you and you wanna encourage them you know to to be active and everything in school but uh you know with all the peer pressure that s going on with all the negative things it is uh it s a tough environment to be growing up in yeah a lot tougher from it was when i was going to school and that was when i was i graduated high school in nineteen seventy nine so that was what twelve years ago i guess okay right so you know it s a lot different now and what s it gonna be like in another twelve years when my uh oldest son s in high school that s right that s right i m afraid to i m afraid to even think about it no yeah that is a scary thought but uh i don t know i i guess what you have to do is just uh keep encouraging uh you know encouraging them and and uh uh try to be open with them so that you can deal with the problems as they come up yeah and that s all you can do you got to you got to be your child s best friend i guess even when they re a teenager and they you know are kind of standoffish still you got to be their best friend because when they got problems who they gonna go to their friends that are dealing drugs or or there parents right exactly you know and and if they go to their friends dealing drugs they re gonna be in even worse shape that s right and and the schools don t don t really encourage to stay away from that you know the schools are there teach history and that we fought the civil war etcetera etcetera they don t teach them good values like drugs are bad i don t maybe i m wrong maybe because i haven t you know been in that kind of environment for a long time but it just is amazing you know need to teach them good values right that s true that s true and uh of course what what if if i say this is a good value someone else is gonna stand up and say oh no and the ACLU s gonna get after them and have a lawsuit which is gonna take twenty years to resolve you know right well and i think uh you touched on it you know you ve got to start them at the home yeah you know that s where they that s where they get the the deep rooted values and and uh and that s about right then you just have to hope and pray that that everything uh works out works out okay that that s all you can do that s right well i got to be going so uh well okay well hey i appreciate the call you too bye bye nice talking to you Jay hm have a good life uh
