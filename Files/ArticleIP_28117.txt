 Demand an Explanation Greetings pissed off consumers It is I the great Shopping Avenger who has toiled without pause this past month all right I paused to right the wrongs inflicted on the buying masses by the dark forces of turbocharged capitalism Before writing the first installment of this column last month the Shopping Avenger had no idea that so many people would have so many complaints about so many different companies The Shopping Avenger also had no idea so many people read Slate The complaints as Alan Simpson would say have come pouring in over the transom I received somewhere around 2 7 million e mails from Slate readers asking for help in the battle against poor customer service Perhaps it was fewer than 2 7 million but not by much Only one correspondent was hostile You re probably just running a scam to collect a bunch of upscale e mail addresses he wrote dyspeptically and inaccurately I checked out his e mail address it s not upscale at all But most of you turned to me in good faith and for this I am thankful Alas I am but one superhero and could not come to the aid of all who beseeched me So for those of you asking highly technical questions concerning the operation of your personal computers let it be known across the land that the Shopping Avenger still writes on papyrus And for those of you who contributed not complaints but wacky observations such as I find it amazing how people will drive many miles out of their way to buy gas that is 5 cents cheaper I thank you for your commentary Now though a few observations of my own about the complaints the understandable ones I did receive 1 The American consumer believes that the telephone is the instument of the devil 2 The people who answer 1 800 lines are spawn of the devil or at the very least incredibly thick 3 The typical corporation would much rather blow smoke than actually apologize for doing wrong 4 American corporations do not yet understand the true power of the Shopping Avenger As an example of all four phenomena I refer you now to the complaint of K who is chagrined by the errant behavior of the U Haul company I signed up a truck from Friday until Monday two weeks hence K explains A week later I called the local number to confirm and confirm they did They confirmed that my reservation was for Sunday Not only was it not Fri to Mon indeed it couldn t be Fri to Mon because U Haul policy is not to rent trucks for more than one weekend day Hey no problem a fine policy But let s supplement it with DON T TELL ME OTHERWISE WHEN I SIGN UP Though I am not one to endorse the use of CAPITAL LETTERS TO MAKE A POINT I believe K earned that right here K goes on to state that he canceled his rental and sought out a truck at Ryder where the saleswoman an ex U Haul employee told him that it was U Haul s policy never to turn down a reservation no matter what Overbooking is the norm she said So I called U Haul to inquire about its rental policies What I got was in technical terms a runaround U Haul International s spokeswoman Johna Burke told me that her company would never behave in such a way Then she blamed the customer for misunderstanding what he heard This I am learning is standard operating procedure across whole industries I ve heard variations of the customer didn t understand our phone prompts three times already leading me to the conclusion that there s a real problem out there with deliberately obfuscatory phone prompts Then Burke yelled at me for having the temerity to even suggest that the ex U Haul employee K quoted might be right The Shopping Avenger can take the heat however I asked her for the U Haul policy concerning weekend rentals but Burke said she could not cite policy because individual U Haul operators set their own policies She asked me to identify the state in which the rental was to occur which I did Then she suggested that K merely thought he made a reservation but actually only asked about prices This seemed a bit of a stretch to me but I checked with K who supplied me with his actual reservation number He also confirmed that he placed a deposit for the truck Once again I called Burke to ask whether U Haul is in the habit of changing confirmed reservations behind the customer s back but Burke even while knowing that the Shopping Avenger s deadline approached did not call back The Shopping Avenger has himself been a victim of the reservation shuffle and so he sympathizes with K s complaint And K should know that the Shopping Avenger will not rest except at night and on weekends until he shakes an adequate explanation out of U Haul But let us turn now to a Shopping Avenger victory Our correspondent A wrote the Shopping Avenger to complain of his treatment on the Ticketmaster Web site As he explained he had logged on to the site in order to buy tickets to a Bob Dylan Paul Simon show Everything was going fine until he clicked to confirm his order The screen read We will now contact the Ticketmaster system to complete your order Please wait to see a response from the system with your confirmation I waited and waited A wrote me Finally a message appeared telling me to try later the gateway was not functioning So there I was wondering what the hell had happened to my credit card information Even worse the phone number they gave me to call is long distance Needless to say this was frustrating I picked up the phone and called the long distance number It was busy In fact it was busy for the NEXT THREE HOURS there are those capital letters again Even worse when I finally did get through I was put on hold for 20 minutes Let me emphasize That was 20 minutes of my long distance on MY phone bill to find out what they had done to MY credit card number A then writes Ironically while on hold Ticketmaster shamelessly plugged its online system finishing with Buying tickets has never been easier Ironic indeed To add insult to injury when A finally spoke to a live person you will soon see why the word live is in quotation marks he asked to have the 5 50 convenience fee waived for each ticket he planned to buy After all I was making a long distance call and they had bungled my initial attempt at a purchase The operator a certain Nola from the misnamed customer service department told him he should have called his local service provider Of course no one had provided A with the local service number He eventually bought the tickets anyway paying the convenience charge All this was too much for the Shopping Avenger who swung into action Actually the Shopping Avenger swung into action even before he knew of A s plight since A s girlfriend had secretly forwarded A s Shopping Avenger complaint to Ticketmaster Soon after I made inquiries A was refunded 11 in convenience charges But 11 wasn t enough I wanted an explanation and an apology for A which he got sort of In a letter to A the executive vice president of Ticketmaster Multimedia Robert Perkins explains semi grammatically that w hen tickets goes on sale it operates through telephone lines that may become busy He also explains Dozens of variables may determine the speed and continuity of your Internet connection are in the hands of your local phone company Perkins does say he s sorry in a fashion Please accept our sincerest apologies and we hope you will continue to offer your comments as our site evolves in the future A can accept the nonsensical apology he told me because Ticketmaster is also offering him a 100 gift certificate for his troubles Ticketmaster has shown the way When you screw up apologize make material amends and get the Shopping Avenger on your side Score that Shopping Avenger 111 evil but contrite corporation 0 Next month the Shopping Avenger hopes to focus on the evils of the pest control and airline industries Don t ask why it s too complicated to explain If you have complaints about these industries or any other for that matter e mail
