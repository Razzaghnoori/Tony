 A Mid Season Night s Dream Starting off there are a couple of mid season series to address Providence Don t do it NBC s new drama has been on for a mere two weeks Fri 8 PM and is already proving emotionally manipulative in a way ER never dreamed Basic premise In the aftermath of her mother s death which incidentally we witness in the first episode Beverly Hills plastic surgeon Sydney Hansen Melina Kanakaredes returns home to Providence R I to care for her sweetly dysfunctional family and practice real medicine in the local clinic In the first three episodes alone viewers are subjected to two deaths an aborted wedding an at home birth a wake and the main character s discovering her boyfriend in the shower with another man Compounding the emotional exploitation Syd s dad Mike Farrell is a veterinarian so every time the show s tear jerk quotient threatens to dip below critical mass viewers are confronted by sick injured and dying puppies Content aside Providence also has a few artistic problems The show is positively lousy with long lingering dreamy shots of Kanakaredes face Since she s unquestionably beautiful to behold a little visual indulgence can perhaps be forgiven What cannot be forgiven however is her hideous sing song voice over too perky and heartwarming by half Even more cutesy and annoying we are periodically inserted into Syd s dream life most of which revolves around her bickering with her dead mother and making out with this guy she had a crush on in high school who is now a local limo driver It s reminiscent of Ally McBeal s peeks into characters inner thoughts but without the special effects or originality Thursday at 9 PM is the premiere of CBS s new series Turks Yet another variation on the ever popular cop drama the show follows the trials and tribulations of an entire family of Chicago policemen Sadly this means we have to sit through the characters tedious personal dramas as well as their professional ones The plot lines aren t particularly surprising or clever but the dialogue is sharper and wittier than average and William Devane of Knot s Landing fame is particularly appealing as the family patriarch Sgt Joe Turk Those show s defining feature however is its overabundance of male bonding A single episode offers multiple sessions of father son bonding brother brother bonding cop cop bonding and so on Thus far the only women around fall into two categories docile wait at home wives and single career gals looking to bag one of the boys in blue There is nary a female cop to be found Perhaps as a sop to female viewers the cast includes a fair helping of Gillette jaws and cute butts Nonetheless I m sticking with Frasier Moving right along Sunday night s movie scene looks good The Fugitive NBC 8 PM vs Dead Man Walking CBS 9 PM but after that the pickings get decidedly slimmer Thank god for Lonesome Dove Family Channel Mon Thur 9 PM Based on the Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Larry McMurtry this 1989 miniseries follows the trail of two former Texas rangers driving a herd of cattle from the Mexican border up to Montana Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duvall are flat out brilliant in the lead roles backed by a strong supporting cast featuring Angelica Huston Diane Lane Danny Glover and Rick Schroder Speaking of Little Ricky if you re having trouble adjusting to the idea of Schroder starring as the hot new stud on NYPD Blue you may want to catch a few minutes of his MFTV movie this week What We Did That Night ABC 9 PM Mon The movie itself is dreadful a white washed blend of Cape Fear and I Know What You Did Last Summer with a truly annoying gotcha ending Schroder however gives a convincing performance as the creepy bad guy who lures all of his former frat brothers back to the scene of their youthful crime He can t save the movie but he definitely livens it up By far the oddest offering of the week is A E s Unmentionables A Brief History Sun 9 PM A two hour look at the evolution of underwear the special is as silly as it sounds The history of the myriad painful fads women have subjected themselves to over the years iron maidens rubber girdles breast binding may help remind viewers what all that 60s bra burning was about For the most part however listening to lingerie designers ramble insipidly about the form function and sensuousness of undies makes one suspect that the special was conceived largely as an excuse to show shot after shot of scantily clad breast buns and crotches It s kind of a thinking man s Baywatch Michelle Cottle
