 Inside eukaryotic cells there is a massive protein complex called the proteasome whose raison d tre is to remove unnecessary proteins by breaking them down into short peptides The proteasome is thus responsible for an important aspect of cellular regulation because the timely and controlled proteolysis of key cellular factors regulates numerous biological processes such as cell cycle differentiation stress response neuronal morphogenesis cell surface receptor modulation secretion DNA repair transcriptional regulation long term memory circadian rhythms immune response and biogenesis of organelles Glickman and Ciechanover 2002 With the multitude of substrates targeted and the myriad processes involved it is not surprising that aberrations in the pathway are implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases including cancer With so many proteins to target for degradation the activity of the proteasome is subject to multiple levels of regulation In the overwhelming majority of cases selected proteins are first labeled by the addition of several copies of a small protein tag called ubiquitin and are thus targeted for degradation in the proteasome Figure 1 The ubiquitination of proteins is regulated through precise selection of protein substrates by specific E3 ubiquitin ligases Pickart 2001 These enzyme complexes each recognize a subset of substrates and tag them by linking the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin with an amino group on the target protein via an amide bond Figure 1 Interestingly ubiquitination is a reversible process Even when a protein has been tagged with ubiquitin its fate is not sealed specific hydrolytic enzymes called deubiquitinases can remove the ubiquitin label intact Figure 1 By deubiquitinating their substrates these enzymes compete with the proteasome which acts on the polyubiquitined form In the competition between proteolysis and deubiquitination polyubiquitinated proteins rarely accumulate in the cytoplasm of healthy cells as they are either irreversibly degraded or deubiquitinated and rescued It is thought that this competition provides a certain level of stringency or quality control to the system Based on sequence homology deubiquitinating enzymes were traditionally classified into two families ubiquitin specific proteases UBPs or USPs and ubiquitin carboxy terminal hydrolases UCHs Both enzyme families are classified as cysteine proteases that employ an active site thiol to cleave ubiquitin from its target Kim et al 2003 Wing 2003 The proteasome itself is made up of a multiprotein core particle CP where proteolysis occurs and a separate multiprotein regulatory particle RP that recognizes and prepares substrates for degradation by the CP A base subcomplex of the RP is pivotal in anchoring polyubiquitin chains during this process either directly or via auxiliary ubiquitin binding proteins Lam et al 2002 Hartmann Petersen et al 2003 The base attaches to the outer surface of the CP and uses energy to unravel the substrate simultaneously with preparing the channel that leads into the proteolytic chamber of the CP Forster and Hill 2003 The lid subcomplex of the RP attaches to the base and is required for proteolysis of ubiquitin protein conjugates but not of unstructured polypeptides Glickman et al 1998 Guterman and Glickman 2003 The size and complexity of this protein eating machine hints at the exquisite controls that must rgulate its function An intriguing evolutionary and structural relationship between the proteasome lid and an independent complex the COP9 signalosome CSN may shed light on their respective roles in regulated protein degradation Both are made up of eight homologous protein subunits that contain similar structural and functional motifs While a lot is still unknown the CSN appears to mediate responses to signals e g light hormones adhesion nutrients DNA damage in a manner that is intimately linked to the ubiquitin proteasome system This is accomplished for instance by suppressing ubiquitin E3 ligase activity or interacting with various components of the pathway Bech Otschir et al 2002 Cope and Deshaies 2003 Li and Deng 2003 In particular one subunit Csn5 moderates SCF Skp1 cullin F box and other cullin based E3 ubiquitin ligases by removal of the ubiquitin like Rub1 Nedd8 molecule from the cullin subunit of the ligase complex Further analysis of the CSN will no doubt uncover additional mechanisms whereby ubiquitin mediated protein degradation is controlled Surprisingly the proteasome itself harbors intrinsic deubiquitination activity Eytan et al 1993 Moreover both the lid and the base contribute independently to RP deubiquitination activity The source of this activity has been attributed to a number of different subunits These include the associated cysteine proteases Ubp6 USP14 Borodovsky et al 2001 Legget et al 2002 UCH37 p37 Lam et al 1997 Hoelzl et al 2000 and Doa4 Ubp4 Papa et al 1999 as well as the intrinsic proteasome subunit Rpn11 POH1 Verma et al 2002 Yao and Cohen 2002 The importance of these components to proteasome function is apparent in their partially overlapping properties In groundbreaking work an intrinsic cryptic deubiquitinating activity that is sensitive to metal chelators has been reported for the proteasome in addition to classic cysteine protease behavior Verma et al 2002 Yao and Cohen 2002 This metalloprotease like activity maps to the putative catalytic MPN JAMM motif of the lid subunit Rpn11 and lies at the heart of proteasome mechanism by linking deubiquitination with protein degradation Notably Rpn11 shares close homology with Csn5 which is also responsible for proteolytic activities in its respective complex By defining a new family of putative metalloproteases that includes a proteasomal subunit a CSN subunit and additional proteins from all domains of life the MPN JAMM motif garnered great attention The trademark of the MPN JAMM motif is a consensus sequence E HxHx 7 Sx 2 D that bears some resemblance to the active site of zinc metalloproteases Members of this family were predicted to be hydrolytic enzymes some of which are specific for removal of ubiquitin or ubiquitin like domains from their targets Maytal Kivity et al 2002 Verma et al 2002 Yao and Cohen 2002 In a further development two independent groups determined the molecular structure of an MPN JAMM protein from an archaebacterium Ambroggio et al 2003 Tran et al 2003 The structures identify a zinc ion chelated to the two histidines and the aspartic residue of the MPN JAMM sequence The fourth ligand appears to be a water molecule activated through interactions with the conserved glutamate to serve as the active site nucleophile Overall this protein certainly has properties consistent with a metallohydrolase and can serve as the prototype for the deubiquitinating enzymes in its class This revelation adds an all new enzymatic activity and with it an additional layer of regulation to the ubiquitin proteasome system Now that it is evident that the proteasome contains a member of a novel metalloprotease family a fundamental question can be raised why does a proteolytic enzyme like the proteasome need auxiliary proteases for hydrolysis of ubiquitin domains At first glance the delegation of tasks between the proteolytic subunits of the proteasome situated in the proteolytic core particle and the auxiliary deubiquitinating enzymes situated in the regulatory particle is clear cut the latter cleave between ubiquitin domains while the core proteolytic subunits process the target protein itself Figure 1 However this still does not explain the mechanistic rational for finding deubiquitination within the proteasome itself In principle deubiquitination could be used for 1 recycling of ubiquitin 2 abetting degradation by removal of the tightly folded highly stable globular ubiquitin domain or 3 mitigating degradation by removal of the ubiquitin anchor without which the substrate is easily released and rescued There is evidence that recycling of ubiquitin by the proteasome is indeed a crucial feature of deubiquitination in proper cellular maintenance Legget et al 2002 Distinguishing between options 2 and 3 however depends to a large extent on the delicate balance between the two proteolytic activities associated with the proteasome proteolysis and deubiquitination Figure 2 Once bound to the proteasome a polyubiquitinated substrate can be unfolded by the RP and irreversibly translocated into the CP It has been proposed that long polyubiquitin chains commit a substrate to unfolding and degradation by the proteasome whereas short chains are poor substrates because they are edited by deubiquitinating enzymes resulting in premature substrate release Eytan et al 1993 Lam et al 1997 Thrower et al 2000 Guterman and Glickman 2003 Extended polyubiquitin chains could slow down chain disassembly thereby allowing ample time for unfolding and proteolysis of the substrate Figure 2 Interestingly both trimming and shaving deubiquitinating activities are associated with the proteasome though the exact contribution of the various proteasome associated deubiquitinating enzymes to each of these distinct activities has yet to be elucidated It is expected that in order to obtain efficient proteolysis of the target shaving of chains at their proximal ubiquitin should be slower than the rate of trimming at the distal moiety As an outcome of this requirement longer polyubiquitin tags would be preferential substrates for degradation by the proteasome Thus the uniqueness of ubiquitin as a label for degradation may lie in its being a reversible tag Deubiquitinases such as Rpn11 serve as proofreading devices for reversal of fortune at various stages of the process right up to the final step before irreversible degradation by the proteasome Identifying Rpn11 and Csn5 as members of a novel class of metallohydrolases immediately elevates them into promising drugable candidates Undoubtedly the molecular structures deciphered by the groups of Deshaies Ambroggio et al 2003 and Bycroft Tran et al 2003 will focus efforts to design novel site specific inhibitors of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway While Csn5 is thought to impede the action of ubiquitin ligases through shaving cullins from their Rub1 Nedd8 modification and possibly also by deubiquitinating substrates bound to the cullins the outcome of Rpn11 inhibition will depend largely on whether Rpn11 participates primarily in shaving substrates from their chains promoting release and rescue or in trimming the polyubiquitin tag allowing for proteolysis quality control Figure 2
