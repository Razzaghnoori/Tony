 Signs of Intelligent Life Roger I d never accuse you of consciously formulating your reviews in accordance with a political agenda My fear based on lifelong respect for your writing and the early corruption of my morals by Beyond the Valley of the Dolls is that the immense responsibility you ve assumed could get in the way of your having irresponsible fun It would be OK if you hated South Park Bigger Longer Uncut what worried me was that you said you felt guilty for having laughed By the way I missed the racism in that film unless it was the depiction of Canadians as having crudely bisected eggheads As for homophobia I saw on the contrary a sophisticated gay camp worldview being slipped in through the back door So to speak Fight Club is a more difficult case Its makers clearly thought they were satirizing fascism you think they ended up celebrating it My view is closer to yours but it s a tricky line Some of the greatest artists burrow so deeply into their characters twisted psyches that they risk making a case for the dark side A seminal masterpiece Taxi Driver goes about as deep as you can and some people think too deep A smart twentysomething former Slate writer tried to explain to me the other day that the point of Fight Club is that the hero spends the whole movie punching himself in the face To him and many others this ironically brutal confession of impotence sums up the messy unresolved feelings of his generation I m skeptical I think the film s ironies are more opportunistic than insightful But I find it so much harder to dismiss than The Green Mile which doesn t ever risk making the case for its evil characters worldview and so illuminates nothing Sarah Lovely case for The Sixth Sense which had me bawling at the end although it cheated like mad and I could smell the greasepaint on those ghosts Your body and soul riff accounts for why the world through the prism of movies seemed to open up toward the end of this year to seem so fluid that even Elvis the Destroyer had an out of body experience By the way I m not your host I m just the guy who camps here year round I admit I felt a little territorial when the Movie Club started now I ll be lonely when the rest of you leave I began on a note of hope for movies I end feeling hopeful about criticism Best David P S Jar Jar must die
