 Campaign Fatigue Syndrome Evan Squeegee Guys and Leprous Beggars for Hillary What a campaign slogan And the bumper sticker possibilities It s going to be a great race That s my desperate hope anyway One of the problems with a presidential year is that it starts so early Twelve months to go and I m already finding myself blowing past the political stories in the morning paper and heading for the pointless wire roundups at the back I ve always liked the weird stuff anyway I probably should have become a night beat police reporter but increasingly I ve come to see Rockville Teen Set Ablaze as my reward for slogging through Bradley Unveils Medicare Plan Today s news is a great example Page 1 of the Washington Post is crowded with eat your peas type stories Bush s tax cut plan the Dow Corning settlement an earnest feature on Korean immigrants who work in chicken processing plants on the Eastern Shore There are also pieces on the WTO riots and the mass graves in Juarez unusually interesting stories for the A section but for the really compelling copy you ve got to venture inside Style where Howie Kurtz has an account of a group firing at the New York Times The other day the Times tossed more than 20 employees from one of its clerical offices in Norfolk for sending inappropriate and offensive e mails None of the e mails in question is reproduced in the story so it s not clear precisely what was inappropriate or offensive about them But there are a couple of incredibly creepy quotes from Times executives If you receive e mail that violates our policy wrote the CEO of the Times in a company wide memo please notify your manager or the head of Human Resources in your business unit We will take prompt action to address the situation Translation Rat out your peers and we ll fire them Or some of them As a friend of mine pointed out this morning if a well known Times reporter was caught forwarding an obscene picture to a friend in the newsroom would he lose his job No way But when some 9 an hour mope in the payroll office in Norfolk does it he s walking down the road talking to his lunch box inside of an hour Under most circumstances I wouldn t have a problem with this Generally I think private employers ought to be able to hire and fire whomever they want at time for any reason And I accept that there is a meaningful difference between Rick Berke and the guy who files workman s comp forms On the other hand the Times came up with its policy against offensive e mail as a way to shield its employees from discrimination and harassment in other words as a way to protect the Little Guy from the abuses of the powerful And yet here we have the Little Guy getting shafted for an offense that a in all likelihood hurt no one and b that the powerful could almost certainly commit without getting fired What we have here Evan is your classic Irony Story And that s what I really want from my daily newspaper Best Tucker
