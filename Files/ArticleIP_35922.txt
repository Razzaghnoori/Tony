 P Is the quot Sensation quot Art Worth the Fuss P Click here to view the entire Sensation show online Dear Deborah Last time we chatted it was in the TriBeCa loft of the abstract painter Melissa Meyer at one of her Sunday teas and like her work and her friends our conversation was eminently civilized and stimulating I must say I d rather spend the next couple of days thinking and writing about and hearing your views about a single picture by Meyer than every piece by every artist in the Sensation show at the Brooklyn Museum Even though I m young and British myself born on the same day as Rachel Whiteread as it happens I have to confess to being as profoundly alienated from the YBAs as they seem to be from the kind of art that turns me on From the kind of art in a word that is about little sensations as C zanne called them rather than the tabloid sensationalism in which the Brooklyn show wallows Of course however wonderfully and sensitively you and I were to write about one abstract painting there is no denying that to the average reader even indeed to the committed art aficionado a two day debate about Meyer s or anyone s use of pink would get a little wearisome Whereas we could get hotter and hotter under the collar about the ethics of displaying one man s collection of new art in a public institution of public subsidy for art the public is goaded into hating of how blasphemy has become an article of faith in an institutionalized avant garde etc etc For journalists even for respectable critics like you and me Sensation is great copy I know Slate wants us to talk about the art in Brooklyn not the kerfuffle surrounding it and hats off to them for wanting it so but one point has to be made It is irksome when art becomes a moral cause It is as if during a fencing match someone were to start hurling bombs It polarizes debate in such a way that aesthetic discernments become irrelevant When mayors and clergymen and animal rights activists start weighing in the issues become freedom of expression the meaning of images the ownership of icons does the Virgin belong to the Church or to everyone touched by the concept etc all fascinating issues but leaving anyone concerned with art obliged to argue for basic artists rights rather than attending to more localized and interesting issues like is Chris Ofili any good But this in turn raises another issue Does Ofili want us to ask whether he is any good or does he not short circuit the evaluative process by making art contrived to raise hell with Catholics and excite a frisson of old time anticlericalism in the rest of us It seems to me absurd to try and read an image like The Holy Virgin Mary 1996 in purely formal terms because it would be to apply aesthetic criteria and art historical comparisons to a work that draws its power primarily from iconoclasm and irreverence Ofili wants surely to be raw crude angry Bad It doesn t do much good to come along and say well the encrustation of cut out porno photos has a decorative quality that recalls Gustave Moreau s overloaded quasi queasy mystical images of the last fin de si cle Better would be to compare and contrast it with other art brut and with other blasphemous imagery In respect of the former it competes with Dubuffet and of the latter with Bu uel Dal Max Ernst I m thinking of Ernst s mock Renaissance altarpiece of the Virgin spanking the Holy Infant with the artist Breton and I think luard as witnesses On both counts prewar anti clericalism and postwar apocalyptic angst gave the Surrealists and Dubuffet respectively historic urgency lacking in the gratuitous neo primitivism of Ofili Unless we want to argue that Ofili s art is about the loss of center that gives meaning to the kind of gestures he deploys The problem remains Do we should we bother with evaluative comparisons and contextualizations with an artist like Chris Ofili whose agenda seems to be anti aesthetic and whose context is much more the current sensations of pop music and fashion with which he vies in terms of energy and verve than the old masters the strong and durable art admired by C zanne in the Louvre and by many of us in the permanent collections of the Brooklyn Museum Best to you David
