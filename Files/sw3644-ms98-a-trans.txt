                uh what are the capital punishment laws in your state   uh theyre   or do you have it   uh theyre theyre the death penalty can be imposed   yeah uh or is it set for a specific crimes uh you know if youre convicted of this then its the death penalty or or is it kind of just to the discretion under certain cases   uh its uh murder it it can be is i think is the only can be tried for you know for uh capital punishment   yeah   and i firmly believe in it   yes uh i im the same way i feel that capital punishment ought to be mandatory under certain crimes   i do too here in Utah theres been a a person thats been on death row for i oh seventeen years i think and they just keep retrying and retrying and i just its just a waste of taxpayers money and and i really think it would be a deterrent   sounds like hed grow old and die long before they get to kill him   yes yes but uh   seventeen years on death row   umhum uh i think hes that hes the longest one in the nation that and they just keep retrying him and retrying him   well uh since they reinstated the death penalty was it about seven or eight years ago i think the shortest anybodys waited has been two or three years i mean death penalty does not seem to be swift for anybody   no is whats the death penalty in Mississippi   i so thats my understanding they do not have death penalty here right now um   i mean the capital     it doesnt make any sense that they dont but they dont um and right now to the best of my understanding there is nothing afoot to get it reinstated uh personally i think there should be death penalty for uh the death penalty should be available almost any major violent crime and mandatory for murder   i i agree with you they believe   it should be at least available as punishment for rape   yes definitely   i think if it was a serious  possible of being executed for doing any of the major crimes that it would be a little less likely for people to commit them   well one thing i cant understand is is these people that uh uh torture torture children and then murder i mean you know and then theyre they eventually kill them   yes   and i definitely think that that should be a death penalty and they get less than than people that have are murdered   yeah   i dont understand that i i just cant see how come a person that has kills a little child can get away with two or three years or five years five to fifteen   yeah and it   because   i dont know i if i think also they should be they uh somebody providing drugs to someone that kills the person   yes   that ought to be considered murder and potential death penalty   boy we think alike   i uh they used to have the death penalty in my home state of West Virginia   oh   and there it was death by hanging   uhhuh uh   uh but   how old are you may i ask   thirty four   oh uhhuh   and it when they eliminated death penalty all kinds of things changed   yes they do   uh the rate of crime doubled within about about a year or so   umhum   and at that point when they were still hanging the uh state prison in Mountsville uh had a very small guard force and they had very little problems with their their inmates   umhum   uh after they eliminated the death penalty shut down the gallows   umhum umhum   uh the place has gotten to the point where people who live in that area are all trying to get moved away its become a maximum security prison they have had a whole lot more problems with breakouts with uh with violence within the the prison   umhum   uh uh just the whole whole tenor of the thing has changed completely   i wonder why i wonder why they dont uh dont uh see that they need the death penalty then because havent you heard that they say that the death penalty does not uh deter crime   who is it who said the death penalty doesnt deter crime well im sure it doesnt much now because the death penalty is very seldom uh given and   used   even then like you say it could be twenty twenty years between the time
