 Earth in the Balance Sheet Earth Day is upon us once again Like most people who think at all about how much burden their way of life places on Spaceship Earth I feel a bit guilty But my conscience is clearer than usual this year and so are those of 2 500 other economists Let me explain A few months ago an organization called Redefining Progress enlisted five economists the Nobel laureates Robert Solow and Kenneth Arrow together with Harvard s Dale Jorgenson Yale s William Nordhaus and myself to circulate an Economists Statement on Climate Change calling for serious measures to limit the emission of greenhouse gases To be honest I agreed to be one of the original signatories mainly as a gesture of goodwill and never expected to hear any more about it but the statement ended up being signed by yes more than 2 500 economists Whatever else may come of the enterprise it was an impressive demonstration of a little known fact Many economists are also enthusiastic environmentalists Partly this is just because of who economists are Being by definition well educated and for the most part pretty well off they have the usual prejudices of their class and most upper middle class Americans are sentimental about the environment as long as protecting it does not impinge on their lifestyle I m happy to reuse my grocery bags but don t expect me to walk to the supermarket But my unscientific impression is that economists are on average more pro environment than other people of similar incomes and backgrounds Why Because standard economic theory automatically predisposes those who believe in it to favor strong environmental protection This is not of course the popular image Everyone knows that economists are people who know the price of everything and the value of nothing who think that anything that increases gross domestic product is good and anything else is worthless and who believe that whatever free markets do must be right A recent example of how this stereotype gets perpetuated is the article by garden shop entrepreneur Paul Hawken in the current Mother Jones I m sorry to say that some of the people at Redefining Progress published an impressively ill informed diatribe along the same lines in the Atlantic back in 1995 But the reality is that even the most conventional economic doctrine is a lot more subtle than that True economists generally believe that a system of free markets is a pretty efficient way to run an economy as long as the prices are right as long in particular as people pay the true social cost of their actions Environmental issues however more or less by definition involve situations in which the price is wrong in which the private costs of an activity fail to reflect its true social costs Let me quote from the textbook by William Baumol and Alan Blinder that I assigned when I taught Economics 1 last year When a firm pollutes a river it uses some of society s resources just as surely as when it burns coal However if the firm pays for coal but not for the use of clean water it is to be expected that management will be economical in its use of coal and wasteful in its use of water In other words when it comes to the environment we do not expect the free market to get it right So what should be done Going all the way back to Paul Samuelson s first edition in 1948 every economics textbook I know of has argued that the government should intervene in the market to discourage activities that damage the environment The usual recommendation is to do so either by charging fees for the right to engage in such nasty activities a k a pollution taxes or by auctioning off rights to pollute Indeed as the extraordinary response to the climate change statement reminds us the idea of pollution taxes is one of those iconic positions like free trade that commands the assent of virtually every card carrying economist Yet while pollution and related negative externalities such as traffic congestion are obvious problems in practice efforts to make markets take environmental costs into account are few and far between So economists who actually believe the things they teach generally support a much more aggressive program of environmental protection than the one we actually have True they tend to oppose detailed regulations that tell people exactly how they must reduce pollution preferring schemes that provide a financial incentive to pollute less but leave the details up to the private sector But I would be hard pressed to think of a single economist not actually employed by an anti environmental lobbying operation who believes that the United States should protect the environment less not more than it currently does The signers of the climate change statement incidentally included 13 economists from the University of Chicago But won t protecting the environment reduce the gross domestic product Not necessarily and anyway so what At first sight it might seem obvious that pollution taxes will reduce GDP After all any tax reduces the incentives to work save and invest Thus a tax on exhaust emissions from cars will induce people to drive cleaner cars or avoid driving altogether But since it will also in effect lower the payoff to earning extra money since you wouldn t end up driving the second car you could buy with that money anyway people will not work as hard as they would have without the tax The result is that taxes on pollution or anything else will other things being equal tend to reduce overall monetary output in the economy which is to say GDP But things need not be equal because there is already a whole lot of taxing and spending going on Even in the United States where the government is smaller than in any other advanced country about a third of GDP passes through its hands So existing taxes already discourage people from engaging in taxable activities like working or investing What this means is that the revenue from any new taxes on pollution could be used to reduce other taxes such as Social Security contributions or the income tax but not of course the capital gains tax While the pollution taxes would discourage some activities that are counted in the GDP the reduction in other taxes would encourage other such activities So measured GDP might well fall very little or even rise Does this constitute an independent argument for taxing pollution quite aside from its environmental payoff Would we want to have say a carbon tax even if we weren t worried about global warming Well there has been an excruciatingly technical argument about this mysteriously known as the double dividend debate the general consensus seems to be no and that on balance pollution taxes would be more likely to reduce GDP slightly than to increase it But so what Gross domestic product is not a measure of the nation s economic well being so declares the textbook as soon as it introduces the concept If getting the price of the environment right means a rise in consumption of nonmarket goods like clean air and leisure time at the expense of marketed consumption so be it Isn t this amazing Not only do thousands of economists agree on something but what they agree on is the warm and cuddly idea that we should do more to protect the environment Can 2 500 economists be wrong Well yes but this time they aren t The Great Green Tax Shift a shift away from taxes on employment and income toward taxes on pollution and other negative externalities has everything going for it It is supported by good science and good economics as well as by good intentions Inevitably then it appears at the moment to be a complete political nonstarter The problem as with many good policy ideas is that the Great Green Tax Shift runs up against the three I s First there is Ignorance Only last year Congress rushed to cut gasoline taxes to offset a temporary price rise Not many voters stopped to ask where the money was coming from So what politician will be foolish enough to take the first step in trying to institute new taxes on all American pollution even with the assurance that other taxes will be lowered at the same time My friends in the administration tell me that the word taxes has been banned even from internal discussions about environmental policy Then there are Interests It is hard to think of a way to limit global warming that will not gradually reduce the number of coal mining jobs As labor market adjustment problems go this is a pretty small one But the coal miners and the energy companies are actively opposed to green taxes while the broader public that would benefit from them is not actively in support Finally there is Ideology It used to be that the big problem in formulating a sensible environmental policy came from the left from people who insisted that since pollution is evil it is immoral to put a price on it These days however the main problem comes from the right from conservatives who unlike most economists really do think that the free market is always right to such an extent that they refuse to believe even the most overwhelming scientific evidence if it seems to suggest a justification for government action So I do not realistically expect the Economists Statement to change the world But then I didn t expect it to go as far as it has Certainly those of us who signed it did the right thing and maybe just maybe we did our bit toward saving the planet
