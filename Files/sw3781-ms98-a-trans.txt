              well i suppose we both have credit cards   umhum yeah they seem to be a part of life     yeah   yeah how do you use them   well i do use them um   umhum   i have a few favorites that i use more than others and uh i try to keep my balances fairly reasonable i i could probably pay them off any month if i wanted to   umhum   um but occasionally they can get out of hand and get higher when when you start using more than a few and uh   umhum   they all can build up   umhum   uh i think theyre handy i just get uh i dont carry a lot of cash with me and uh i hate writing checks   umhum yeah   when you go shopping   umhum   well do you use credit cards   yeah i use a few i um i watched my grandmother go into debt  on them and so ive and then i guess my mother yeah so my mother learned from that and i guess she taught me to be very very careful with them so   umhum your grandmother huh   basically um i just keep them i use them so that i build up a credit rating you know but otherwise um   umhum   i generally and my husband it turns out ive just been married seven months but he has the same habit and we just keep a few you know few of the major ones and then use them once in a while for something but we always pay it off right that month   thats good oh thats thats wonderful   so that way we keep any service charge so that way we keep out of debt and we keep on top of what were spending   well the interest rates in credit cards is so high now compared to what youre savings is bringing its really i guess ridiculous to let them keep building   yeah yeah yeah thats what i feel   but i know some people can get get you know carried away with them and let them get out of hand   so umhum its really easy just to forget you know that you you charged that or charged that i try to keep all my receipts and keep them in someplace where i know that the bills going to come but sometimes i forget and so you know  a bill will come in and ill think oh no i didnt know it was going to be that high but so far ive been able to weve been able to pay it off every time so   umhum um yeah well thats good im looking right now im kind kind of looking for a Visa that has a lower interest rate it seems that some of them have gotten higher   uhhuh   and uh i saw on TV they had a program on uh credit cards and theyre supposed to i dont know if it was Tennessee or Arkansas or some some other state had a Visa card that was the lowest one in the country and i didnt write it down at the time and then i went and looked and to see what my Visa was and i think its eighteen percent or something so   umhum um   think i want to find something that has a lower rate   yeah have you ever used Discover card   no i havent   yeah im not even sure what their interest rate is since i pay it off but you know   is is that the one from Sears   um i think Sears originally put it out but its um its pretty well taken all over the US now i mean uh ive havent found many places that dont take Discover   okay   and theres no annual service fee which is good you know and then um   okay   they also give you they say cash back um like at the end of the year for the amount that i charge i get two dollars back or something but if you use credit cards a lot you probably get more back   uhhuh oh oh they give you money back for using your credit card   yeah basically thats it yeah basically thats it and i think the service charge is pretty low too but im not sure   oh i didnt know that hum well you know Sears was one of the few department stores that never would take any other credit cards   uhhuh   i worked with at Sears for over ten years and uh it was only a Sears card that they would take   uhhuh   until i guess they decided to join the club and come up with their own credit card another credit card that was accepted so   umhum   you know now theyll take the Discover but i still dont know if Sears will take Visa or MasterCard   umhum   but uh i never did apply for a Discover card i just figure with the Visa and   yeah umhum   American Express i probably have an i can do enough damage with those two   yeah i think its best to keep the number down  that you have   umhum yeah ive got some that i you know i havent even used at all uh past few years i probably wouldnt be able to use them   so umhum   but uh i i do like my Dillards i have to admit thats one of my favorite places to shop   uhhuh   and i do do use Dillards probably as more than any of the other department stores   umhum   but   yeah well do you have anything else to say or   well yes no not too much more about credit cards   okay i dont think i do either so well it was good talking to you   okay well good talking to you Beth   okay have a good evening byebye   good luck you too bye
