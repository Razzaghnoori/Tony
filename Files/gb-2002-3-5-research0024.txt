 Background Gene fusion leading to the formation of multidomain proteins is one of the major routes of protein evolution Gene fusions characteristically bring together proteins that function in a concerted manner such as successive enzymes in metabolic pathways enzymes and the domains involved in their regulation or DNA binding domains and ligand binding domains in prokaryotic transcriptional regulators 1 2 3 The selective advantage of domain fusion lies in the increased efficiency of coupling of the corresponding biochemical reaction or signal transduction step 1 and in the tight co regulation of expression of the fused domains In signal transduction systems such as prokaryotic two component regulators and sugar phosphotransferase PTS systems or eukaryotic receptor kinases domain fusion is the main principle of functional design 4 5 6 Furthermore accretion of multiple domains appears to be one of the important routes for increasing functional complexity in the evolution of multicellular eukaryotes 7 8 9 Pairs of distinct genes that are fused in at least one genome have been termed fusion linked 3 A gene fusion is presumably fixed during evolution only when the partners cooperate functionally and by inference a functional link can be predicted to exist between fusion linked genes Recently this simple concept has been used by several groups as a means of systematic prediction of the functions of uncharacterized genes 1 2 3 10 11 In addition to their utility for functional prediction analysis of gene fusions may help in addressing fundamental evolutionary issues Gene fusions often show scattered phyletic patterns appearing in several species from different lineages By investigating the phylogenies of each of the two fusion linked genes it may be possible to determine the evolutionary scenario for the fusion itself A recent study provided evidence that the fission of fused genes occurred during evolution at a rate comparable to that of fusion 12 Here we address another central aspect of the evolution of gene fusions namely do fusions of the same domains in different phylogenetic lineages reflect vertical descent possibly accompanied by multiple lineage specific fission events or independent fusion events or horizontal transfer of the fused gene In other words is a fusion of a given pair of genes extremely rare and once formed is it spread by horizontal gene transfer HGT perhaps also followed by fissions in some lineages Alternatively are independent fusions of the same gene pair in distinct lineages relatively common during evolution Among fusions that are found in at least two of the three primary kingdoms of life Bacteria Archaea and Eukaryota we detected both modes of evolution but horizontal transfer of a fused gene appeared to be more common than independent fusion events or vertical inheritance with multiple fissions Results and discussion To distinguish between a single fusion event followed by HGT and or fission of the fused gene and multiple independent fusion events in distinct organisms we analyzed phylogenetic trees that were constructed separately for each of the fusion linked domains proteins The fusion was split into the individual component domains and phylogenetic trees were built for each of the corresponding orthologous sets from 32 complete microbial genomes Figure 1 and see Materials and methods including both fusion components and products of stand alone genes The topologies of the resulting trees were compared to each other and to the topology of a phylogenetic tree constructed on the basis of a concatenated alignment of ribosomal proteins which was chosen as the hypothetical species tree of the organisms involved 13 If the fusion events either occurred independently of each other or were vertically inherited perhaps followed by fission in some lineages the distribution of the fusion components in the phylogenetic trees for the orthologous clusters to which they belong is expected to mimic the distribution of the species carrying the fusion in the species tree In contrast if the fusion gene has been disseminated by HGT fusion components will form odd clusters different from those in the species tree This could be a straightforward approach to reconstructing the evolutionary history of gene fusions if only the topology of the species trees was well resolved However this is not necessarily the case for bacteria or archaea where relationships between major lineages remain uncertain 14 15 although a recent detailed analysis suggested some higher level evolutionary affinities 13 Because the distinction between the three primary kingdoms is widely recognized 14 16 and is clear in the trees for most protein families 17 trans kingdom horizontal transfers of fused genes can be more reliably detected with the proposed approach Therefore we concentrated on the evolutionary histories of gene fusions that are shared by at least two of the three primary kingdoms As the framework for this analysis we used the database of clusters of orthologous groups COGs of proteins 18 19 which contains sets of orthologous proteins and domains from complete microbial genomes 32 genomes at the time of this analysis see Materials and methods Domain fusions represented in some genomes by stand alone versions of the fusion components are split in the COG database so that each fusion component can be assigned to a different COG Whenever distinct domains of a fusion protein belong to separate COGs the corresponding COGs are said to be fusion linked 3 A search of the COGs database revealed 405 pairs of fusion linked COGs The vast majority 87 of fusion links include fusion present in only one primary kingdom Table 1 Only 52 pairs of fusion linked COGs included fusions represented in two or three kingdoms Table 1 and for reasons discussed above we chose these pairs of COGs for an evolutionary analysis of gene fusions Figure 1shows a genome COG matrix that reveals the phyletic phylogenetic patterns of the presence or absence of the orthologs across the spectrum of the sequenced genomes 18 for each of the 52 pairs of fusion linked COGs containing cross kingdom fusions When assessed against the topology of the tentative species tree based on the concatenated alignments of ribosomal proteins 13 fusions showed a scattered distribution in phyletic patterns depicted by columns in Figure 1 For example the fusion between COG1788 and COG2057 and subunits of acyl CoA acetate CoA transferase is seen in the bacteria Escherichia coli Deinococcus radiodurans and Bacillus halodurans and in the archaea Aeropyrum pernix Thermophilus acidophilum and Halobacterium sp Similarly the fusion between COG1683 and COG3272 uncharacterized conserved domains was found in the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Vibrio cholerae and in the archaeon Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum In each of these cases with the species tree used as a reference the bacteria involved are phylogenetically distant from each other and more so from the archaea and non fused versions of the two domains exist within the same bacterial lineages and in archaea Figure 1 These observations emphasize the central question of this work are the fusions between the same pair of domains in different species independent or are they best explained by HGT Figure 2shows the pair of phylogenetic trees for the fusion linked COGs 1788 and 2057 In both trees the fusion components from E coli and B halodurans YdiF and BH3898 respectively confidently group with the archaeal fusion components to the exclusion of the non fused orthologs This position of the E coli and B halodurans fusion components is unexpected and is in contrast to the placement of the orthologs from other gamma proteobacteria and Gram positive bacteria as well as non fused paralogs from the same species AtoA D and BH2258 2259 respectively within the bacterial cluster These observations strongly suggest that the gene for fused subunits of acyl CoA acetate CoA transferase was disseminated horizontally between E coli B halodurans and archaea The presence of non fused paralogs in both these bacterial species appears to be best compatible with gene transfer from archaea to bacteria In contrast the fusion of the pair of domains from the same COGs seen in D radiodurans seems to be an independent event because in both trees the D radiodurans branch is in the middle of the bacterial cluster Figure 2a 2b Thus the history of this pair of fusion linked COGs appears to involve horizontal transfer of the fused gene between bacteria and archaea and possibly also within kingdoms as well as at least one additional independent fusion event in bacteria Figure 3shows the phylogenetic trees for the two domains of phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine FGAM synthase a purine biosynthesis enzyme The components of this fusion which is found in proteobacteria and eukaryotes form a tight cluster separated by a long internal branch from the non fused bacterial and archaeal orthologs This tree topology suggests HGT between bacteria and eukaryotes possibly a relocation of the fused gene from the pro mitochondrion to the eukaryotic nuclear genome or alternatively gene transfer from eukaryotes to proteobacteria An additional aspect of the evolution of this gene is the apparent acceleration of evolution upon gene fusion which is manifest in the long branch that separates the proteobacterial eukaryotic cluster from the rest of the bacterial and archaeal species Figure 3a 3b The fusion linked COGs 1605 and 0077 chorismate mutase and prephenate dehydratase respectively show a more complicated history with distinct fusion events resulting in different domain architectures see legend to Figure 4 The presence in both trees of two distinct clusters of fusion components and the isolated fusion in Campylobacter jejuni suggest at least three independent fusion events two of which apparently were followed by horizontal dissemination of the fused gene Figure 4a 4b The single archaeal fusion the Arachaeoglobus fulgidus protein AF0227 belongs to one of these clusters and shows a strongly supported affinity with the ortholog from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima Figure 4a 4b Given the broad distribution of this fusion in bacteria horizontal transfer of the bacterial fused gene to archaea is the most likely scenario The pair of fusion linked COGs 0777 and 0825 and subunits of acetyl CoA carboxylase respectively shows unequivocal clustering of the fusion components from numerous archaeal and bacterial species which indicates a prevalent role for HGT in the evolution of this fusion Figure 5a 5b Moreover archaea are scattered among bacteria suggesting multiple HGT events However an apparent independent fusion is seen in Mycobacterium tuberculosis Figure 5a 5b It could be argued that in cases like those in Figure 5 where there is a sharp separation a long strongly supported internal branch in each of the trees between the fusion components and stand alone proteins the COGs involved needed to be reorganized to form one COG consisting of fusion proteins only and two separate COGs consisting of stand alone proteins Formally this would eliminate the need for HGT as an explanation of the tree topology for any of these new COGs However this solution even if attractive from the point of view of classification does not seem to be correct in light of the principle of orthology that underlies the COG system it appears that in both of the COGs involved the fusion components and stand alone proteins are bona fide orthologs as judged by the high level of sequence conservation and by the fact that in the majority of species involved they are the only versions of this key enzyme The results of phylogenetic analyses of the 51 cross kingdom fusion links are summarized in Tables 2and 3and the Additional data In 31 of the 51 links an inter kingdom horizontal transfer of the fused gene appeared to be the evolutionary mechanism by which the fusion entered one of the kingdoms In contrast only 14 fusion linked pairs of COGs show evidence of independent fusion in two kingdoms and in just two cases the fusion seems to have been inherited from the last universal common ancestor The latter two scenarios were distinguished on the basis of the parsimony principle that is by counting the number of evolutionary events fusions or fissions that were required to produce the observed distribution of fusion components and stand alone versions of the domains involved across the tree branches Accordingly it needs to be emphasized that we can only infer the most likely scenario under the assumption that the probabilities of fusion and fission are comparable It cannot be ruled out that some of the scenarios we classify as independent fusions in reality reflect the existence of an ancestral fused gene and subsequent multiple independent fissions The detection of ancestral domain fusions may call for the unification of the respective COG pairs in a single COG with the species in which fission occurred represented by two distinct proteins Examination of the genomic context of the genes that encode stand alone counterparts of the fusion components showed that in 25 of the 51 cases these genes were juxtaposed in some and in certain cases many prokaryotic genomes Table 2 This suggests that evolution of gene fusions often if not always passes through an intermediate stage of juxtaposed and co regulated but still distinct genes within known or predicted operons In addition some of the juxtaposed gene pairs might have evolved by fission of a fused gene The results of the present analysis point to HGT as a major route of cross kingdom dissemination of fused genes Horizontal transfer might be even more prominent in the evolution of fused genes within the bacterial and archaeal kingdoms This notion is supported by the topologies of some of the phylogenetic trees analyzed which show unexpected clustering of bacterial species from different lineages note for example the grouping of D radiodurans with P aeruginosa in Figure 5 Massive HGT between archaea and bacteria particularly hyperthermophiles has been suggested by genome comparisons 20 21 22 23 24 However proving HGT in each individual case is difficult and the significance of cross kingdom HGT has been disputed 25 26 With gene fusions the existence of a derived shared character fusion supporting the clades formed by fusion components and the concordance of the independently built trees for each of the fusion components make a solid case for HGT The apparent independent fusion of the same pair of genes or more precisely members of the same two COGs on multiple occasions during evolution might seem unlikely However we found that one fourth to one third of the gene fusions shared by at least two kingdoms might have evolved through such independent events and probable additional independent fusions were noted among bacteria This could be due to the extensive genome rearrangement characteristic of the evolution of prokaryotes 27 28 and to the selective value of these particular fusions which tend to get fixed once they emerge Materials and methods The version of the COG database used in this study included the following complete
