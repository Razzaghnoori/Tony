 Background The initial publication of two draft versions of the human genome led to intense debate over the exact number of genes in the human genome 1 2 Current estimates suggest that the human genome encodes approximately 35 000 to 38 000 although the final number must await the complete annotation of each genome sequence The search for additional genes not discovered during early annotation attempts has involved the use of several different approaches These have included the sequencing of randomly selected cDNAs from various tissue sources the development of computer based prediction programs of ever increasing accuracy and the direct comparison between the human genome and the genome sequences of other vertebrates and invertebrates 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Using these approaches fully annotated genomes of numerous species will be available within a relatively short time We approached the problem of gene identification by using a combination of experimental and in silico techniques Specifically we initiated a project designed to sequence expressed sequence tags from the hamster testis and used these sequences to identify unannotated or incompletely annotated genes in the human and other vertebrate genomes The hamster has not been used extensively in genomics research however it has been used extensively in various areas of investigation including circadian rhythm research 10 and also in investigations in a number of areas of research in reproductive biology For example the study of hamster gametes has revealed significant information concerning the mechanisms underlying species specific sperm egg interactions 11 12 13 and the deleterious effects of endocrine disruptors on male and female reproductive development 14 15 16 17 The hamster mouse and rat are all members of the family Muridae however both mice and rats belong to the subfamily Murinae while hamsters belong to the subfamily Cricetinae Three hamster species that are commonly used in research are Mesocricetus auratus Syrian golden hamster Cricetulus griseus Chinese hamster and Phodopus sungorus Siberian hamster Therefore sequence information from any hamster species should complement information gained from other closely related species The testis was chosen for these studies as it represents a viable source for the identification of novel genes The adult testis is a complex organ consisting of numerous different somatic cell types as well as germ cells at all stages of spermatogenesis from the gonocyte stem cells to the mature sperm cells 18 Consequently several unique gene populations including those involved in the regulation of meiosis as well as those specific to the various testicular cell types are expressed in the testis A recent gene discovery study performed in the testis of Drosophila melanogaster found that 47 of greater than 1500 sequenced cDNAs did not match to ESTs previously identified in this organism 19 Likewise the testis of the cynomolgus monkey has yielded several novel gene sequences 8 9 Therefore we reasoned that the sequencing of ESTs from hamster testis might reveal the existence of novel genes conserved in other species that may function in controlling testicular development and or function In this report we describe our initial results from the sequencing of randomly selected cDNAs from the testes of male Syrian golden hamsters In particular we identified eight cDNAs that appear to be derived from genes that were not previously annotated in the human genome We describe the detailed analysis of two of these genes which encode a new member of the kinesin superfamily of microtubule based molecular motors and a protein likely to be involved in chromatin remodeling Results Generation and sequence analysis of a Hamster testis cDNA library Random clones from a hamster testis cDNA library were selected and sequenced as described in materials and methods The sequences were screened to remove ribosomal RNA and vector sequences which yielded 735 distinct sequences The sequence of each clone was compared to sequences in public databases to identify its closest match Each sequence was then assigned to a functional group based on this comparison Table 1 The genes were distributed amongst all of the functional groups listed with the highest numbers in groups associated with protein synthesis and degradation 11 metabolism 6 gene regulation and RNA processing 8 and intracellular signaling 5 Overall the data set contains examples of numerous testis specific genes as well as genes that display less limited patterns of expression We next considered the overall complexity of the sequences in our database as our cloning strategy made it possible to obtain multiple fragments from the same cDNA We identified only 40 instances where more than one fragment was derived from the same gene data not shown In addition only 17 fragments appeared more than two times in the database and only 6 fragments appeared more than three times The most common sequences were derived from genes that are known to be highly expressed in the testis in other organisms and include heat shock protein 90A 20 chitobiase 21 outer dense fiber of sperm tails 22 and kinectin 23 Therefore the majority of sequences were represented only once or at most two times in the data set The fact that most sequences were not identified multiple times suggests that we have not exhaustively sequenced all of the DpnII fragments from cDNAs expressed in the hamster testis This is not surprising as conservative estimates suggest that there are many thousands of unique transcripts expressed in the various somatic and germ cell lineages in the testis The largest group of sequences identified in this project falls into the functionally unclassified group Table 1 This group includes a small number of named genes for which no function has yet been assigned but primarily contains the results of full length cDNA sequencing projects or genes predicted by gene finding software Approximately one third of these clones 78 out of 239 were originally isolated from testis libraries suggesting that a large number of genes remain to be functionally characterized in the testis Identification of novel testis specific genes 1030 A new member of the kinesin superfamily The 1030 clone contained an ORF of 80 amino acids that displayed similarity to members of the kinesin superfamily of molecular motors 25 26 Northern analysis using the hamster 1030 probe detected a single band in testis RNA and weak signals in several other tissues including brain heart and lung figure 1 Comparison of the hamster nucleotide sequence with genomic sequences revealed highly significant matches within chromosomal positions 9q21 33 in human 13B2 in mouse and 17 in rat Partial cDNAs from human and macaque also mapped to the same genetic locus Table 2 Using the procedures described in materials and methods we mapped an 18 exon gene that was followed by a consensus polyadenylation signal in the human mouse and rat genome sequences figure 3A Exon 1 is located within a strong CpG island indicating the likely presence of a promoter in this region PCR cloning of the human cDNA was employed to confirm the exonic structure predicted by the genomic sequences These studies revealed the existence of three alternatively spliced products one containing all 17 coding exons exon 1 is non coding and two variants lacking either exon 11 or exons 12 and 13 figures 3Band 3C Conceptual translation of the predicted full length human mRNA revealed a 1401 amino acid protein that is highly conserved in macaque mouse and rat figures 2and 4 Database searches revealed that it encodes a previously unreported member of the kinesin superfamily The kinesin superfamily in humans and mice is comprised of at least 45 members designated with the prefix KIF 26 Based on this naming system we have assigned the name KIF27 to this new family member with the suffixes A B and C to designate the splice variants described above figure 3B Domain mapping within KIF27 revealed an amino terminal kinesin motor domain and a putative topisomerase domain located in the center of the protein figure 2and 3B Phylogenic analysis revealed that KIF27 belongs to the N 5 phylogenic group of KIFs 26 which includes mouse KIF21A and 21B and human KIF4 a group also known as the chromokinesins Comparisons with the other members of the N 5 subgroup revealed greatest similarity within the motor domain 47 50 identity figure 5 In addition the sequence of the neck domain of KIF27 located at the C terminal end of the motor domain conformed to the consensus sequence for the neck domain of chromokinesins figure 3B 27 7012 This clone contained an ORF of 73 amino acids that detected a strong signal by Northern blotting in testis RNA figure 1 Genome analysis permitted the mapping of a common set of 10 exons on human mouse and rat chromosomes 5 15 and 2 respectively Table 2 assembly of which resulted in translation products of 579 555 and 563 amino acids respectively figure 6 These predictions were also corroborated by a macaque cDNA AB070167 The encoded proteins did not contain any recognizable functional motifs figure 3 and were most similar to an uncharacterized human protein named B29 figure 2 B29 was originally identified as a gene located on human chromosome 18q21 in a search for candidate tumor suppressor proteins in lung 28 However the function of B29 is unknown and it does not contain any obvious functional domains Interestingly the apparent size of the detected mRNA is significantly larger than that of the assembled sequences suggesting that additional exons are likely to remain to be discovered In this regard gene prediction software identified an additional 35 exons in the mouse genomic sequence that were partly conserved in the rat but not present in the human sequence Final mapping of the genomic structure of 7012 will await further refineme nt of each genomic sequence 9004 This clone encoded an ORF of 87 amino acids that did not display significant similarity to any known proteins in public databases Northern blotting revealed a specific signal in hamster testis RNA figure 1 The clone sequence mapped to human chromosome 1p13 3 mouse chromosome 3F3 and rat chromosome 2 Table 2 Human and macaque cDNAs have recently appeared in the database that encompass this clone and the sequences of their encoded proteins are compared in figure 7 These polypeptides contain a predicted coiled coil region figure 2 but do not contain other functional domains that might indicate their possible function s 13043 This clone encodes an ORF of 56 amino acids that did not display significant similarity to known proteins Northern blotting revealed a strong signal in testis figure 1 Genome comparisons revealed matches on human chromosome 3 mouse chromosome 16 and rat chromosome 11 Table 2 Human mouse and rat coding sequences were assembled using a macaque cDNA AB070087 as template figure 8 Domain mapping identified several conserved transmembrane domains in each protein as well as a putative cyclic nucleotide binding site close to the C terminus figure 2 In addition a putative cation channel was identified in the center of the protein Further analysis will be necessary to determine whether this protein functions as a regulatable cation channel 15014 This clone encodes an ORF of 67 amino acids whose mRNA was specifically detected in hamster testis RNA figure 1 Genome comparisons revealed strong similarities with regions of human chromosome 11 mouse chromosome 9 and rat chromosome 8 Table 2 This clone matches to hypothetical proteins recently added to the annotation of the human and mouse genomes FLJ13386 and XP_134746 as well as a protein encoded by a macaque cDNA BAB63125 The alignment in figure 9accounts for each of these clones as well as additional exons predicted in the mouse from inter genome comparisons The encoded protein contains several predicted coiled coil regions but no other identifiable functional domains figure 2 15018 This clone encodes an ORF of 47 amino acids that detected a specific signal in hamster testis RNA figure 1 It mapped to a predic ted 20 exon gene on human chromosome 4 with orthologous but incomplete sequences on mouse chromosome 3 and rat chromosome 2 Table 2 An orthologous protein has recently been reported from rat and named sodium channel associated protein 1A SCAP1A Alignment of the human and rat proteins is shown in figure 10 Although the specific function of this protein is currently unknown it contains a potential V type ATPase domain as well as several predicted coiled coil regions figure 2 15037 This clone encodes an ORF of 59 amino acids that was detected specifically in hamster testis figure 1 It mapped to specific regions on chromosomes 10 19 and 1 in human mouse and rat respectively A comparison of the predicted human protein based on several partial human cDNAs and a mouse protein named oocyte testis gene 1 Otg1 is shown in figure 11 The protein sequence is predicted to contain several coiled coil regions but no other potential functional domains figure 2 19045 This clone detected two distinct transcripts in testis brain and heart by Northern blotting figure 1 The sequence mapped to regions on chromosomes 1 1 and 13 in human mouse and rat respectively and we have assembled the orthologous sequences from human mouse rat and Fugu figure 12 The protein is 433 amino acids in length in human mouse and rat 434 in Fugu and contains two recognizable functional domains characteristic of proteins with chromatin remodeling activity figure 2 The first is an interrupted SET S u var 3 9 E z trithorax domain 29 and the second is a MYND m yeloid transcription factor n ervy D EAF 1 domain 30 A similar domain organization is also found in the BOP CD8 b op posite recently renamed the SET and MYND domain protein SMYD family of proteins and alignment of the human protein identified here with SMYD1 BOP1 from mouse and chicken is shown in figure 13 The SMYD1 proteins are transcriptional regulatory proteins with chromatin remodeling activities important in cardiac tissue muscle and T lymphocytes 31 32 33 Therefore the new protein identified in this report is likely to play as yet undefined roles in transcription and has been assigned the official name SMYD2 to designate its relatedness to SMYD1 Discussion KIF27 a new kinesin family member Our studies revealed the existence of a new member of the kinesin superfamily of microtubule based molecular motors which we have named KIF27 KIF27 RNA was detected primarily in hamster testis but weaker signals were also present in several other tissues suggesting that this protein may function in numerous cell types Significant characteristics of the KIF27 genes mapped in human mouse and rat included a conserved 18 exon arrangement and the existence of at least three mRNAs that resulted from alternative splicing at least in human Although partial cDNAs existed for the human and macaque genes in public databases we were able to construct full length cDNA sequences for human mouse and rat from genomic comparisons and to assemble a corresponding sequence from macaque by joining two previously reported cDNAs Kinesins are characterized by a conserved motor domain of approximately 350 amino acids that may be located at the amino terminus KIN N carboxy terminus KIN C or within the polypeptide KIN I 27 and the motor domain of KIF27 is located in the N terminus of the protein Based on this arrangement and the sequence of the adjacent neck domain we assigned KIF27 to the N 5 phyogenetic group of kinesins 27 The N 5 subgroup is defined by the human KIF4 protein which is primarily localized to the nuclear matrix and associates with chromosomes during mitosis 35 In cell division nuclear kinesins of this chromokinesin class appear to be important for the maintenance of sister chromatids on the metaphase plate 36 However additional functions for nuclear kinesins have recently been uncovered For example KIF17a a member of the N 4 subgroup that is predominantly expressed in germ cells was recently shown to possess transcriptional regulatory properties by controlling access of the transcriptional activator protein CREM to a coactivator ACT 37 Clearly functional analysis of the KIF27 polypeptide will be needed to determine the subcellular location of this protein to determine whether it may add to the growing number of kinesins that function in the nucleus In this regard although the carboxy terminal regions of KIF27 and KIF4 display little significant sequence similarity both contain a putative topoisomerase domain that may be important for nuclear functions figure 2 In addition several clusters of basic amino acids that may function as nuclear localization signals are located in the KIF27 polypeptide SMYD2 a putative chromatin remodeling protein The final clone isolated in our search encodes a 433 amino acid protein whose sequence was highly conserved from human to pufferfish This protein now named SMYD2 contains SET and MYND domains that are characteristic of proteins with chromatin remodeling capabilities The SET domain is a common feature of proteins with histone lysine methyl transferase HKMT activity and has been identified in hundreds of proteins in organisms ranging from bacteria and viruses to humans 38 The SMYD2 SET domain is separated into two parts i e a S ET domain and is followed by a short cyteine rich region that is common in many SET domain proteins figures 2and 12 The MYND domain is located between the two halves of the SET domain and similar domains have been identified in a number of proteins that function as transcriptional repressors including the ETO protein that is fused to the AML 1 transcription factor in the t 8 21 translocation in acute myeloid leukemias 39 The MYND contains two zinc finger motifs and is a protein protein interaction interface responsible for the recruitment of corepressors 39 40 41 This domain organization is conserved in several proteins in public databases including the recently described SMYD1 aka BOP family of proteins 31 Three isoforms of SMYD1 have been reported thus far referred to by their original names m BOP1 m BOP2 and t BOP that are products of a single gene that result from either alternative splicing or promoter usage 31 32 33 m BOP is essential for cardiac differentiation and morphogenesis while t BOP is expressed in cytotoxic T lymphoctes Studies are currently underway to examine the function s of SMYD2 in testis and heart Genomic studies in the hamster The impetus for this study arose from the need to perform microarray experiments to investigate the molecular changes elicited by environmental toxicants on male reproduction function in hamster Comparisons performed between the limited numbers of hamster sequences in public databases with ortho logous sequences from the mouse suggested that despite the close taxonomic relationship between hamster and mouse evolutionary divergence in coding sequences was sufficiently great in certain cases that reagents developed for the mouse would be of limited use for genomic studies in the hamster This conclusion was supported by experimental observations in our laboratories indicating that probes derived from rat and mouse cDNAs yield inconsistent results in Northern blotting under stringent hybridization conditions data not shown The reagents described here will now permit the initiation of genomic studies in the hamster Methods RNA cDNA and plasmid preparation Total RNA was prepared from testes of adult Syrian golden hamsters Mesocricetus auratus Poly A RNA was isolated using the poly A Spin mRNA isolation kit New England Biolabs Beverly MA 5 g of polyA RNA was converted to double stranded cDNA using the cDNA Synthesis Kit Life Technologies Gaithersburg MD The cDNA was then digested to completion with DpnII and electrophoresed on a 1 5 agarose gel Five populations of digested cDNAs in size ranges between 100 and 800 bp were excised from the gel and purified using Qiaex II resin Qiagen Valencia CA Each population of cDNA was ligated into a pBluescript vector that had been digested with BamHI and alkaline phosphatased to decrease the rate of self ligation The ligations were transformed into DH5 supercompetent cells Life Technologies and positive clones were identified by blue white selection The success of the cloning procedure was initially monitored by picking 5 clones from each group preparing plasmid DNA and sequencing These preliminary studies indicated that the most useful clone sets were those derived from cDNAs in the 100 300 bp range White colonies from these two sets were carefully picked and used to inoculate single cells of a 96 well culture block with each well containing 1 2 ml of TB 1 2 Tryptone 2 4 yeast extract 0 4 glycerol supplemented with 50 g ml carbenecillin The bacteria were grown for 20 hours at 37 C and glycerol stocks were subsequently prepared using a Biomek 3000 robot Beckman Coulter Inc Fullerton CA Fresh cultures in 1 ml of 2X LB 2 Tryptone 1 yeast extract 1 NaCl plus 50 g ml carbenecillin were inoculated from the glycerol stocks using a 96 well needle transfer device and grown as before Plasmid DNA was prepared using the full lysate protocol of the Montage Plasmid Miniprep96 Kit Millipore Bedford MA Typical yields of plasmid DNA ranged from 5 10 g in 50 l volume Sequencing Plasmid DNA was diluted four fold in water and 2 l of the diluted sample was sequenced in 96 well format using the Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit Beckman Coulter Inc The reactions were cleaned up by an ethanol precipitation step in which 35 l of 10 mg ml glycogen 70 l of 0 5 M EDTA 70 l of 1 5 M Sodium Acetate pH 4 8 was first mixed with the sequencing reaction 6 6 l 20 l of 95 ethanol was added and the plate was centrifuged at 4 000 rpm for 45 minutes The pellets were washed twice with 100 l of 70 ethanol air dried and dissolved in 25 l of molecular biology grade formamide A drop of mineral oil was overlaid on each reaction and these were then run on a CEQ2000 capillary array sequencer Beckman Coulter Inc Sequence analysis Raw sequence data was first imported into the Contig Express component of the Vector NTI suite of sequence analysis programs InforMax Inc Bethesda MD Each clone was named according to its position in the original 96 well plate for example clone 1030 came from position 30 in plate 1 Vector sequences were first scanned in batch mode for the presence of vector derived sequences using Contig Express and these sequences were trimmed before proceeding In some cases manual processing of the sequences was necessary using the VecScreen program at the National Canter for Biotechnology Information NCBI http www ncbi nlm nih gov VecScreen VecScreen html The presence of DpnII sites at either end of the clone simplified the removal of vector sequences The sequences were concatenated in batches of 96 into a text file using FASTA format and submitted for a batch BLASTN search using the interface program BLASTCL3 This search returned the three top matches into an output file No further analysis was performed in those cases where a match with a known gene was clearly established and the clone was annotated as the hamster orthologue of a known gene A series of additional comparisons were performed if a clear relationship between a hamster clone and known sequence was not established by this initial search The most useful additional comparison was a BLASTX search which compares the translated sequence of the input clone in all six frames to the peptide sequences in GenBank This search clarified the identity of several additional hamster clones 200 clones did not match to known sequences and were analyzed to determine whether they might represent potentially novel genes First the output sequences were translated in all frames to determine whether a complete open reading frame ORF was present If so the clones were resequenced on both strands to ensure that the sequence was correct Promising sequences were compared to the public version of the annotated human sequence v 9 30a 1 at Ensembl http www ensembl orgto find matches with human chromosomal sequences Further comparisons were performed against the mouse v 9 3a 1 rat v 9 1 1 zebrafish v 9 08 1 pufferfish v 9 1 1 and mosquito v 9 1a 1 genome sequence in the same database When matching genomic loci were identified approximately 100 000 bp of genome sequence surrounding the match was imported into Vector NTI and submitted to gene prediction software programs to determine if the hamster sequences were located within exons of predicted genes Two gene prediction programs were used FGENESH http www softberry com berry phtmland GENEMARK http opal biology gatech edu GeneMark eukhmm cgi org H sapiens Predicted cDNA sequences were then assembled into contiguous files and subjected to further comparisons against cDNA and EST databases at NCBI Genome structures were further examined using PipMaker a program that supports comparisons of large DNA fragments and identifies short conserved regions of similarity such as exons The predicted protein sequences of the derived cDNAs were analyzed for the presence of functional domains using the conserved domain function of BLAST at NCBI as well as the Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool at http smart embl heidelberg de Protein structures were annotated in Vector NTI and published in Canvas v7 0 Deneba Systems Inc Miami FL Sequences were submitted to the appropriate databases at the National Center for Biotechnology Information NCBI Specifically EST sequences were submitted to dbEST under accession numbers BI431001 BI431008 and CB884447 CB885166 Human KIF27 sequences were submitted to Genbank under accession numbers AY237536 AY237538 Sequences defined by annotation of previously available sequences were submitted to the Third Party Annotation database under accession numbers BK001053 BK001057 and BK001326 BK001332 The Human Genome Organization HUGO nomenclature committee has approved proposed gene names Northern analysis Total RNA was purified from various hamster tissues using TriZol reagent Life Technologies Inc 20 g of each RNA was electrophoresed through a 1 agarose formaldehyde gel and transferred to a Nylon membrane Micron Separations Westborough MA The RNA was cross linked to the membrane by exposure to UV light and hybridized with specific probes labeled with 32P dCTP Perkin Elmer Life Sciences Boston MA using the Prime It random prime labeling kit Stratagene La Jolla CA The hybridization procedure was performed as described before 42 Several duplicate membranes were prepared and the radioactive probe was stripped after each round of hybridization by boiling for 10 minutes in 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7 5 1 mM EDTA 1 SDS The specific probes were prepared by digesting the appropriate pBluescript plasmid with XbaI and EcoRI separating the fragment on a 1 5 agarose gel followed by extraction using the Qiaex II extraction kit Qiagen PCR cloning of human KIF27 cDNAs PCR primers based on the predicted human
