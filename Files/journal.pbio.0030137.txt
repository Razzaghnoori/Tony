 Jakob von Uexk ll coined the term Umwelt to describe the subjective world of animals The world that animals perceive is not an objective veridical representation of the physical world he argued but is instead a product of the particular sense organs that each species has acquired in its evolutionary history 1 Many animals have sensory abilities that humans don t such as a magnetic compass sense in birds 2 or sensitivity to electric fields in fish 3 But even within sensory modalities shared by many animals such as vision hearing and olfaction there are strong differences between species For example bees but not humans can see UV light 4 5 and smell carbon dioxide 6 and bats can hear ultrasound 7 But what exactly is the structure of the perceptual worlds proposed by von Uexk ll Can we draw them on paper in the form of maps allowing us to visualize a particular animal s subjective view of the world Will such maps allow us to predict the similarity of two stimuli e g two colors or two scents by inspecting the distance between the loci they produce in a perceptual space Does understanding the metrics of such maps help us predict how stimulus mixtures will be perceived Even though perceptual sensations may strike us as ethereal they must be based on patterns of activity in neuronal hardware thus we need to look into the brains of animals to see how the neuronal circuitry processes the information from the sense organs The study by Guerrieri et al 8 on odor space in honeybees in this issue is an excellent example of how behavioral studies can be paired with neurobiological data to access the perceptual space of an animal Here we contrast the complexity of scent perception with two examples of simpler perceptual worlds vertebrate frequency perception and bee color vision The Perception of Pitch in the Auditory System Sound is a mechanical vibration whose most defining characteristic is neatly arranged along one dimension frequency of waves with alternating high and low pressure The mechanical structure of our inner ear tidily maps the frequency of sound onto different positions of the basilar membrane in the snail shaped cochlea 9 The width and flexibility of this membrane increases with distance from the oval window the point of entry of sound The result is that when the frequency of sound is high it will produce a peak of vibration near the oval window Figure 1A if the frequency is low the peak of vibration will be nearer the far apical end of the cochlea 10 In this sense the cochlea processes sound similarly to how a prism acts on white light 11 it decomposes mixtures of sound frequencies into their components and maps them onto different spatial positions within the cochlea The thousands of mechanoreceptors distributed along the basilar membrane need not be tuned to different frequencies as in color vision where each receptor type responds most strongly in a particular wavelength range It is the mechanoreceptors position in the cochlea that determines which sound frequency will maximally stimulate them 10 12 This structure is maintained on a higher processing level fibers in the auditory cranial nerve send the information from the receptor cells to the brain in parallel i e in a first approximation each receptor cell has its own neuronal cable to the cochlear nuclei and beyond to the auditory cortex where we find a complete topographical map of the audible frequency spectrum Figure 1B mirroring the mapping of frequencies in the cochlea 11 13 14 The perception of pitch then is arranged along one dimension as on a piano keyboard Because of the parallel processing of receptor information from the cochlea we can hear mixtures of different frequencies and analyze their components accurately unless mixtures are very complex We can identify the tones that a chord is made up of 15 There are of course cases where mixtures have unique properties e g in the case of the intensities of harmonic overtones integer multiples of the fundamental frequency that distinguish a C tone produced by a guitar from that of a flute but we can still identify the fundamental whose perceived pitch is not altered by the overtones We would never perceive a mixture of 400 Hz and 800 Hz as an intermediate frequency e g 600 Hz Color Perception in Bees While these observations are seemingly trivial in the world of sound the perception of mixtures in color vision is fundamentally different If we mix yellow with red light we will see orange not only will we not be able to tell that the orange light has been produced by mixing two lights but we will also be unable to distinguish the mixture from monochromatic orange light 16 Similar mixture phenomena are well established in bees for example orange light with a wavelength of 590 nm can be mixed with blue light 440 nm to produce a mixture that is indistinguishable from monochromatic bluegreen light 490 nm 17 18 In bees as in humans the perception of hues is arranged in a circular fashion around achromatic white or gray 19 In this circular arrangement complementary colors i e those opposite on a circle can be additively mixed to generate a neutral stimulus e g UV light 350 nm mixed in the appropriate ratio with bluegreen light 490 nm will be perceived as white by bees 17 In the auditory system mixing only two frequencies to produce the perception of white noise is inconceivable Finally the circular arrangement of hues also implies that it is possible to mix two ends of the perceptible spectrum to produce a sensation that is not contained in the spectrum for humans mixing violet with red light will produce purple a sensation that has no equivalent in the visual spectrum a similar unique percept can be produced by facing bees with a mixture of UV and green light 5 17 We and other animals can only ever see one color in a point additive color mixtures are perceived as intermediates of their generative sources and it is not possible to identify the physical components of a mixture e g the perception of white can be generated mixing any two complementary colors In contrast we can hear several frequencies at once and identify the components of at least simple stimulus mixtures such as triads 15 In color vision but not in hearing multiple combinations of physical stimuli will generate identical sensations The reasons for these fundamental differences between the visual and the auditory sensory modalities can be attributed in a straightforward way to the structure of the sense organs as well as post receptor neural circuits In color vision there aren t thousands of receptor cells each responsible for receiving a narrow range of wavelengths as there are in the auditory system with its technique of frequency analysis Instead both humans and bees have only three color receptor types each sensitive to a broad range of wavelengths Figure 2A Human color receptors are typically termed blue green and red receptors while those in bees are most sensitive to UV blue and green light 5 20 A single receptor cannot analyze the wavelength of the light it receives it simply acts as a quantum counter but the information about the wavelength identity of the quantum is lost on absorption Any single photoreceptor might respond equally to a medium intensity light in the wavelength range of its peak sensitivity and to a strong intensity light at the periphery of its sensitive range hence it cannot disentangle wavelength from intensity 5 This means that the visual system has to compare the signals from receptors differing in spectral sensitivity In insects as well as in vertebrates it does this by means of color opponent neurons Figure 2A 18 21 22 The minimum equipment for an animal with two color receptor types is one type of opponent neuron receiving antagonistic inputs from the two types of cells Using such an opponent mechanism the visual system can tell whether there is a stronger signal from the short wavelength receptor or the long wavelength receptor hence it can extract information about stimulus spectral quality Theoretically an animal with n color receptor types needs n minus 1 chromatic opponent mechanisms 23 Indeed behavioral experiments with bees have shown that only two color opponent mechanisms are necessary to explain color discrimination data 18 24 It is not clear which ones these are physiologists have found at least seven different types of color opponent neurons in the bee optic lobes 5 18 21 and modeling has shown that almost any combination of two color opponent neuron types is adequate for color coding 24 Nevertheless the two dimensional color opponent space whose axes correspond to excitation patterns of color opponent mechanisms Figure 2B has proven extremely useful distances in such a color space correlate well with behavioral color discrimination data The color opponent space allows us to predict hue by assessing angular position and saturation by measuring distance from the center and it can be used to predict the perception of color mixtures which fall between the loci of the colors used to generate the mixture 5 Because information about the actual receptor signals is discarded in the very periphery of the sensory system perception is only based on derived color opponency dimensions which measure differences in receptor signals rather than absolute signals Olfactory Perceptual Space in Bees Making sense of scents is a considerably messier affair Odors are hardly presentable on a physical continuum like the wavelength of light they are multidimensional entities that can vary from small gaseous molecules to long chained hydrocarbons 25 26 Organic compounds vary in carbon chain length and functional group i e the group of atoms that give substances their characteristic properties e g alcohols aldehydes ketones or alkanes At any moment the air around an animal may contain hundreds of different airborne substances which fluctuate with wind humidity and multiple other factors 25 On the receptor level the olfactory system shows a complexity that is unparalleled in any color vision system the receptor family discovered by 2004 s Nobel laureates L Buck and R Axel comprises about 1 000 receptor proteins in mammals each of which only binds a narrow range of airborne molecules 27 28 Only one of these proteins is expressed per receptor cell so that there are indeed about 1 000 different odor receptor cell types in the mammalian olfactory epithelium 29 In insects the diversity of such receptors is lower but still impressive fruit flies appear to have 65 different odorant receptor genes 30 In honeybees the number of such genes will be accessible pending the publication of the honeybee genome so far screens by H Robertson pers comm indicate a number 130 Some 60 000 olfactory receptor cells of a few dozen different types are distributed along the honeybee antennae 31 Figure 3A How can the brain extract biologically useful information from such multidimensional sensory input The first neuronal center of olfactory information processing the antennal lobe or its mammalian analogue the olfactory bulb achieves order in two ways First axons from like receptor cells i e those that express the same receptor protein and therefore bind the same odorants project to one or a few glomeruli i e globular anatomically distinct subunits within the antennal lobe 26 The number of glomeruli ranges from a few dozen to several hundred and corresponds roughly to the number of putative olfactory receptor types 25 The honeybee s antennal lobe contains 160 glomeruli 31 Individual chemicals reliably activate sets of identified glomeruli 32 These micro relays sum up the input from same chemoreceptors tremendously increasing the signal to noise ratio and thus facilitating reliable odorant detection 26 A second and perhaps more remarkable feature of the antennal lobe is that glomeruli coding for similar substances are located close together while those that code for distinct scents are spatially segregated 29 32 33 34 Carbon chain length for example is neatly represented in this glomerular map 32 How the brain achieves such chemical mapping is something of a miracle how would the developing brain know which axons belong to receptors that respond to chemically similar substances so that these can be wired to neighboring glomeruli In mammals it was recently found that the receptor proteins that bind odor molecules are also expressed in the axon terminals of the receptor cells 29 If we assume that similar receptor molecules bind similar odorants then the developing nervous system could use receptor molecule similarity in the receptor cells axon terminals to wire up the neural map in the antennal lobe But does this neuronal activity map indeed correspond to the olfactory perceptual space Theoretically a perceptual space might have as many dimensions as there are distinct receptor types or it might have as many axes as there are glomeruli with distinct response profiles Is it possible that olfactory space in bees then has several dozen dimensions To evaluate the structure of olfactory perceptual space Guerrieri et al 8 trained honeybees to memorize a wide variety of odors and then tested how well bees could distinguish these odors from others They then asked how many axes must the olfactory perceptual space have so that distances between odors can be used to predict how similar they will appear to bees They found that the multidimensional receptor space might be collapsed onto very few perceptual axes much of the similarity judgments between odors can be explained by a three dimensional space Figure 3B The most important axis spreads out scents according to carbon chain length whereas the other two axes separate the odors according to functional group i e they separate primary and secondary alcohols aldehydes and ketones Distances between odor loci in this three dimensional space correlate well with the discriminability of the odors to bees They also correspond to the similarity of activation patterns of the glomerular map 32 although the actual mechanisms that evaluate this similarity remain to be identified There are a number of complications however that indicate that the olfactory perceptual space is unlikely to submit to the relatively simple rules of perception of color and pitch Take mixtures of different stimuli for example If odor perception followed rules similar to those of color perception and if it relied exclusively on derived parameters such as carbon chain length then mixtures would be perceived as intermediates of their components A mixture of two molecules differing only in carbon chain length would be perceived as indistinguishable from a single odorant with an intermediate carbon chain length This remains to be tested but we conjecture that this is unlikely to be the case On the other hand are odor mixtures simply perceived as a compound entity with distinct components like a triad in vertebrate pitch perception or are mixtures unique entities that are perceived as fundamentally different from their elements like white in color perception Honeybees appear to employ a combination of the two they can perceive the components of a mixture and generalize to these components when faced with them individually but also attach unique properties to the mixture 31 35 A further complication is that Guerrieri et al 8 found intriguing asymmetries in the bees assessments of odor similarities bees respond as if they find odor A more similar to trained odor B than they find B to trained odor A It will be difficult to represent these complex phenomena in a simple map These phenomena indicate that odor perception cannot be as easily visualized in a low dimensionality space as other sensory modalities However for psychophysicists just as for motorists navigating novel territory even a rough guidance map is better than no map and so this olfactory space is undoubtedly a useful tool to predict the bee subjective similarity of scents While the antennal lobe clearly structures the sensory input so as to extract derived chemical properties the information about the input from individual receptor types might not be discounted in the periphery of the nervous system as in visual perception but relayed on to higher processing centers such as the mushroom bodies and the protocerebrum 36 37 If both modulated and unmodulated sensory information is available to the neuronal centers that ultimately decide on odor similarity and especially if different individuals attend differently to different kinds of input e g because experience modifies interactions between glomeruli 31 then the derivation of a static perception space that can be applied to all individuals of a species may be quite challenging Conclusion Philosophers have correctly pointed out that we cannot actually imagine what it is like to perceive the world through other animals sense organs 38 But studies such as those by Guerrieri et al 8 show elegantly how to attach scales and numbers to the inner worlds proposed by von Uexk ll a century ago Mapping these worlds quantitatively will allow us to compare them between related species operating in different environments to see how the architecture of perceptual spaces is adapted to mirror biologically useful information from the real world in each species 39 One of the most exciting future directions is to explore the extent to which such perceptual worlds are not just species specific but in fact individual specific In the honeybee learning alters the response patterns of the glomerular map 40 If the antennal lobe has a dual function in creating the primary dimensions of olfactory perception and storing olfactory memories then one prediction is that individual experience will alter perception Similar phenomena have been predicted in other sensory modalities 19 41 but remain to be shown directly by exposing different individuals to different environments during development
