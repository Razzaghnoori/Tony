 Robert Reich Quote Doctor Locked in the Cabinet Robert Reich s new memoir of his years as labor secretary in the Clinton administration is an engaging policy memoir insightful often witty and what s most unusual for wonk kiss and tells easy to read partly because it s told in long stretches of well written dialogue that add up to scores of novelistic scenes of Washington at work The book reads like good fiction Unfortunately some of it is Call me old fashioned but I ve always believed that there is something special about quotation marks Whatever is between them in nonfiction is supposed to reflect accurately words that some real person actually said Now accurately leaves room for quibbling and a memoir will be understood by most readers to be offered on an as remembered basis Reich says in his prefatory note that he jotted notes to himself usually late at night and then consolidated them to make the book People know that Reich is not a reporter and will adjust their expectations accordingly Fair enough Maybe he has a good memory Certainly from a former Cabinet officer however one would expect if not word for word accuracy at least some checking of his memory especially when public documents are available Suspicions mount as Reich spins out page after page of crisp conversation especially when the same remark issues from two different mouths as happens on pages 122 and 129 Again and again Reich offers zippy dramatic dialogues culminating in pithy and revealing quotes For instance he has Robert Michel R Ill who was House minority leader at the time telling him this about Newt Gingrich and friends They talk as if they re interested in ideas in what s good for America But don t be fooled They re out to destroy They ll try to destroy anything that gets in their way using whatever tactics are available Reich may believe Michel said this but Michel says he knows otherwise That s not my quote no he says Michel says he probably complained about the decline of comity and bipartisanship But I would never say that that they re out to destroy I d never say anything like it Reich says that on March 18 1993 Democratic Rep Martin Olav Sabo of Minnesota House Budget Committee chairman told him this about congressional Democrats We re owned by them Business That s where the campaign money comes from now But Sabo says that he could not have spoken with Reich on March 18 they did talk on March 2 and that in any case he neither said nor believes that Democrats are owned by business Reich certainly does not capture the substance of any conversation I ever had with him Sabo wrote to the Minneapolis Star Tribune Reich also reports a conversation in which he tells Rep David Obey D Wis his theory about blue collar hostility toward Clinton The vignette ends with Obey saying You re either a genius or you re nuts If I were you I wouldn t share that theory with anyone else Obey says through an aide that he s sure he never said that since he was talking up a similar theory himself though he says the rest of the conversation seems accurate Former head of the AFL CIO Lane Kirkland whom Reich portrays unsympathetically in several private dialogues protested in a recent letter to Reich I did not in fact utter the words that you attribute to me in various places in direct quotation marks as though you were repeating my words verbatim Asked about these denials Reich said Our recollections differ And it s certainly true that in Washington quote denying is endemic But some of Reich s dialogues are checkable and turn out when checked to be inaccurate in ways that serve Reich s rhetorical ends At a 1995 press conference just after President Clinton and Reich have failed to settle the baseball strike Reich has reporters asking the following questions Mr President why did you invite the players and owners to the White House in the first place If you can t even get these parties to agree what hope do you have in Bosnia Does this mark the nadir of this administration s influence First it was the minimum wage and now it s baseball Why do you and your labor secretary think Washington should be involved in every employment issue in America Those questions certainly help Reich paint a picture of piranha journalists intent on humiliating the administration But none of the questions nor any like them was ever asked The reporters focus was on major league baseball not on Reich and Clinton and their tone was puzzled rather than angry Here are all the real questions that the reporters asked Mr President you ve met now with the players and the owners In your opinion who is more to blame for this impasse And why won t they simply accept voluntarily binding arbitration Mr President what gave rise to the optimism you felt during the course of the evening that a settlement might be possible How do you compare this Mr President to say President Kennedy acting on steel prices and former uses of the office and the Oval Office for labor disputes There was a question about legislation And most scathingly Mr President if the season begins with replacement players would you throw out the first ball Life unlike Reich s book is not a series of morality fables On Feb 22 1995 Reich testified on the minimum wage before the Joint Economic Committee That much his memoir gets right The Republican attack machine is gearing up Reich writes and I m one of the targets Then he paints a scene in which committee chairman Jim Saxton R N J interrupts Reich s initial testimony and lights into him savagely starting with Where did you learn economics Mr Secretary and then jumping up and down in his chair and crying Evidence Evidence while pointing to a chart There was a time not long ago when congressional hearings were designed to elicit information for members in order to help them draft legislation recalls Reich ruefully Now they re attack ads When I checked the transcript I was flabbergasted so I checked the C SPAN tapes and they leave no doubt Reich appears to have fabricated much of this episode for dramatic effect Saxton was in fact decorous and polite He did not jump up and down he did not impugn Reich s education he did not shout Evidence Evidence The chart to which Reich refers was actually presented during Saxton s opening statement hours before Reich testified and did not look as Reich claims it did Worst of all most of the lines that Reich attributes to Saxton starting with where did you learn economics Mr Secretary appear never to have been said at all Reich has replaced a dull earnestly wonkish hearing with a Hollywood script in which a mean Republican hammers a decent Democrat Don t take my word for it I invite you to compare Reich s account with reality by clicking Or perhaps most striking of all consider a set piece in which Reich speaks to the National Association of Manufacturers He describes himself as being ambushed by cigar chomping capitalists who hiss at him so loudly that he has to yell to be heard They plan to carve me up into small pieces he writes There isn t a lady in the room All men in dark suits They ve finished lunch Some are smoking cigars Others are quietly smirking ready for the kill His speech over Reich is lambasted by a John and Reich s answer elicits an eruption of Wrong Bullshit and Go back to Harvard As Reich speaks the audience hisses so loudly that I m not sure anyone can hear me The cigar smoke he says is making my eyes water I feel dizzy He says We re in a boxing arena John s the champ and the crowd is loving every minute Finally the meeting over he races out the back exit before they can pummel me As it happens the meeting was a breakfast not a lunch The NAM says the attendance list shows that a third or more of the people present were women including the NAM representative with whom I spoke If anyone actually was inclined to light up a cigar after breakfast he would have been breaking the NAM s no smoking rule according to an association representative who like another witness I talked to saw no cigars Most important a transcript of the meeting shows a respectful Q and A session in which none of the comments attributed to John nor any like them were actually made One would hardly expect a roomful of corporate reps to hiss boo and shout bullshit at a sitting U S labor secretary Sure enough the transcript shows nothing nastier than sprinkled applause and laughter I asked Richard Boyd the professional court reporter who transcribed the session whether his transcript might have omitted hisses boos and imprecations I never witnessed anything like that with Robert Reich or anybody else at a NAM meeting he said I m absolutely certain I would remember it Reich portrays himself as the little guy standing up to a roomful of abusive capitalists pure Hollywood Again don t take my word for it click I asked Reich what was going on in each of these cases In reply he pointed to his Note to the Reader I claim no higher truth than my own perceptions This is how I lived it He said that his notes accurately reflected how he felt and what he perceived In the three cases cited above he felt varying degrees of hostility I am not representing the book to be anything other than it is which is my account of my experiences my perceptions what I saw and heard around me he said That s all I can say In effect Reich is saying that he s not writing journalism or history He s writing well what He elides the very distinction between history and myth memoir and novel reality and perception The problem is that those are real people he misquotes real history he rewrites Steve Wasserman a former Random House editor who now edits the Los Angeles Times Book Review points out an irony Books are often viewed as better sources for history than newspapers but newspapers which are generally much more careful than the average publishing house about such niceties as checking quotes are often the more reliable source Reich s memoir if that s the proper word for it is now ensconced between hard covers and will be read for years to come as part of the historical record That is a shame Quote me
