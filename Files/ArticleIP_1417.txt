among Georgia politicians and 2 the law was designed to be symbolic rather than effective e g it allows candidates to pick the day they will be tested The Fourth Amendment spin is that the court

Congress 4 11 Newt Gingrich is back On the heels of his widely acclaimed trip to China the House speaker has delivered high profile speeches bashing Clinton Yasser Arafat taxes unions the IRS and government funded art Conservatives are heartened though a few winced at his boast that Republican ideas are carrying the day in Mongolia See Slate s Jacob Weisberg on Newt Descending The contrary

Iraqi bunker years before the Persian Gulf War but failed to give the armed forces clear warning before they blew up the bunker The admission contradicts the CIA s previous assurances that U S
