                    Background        The distribution of health or health inequality has        become prominent on global policy agendas as researchers        have come to regard average health status as an inadequate        summary of a countrys health performance      Almost        all health inequality studies have in fact documented         differences in average health status        across groups of people Those with an economic focus        have measured differences in average health status across        income groups      Researchers with a sociological        focus have examined inequalities in average health status        among social classes      and those with a political        focus have looked at how political structure is related to        differences in the average level of health     Other        scholars have focused on differences in average health        status among racial or ethnic groups or by educational        attainment or occupation       And most researchers        consider differences across political entities such as        countries or local governments Similarly demographers        have also long studied differences in average health        status particularly in children across age sex        education and racial groups       In low and        middleincome countries there exists a rich demographic        literature on levels and trends in child mortality and        causes associated with them              In this paper we define the concept of         total health inequality  and        demonstrate how to measure it by the variation in health        status across         individuals within a country as a        whole or any subgroup within a country This approach        complements the existing grouplevel approaches a fact        that can even be demonstrated mathematically That is the        standard analysis of variance identity applies to        variations in health status just as it does to all other        coherent variables        Total  Between Group  Within Group        Existing literature has focused exclusively on the        between group component In this paper the missing        withingroup component is added to the existing measures        to arrive at total health inequality With total health        inequality no individual variation in health status is        ignored With this measure added to existing reporting        standards public health policy can be targeted at reducing        inequalities across individuals in addition to its        existing goal of reducing disparities in average health        status across countries and groups in society        We would like to emphasize that total health inequality        complements group level measures it does not replace them        After all if average health attainment is the same across        a given set of groups total health inequality could still        be unacceptably high because of intragroup variation        across individuals whereas if total health inequality is        small then the differences among any set of groups albeit        potentially systematic must also be small In our view        between within and total levels of health inequality        should be reported henceforth        Preferably measures of inequality in healthy life        expectancy the number of years in full health an        individual born today can expect to live     would be        computed but this paper focuses on a preliminary step for        which data are more readily available  developing methods        for the measurement of total inequality in the probability        of child survival Survival from birth to two years of age        is only one aspect of health but it is a useful place to        start since it is a critical part of health status        particularly in developing countries             The normative principles involved in choosing a measure        of inequality are discussed briefly Instead of making an        arbitrary choice the inequality measure selected is        consistent with the results of a survey of normative        preferences of over  health professionals conducted by        WHO and used in the         World Health Report             Comparisons with applications of other popular measures of        income inequality to health are also presented                    Methods        The data analyzed are from  countries where a        Demographic and Health Survey DHS had been conducted and        the data were available Table lists the countries sample        size and year of the surveys used The DHS is a year        project conducting high quality national sample surveys on        population and maternal and child health Funded primarily        by the United States Agency for International Development        USAID DHS is administered by Macro International Inc            Lowincome country governments and international        organizations have long relied on DHS data to monitor a        variety of child and maternal health and family planning        indicators     One of the most significant        contributions of the DHS is the collection of        internationally comparable data on the demographic and        health characteristics of populations in developing        countries               The DHS are conducted through inperson interviews The        samples which are all above  households in the        countries analyzed in this study are the result of a        multistage stratified sampling design     The DHS        sampling weights are used to produce nationally        representative estimates        For each country we used the latest year of available        data from a nationally representative DHS ranging from         to  For each mother surveyed the number of        children born and the number survived to age  was        calculated A tenyear observation period was used ending        two years prior to the interview year to avoid censoring        effects This period is a compromise between providing        recent estimates and ensuring enough births to reduce the        effects of sampling error Measuring survival to or death        by age  would involve a longer censoring period produce        older estimates of inequality and not differ much from the        under  mortality because on average  of under  deaths        occur in the first two years of life             To provide a partial but independent validation of the        DHSbased results mortality data by municipality in Mexico           and Brazil    from different data sources were        analyzed Data on socioeconomic variables    and on the        political system    of each country were also collected        to help us explore possible causes of differences in        inequality The socioeconomic variables were collected for        the year the survey was conducted in each country        The population of interest includes all children born        alive in a country in a given time period Ideally one        would measure the length of time each child is         expected to live from birth to two        years and then use a measure of inequality to summarize the        distribution of these survival expectations Making the        inference from the dichotomous data on child survival to        health inequality requires several methodological        steps        The first step is to estimate the distribution of the        probability of death across children in each national        sample The chief methodological difficulty here is that        for any one child only the dichotomous variable of        survival to two years is measured while the probability of        dying for each child is not observed These probabilities        are estimated using the extended betabinomial model              This model has been widely applied in biomedical        research most commonly for modeling animal littermate        survival probabilities and in political science to model        voting statistics          In this        application we model the number of child deaths within a        family with a binomial distribution with equal risk of        dying per child and then allow the risks to vary across        families according to a beta distribution     See        Additional file  for more details on the specification of        the model        Potential confounders including mothers age number of        children level of education and average birth interval        were controlled for     This procedure relaxes the        assumptions of the model making it more flexible However        the basic model fits the data well and controlling for        these variables does not materially affect the estimates of        health inequality When the covariates have no effect the        beta distributed random effect portion of the model ensures        that the level of variability is not underestimated        For Mexico and Brazil the extended betabinomial model        was also applied to the municipalitylevel mortality data        sets to validate the model The underlying assumption is        that small geographical areas which are treated        analogously to families include mostly homogeneous        populations for which the risk of death is similar In both        countries the estimates of inequality from the extended        betabinomial model did not materially differ between the        two data sets used        As an example of the results of the survey analysis        Figure shows the estimated distribution of the probability        of dying before age  in Benin and the Central African        Republic and the corresponding distributions of expected        childhood survival time up to two years for those        countries These two countries were chosen because they        have very similar average probabilities of death  and         respectively and therefore very similar mean        survival times  and  years respectively but        markedly different distributions of actual survival time        around these means and hence divergent levels of health        inequality For example in the Central African Republic        about  of children born have a probability of death        lower than three percent In contrast children in Benin        have risks of death more closely distributed around its        mean with only  of its children having a probability of        death lower than three percent Clearly at the lower end of        the distributions Benin does worse but it does much        better at the higher extreme For example in Benin less        than  of children born have a probability of death        greater than forty percent contrasted with the Central        African Republic where more than  of children have that        probability of death This is merely one striking example        of why summarizing health status with only mean levels is        misleading        The second step is to transform the estimated        probability of death between birth and age two for each        child                   q          in demographic notation to the        expected survival time in the first two years of life         S  Although the results do not        change materially we opted to measure inequality in        survival time instead of probability of survival as it is        analogous to inequality in health expectancy and is more        interpretable Expected survival time can be calculated        as                where         S is expected survival time and                  m          is the mortality rate in the first two        years of life                      m          can in turn be calculated from the        probability of dying in the first two years of life                   Finally since printing fifty plots like Figure would        be unwieldy we give numerical summaries of health        inequality To do this several normative criteria have to        be addressed At least three general normative dimensions        are relevant     First measures of inequality range        from absolute to relative Absolute measures are        independent of mean survival time whereas relative        measures adjust for the mean If one believes that more        variation in health states is acceptable when average        survival time is higher then a measure close to the        relative end of the continuum would reflect that choice on        the other hand if one believes that a given discrepancy in        expected survival across people should be considered in the        same way irrespective of the mean survival time in that        population then an absolute measure of inequality would be        appropriate The second normative dimension is the weight        given to outliers One might believe that the majority of        children is what measures should be based on or one might        instead want to focus primarily on the worst and best off        The final dimension is whether individuals should be        compared to the average of their communities or to each of        the individuals within their communities separately        A range of measures of inequality that reflect many        different normative positions were developed including        measures used in quantifying income inequality such as the        Gini index variance measures and many that have not been        previously considered     Although it need not have        turned out this way in the present analysis these measures        all gave substantively consistent empirical results For        empirical analyses the inequality index          II  used was derived from a survey        of the normative preferences of over  health        professionals and other individuals with an interest in        health systems     The index is defined as                where         s                   i          is the expected survival time between birth and age        two of individual         i  and         s is the average expected survival        time in the first two years of life in the population This        index of inequality          II  is logically between a relative        and an absolute measure so the average survival time is        included in the denominator The index is based on        comparing each child with every other child in the        population thus the sum of the differences in the        numerator and gives a large weight to the best and worst        off the differences are raised to the power of three        Larger values of         II indicate more individual level        inequality in child survival The health inequality point        estimates and uncertainty bounds are mean posterior        estimates and  credible intervals respectively        computed from the extended betabinomial model with flat        priors and the traditionally used asymptotic normal        approximations eg                        Results        Table lists estimates of child survival inequality        using         II for each of  countries ranked        from most unequal Liberia to least unequal Colombia        For comparison estimates of child survival inequality were        calculated for three other commonly used summary measures        of distributions  the variance the Gini index and the        coefficient of variation The pairwise rank order        correlations between the four measures were all higher than         Table presents the ranking of countries from most to        least unequal by the four measures of inequality used in        this analysis        To get a sense of the uncertainty in estimation Figure        plots the inequality estimates with  confidence        intervals for each country the size of the confidence        intervals is mostly a function of the sample size in each        country These kinds of basic data could be used by health        professionals to base further research particularly into        the determinants of total health inequality and eventually        public policy to reduce inequalities        Figure presents an exploratory view of the relationship        between our measure of health inequality and five plausible        explanatory variables interacted with the type of        government The purpose of these graphs is to understand        the measure of inequality developed and to explore        correlations with other relevant variables Determining        what causes changes in inequality is a critical issue but        one that we do not pursue in any detail here Among the        variables included GDP per capita and health expenditures        per capita are negatively correlated with health        inequality which lends face validity to the inequality        measure As with average level of mortality the        relationship between health inequality and GDP per capita        and health expenditure per capita is very strong at low        levels of income and expenditure and the effect is smaller        at higher levels The relationship between health        inequality and absolute poverty defined as the percent of        the population earning less than one international dollar        per day appears to be more linear with considerable        variation in inequality at each given level of poverty        More surprisingly health inequality seems entirely        uncorrelated with income inequality r   as        measured by economists most commonly used measure the        Gini index calculated for income        Additionally inequality in childhood survival is        positively related to the mean probability of death          q  but at a given level of        mortality there is significant variation in inequality        This confirms the expected relationship and also reflects        the fact that traditionally reported measures of average        levels of health are insufficient for summarizing the        health experience of a population Finally each point in        each graph also codes the type of political system The        graphs seem to indicate that full democracies represented        as diamonds tend to have lower values of inequality than        partial democracies squares or autocracies triangles        as would be expected Partial democracies include        countries that have adopted some democratic practices such        as popular elections to legislatures with limited powers        but most have not completed the transition from autocratic        practices However and perhaps surprisingly health        inequality is otherwise unrelated to the type of political        system either directly or in interaction with any of the        five potential explanatory variables        The individuallevel approach to conceptualizing and        measuring health inequality appears to complement the        grouplevel approaches To show that the total health        inequality measures offered here are at least sometimes        distinct from grouplevel analyses the results of the        present analysis are compared to those of Wagstaff           and Brockerhoff and Hewett     Wagstaff calculated        inequalities among income groups in  countries measured        by a concentration index Brockerhoff and Hewett measured        ethnic differences in  countries via odds ratios        Brockerhoff and Hewett used subsets of the same DHS        datasets as used in this analysis while Wagstaff used        mostly data from the Living Standards Measurement        Surveys        Figure plots of the ranks of the total health        inequality measure          II  by each of these grouplevel        measures with rank  assigned to the country with the        largest inequalities Clearly the individuallevel measure        is tapping into different concepts as the two pairs are not        even positively correlated For example the Central        African Republic and Rwanda have large individuallevel        inequalities in child survival but relatively smaller        interethnic group inequalities These results do not        contradict but rather imply that there is considerable        intraethnic group inequality that is by definition not        picked up by the grouplevel measures In contrast Kenya        has less individuallevel health inequality relative to        other subSaharan African countries but more        ethnicityrelated inequalities Similarly Brazil and        Nicaragua have large differences in child mortality levels        across income groups but less individuallevel inequality        than Pakistan and Cote dIvoire These different results        establish that measures of total health inequality are        indeed measuring different concepts and uncovering        different findings than the existing grouplevel        approaches                    Conclusions        This paper presents the first measures of total health        inequality of a population Such measures could serve as an        important complement to existing grouplevel approaches in        the literature on health inequalities among groups        Including individuallevel variation as done here        produces estimates of inequality that capture the entire        distribution of risk of death in the population and that        are directly comparable across countries        At the same average level of health status countries        can achieve widely varying levels of health inequality        Since measuring and communicating this type of information        seems essential to making informed public policy we        believe inequality should be measured and reported together        with average levels of health status        Estimating the underlying distribution of risk is useful        for understanding the nature and possibly the causes of        health inequality using observed dichotomous outcomes such        as survival and death This or a related approach should        prove useful for examining the risk of illhealth for all        age groups such as in measures of inequality in health        expectancy        Considerable future research needs to be conducted into        health inequality For one area efforts should continue to        measure inequalities in child survival outside of the fifty        countries analyzed here For another the normative        underpinnings of popular measures of health inequality        should be further clarified Similarly other measures that        formalize richer normative principles should be developed        Further efforts need to be made to measure what types of        people policymakers and democratic electorates prefer one        normative position rather than another Third new        databases need to be created and statistical methods        developed that enable researchers to expand measures of        inequality in child survival in the first two years of life        to inequality in health expectancy in general Fourth we        should seek further external validation of these results        along the lines of the vital registrationbased analysis        conducted for Mexico and Brazil Finally and most        importantly for influencing health policy globally        scholars should pursue an understanding of the determinants        of inequality We need to understand not only how average        levels of health status of populations can be raised but        also how health inequalities can be reduced        There are several limitations to this study The ranking        of countries is influenced by the year the data were        collected and particularly for those most affected by the        HIVAIDS epidemic the estimate of the inequality index        might change if more recent data were available Since        women of reproductive age are the basic sampling units in        these surveys their premature death from maternal or        other causes excludes their children from the studies        Such children often have an elevated mortality risk and        their exclusion may bias estimates child mortality both        level and inequality downward This bias is likely to be        greater in countries with higher maternal mortality and        HIVAIDS epidemics Our preliminary explorations of this        issue indicate that the estimate of the inequality index        changes very little and not enough to result in a change        of rankings across countries        Some of the potential implications of this article        include a research program devoted to developing and        improving measures of health inequality a substantial        change in data collection efforts by public health        authorities internationally and even ongoing changes in        national and international public policy as a result All        this possible activity takes nothing away from the        important existing focus on differences in average health        levels across groups but measuring and reporting        individual health inequality adds an important new        perspective as well                    Competing interests        None declared                    Authors contributions
