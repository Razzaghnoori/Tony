 Major League Soccer Since the North American Soccer League disintegrated in 1984 America has been plagued by its soccer bores These folks who are the same people who can t understand why Paul Tsongas wasn t elected president are perpetually lathered at American indifference to the king of sports But it s the most popular sport in the world But 18 million Americans play it But kids love it But there ought to be a pro league But but but Full disclosure I too am a soccer bore Finally the bores have shut up Professional soccer a sport whose American history is an unbroken record of has at long last found a happy home here Major League Soccer opened its third season last week with 12 teams MLS is drawing nearly 20 000 fans per game NASL averaged only 15 000 in its best season Last October s championship game sold out Washington D C s 57 000 seat RFK stadium MLS has TV contracts ABC will broadcast a dozen games this season and ESPN will air 25 more It has endorsement deals Corporations including Pepsi AT T and Nike will spend 80 million on MLS over the next five years It has expansion teams MLS just added franchises in Miami and Chicago MLS in short looks very much like a real American sport MLS is a weird experiment a test of America s sports character Soccer has always been perceived as vaguely un American It s too low scoring there s too much cooperation the players are too small and too Euro it looks bad on television MLS in fact is un American but not for those wrong reasons MLS is un American because it marks the first time that an American pro sports league hasn t tried to be the best in the world MLS is perhaps the 10 th best soccer league in the world a shout and a mile from the premier divisions in Germany Spain Italy and England According to soccer experts the best MLS teams could compete with teams from Austria or Paraguay Paraguay America s fans are a spoiled lot It is the philosophy of American sports that if you can t be the best buy the best North Americans invented basketball baseball and football and dominate them by divine right The United States has used dollar power to make itself the world capital of other non American sports The NHL buys the best hockey players from eastern Europe The PGA tour buys the best golfers from Europe and Asia Huge purses bring the best European and Asian figure skaters here Foreign boxers travel to Vegas for title fights In every sport in which the United States stages pro competitions those competitions are the world s finest except perhaps for track and field And that was NASL s strategy in its glory days During the mid and late 70s NASL lured some of the very best players in the world to America Pele Franz Beckenbauer George Best Johan Cruyff and flirted with being one of the world s top leagues But that s not the way MLS was designed In an age of nearly universal free agency and vicious competition among teams MLS is a command economy the North Korea of pro sports After the United States hosted the 1994 World Cup U S soccer impresario Alan Rothenberg recruited a bunch of tycoons to invest in a new pro league MLS Rothenberg believed should avoid the mistakes that killed NASL too much expansion too much spending too many foreigners Rothenberg devised a crafty mechanism to lower MLS s costs He constituted the league as a single entity Each team has an owner operator but the league itself owns the players It negotiates all contracts and assigns stars to teams In other pro leagues players sign contracts with teams MLS players can t auction themselves to the highest bidder Though soccer salaries are soaring worldwide MLS has gone cut rate NASL paid stars more than 1 million a year in the 70s MLS s maximum salary is only 236 750 less than the NBA s minimum salary MLS s minimum is only 24 000 The payroll for an entire MLS team is capped at 1 6 million less than half of what a top European player earns MLS allows only five foreigners on its 20 man rosters a move that cuts costs while guaranteeing playing time for home grown players MLS also recruits most of its foreign players in Latin America largely because Latin players are cheaper than Europeans Latin players also appeal to MLS s best fans Latinos are a quarter of MLS s spectators and certainly the most fervent of them MLS relies heavily on assigning foreign players to cities where they ll be most popular MLS s calculated efforts have created a lovely league one that preserves the intimacy that the NBA et al have lost MLS is major league sport with minor league charm The average MLS ticket costs a mere 13 one third the price of an NHL or NBA ticket The relatively small crowds mean that fans sit close to the action MLS encourages fan clubs At every D C United game a section called the Barra Brava is jammed with Salvadorans and Bolivians wielding noisemakers MLS may not feature world class soccer but its toque toque style of play which requires lots of short accurate passes is more elegant and entertaining than the kick and run game many Americans are accustomed to The best teams D C United Kansas City Wizards pass beautifully and score lots of goals And players like Marco Etcheverry Carlos Valderrama Jaime Moreno Preki and Eric Wynalda would be thrilling in any league But this may not be enough MLS is losing tons of money more than 30 million in its first two seasons This summer s World Cup will distract fans and remove the league s best players for two months in the middle of the season And MLS players have filed a lawsuit to end the single entity league When MLS launched U S players were so grateful to get work that they accepted MLS s terms of employment Now they argue that the single entity suppresses salaries and violates antitrust laws The lawsuit goes to trial this fall MLS s major obstacles however are its ambivalence about itself and America s ambivalence about soccer For MLS to grow it needs to fill stadiums with Joe Sports Fans the kind of folks who aren t soccer bores but will attend a few games a season And for MLS to make itself a top class league it needs to spend tens of millions of dollars to steal European players and protect its own stars Europe is already grabbing MLS s best Goalkeeper Brad Friedel went to Liverpool last season and more top MLS players may follow him MLS s dilemma is this If it doesn t pay for talent it will certainly remain a minor league But even if it does pay for talent no one knows whether thousands of new fans will come MLS doesn t know whether it wants to be a very expensive world class soccer league or a very charming second class one And America doesn t know if it cares If you missed the link to MLS s ethnic marketing strategy click
