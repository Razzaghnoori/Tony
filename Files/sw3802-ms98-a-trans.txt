                Mike im calling from Dallas from Richardson   oh okay great im in Addison here   okay well good you know our subject is on boating and sailing   right   and quite honestly with the exception of being involved in a part ownership of a little bass boat i have never really got into sailing or boating   i do uh quite a bit of sailing i own a sailboat that i keep parked up on the scout lot of my scout troop  and we take it out and we do some teaching of sailing with the scouts but   oh do you well great   well thats neat   i havent really been taking it out recreationally too much lately  since its i dont have a trailer hitch on my car anymore so its hard for me to get it somewhere but     right ive seen some nice nice sailboats the guy that used to live next to us in Richardson before we moved twelve years ago or whatever he had a sailboat used to park it right in the uh driveway and it seemed i think it held probably uh it must have slept four people anyway   yeah this one is not that big its a day sailer it does have a little kind of cabin thing that you can store things in but you couldnt really sleep in there unless you sort of   right   stuck your body out the whole  it back into the main part of the sailboat but   i i understand   but its there they can be black holes to throw money into boats are kind of expensive to maintain   ill tell you its oh they are and you know we have a swimming pool at our house and i think of all the time now that my kids are gone and away and married and going to college or whatever that i put in there i just could not imagine a boat because i know its a lot of maintenance   especially a bigger one the bigger they are if you get a big cabin cruiser or a big ski boat   oh gosh yeah you bet   power boat then theres always uh stuff to go wrong with it the sailboat at least doesnt have an engine to mess up but you still have to   sure   worry with the hull and the condition of the sails and spars and rigging uh everything thats in it it takes a  a pretty good amount of maintenance to keep one up but   you bet i know my wife and i were first married her aunt and ancle uncle aunt and uncle up in New York they kept a boat on Jamaica Bay        and we used to go out with them and back then they had bought an older Chris Craft and we were involved every weekend in just uh as we visited we were involved every weekend in just helping him redo this and refinish that we just worked all the time but their boat slept about four people plus had a little kitchen it was sort of neat we but i think that was the last time we were really involved in that was twenty years ago or twenty five years ago it is a lot of fun   well its a lot of fun i think um just from the standpoint of  getting away from the dodge here and when you work hard and youre under pressure and everything all week long a boat can be a lot of relaxation uh to especially with a group of friends and cook out or camp out or whatever uh or a cabin or something depending on how much you like to rough it and but its uh   you bet i visited my cousin a couple of years ago my wife and i and our daughter and he had a place on the Lake of the Ozarks and he had a boat and uh       i never seen so many boats in all my life people actually park their car when they get to their place theyre staying and townhouse or condominium whatever they own and they they go boats i mean they go if they wanna go to a lounge to have a cocktail they use the boat   use the boat for transportation they just go across the boat and get a and tie it up and go in huh   and that was sort of neat yeah thats thats thats true thats exactly how they do it they go to dinner that way go to all the restaurants that was sort of a neat setup i enjoyed that we spent a week with them i enjoyed that   yeah that would be fun   but im envious im envious of people that have the big boats and uh   ive just never  ive never moved up to a really big class of sailboat um once i get my son into and through with college hes gonna be starting uh Rice next year so hes going off but        um once i get to that stage where im not paying for something else and uh i i dont have to worry about a lot of other scheduling things where ive actually got the time to go out and enjoy it uh   you bet   i might do something differently i might just donate my little one to the scout troop and let them keep it and maybe consider getting a a better one for me uh     think you think youd really enjoy it   yeah i think i would uh i the sailing part of it i like uh because its so quiet   yes   and if you get a big enough one then youve got a little motor on it also where if its light wind you can still putt around a little bit and have fun   oh thats   or if or if the wind dies youre not stuck in the middle of the lake ive with my little one ive been out there many times on a calm summer day   yeah thats great     where all of a sudden the wind stops and youre just stranded out there trying to pick up what little gusts you can to work your way back in and   oh i know   and that gets hot and and wearisome doing that and if you have if youre have big enough boat to have the little       auxiliary motor on there at least you can kind of drop the sails and putt on back in   and putt putt  sure well thats neat  where do you work who are you with   but its fun  i own an insurance agency a managing general a wholesaler of insurance uh out in Addison and uh   well good   im a scout leader though so im im out with
