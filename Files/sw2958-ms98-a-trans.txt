                okay Catharine can you uh give me your views on uh  what you think about the uh care of elderly   well i would i hate to see them being put into a hair care or a health facility care environment because they then feel like you know the family has abandoned them is uh what i get the comments from elderly people that i know that its happened to and the elderly people that i  that are still hanging onto their homes that is their greatest fear is to be put into a a a care facility rather than their families taking them in because the families then seem to neglect visiting them but if that is the case that they have to go to a care facility like that i think that care facility has to be thoroughly investigated as far as the uh medical um evaluation what kind of credentials do the medical people hold uh if theyre qualified uh what type of recreation do they have for them uh their food uh situation um the environment that they are exposed to the the majority of the time that theyre there is it bright and cheery um and to put them in with people that have the same type of uh lifestyle uh that they would feel more more welcome in uh in making new friends because they can relate to certain individuals because of their personalities   um yeah   um so i guess i would like to hear how you feel about it now Ray   uh we uh just went through an experience um both my parents passed away fairly young and uh   oh my   my wifes mother died when she was only nine years old so the only one that we really had was her father  and uh   i i see   hes no longer with us he passed away when he was uh he was going on eighty nine years old so he had a good long life   yes he did uhhuh   but he always maintained his own apartment he lived in the city he lived in uh Rhode Island in fact we live in Rhode Island i work in in the Massachusetts plant but i live in Rhode Island   umhum   hes always lived in the in the city and hes always been kind of independent hes uh   thats wonderful thats good   hes never had a a never owned an automobile never had a drivers license you know hes always you know yeah   so he was very independent wasnt he   he got around yeah yeah because he lived right down down city in the   yes   port authorities right there so he used to take the steamer down to New York and you know i mean he went   wow thats wonderful   yeah he went everywhere he wanted to go   sure he it didnt have any hindrances for him   no and then about a year and a half ago he uh he started having mini strokes   umhum   and we got kind of concerned about him and then uh he had fallen in the street a couple of times but   oh bless his heart   he uh he still didnt want to give up his apartment   umhum umhum   and uh and uh finally a year ago last Thanksgiving um my wife tried to call him and he wouldnt answer the phone so we kind of expected the worse so i went down   umhum   and he had had another stroke and uh i found him he was just he was just standing in the middle of the room all covered with shaving cream he always trying to shave and he didnt know who i was so we brought him up to to uh stay with us   umhum   and uh he snapped he snapped out of it he uh he was probably uh say ninety five percent himself   umhum umhum   and in in the course of the next during the next year towards again it was getting on towards Thanksgiving time he started having you know more strokes and then uh   thats wonderful umhum   uh one morning he felt real dizzy so we took him to the hospital   umhum   and while he was in the hospital he had a a massive stroke and it crippled him on one side his right side   umhum umhum   so he didnt have the use of of his arm or his leg or and then uh he lost the ability to speak and were not sure but we think that he was very hard of hearing to begin with his almost his whole entire life     i see   so we figured that uh his hearing deteriorated even further and his eyesight um we did as much as we could for him and then it got to the point where we couldnt handle him anymore   sure i understand that   um i was working during the day and and uh my wife couldnt she she couldnt get him up   umhum sure   so um the alternative was to put him back in the hospital which we did and they took care of him you know and he slowly deteriorated and uh   umhum   to the point where he uh became fairly stable i mean he he knew who we were when we went in to visit him  even though he couldnt communicate with us   umhum   and then they said that um there was nothing more that they could do for him and he had to go into a nursing home the doctor said that he couldnt come back with us   umhum   because we couldnt take care of him   right   and we started looking around and they said no the first nursing home thats closest to you that has an available bed is where hes going to go so we didnt have much of a choice   wow i didnt know that they were that uh   well at least up here um so he went in there anyhow and my wife went in there every day to see him and you know she     were you satisfied with uh the facility   uh at first well at first no   umhum   its uh its very cold uh or at least we thought it was theyre very clinical theyre its like a  well its a business   umhum right   you get them in uh you do what you have to do for them and thats it   oh   um so I would go on weekends and she would go during the day to to visit him and they had a laundry you know they had the whole facility was there but   um umhum   closed up most of the time so shed go in and do his laundry for him and shed go in and feed him and and it got to the point where um they we knew them just as much as they knew us and and they really cared for him at you know he was in there for almost six months   so you established a relationship with the uh the personnel there umhum umhum   with the nursing home right um and it was run the nursing home was run by uh regular staff but it was owned by Seventh Day Adventists   okay   which was a surprise to us you know we didnt realize that they had i guess   well then you did see some compassion from the people there   uh but most of the people were   or were they just very businesslike and perhaps not of that faith   well they didnt have anything to do with it they owned it   okay   but they i suppose they cared how it was run but they had an administrator that ran it and and most of the people were um uh aliens you know uh Jamaicans or Africans or   okay umhum um okay yes   and they uh they took real good care of him he had lost a pair of slippers one day and one of them out of her own money bought a pair of slippers for him and you know that type of thing   i see uhhuh   but i think only because my wife spent so much time there she was there i mean every single day during the week and then on weekends we would go in the both of us   uhhuh uhhuh umhum   and she would do things and she would donate little things and shed help clean up the tables and you know that type of thing so um   umhum right   but youre right when most when most people end up in there and i hear it from a lot of elderly people their greatest fear is that theyre going to end up there and nobodys going to see them   sure thats right   theyll be abused but you hear horror stories all the time   oh yes sure   but if you care then it makes a difference those people   oh absolutely absolutely   that have uh a a lot of visitors   umhum   and we had a gentleman that uh that uh lets see maybe about a week after my fatherinlaw was in there he shared his room he came in he could get around fairly well he again had a had a stroke and he was partially paralyzed   umhum umhum   but he was young enough where they gave him therapy and he was beginning to move up but he could talk  and would tell us things oh you want to see what theyre doing here and do you want to see this but dont tell anybody you know   so he kind yeah yeah so he kind of adopted you and your wife   yeah yeah in fact uh   uhhuh umhum   we go down to see him she goes down occasionally maybe maybe uh once or twice a week just just to see him   umhum   and uh ill stop in maybe once or once or twice a month on the weekend ill go down to see him   well im sure he looks forward to that   uh yes but he gets out he can get out you know he can hes got a lot of friends and they take him here and they take him there so hes not as as bad off as some of the people because some of them are in there and in the six months that my fatherinlaw was in there   umhum umhum   um ive ive seen a lot of them that didnt have any visitors whatsoever at least while i was there   right yeah theyre abandoned by their families yeah or if they or they might not have any at all   yeah they just uh yeah and uh we had an old dog an old shepherd they were inseparable my fatherinlaw and the dog we brought the dog down there and it was nice and all the old people oh look at the dog and   umhum umhum umhum oh yes   well most people dont do that you know they dont they dont they figure figure once youre in there you forget everything and thats thats really not the case and its its sad um   umhum umhum um   i hope that i never get into that situation where you know the kids will say well okay dad you know here you go   of course yes umhum umhum umhum   i think ill walk off into the mountains somewhere or out into the   like the old Indian people used to do     but yeah yeah and you know and theres something to say for that i think     well yes they died with dignity didnt they   right they do and and the people that   umhum   that have families that dont
