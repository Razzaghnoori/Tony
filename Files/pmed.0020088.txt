 P LoS Medicine was launched at a time of unprecedented concern about the influence of hidden competing interests on the medical literature As a new journal we had the opportunity to help create the fully transparent world that is desirable 1 What are we doing to promote transparency and is our strategy going far enough We ask all authors and reviewers to declare any competing interests financial personal and professional 2 and authors declarations are included with all published articles We reject articles when we believe that authors competing interests have compromised their work for research articles this means compromised in either the conduct of a study or its interpretation When we are concerned that reviewers competing interests may prevent them from giving an unbiased assessment we find alternative reviewers And as recommended by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors 3 we decline to publish studies when the sponsor controls the decision on publication Our main strategy for managing competing interests is disclosure Financial relationships between industry researchers and academic institutions are widespread 4 and disclosing these competing interests is a crucial step in helping to protect the public and the reputation of authors and of PLoS Medicine Disclosure also matters because there is increasing evidence that authors competing interests have a strong influence on their conclusions For example review articles looking at the scientific evidence on the health effects of passive smoking have reached different conclusions a study of these review articles found that the only factor associated with the conclusion that passive smoking was harmless was whether an author was affiliated with the tobacco industry 5 A study of 159 randomized clinical trials found a significant association between authors financial competing interests and their favorable conclusions about an experimental intervention 6 We cannot rely entirely on peer review to detect bias in the conclusions of an article because although peer review may help to uncover some types of bias such as bias in the study design it cannot detect other types such as bias in the study s conduct Because a competing interests statement accompanies every article published in PLoS Medicine readers can take these interests into account when they assess a paper themselves The reality is that readers are wary of competing interests In one study readers were randomly sent the same paper with or without Financial relationships between industry researchers and academic institutions are widespread the authors having disclosed a financial competing interest 7 Readers scored the paper with the competing interest significantly lower on all five measures interest importance relevance validity and believability of the study Our policy of asking authors to disclose their competing interests is not of course foolproof The Center for Science in the Public Interest recently examined 163 articles in four scientific journals and identified at least 13 articles for which authors did not disclose relevant conflicts of interest that should have been disclosed according to the journals policies 8 Bero and colleagues compared the statement of competing interests of the authors of a 2003 BMJ paper on the health effects of secondhand smoke with internal tobacco industry documents describing financial ties between the industry and the authors 9 Although the authors met the BMJ s requirements for financial disclosure the disclosure did not provide readers with a full picture of the industry s long standing involvement with the authors Should we as journal editors be investigating authors ties for ourselves We do not have the resources to do so and agree with Bero and colleagues that an elaborate policing operation is not feasible or necessarily desirable 9 But in this particular case say the authors a quick search of the tobacco documents that are freely available online e g at http www legacy library ucsf edu or http www bat library ucsf edu would have been revealing Maybe we are heading towards an era when such searches become more common perhaps initially by randomly selecting papers for investigation At last year s Council of Science Editors retreat on competing interests editors came up with a list of questions to think about when formulating a journal s competing interests policy Table S1 Some are straightforward Should editors declare their own competing interests We think so and have declared ours at http medicine plosjournals org perlserv request get static name editors_interests Others are more complex When editors discover that a published author failed to declare a significant competing interest what should they do Should they impose sanctions on the author Should they publish a correction or even retract the paper To help us answer such questions and to advise us on individual cases for which we are concerned about competing interests or broader ethical questions we have appointed an external advisory group The group Table S2 has expertise in clinical medicine medical editing research health policy law and bioethics and includes a lay member In addition an internal committee at PLoS meets monthly to consider competing interests across the organization We are taking this issue seriously because we recognize that journals are seen as the gatekeepers of published research We welcome your feedback on how we are doing at protecting the probity of our content Supporting
