 George Will s Double Standard In January 1988 when Jesse Jackson appeared on ABC s This Week George Will asked him a series of questions designed to expose Jackson s deception and ignorance In particular Will asked Jackson As president would you support measures such as the G 7 measures in the Louvre accords As Will acidly recounted in a subsequent column Jackson s answer to that question was Explain that The Louvre accords it turned out to the enlightenment of Jackson and just about everyone else were an agreement reached in Paris a year earlier to stabilize currency exchange rates When asked later whether his question was designed to embarrass Jackson rather than elicit information Will argued That s information too When Jackson implied that Will s attempt to embarrass him was racist Will took offense To the contrary Will argued Because Jackson is black his white rivals sit silently beside him leaving his foolishness unremarked The real racism in this campaign is the unspoken assumption that it is unreasonable to expect a black candidate to get rudimentary things right He should be thankful for double standards Now along comes George W Bush with his fumbling references to Kosovians and his confusion of Slovakia with Slovenia And what does Will think of this In his Sept 23 Washington Post column headlined He s No Intellectual And So What Will writes The headmaster of Bush s private secondary school in Houston aspired to give students a sense of style At Bush s Andover graduation the headmaster urged graduates to take with you a sense of style a distinction in manner and bearing FDR a virtuoso of charm and guile was more a manner than a mind but in politics manner style can be a kind of program Bush seems to know this As for the intellectualism of presidents early in this century Will concludes such intellect in politics is rare and perhaps should be What Bush understands Will suggests is that the wise leader should strive to have intellectuals on tap and not be one himself Why is Bush unlike Jackson hailed as a wise leader when he fails to get rudimentary things right Is it racism Chatterbox doesn t think so There s a simpler explanation that applies to politicians in both parties from Ronald Reagan to Bill Bradley Whether you call a politician a fool or a wise leader depends on whether you re the kind of intellectual he plans to keep on tap
