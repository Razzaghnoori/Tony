 Background Although the challenge represented by the largest open reading frame in the yeast genome YLR106C has existed for more than five years there is surprisingly little known about the function of YLR106p the protein that it encodes The predicted amino acid sequence of YLR106p contains 4910 amino acids with a molecular mass MM of 560 kDa Systematic deletion studies of yeast proteins have indicated that YLR106p is required for viability 1 YLR106p has recently been identified in a 60S pre ribosomal particle involved in export of 60S ribosome subunits from the nucleus 2 but it is not yet clear whether this association is functional or adventitious Different sets of polypeptides were found associated with YLR106p in a systematic study of the yeast proteome 3 4 In a survey of the family of AAA ATPases Neuwald and coworkers 5 noted that YLR106p is a member of the AAA ATPase family and is unusual in containing six tandem copies of the set of sequence motifs that characterize an AAA protomer The genome projects for Drosophila Arabidopsis and Schizosaccharomyces pombe have identified an ortholog of YLR106p in these organisms The ortholog in these species as well as the presence of an unassembled orthologous gene in humans Caenorhabditis and Giardia has been noted by Mocz and Gibbons 6 who discussed its evolutionary relationship to the heavy chain of dynein motor protein The COOH terminal region of the human ortholog of YLR106p has been obtained as clone kiaa0301 by Nagase and coworkers 7 as part of a comprehensive project to clone high molecular weight polypeptides in humans These authors reported that the gene is expressed at a low level in most tissues with higher levels present in testis and kidney 8 In this study we have used sequence alignments of YLR106p and its orthologs from widely diverse eukaryotes to identify and characterize five major functional domains in the protein Expression of epitope tagged YLR106p is shown to result in a polypeptide of the anticipated size that localizes principally in the nucleus Results and discussion Amino acid sequence In Saccharomyces midasin Mdn1p is encoded as a predicted polypeptide of 4910 amino acids accession S64942 MM 560 kDa In Schizosaccharomyces pombe it is encoded as a polypeptide of 4717 amino acids accession CAB11610 MM 538 kDa In Giardia intestinalis it comprises a polypeptide of 4835 amino acids accession AF494287 MM 540 kDa We have determined the sequence of the human midasin gene from PCR amplified fragments of cDNA from testis The coding region of the human gene for midasin accession AF503925 comprises 102 exons spanning 156 000 bp at map position 6q15 and encodes a predicted polypeptide of 5596 amino acids with a molecular mass of 631 kDa All intron boundaries in the gene follow the gt ag rule Microheterogeneity of splice sites including the omission of exons 71 and 86 was observed in some amplified fragments of cDNA Midasin has also been identified as an ortholog of YLR106p in the genome projects for Drosophila gene CG13185 MM 605 kDa and Arabidopsis accession AAD10657 MM 583 kDa In Caenorhabditis there appears to be an unassembled midasin gene located on chromosome VIII data not shown However the midasin sequences in these organisms have not yet been verified by experimental confirmation of the computer predicted exon intron boundaries and they are not used in this analysis Domain structure Dot matrix plots comparing the amino acid sequence of midasin from different organisms reveal the presence of five major domains through an abrupt change in the level of sequence conservation at domain boundaries Figs 1 2 A weakly conserved N terminal domain is followed by a highly conserved AAA domain that contains six tandem AAA protomers This AAA domain is connected by a large linker domain to a D E rich domain that has a conserved amino acid composition rich in aspartate and glutamate residues but only moderately conserved sequence The D E rich domain is followed by the COOH terminal M domain that is highly conserved and contains a set of MIDAS sequence motifs 9 N terminal domain In most organisms the region between the NH 2 terminus of midasin and the beginning of the AAA domain comprises a weakly conserved domain of approximately 300 residues However in the compacted genome of Giardia 11 12 the N terminal domain is greatly truncated and consists of only about 25 residues The N terminal domain is the least conserved region of the midasin molecule Table 1 In many organisms the N terminal domain contains a cluster of basic residues these include the sequences RWIKDSKKK residues 75 83 in Saccharomyces and RYGRRRMKLR residues 137 146 in humans However the absence of such a basic cluster in the N terminal domains of Giardia residues 1 25 and Schizosaccharomyces pombe data not shown renders its significance questionable AAA domain As first noted for the yeast sequence by Neuwald and coworkers 5 midasin is a member of the AAA ATPase family The proteins of this family are unified by their sharing of a common structural organization that is based upon a conserved ATPase domain of 225 residues referred to as an AAA protomer The structure of an AAA protomer includes an ATP binding site located in the cleft between a large N subdomain and a smaller all C subdomain In contrast to their shared structure the AAA proteins participate in diverse cellular activities including proteolysis protein folding and unfolding membrane trafficking DNA replication metal ion metabolism and intracellular motility 13 14 15 Recent structural studies have revealed that the protomers of an AAA protein usually oligomerize into ring shaped hexameric structures that constitute molecular platforms essential to their mode of action In many cases conformational changes occurring in the individual AAA protomers during an ATPase cycle function cooperatively to change the shape of the overall hexameric ring in a manner that exerts mechanical force on their protein or nucleic acid substrates In most AAA proteins the ring structure is formed by six identical polypeptide subunits with each contributing a single AAA protomer 14 However the AAA motor dynein differs in having six distinct AAA protomers disposed in tandem on a single polypeptide subunit of unusually high molecular weight and it is believed to form a unimolecular pseudo hexameric AAA ring 5 6 16 The AAA domain of midasin like that of dynein contains six tandem copies of the amino acid sequence motifs that characterize AAA protomers Fig 3 see also reference 5 The Walker A motif GxxxxGK T S and Walker B motif hhhhDExx where h is any hydrophobic residue and x is any residue that contain residues essential for ATP binding and hydrolysis in all P type ATPases 17 are present in their canonical forms in the AAA2 AAA3 AAA4 and AAA5 protomers of midasin for all the organisms in Figure 3 The Walker A motif is present also in AAA1 and AAA6 although the Walker B motif in these protomers is deviant The sensor 1 and sensor 2 motifs that are specific for members of the AAA ATPase family are present and highly conserved among organisms in AAA2 AAA3 AAA4 and AAA5 but are less conserved or absent in AAA1 and AAA6 It is notable that the functionally important Asn in sensor 1 and Arg in sensor 2 15 are present and invariant among organisms in all protomers of midasin except AAA1 and AAA6 These critical residues lie close to the phosphate site in other AAA proteins with known structures and they are believed to trigger a change in the angle between the N and C subdomains of the protomer upon binding of ATP or dissociation of the phosphate 18 Indirect evidence suggests that such a conformational change in one protomer can be communicated to the adjacent protomers and result in a cooperative alteration in the shape of the overall hexameric ring 19 In both midasin and dynein the evolutionary fusion of the six AAA protomers into a single polypeptide has permitted the individual protomers in the hexameric assembly to acquire substantial structural and functional specialization In dynein this has included the acquisition of two substantial accessory structures that protrude asymmetrically from the hexameric AAA ring Concomitant with this development of asymmetrical structure the AAA1 protomer of the dynein motor unit evolved a functional dominance in which it alone retains the full ability for binding and hydrolysis of ATP while AAA2 AAA3 and AAA4 have lost the capability for hydrolysis and the most degenerate protomers AAA5 and AAA6 show no significant binding of ATP 20 21 22 In midasin the specialization of AAA protomers appears to have taken a less drastic course than in dynein In all the available organisms the four central protomers of the midasin polypeptide AAA2 AAA3 AAA4 and AAA5 possess canonical Walker A and B motifs as well as the critical Asn in sensor 1 and Arg in sensor 2 that are required for proper function in other AAA proteins 15 The presence of these critical residues taken together with their higher level of average sequence conservation Table 1 suggests that the four central protomers all retain an active enzymatic function Only in the two outer protomers AAA1 and AAA6 do the AAA sequence motifs depart sufficiently from their canonical forms to suggest that the protomers containing them play a less active role in midasin function Phylogenetic analysis of the sequence differences between the six protomers in the AAA domain of midasin Fig 4 shows that the evolutionary distance between any two protomers in a single organism is substantially greater than that between any single protomer taken from different organisms even for such highly disparate organisms as humans and Giardia This analysis also indicates that the odd numbered protomers AAA3 and AAA5 and the even numbered protomers AAA2 and AAA4 form two separate groups in which regardless of the organism they come from the members in any one group are more closely related to each other than they are to any members of the other group Although this odd even grouping is less obvious in the most divergent protomers AAA1 and AAA6 it remains visible in such features as the extended loop inserted between the Box IV and Box IV motifs of all the even numbered protomers Fig 3 Taken together these data support a phylogenetic model for midasin in which the hexa protomeric structure of its AAA domain evolved through a trimeric assembly of pre existing di protomeric AAA polypeptides that had evolved previously However such primordial di protomeric AAA polypeptides would have to have been simpler than those present in NSF ClpA and p97 and other AAA proteins of the current era for the latter assemble into two tiered hexameric assemblies with the axis joining the two protomers in each polypeptide oriented perpendicular to the plane of the hexameric ring 14 We cannot at present exclude an alternative model for midasin structure in which the hexameric AAA ring assembly is a dimeric two layered structure formed by two midasin polypeptides arranged laterally with all six odd numbered protomers in one layer and all six even numbered protomers in the other Linker domain The COOH end of the sixth protomer in the AAA domain is joined to the upstream end of the D E rich domain by a lengthy linker domain ranging between 1700 and 2300 residues in most organisms The sequence of this linker domain is moderately well conserved among organisms with 13 19 identity and 26 34 similarity in pairwise alignments of the yeast sequence with those of human and Giardia Table 1 The structure prediction program PhD 23 suggests that the linker domain folds into a compact globular conformation containing approximately 65 helix and less than 10 sheet Screening of the translated non redundant nucleotide database at GenBank with the sequence of the yeast linker domain detected the midasins in other organisms but revealed no significant homology of this domain to other proteins The roughly constant length of the linker domain in most organisms together with its moderate level of sequence conservation suggests that it primarily fulfils a structural role in midasin However the presence of a short region of relatively well conserved sequence near the middle of the linker Fig 2 suggests a more active role for this region of the domain perhaps acting as a hinge or as a binding site for other proteins D E rich domain The D E rich domain of midasin comprises 430 630 residues located between the COOH end of the linker domain and the NH 2 end of the M domain It is characterized by having a highly acidic amino acid composition with 35 40 of the residues being either aspartate or glutamate Fig 5 This composition gives the domain a predicted isoelectric point 3 7 4 0 The NH 2 boundary of the D E rich domain is marked by a well conserved glycine rich motif GxGxGxGxG The interior of the domain contains additional small clusters of glycines but few other hydrophobic residues The absence of any consistent pattern of heptad hydrophobic repeats indicates that there is little or no helical coiled coil structure in the domain The downstream boundary of the domain is usually marked by the presence of a small cluster of proline residues Structure prediction with the program PhD 23 24 suggests that the D E rich domain has a highly extended conformation containing about 30 helix and 70 coil The D E rich domain appears to be only weakly conserved with 20 identity in pairwise alignments of the sequence from different organisms Table 1 although the biased amino acid composition often makes correct alignment ambiguous Screening of the translated non redundant database at GenBank with the amino acid sequence of the yeast D E rich domain selected numerous other aspartate glutamate rich proteins including neurofilament proteins and caldesmon However scrutiny of the putative alignments indicated that most or all were based upon fortuitous fitting of the abundant acidic residues M domain The M domain of midasin is a highly conserved domain of 280 residues 30 kDa located at the COOH terminus of the protein The domain contains a full set of MIDAS sequence motifs consisting of hhhhDxSxS followed after 70 residues by a conserved threonine followed after a further 30 residues by hhhh S T DG where h is any hydrophobic residue and x is any residue Fig 6 The best studied examples of MIDAS containing domains in other proteins are the I domains of integrin chains 1 2 10 and 11 and the A domains of von Willebrand factor 9 25 26 27 In proteins whose structure has been determined to atomic resolution the MIDAS containing domain has a classic Rossman fold with a central hydrophobic sheet flanked on both sides by amphipathic helices The residues in the MIDAS motifs lie on three closely apposed loops located on the upper edge of the sheet where they form the metal binding site with oxygen atoms in the aspartate serine and threonine residues coordinating the metal ion 9 In integrin 2 1 which is a collagen receptor the metal binding site also binds the collagen ligand through the conserved glutamate in a GFOGER motif O hydroxyproline completing the coordination sphere of the metal 28 In vivo the binding of collagen at this site appears to be regulated through a conformational shift in which the loops forming the MIDAS site change from a closed to an open conformation 29 30 31 Other proteins containing a domain with all three MIDAS motifs include the D subunit of magnesium chelatase 32 Ca activated chloride channel protein 33 34 nitrate reductase accession AAC79447 and the D subunit of nitric oxide reductase accession AAC45374 The ability of a MIDAS protein to bind its protein ligand is tightly linked with the presence of intact MIDAS motifs mutations to the metal coordinating residues in these motifs weaken or eliminate ligand binding 35 36 An additional set of MIDAS like proteins that includes the integrin chain 37 38 and the von Willebrand Factor A domain 27 lacks one of the three motifs and appears to bind ligands in a somewhat different manner 27 39 40 In midasin the presence of all three MIDAS motifs in the M domain with the putative metal ion binding residues in the motifs invariant in the available organisms indicates that midasin belongs to the family of MIDAS containing proteins In addition to this conserved framework the midasin M domain possesses an extension of 75 residues at the NH 2 end of the hhhhDxSxS motif The sequence in this NH 2 extension is highly conserved with 46 of the residues invariant among midasins from the available organisms Since this region of well conserved sequence continues unbroken between the NH 2 extension and the hhhhDxSxS motif the NH 2 extension and the carboxyl region of the M domain probably form two parts of a single structural domain The structure prediction program PhD 23 24 suggests that the COOH region of the M domain has an conformation similar to that expected from its sequence homology to the integrin I domain whereas the NH 2 extension is predicted to be largely helical Although the sequence of the midasin NH 2 extension shows no statistically significant similarity to other proteins in the GenBank database its high density of basic and hydrophobic residues generally resembles that in the equivalent region of the magnesium chelatases Fig 6 suggesting that the two proteins share a common fold in this region The highly conserved sequence in the midasin M domain indicates that it plays a critical role in midasin function One possibility is that the MIDAS site serves to attach protein ligands through a mechanism involving participation of a glutamate or aspartate residue on the ligand in the coordination of a Mg 2 ion at the MIDAS site of midasin in a manner similar to that by which the MIDAS site in integrin I domains appears to mediate attachment of collagen through the glutamate in the GFOGER binding motif 36 Interestingly the related RGE ligand binding motif 41 occurs in a conserved region of the midasin AAA domain yeast residues 1835 1838 as well as in the AAA domain of Mg chelatases 32 The presence of this consensus binding motif in the AAA domain raises the possibility of the midasin molecule folding back onto itself with the M domain becoming attached to one face of the AAA domain and perhaps regulating access to its central chamber in a manner analogous to that in which the 19S proteasome regulator also an AAA protein controls access to the central proteolytic chamber of the proteasome 42 A compacted midasin in Encephalitozoon caniculi The parasitic microsporidean Encephalitozoon caniculi has been under severe and sustained evolutionary pressure to reduce the size of its genome which is the smallest of any sequenced eukaryote with an overall length of only 3 Mbp 43 One result of this pressure has been to compact many of the essential genes that the organism could not afford to eliminate 44 We have examined the sequence of midasin in Encephalitozoon as one approach to probing why midasin is so large and to identifying which regions of its domains are essential to their function Midasin in Encephalitozoon is encoded by a gene of 8496 bp corresponding to a protein of 2832 residues accession CAD26493 with a predicted molecular mass of 324 kDa This corresponds to an overall 42 reduction compared to that of yeast midasin Sequence alignment of Encephalitozoon midasin with that from the other available organisms shows that the different domains of the protein have been affected to conspicuously different extents by this compaction See Additional File 1 FullAlignment The N terminal domain is reduced by 90 to 25 residues indicating that much of this domain plays a non essential role However the abbreviated domain retains a cluster of basic residues KFKKHKK residues 2 8 similar to those present in this domain of humans and yeast The AAA domain has been affected relatively little all six AAA protomers are retained and the overall length of the domain is reduced by only 19 Most of this reduction involves a shortening of the lengthy loops between the Walker A and Walker B motifs of even numbered protomers in normal organisms Fig 3 On the other hand the linker domain which is believed to serve a structural function is reduced by more than 50 to 537 residues indicating that it has undergone major reorganization through compaction The D E rich domain is reduced in size by 50 while retaining its acidic character with a high percentage of aspartate and glutamate residues The M domain is reduced by 20 mostly through loss of a 40 residue section of the less conserved region immediately upstream of the hhhh S T DG motif All the MIDAS sequence motifs in this domain are retained and most of the residues in the highly conserved NH 2 extension of the M domain are unaffected Although all domains in midasin have yielded something to the pressure for gene compaction during evolution of Encephalitozoon it is the N terminal linker and D E rich domains in which the sequence is relatively less conserved among organisms that have yielded the most The essentially complete retention of the M domain and the hexameric assembly of protomers in the AAA domain emphasizes the critical importance of these domains to the proper functioning of midasin Relationship of midasin to other AAA proteins The early evolutionary divergence of the different major branches of the AAA family makes it difficult to evaluate the phylogenetic relationships among them 45 However by restricting the analysis to residues in the more highly conserved regions of the AAA structure that interact directly with ATP we have been able to improve the signal to noise ratio sufficiently to probe the phylogenetic relationship of midasin and dynein to representative members in other branches of the AAA family Such analysis of the AAA protomers that are best conserved among organisms AAA2 AAA3 AAA4 and AAA5 in midasin and AAA1 in dynein shows that the AAA protomers of midasin and dynein are substantially more closely related to each other than they are to those in the other branches of the AAA family examined Figs 7 8 This result supports the view that midasin and dynein evolved from a common AAA ancestral protein that had already developed a subunit structure of six AAA protomers in a single polypeptide However insufficient information exists to relate this last common ancestor to any particular other branch of the presently existing AAA family Apart from the AAA domain the other domains of midasin appear to show little or no relationship to dynein The polypeptide joining the adjacent AAA protomers in midasin is approximately 100 residues long between all protomer pairs There is no indication that any of these joining polypeptides contains a ATP sensitive microtubule binding site resembling that located between the AAA4 and AAA5 protomers of dynein 46 The position of the N terminal domain of midasin relative to the AAA domain is similar to that of the stem domain of dynein and in several organisms the midasin N terminal domain contains a cluster of basic residues that has the potential to bind microtubules in an ATP insensitive manner However the major truncation of the midasin N terminal domain in Giardia Fig 3 and Encephalitozoon together with the absence of a cluster of basic residues in the N terminal of Schizosaccharomyces pombe makes the domain of questionable functional significance Expression and localization of midasin in yeast In order to verify the expression of the midasin gene as a single polypeptide and to make a preliminary study of its function we modified the chromosomal MDN1 gene in a diploid strain of yeast by adding an oligonucleotide encoding a hemagglutamin HA epitope tag to the 3 end of one copy of the gene Subsequent sporulation and tetrad dissection yielded 4 viable spores from most tetrads indicating that the HA tagged midasin is able to function and maintain viability in a haploid strain Preliminary characterization of the haploid cultures at temperatures ranging from 14 C to 37 C indicates that strains with the modified MDN1 HA gene grow somewhat more slowly than those with the native MDN1 wt gene but appear otherwise normal Western blots obtained after electrophoresis of a crude homogenate of yeast containing the MDN1 HA gene demonstrated the presence of midasin as a single immunostained band with a molecular weight of greater than 500 kDa Fig 9A there was no comparable immunostained band in homogenates of yeast with the MDN1 wt gene Differential centrifugation of the homogenate showed that the midasin remained in the supernatant fraction upon centrifugation at 2 000 g for 2 min but mostly passed into the pellet fraction upon centrifugation at 18 000 g for 20 min Attempts to solubilize the midasin under relatively mild conditions by extracting the 18 000 g pellet with 0 6 M NaCl 0 1 M Na 2 CO 3 or 1 Triton X100 were unsuccessful data not shown However the midasin did pass into solution upon extraction of the 18 000 g pellet with 8 M urea and it then remained in the supernatant fraction after centrifugation at 150 000 g for 20 min Fig 9B The localization of midasin in yeast was examined by fluorescence microscopy of immunostained cells from exponentially growing cultures of MDN1 HA yeast with comparable immunostained cells from parallel cultures of MDN1 wt yeast used as controls The results demonstrated that the tagged midasin localizes predominantly to the nucleus Fig 10 The midasin signal covered a slightly larger area than the DAPI signal and sometimes appeared granular or punctate In most cells this additional stained area appears nearly symmetrically disposed around the DNA Fig 10a However in cells that appeared to have recently divided a comet tail of immunostained material was frequently visible trailing behind the separated nuclei Fig 10b 10c This tail possibly corresponds to the finger of nuclear envelope and matrix that formerly enclosed the anaphase spindle 47 48 The localization of midasin to the nucleus in yeast together with the difficulty in solubulizing it under moderately dissociating conditions suggests that midasin occurs primarily in association with one of the cytoskeletal assemblies that constitute the nuclear matrix and the nuclear pore complex Consistent with the lack of a consensus hydrophobic segment in its sequence the solubility of midasin in 8 M urea indicates that it is not an intrinsic membrane protein When the amino acid sequence of yeast midasin is screened with the PredictNLS server at http cubic bioc columbia edu it reveals two potential nuclear localization signals One is the cluster of basic residues KKKKRR residues 768 773 located in a relatively non conserved region of the AAA domain between AAA3 and AAA4 The second is the highly conserved sequence RKDKIWLRRTKPSKRQ residues 4687 4702 located in the NH 2 extension of the M domain immediately upstream from the first MIDAS motif General discussion Stripped to its fundamentals the structure of midasin consists of a pseudo hexameric assembly of AAA protomers associated with a MIDAS containing M domain This basic domain organization shows a striking parallel to that of magnesium chelatase a heterotrimeric enzyme containing BchD BchI and BchH subunits that performs ATP dependent insertion of Mg 2 into the protoporphyrin IX ring in the course of chlorophyll biosynthesis 49 In particular the BchD subunit resembles midasin in possessing a single AAA protomer close to its NH 2 terminus together with a short aspartate glutamate rich region and a MIDAS containing domain at its carboxy terminus The BchI subunit also possesses a single AAA protomer but contains no MIDAS domain 32 The third subunit BchH is able to bind the protoporphyrin ring in either the presence or absence of ATP The initial step of the insertion can proceed in the presence of either Mg ATP or a non hydrolyzable ATP analog and involves oligomerization of the BchD and BchI subunits to form an oligomeric ring of AAA protomers that resembles the ring structure of NSF and other AAA proteins 14 32 The second step of the insertion involves an obligatory hydrolysis of ATP that is tightly coupled with the transfer of the chelated Mg 2 to the protoporphyrin ring by BchH 49 Although the details differ from midasin particularly with respect to the subunit composition of the AAA ring this chelation reaction provides a structural model suggesting that the function of the midasin M domain may be to regulate the ATPase activity of the AAA protomers in the pseudo hexameric ring and thus couple ATP hydrolysis to the binding of a protein ligand at the MIDAS site Studies of the yeast proteome have the potential to clarify the function of midasin by identifying the protein partners with which it interacts in vivo In a recent large scale screen with 1739 yeast proteins used as bait 3 midasin YLR106p was identified in the polypeptide sets that copurified with four bait proteins ESS1p RPT1p YML029p and HRT1p that function principally in RNA metabolism and in the regulation of proteasomes which are mostly intranuclear in yeast 50 However the interpretation of these proteomic data is clouded by the fact that no protein partners were identified in the complementary experiment in which midasin was itself used as bait Substoichiometric amounts of midasin have also been detected in isolated preparations of 60S preribosomal particles suggesting that it may play a role in maturation of 60S ribosome subunits 2 Such a role for midasin as a nuclear chaperone involved in the assembly disassembly of macromolecular complexes in the nucleus would be consistent with our localization data and with the known functions of other AAA proteins As part of this role the function of the highly extended D E rich domain in midasin could be to interact with positively charged nuclear protein substrates in a manner analogous to the acidic regions of the nuclear transport GTPase Ran 51 the nuclear transporter Tpr 52 and the chromatin remodeling proteins of the SWI SNF family 53 However there are alternative possibilities that need to be considered At least part of the present dearth of direct information linking midasin to a specific cell function seems likely to be a consequence of its unusually high molecular weight Many libraries used in genetic complementation screens do not contain inserts as large as 15 kb and so would be unable to detect midasin Adequate migration of the 560 kDa midasin polypeptide on electrophoresis gels requires use of lower percentage gels than standard especially if blotting is involved Without such special handling midasin may have been undetected in some cell fractionation experiments However the recent increased availability of high sensitivity mass spectrometry for peptide identification greatly lessens the difficulty of detecting midasin in semi purified cell fractions It is to be expected that more detailed information about its function will be available shortly Conclusions The highly conserved structure of midasin in eukaryotes taken in conjunction with its nuclear localization in yeast suggests that midasin may function as a nuclear chaperone and be involved in the assembly disassembly of macromolecular complexes in the nucleus However other possibilities remain to be evaluated The AAA domain of midasin is evolutionarily related to that of dynein but it appears to lack a microtubule binding site Materials and methods Sequence determination The sequence of the human midasin gene has been determined from PCR amplified fragments of cDNA from human testis Clontech We used regions of amino acid sequence conserved between the midasin genes in yeast and Schizosaccharomyces pombe to make a rough map of the gene onto the August 2001 freeze of the assembled human genome with the public domain Blat server at http genome ucsd edu index html 54 55 The resultant partial nucleotide sequence identified about four fifths of the exons and was used to design the requisite PCR primers to verify all exon intron boundaries in the gene by physical sequencing of appropriate PCR amplified cDNA fragments The midasin gene in Giardia intestinalis accession AF494287 was cloned in silico from sets 1 11 of the unassembled genomic nucleotide sequences kindly made available by the Giardia Genome Project 11 Regions of conserved amino acid sequence in the human and yeast genes for midasin were used as input to the Tblastn server at Genbank 56 to identify clones that encoded homologous regions in Giardia These starting clones were extended by repeated cycles of searching to obtain neighboring overlapping clones until the complete coding sequence of midasin was included The resultant sequence was supported by double stranded raw data with a depth of four fold or greater over approximately 85 of the gene The sequence of the remaining regions was verified by physical sequencing of PCR amplified fragments of genomic DNA Sequence alignment The overall alignment of the six AAA protomers in midasin from human yeast and Giardia was created by first making separate alignment of the three organisms for each of the six AAA protomers The resultant six partial alignments were then combined by using with the profile alignment procedure of ClustalX 57 with the Blosum100 scoring matrix The overall alignment of the midasin M domain from humans yeast and Giardia with other MIDAS containing proteins three Mg chelatases and the I domains of three integrins was created by first aligning the midasins Mg chelatases and integrins separately with the program T Coffee 58 The resultant three partial alignments were then combined by the profile alignment procedure of ClustalX as above Tagging of the midasin gene in yeast Diploid strain DDY1102 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with genotype Mat a his3

TCGTGTAGTA AACCTCCTCT TCTTGGTTTT CACGATATAC GAATTCGAGC TCGTTTAAAC 3 The site of subsequent integration by homologous recombination was verified by PCR amplification with one primer located in the transformation cassette and the second primer located in the midasin gene The resultant MDN1 HA MDN1 diploid strain was sporulated and the tetrads dissected Haploid MDN1 HA clones for subsequent work were derived from tetrads that had yielded 4 viable spores with the anticipated mixture of genotypes In order to confirm the yeast database entry indicating that the MDN1 YLR106C gene is essential for viability in yeast we performed tetrad analysis of the heterozygous midasin knock out strain CMEY072 HE Mat a ura3 52 ura3 52 his3D1 his3D1 leu2 3_112 leu2 3_112 trp1 289 trp1 289 MDN1 4 14727 kanMX4 MDN1 obtained from EuroScarf PCR was used to verify that one copy of the midasin gene had been deleted and replaced with the selectable marker After sporulation and tetrad dissection all 15 of the 15 tetrads dissected yielded 2 viable spores In a parallel analysis of the wild type strain CEN PK2 dissection yielded 9 tetrads with 4 viable spores 1 tetrad with 3 viable spores and 1 tetrad with 2 viable spores average germination 93 These data confirm the database entry that the MDN1 gene is required for viability in Saccharomyces Western Blots Cultures of the haploid yeast containing MDN1 HA or MDN1 were harvested in log phase The cells were washed once with buffer containing 50 mM Tris HCl pH7 5 100 mM NaCl 1 mM EGTA and 4 mM MgSO 4 Cells were then resuspended in 0 6 ml of the same buffer plus 1 mercaptoethanol 0 5 mM phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride 50 g ml leupeptin 4 g ml aprotinin and 15 l ml of protease inhibitor cocktail P8215 Sigma After the cells had been homogenized by vortexing with glass beads for 2 5 min at 4 C they were centrifuged for 2 min at 1000 g to remove the glass beads and large cell debris The resultant supernatant was then centrifuged for 20 min at 18

were probed with monoclonal antibody against the HA tag H9658 Sigma diluted 1 11 000 in PBSB 0 14 M NaCl 1 bovine serum albumin 0 05 Tween 20 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 7 4 for 1 2 hrs at room temperature Blots were then incubated with anti mouse peroxidase linked secondary antibody 170 6516 BioRad for 1 hr at a dilution of 1 4 000 in PBSB Immunocytochemistry Haploid yeast was grown to log phase and fixed with 4 formaldehyde for 1 hr Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with buffer containing 40 mM potassium phosphate pH 7 5 0 5 mM MgCl 2 and 1 2 M sorbitol Cell walls were digested for 20 30 min at 29 C with 50 g ml Zymolyase 100 T in the same buffer with the addition of 2 l ml mercaptoethanol Cells were attached to poly lysine coated slides and dehydrated with methanol at 20 C for 6 min followed by acetone for approximately 30 sec at the same temperature After blocking in PBSB the cells were incubated with anti HA antibody H9658 Sigma at 1 900 in PBSB for 1 hr washed 3 4 times in PBSB buffer then incubated with anti mouse antibody linked to Texas Red Molecular Probes at 1 600 in PBSB for 1 hr The cells were then washed 3 4 times in PBSB and mounted in Gel Mount biomeda containing 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole DAPI at 1 10 000 under cover slips Cells were visualized on a Zeiss Axiovert S100 microscope with a 63X objective Data were analyzed using Openlab software Improvision In all preparations control samples of haploid yeast containing the MDN1 wt gene were processed identically in order to confirm the specificity of antibody staining In some cases samples of MDN HA yeast were processed with the primary HA antibody omitted as an additional control Authors contributions JEG performed the experimental work on yeast and performed or
