 The Swimmer By Michael Collier posted Wednesday Aug 12 1998 To hear the poet read The Swimmer click Nothing like him in Bosch or Breugel nothing so denatured as to resemblenot a semblance of a human facebut the substance of some form made and then unmade or like a lump of human butter excavated from a bog His eyes askew aligned by a jagged axis that must have balanced once across the fulcrum of his nose The pupils deep and lost but ever seeinglike water in a well at night The head misshapen like a too ripe melon dimpled by the forceps mark of his accident or whatever extracted him from normalcy dipped him in the searing crushing waters of disfigurement and then returned himto the world to fill it with the childish worrying sound working its way from his mouth that s not so much a mouthas a coin purse cinched tight sewnwith the fragments of his lips the yipping gait of breathlessness he makes which makes no sense without the fluttering exuberance of his hands that come to rest delicately on my shoulders as if to say Help tie the drawstring of my suit shoulder my towel fit these sandals to my feet and lead me to the pool where you will see how struggling to be what I am I become otter seal dolphin released from myself though not absolved not ever able to hide the fin or the fluke my feet webbed and unwebbed
