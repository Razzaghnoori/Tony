 okay let s see i think uh i guess since i call i m supposed to start i think that s the way everybody has done it so far okay but anyway i i think that um we are paying a lot in taxes but i think that we have a government and we have a lot of freedoms and we have a lot of things that uh you know the governments doing with our money um we re probably one of the the only countries in the world that has all the things that we have the you know as far as the quality of the streets the school systems um the hospital stuff that the the government gives money to um the you know all the things that the government does like that i uh i think they need to manage it a little bit better but i don t think uh anybody is just going to come in and fix it in a couple of weeks because they ve been messing it up for many years now so yeah well i have to agree that and and you re right i mean we you know we do have a good government we do have a lot of things that you know show that the taxes are there to support but i do think they re mismanaged and i think that sometimes it s too easy of a i don t know to easy of an answer it seems to the politician to say i ll tax them if you can t get enough money instead of trying to figure out how to cut budgets or cut spending or or you know get all of the waste out of the spending um hum um i don t know what y all are paying in Dallas but you know it seems like we pay the state you know there is a the taxes is set by you know the the state and the city can add theirs and the county adds theirs and you know we re paying almost eight percent sales tax right now which seems to me nuts i came from California yeah and you know when i left there we paid six cents on the dollar and that was like one of the highest in the nation right i think it s seven here or seven point something yeah yeah ours is seven point seven five almost eight and it drives me crazy i m thinking you know everybody is sitting here screaming about yeah we don t want a state income tax but yet they allow the sales tax to go up and up and up and up and they don t do anything about it um hum right do where are you at what state so i m in Lubbock Texas yeah oh really yeah there s we re still we still one of few that don t have the uh state tax taxes that s true and i did pay state tax in in California but my goodness that that the what do you call it sales tax is just getting outrageous to pay yeah that s true know you don t sound like you re from Dallas where do you come do you come from originally Texas or yeah yeah i do i ve lived in in the Dallas area here since i was like four so uh it s i don t know rural an urban area i guess whatever i don t know what i m oh okay you just you just managed to escape the real Texan accent i thought maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there yeah no no i ve just lived here but yeah i don t know i i do i can think of all the uh the biblical things about it too where what did they say to uh i can t think of the scripture Render unto Caesar s what is Caesar s so that s right you know even uh i think even in the the story where they had to pay the taxes the disciples and uh Jesus said the money in the fish s mouth or in the fish s inside the fish yeah and uh i thought of those two things when i was i was holding for a long time yeah yeah oh were you really trying to find someone at home well you know um back then what they try to do you know the would always try to stump Jesus try to give him something that would contradict himself right and so that s what they were trying to do with the tax situation and of course that s when he said well you render unto Caesar s what is Caesar s you render unto God what is God s and uh right and you know of course there i don t think they really cared about the answer they just wanted to try and catch him in something right get in yeah but i you know i believe in paying taxes and i mean yeah like everybody else i try to you know take as many deductions as i can that right and honest you know i don t want to pay more than i have to and and i get outraged sometimes when i feel like they go up for useless reasons but i believe that they re necessary you know so i really do oh sure sure right um hum right where do do uh do you deal with taxes much in what you do when you work or yeah are no not really i i we ve i spends a lot of time with our income tax though this especially this year and last year um i have been married for just a few years so i ve had to really switch around from the EZ form to the um just a regular right all the deductions and all that schedule A well yeah and you know did you notice that when they passed the new simplified tax act it seemed like it made everything harder yeah it really did i i saw that too i didn t notice anything simplified about it except that they took away the deductions for the interest and other things right right that s we re looking at buying a house and that s one of the main uh pluses we have about buying a house is yeah and it will help tremendously we bought ours five years ago and it s the one thing it seems like you make those payments every month and at the end of the year you ve paid all interest and no principles yeah um hum right so that will definitely help in taxes and what you will get back yeah yeah you know there s a thing i just i ve been trying to learn as much as i can about it if if you pay i i know i get paid twice a month every two weeks instead of twice a month so i get twenty six paychecks which would come out to be in like thirteen months uh huh uh huh that s right so if you pay your uh rent or your house payment every two weeks instead of once a month you ll come out paying a uh huh uh one month extra every year and it ll if have you a thirty year note it will take like seven or plus years off of your note that s right that s right my parents uh bought a home in San Diego about four or five years ago and they did that they thought their payment is automatically taken out like every other Wednesday and that s exactly right even though the note is thirty years she said it s going be paid off in like twenty or twenty one years or something like that oh yeah um hum right yeah uh just because uh exactly what you said you re making one more months payment every year right right and that s going on the principle it doesn t pay any interest or usually usually it doesn t anyway yeah so that s that s a good way to do it and when we bought this house we looked at doing a fifteen year note because it it added more to the payment but not significant amounts you know it was it was a good payoff for being able to pay it off sooner yeah um hum um hum right that s what we re looking at fifteen or maybe twenty we re not going to go longer than twenty yeah yeah but we re taking our time we re going uh try to make our decision by July well that s good though so and we just started two or three weeks ago and we re not going to just kill ourselves you know just two or three houses a week at the most yeah and well that s good though is it kind of a buyers market down there you ll be yeah uh yeah absolutely and the credit union has nine percent interest so yeah so that s well that s good that s pretty excellent i don t know we couldn t think of a better time to buy than now that s good but anyway well um i can t think of a whole lot more to say well i can t either i appreciate the call though yeah me too and uh yeah same here my wife uh she went to uh the school out there in Lubbock um
