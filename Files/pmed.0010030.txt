                            Nevirapine and efavirenz are the most commonly prescribed of the class of antiretroviral        drugs called nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors NNRTIs Efavirenz has the        advantage of oncedaily dosing In a recent study called the NN study Lancet          it appeared to be only marginally superior to nevirapine in terms of clinical        success and virological suppression Van Leth and colleagues have now shown that while        nevirapine and efavirenz both raise highdensity lipoprotein HDL cholesterol the good        type of cholesterol the overall lipid profile is better with nevirapine than with        efavirenz        These data suggest that nevirapine may be preferable to efavirenz in HIVinfected        adults with other cardiovascular risk factors says the studys academic editor Andrew        Carr of St Vincents Hospital in Darlinghurst Australia However perceived        cardiovascular risk is only one factor that would affect the choice between these two        drugs        Van Leth and colleagues prospectively analyzed the lipids of patients enrolled in the        NN study a randomized openlabel efficacy study that included adults with HIV who had        never been on antiretroviral drugs All patients were given stavudine and lamivudine and        were then randomized into three treatment groups nevirapine efavirenz or both        For the lipid analysis which was preplanned the researchers included only the        nevirapine and efavirenz groups  and  patients respectively This was because the        NN study showed that simultaneous use of nevirapine and efavirenz should be avoidedthe        combination is associated with increased toxicity without increased efficacy The increase        in HDL cholesterol was significantly higher with nevirapine than with efavirenz There was        a decrease in the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol with nevirapine and an        increase with efavirenz        The study does not prove however that the rise in HDL cholesterol seen with NNRTIs        especially nevirapine actually leads to a reduction in coronary heart disease There are        no vascular functional data says Carr or clinical vascular endpoint data that confirm        that the statistically significant lipid differences observed are clinically        significant        The study was funded by Boehringer Ingelheim the manufacturer of nevirapine The        authors clearly state that the company had a nonbinding input on issues of study design        and analyses but it had no influence on reporting of the data or the decision to        publish        Despite its limitations van Leth and colleagues study moves clinicians and patients        away from onesizefitsall antiretroviral therapy says Carr It takes us further        along the path of choice of antiretroviral therapy being individualized according to other        patient comorbidities and risk factors as well as therapy simplicity and side        effects
