 Nicey Nicey If you grew up in the 1950s as I did it s nearly impossible to watch the rise of the Internet without thinking back to the rise of television way back when A powerful new technology occasioned an enormous amount of hyperventilation about the new medium s potential as an agent of change change it almost goes without saying that would demonstrably improve the society Television would be the greatest educational force ever created It would not just entertain but also enlighten High mindedness would reign Et cetera et cetera Some five decades have passed and we know all about television now We know for instance that while television s effect on society has been large it hasn t been especially high minded Television has come to be much more about sweeps week than about uplifting the culture It seems fair to say that in part as a result of our experience with television we tend to shy away from making grandiose claims for new technologies anymore We ve become warier It s been a long time since we ve fallen for the grand promise of a new technological marvel Which is why the hoopla surrounding the Internet is so bewildering Where is all that hard won cynicism that now marks the American character It vanishes as soon as the subject turns to the Internet and its alleged power to transform our lives Suddenly we are innocents again just as in the 1950s willing to believe just about any claim about the Internet s promise Not only can the Internet help free citizens from the tyranny of oppressive governments not only can it make investors wealthier and citizens more active and students more eager to learn but it can also enhance the experience of watching a ballgame by allowing you to interact with a commentator while the game is still going on I m still trying to figure out why anybody would want to do that More surprising yet Internet proselytizing is often led by actual smart people people like Esther Dyson Dyson is without question one of the computer industry s Really Big Thinkers She s on a first name basis with all the computer moguls In her acknowledgments she coyly thanks all the Bills I have known Her industry confabs drip with cachet And her newsletter Release 1 0 may well be the single most indispensable publication in all of technologydom full of insightful analysis and trend spotting in the best sense of the word Her profile is high enough that the publisher felt justified in putting her face on the cover of her new book which is titled Release 2 0 Dyson says that the paperback edition when it comes out will be called Release 2 1 Cute Unfortunately the sharpness that characterizes her newsletter is nowhere to be found in her book I live on the Net writes Dyson and it shows For one thing her prose more closely resembles a series of e mail missives than a rigorous argument All that e mailing she does appears to have caused her to forget how to write more than four consecutive paragraphs at a time More crucially her design for living in the digital age as the subtitle puts it comes across as a cross between New Age philosophy and 1950s hyperbole Critical thinking has been replaced by wishful thinking What Dyson essentially believes is that if we would just embrace the Net we could make the world a better place Really For instance the Net will help create wonderful communities of like minded people whose interactions are spirited but always fair minded just like Dyson s interactions with the Net communities she s involved in This will happen because people will gravitate toward communities where they share interests and respect the views of others in the community Dyson never quite gets around to explaining what happens to those who tend to disrupt those nurturing Net communities She believes the Net will allow those who want freedom to be able to work on their own terms without sacrificing as much as they must today In other words the Net will free people from the need to work for large organizations in order to make a decent living In Dyson s view this will be particularly good for obnoxious people People who aren t much fun to work with will be able to become more independent is how she phrases it And on and on The Net will foster truth telling and fuller disclosure in all sorts of areas It will allow people to be anonymous when it suits them and to be themselves when that suits them If people s secrets are somehow revealed on the Net well that could be good too At the same time we may all become more tolerant if everyone s flaws are more visible And my personal favorite Dyson believes that the explosion of Internet content will somehow bring back new respect for people for personal attention for service and for human interaction Underlying all her prognostications on work security privacy and so on is one central and rather circular idea If the Internet is going to live up to its potential says Dyson we need to be nicer to each other As she puts it One purpose of this book is to encourage people to make the mainstream of cyberspace nice enough that people will want to live their social lives there But she also seems to believe that if we would start spending more of our social lives on the Net that would help make us nicer since the culture of the Internet will inevitably foster niceness Niceness in fact permeates this book everything Dyson says she tries to say as nicely as possible This is true even when she s conceding that not everyone in cyberspace is as nice as she is It may not be nice to say it she writes at one point but people are not all always nice and therefore a little social pressure can be a good thing See how nice that was There are two problems with this emphasis on niceness one small and one large The small problem is that as virtues go niceness is wildly overrated Nice books for instance are usually bland books as this one is More to the point for people who are trying to get something done too much niceness is likely to get in the way Very few of Dyson s Silicon Valley CEO friends are nice except maybe to her The larger problem is that the Internet is simply not going to make us nicer people nor are we going to become nicer just because we want to see the Internet reach its full potential The notion is ludicrous on the face of it No matter how much information gets loaded into it the Internet is never going to transform the dynamics of human behavior At least not for the better In fact the evidence thus far is quite depressing in this regard As anyone who has spent any time in a chat room knows the bad tends to drive out the good Which when you think about it is pretty much the way it happens in the offline world My own bet is that by 2004 a year in which Dyson places many of her predictions books like hers will seem like artifacts from a more gullible age We won t be making extravagant claims for the Internet anymore but will accept that it s just a tool sometimes extremely useful sometimes not Some of what is on it will be very good a lot of it will be junk It ll be just like television And no one will be nicer
