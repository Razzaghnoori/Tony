        do you do you have a lot of credit cards   um no i have i have two actually   well thats all i have too   yeah i um one of them one of them i use one of them i dont uh one of them is like an American Airlines thing where you get free mileage   oh yeah ive heard about those   i yeah its pretty good i use that and i got im close to a free plane ticket anywhere in the United States   oh thats nice   and and the other one is uh um a credit card i got it was a while ago i got it like a free gold card and its good if i ever rent a car it pays for uh it pays for the insurance   oh really     so i keep that i never use that one but i happen to be going on vacation soon and im going to be renting a car so ill put it on that card and then if i got an accident they would pay for the insurance yeah they would pay for the accident   really really yeah i only have two one of mines a gas card that i use just for my gas to and from work and the other ones a Visa for emergencies only       yeah   like if i go on trips and stuff i take it with me in case my car breaks down or something but other than that i keep it locked up   yeah i never i never uh like i always pay you know like sometimes i use it out of convenience but i dont i dont run like on a a monthly balance you know i always pay whatever it is that that month   yeah i just i make it a habit not even to carry my Visa because ive seen too many of my friends get in deep financial trouble with it   um yeah well you cant it sometimes it easy i live in in in New York City and uh if youre going to go out and buy something for a hundred two hundred dollars not that its such a dangerous place but you know i just sometimes i dont feel that comfortable carrying a lot of money around so its good to have a credit card to pay for it with that um i use it for that where you live in LA   yeah no thank heavens i live in National City which is almost as bad   where is that   National City its outside of San Diego   oh okay okay   and unfortunately theres a lot of gangs around here so its like i dont carry money and i dont carry credit cards   right uh yeah its probably a good idea but uh yeah but i i dont mind i i dont see what the big deal is with um i i i couldnt see spending more than i had to pay the bill with because eventually its going to catch up with you   i know i dont see how people can do that either but i know a lot of my friends have gotten in trouble deep trouble with them and its like well whyd you guys do it oh well its so easy to use   right   and its like yeah its easy to use but you have to pay for it you know  didnt this dawn on you but   sure sure   i got my credit cards through a guarantee agency do you know what that is   right uh no   you give them you put so much money in an annuity and it guarantees your credit card like say if something happened to you they could still pay off the balance with whats in there   right thats cool   and whatever your limit is you keep that much in your annuity fund and its worked pretty good for what ive had it for about five years now and you can take the annuity out the money out of the annuity if you want to but its just there like you know in case you died suddenly or something   right right   you know they wouldnt be stuck with the bill   cool cool that thats   so i like it that way   yeah you know they get paid for if youre dead right you know   yeah at least they wont be coming after my husband you know saying hey your wifes charged so much money on this credit card we want the money   thats true but then again you dont have to deal with him if youre dead so   no but       i dont know i wouldnt want to leave him and my kids in that kind of a situation   thats true thats true   but ill tell you what it comes in real handy when youve got kids cause we went we went on a trip to Arizona we drove there and the car broke down and it was me and my husband and our two kids in that car and Arizona is really hot     right   and its like you know if we didnt have that Visa we wouldve been stuck there in that heat for heaven knows how long   yeah that was like yeah like like the first time i ever got a credit card was for that reason because i was in uh where the heck was i i forget where i was i know i was in Europe one time and they ran out of money but i couldnt get money on my credit card either oh i was up i was dating a woman upstate New York and i was up in uh upstate and i had been in college and i guess i took like a hundred two hundred dollars with me or whatever at that time time maybe fifty bucks was enough to live on for a week but i  i took some money with me and i ran out of money like at the end of the first weekend i was supposed to be there for a week   yeah huh   and i needed to i called up my father and i said dad you know go to my bank account and withdraw a couple of hundred bucks or whatever it was and could you send it Western Union and it was a pain in the neck i had to like wait till Monday and you know wait till the office opened and it took time and everything became a pain so what i did was i uh   yeah   so what i did right after that is i got myself a credit card in case it ever happened again i can always you know buy something on the credit card and and not have to worry about carrying cash around   yeah   so that was about ten ten twelve years ago and ive always had one since and like you said for that reason its its easy you know if you need the cash i couldnt imagine
