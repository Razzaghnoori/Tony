 Background A synthetic form of EPO human recombinant EPO has been successfully used to treat anemia in patients with chronic renal failure and HIV 1 Some randomized trials RCT assessed the role of EPO in anemia related the cancer 2 3 However many of these trials were underpowered and failed to identify clinically meaningful benefits of EPO treatment As a result there has been persistent uncertainty about the efficacy of EPO as a treatment for cancer related anemia despite the introduction of EPO in a clinical practice almost a decade ago Systematic reviews SR are the best way to offer synthesis of evidence and are of special utility in settings where many small trials fail to achieve a significant result 4 A recent comprehensive SR 5 6 addressed the role of EPO in treatment related anemia in cancer patients This SR included non randomized studies and performed a meta analysis MA of 12 RCTs showing a significant effect of EPO in reducing the need to transfuse patients who are receiving chemotherapy Although comprehensive some issues were not addressed in this previous SR MA a formal quantitative synthesis meta analysis was not performed according to different clinical aspects and to main methodological quality dimensions empirically linked to bias 7 In contrast to this previous report 5 6 in this SR we evaluated only data from randomized studies We also investigated a broad range of clinical issues including EPO use according to the level of hemoglobin hb platinum based chemotherapy and tumor type Finally to investigate the stability of our conclusions a broad methodological appraisal of the quality of the trials was performed specifically examining those dimensions that have been empirically linked to bias 7 We also performed a conservative cumulative meta analysis CMA 8 to determine the earliest point in time when the use of EPO versus placebo reached a such statistical significance after which the uncertainty 9 about the effect of EPO in cancer related anemia could have been considered resolved Methods A previous SR served as a basis for location of the articles of interest 5 We also performed a search of MEDLINE LILACS and CANCERLIT databases last update in July of 2001 using the optimal search strategy for RCT for use in MEDLINE 10 and LILACS 11 with the additional terms related to this review epoetin OR Erythropoietin and cancer OR neoplasm in all fields We included only RCTs that compared EPO versus no therapy or placebo in cancer related anemia We excluded studies related to transplant setting and myelodysplastic syndrome since the physiopathology of these diseases is different more linked to pancytopenia than to anemia 1 We also excluded trials that used EPO with the primary objective to magnify hb to improve the efficacy of radiotherapy Four trials described more than one comparison of different doses of EPO with only one control group 12 13 14 15 We approached these multi arm studies in two different ways in the first each EPO arm was compared to the control arm In the second we combined all active arms in one by adding all EPO treated patients and analyzed it against the control Both combinations achieved virtually the same result and data are presented using the second method Data were abstracted on patient characteristics type of tumor treatment details and the major methodological quality dimensions 4 7 see Additional file 1 The end point studied was the number of patients requiring transfusions Results in a conventional meta analysis were pooled using the Peto s Odds Ratio OR and relative risk RR both in a fixed effect model 16 We also extracted data on adverse effects of the use of EPO Additional file Table 1 Characteristics of included studies Click here for file Heterogeneity among trials was assessed using chi square test chi The possibility of publication bias was assessed using the funnel plot method 17 To assess the reasons for any heterogeneity found we performed a meta regression 4 Sensitivity and subgroup analyses according to the main methodological quality dimensions 7 and a number of clinical criteria were also performed see fig 2and 3 The results were calculated with corresponding 95 confidence interval 95 CI When the results from pooled data were significant we calculated the number of patients need to treat NNT 18 in order to prevent one transfusion However the readers are advised to exercise due caution because NNT and NNH number of patients to harm are more influenced by the baseline risk in a control group than the odds ratio The qualitative conclusion of the authors was assessed using the method described by Gilberts and Colditz 19 20 and adapted to a six point scale where 1 control group highly preferred 2 control preferred to EPO treatment 3 about equal EPO a disappointment 4 about equal EPO a success 5 EPO preferred to control and 6 EPO highly preferred Finally we performed a cumulative meta analysis CMA 8 using a conservative approach setting the error at 1 with a two tailored p in a random effects model 21 The CMA allowed us to determine the point when the results achieved a level of statistical significance after which we should expect no changes in the effect by performing new trials and after which placebo controlled trials should not have been performed In other words CMA allowed us to determine the threshold point after which uncertainty about this question should have been considered resolved 9 Results Thirty seven randomized articles addressing the use of EPO in cancer related anemia were located and retrieved for full text appraisal Twenty one papers fit our inclusion criteria Two articles describing two small trials 22 23 with a total of 79 patients were excluded from our analysis because they did not provide information regarding our end point of interest Nineteen articles 2 3 12 13 14 15 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 describing 21 trials see Additional file 1 fit our inclusion criteria One paper 3 described three different trials two of which 24 26 were reported later in separate papers We included data from these latest papers only Therefore we included 19 trials from 19 articles with 1896 patients in cancer related anemia Fourteen trials with a total of 1511 patients described the use of EPO in patients with hb level 11 5 g dl and five trials with 369 patients related to hb level 11 5 g dl Of the latter ones one trial 14 included patients with hb ranging from 10 6 to 12 0 g dl The analysis did not change when we excluded this trial in the sensitivity analysis The possibility of publication bias was considered unlikely according to the visual inspection of the funnel plot 17 The results of the critical appraisal according to the most important methodological quality dimensions of each article are shown in see Additional file 1 No single trial met all methodological quality criteria All trials scored five or six on the six point Gilbert 19 and Colditz 20 scales denoting strong qualitative support in favor of EPO see Additional file 1 The meta analysis of the 19 trials Fig 1and 3 showed a significant beneficial effect of EPO in diminishing the number of patients requiring transfusion OR 0 41 95 CI 0 33 to 0 5 p 0 00001 without statistical heterogeneity chi 23 46 df 18 p 0 1 When we used relative risk fig 3 as a summary point estimate in the meta analysis the results remained significant RR 0 61 95 CI 0 54 to 0 68 p 0 00001 but now with significant statistical heterogeneity chi 37 56 df 18 p 0 0044 However when the study by Porter et al 29 was removed from the analysis heterogeneity disappeared from the analysis and the analysis according to OR or RR did not differ This is likely because in this small study including 10 patients in each group event rate was so high with all but one patient receiving transfusion To further explain heterogeneity we also performed a metaregression 4 The variables related to the design and clinical features which possible could affect the treatment effect of EPO were entered in the equation see Additional file 1 We found no statistically significant association between any of the variables with the treatment effect of EPO when all data were simultaneously entered in a multiregression equation data not shown However when a stepwise regression model was used two variables emerged of the potential significance which could explain most the heterogeneity of our results in adequacy of allocation concealment p 0 026 and Hb cut off value of 11 5 g dl p 0 046 The between study variation tau2 estimate was 0 0372 for the model containing no variables i e the simple meta analysis this was reduced to almost zero in the final model In addition most likely explanation of heterogeneity seen in our study is related to a small sample size of the individual trials resulting in random fluctuation of the effect between the studies When we divided the trials according to the hb level using 11 5 g dl as a cut off point the results remained essentially unchanged i e highly significant in favor of EPO fig 2and 3 Thus it appears that the effect of EPO is a rather robust despite heterogeneity noted in the meta analysis Sensitivity and subgroup analyses according to clinical and methodological quality dimensions Fig 2and 3 showed consistency in the results favoring the use of EPO Statistical heterogeneity was noted for some of these comparisons see fig 2and 3 It was related to the magnitude of the treatment effect and not to its significance since in all trials the point estimate of the effect favored EPO A stepwise metaregression analysis did point to the possibility that treatment effect could have been exaggerated by inadequacy in allocation concealment and that larger treatment effects are seen at hb level 11 5 g dl The heterogeneity was more common when we used RR than when we used OR The overall result by pooling all trials indicates that for each 5 cancer patients 95 CI 4 to 7 using EPO one patient will avoid transfusion This result is maintained when we separately analyzed the trials that included patients with hb level 11 5 g dl NNT 5 95 CI 4 to 8 and Hb 11 5 g dl NNT 5 95 CI 3 to 9 These NNT should be analyzed carefully since they were calculated from a pool of data that in some analysis were not homogeneous We also performed a CMA fig 4 using a conservative approach i e setting error at 1 Our CMA demonstrated that by 1995 a high level of significance OR 0 52 99 CI 0 28 to 0 97 p 0 0068 RR 0 69 99 CI 0 53 to 0 90 p 0 0003 about the benefit of EPO on reducing the use of blood transfusions had been achieved Beyond this point all new trials only improved the precision without adding any additional useful information We estimated that 1240 patients representing 65 of the total number of cancer patients who participated in EPO studies were enrolled in 13 placebo controlled randomized studies that were reported after 1995 The previous SR 5 concluded that it was impossible to reasonably distinguish between adverse events related to EPO and concurrent treatments We also tried to extract data on adverse events but were unable to make a reasonable approach due to the poor reporting Therefore we decided not to tabulate data on adverse events and perform quantitative pooling Discussion According to our overall analysis administration of EPO is related to an average 59 reduction in odds of requiring a transfusion A previous SR 5 6 pooled 12 trials that used subcutaneous EPO all also included in our analysis in a Bayesian MA reached results similar OR 0 38 95 CI 0 28 to 0 51 to ours We could also demonstrate consistency of the results when analyzed according to OR RR various quality dimensions and many different clinical settings fig 2and 3 Due to these EPO effects patients with cancer are expected to have direct benefits through fewer transfusions and lower exposure to anemia effects Furthermore all patients will benefit indirectly through conservation of the blood supply The use of RR as summary statistics is less robust than OR 4 and in this case resulted in greater heterogeneity than the analysis based on OR see fig 2and 3 The estimate the effects of EPO using RR indicated a smaller effect than OR but both results were significant p 0 0001 in both analysis However when events are common the OR may overestimate the effect of treatment 4 Due to these characteristics of the analysis we choose to show both OR and RR as a summary statistics Nevertheless we should mention see the RESULTS that the most of heterogeneity could be explained by high transfusion rates in the trial by Porter et al and inadequacy of allocation concealment in EPO trials Similarly it appears that the larger treatment effects are seen when EPO is given in the patients with hb 11 5 g dl Because it was not possible to extract data on quality of life QOL this issue was not addressed here However a recent systematic review by Bottomley et al 37 indicated that solid evidence about the effect of EPO on this end point is lacking We should also mention that the high cost of EPO has deterred its widespread acceptance 5 and more studies using economic analysis should be done to address the issue if the use of EPO is cost effective A previous SR 5 6 found no increased incidence of adverse events of EPO when compared with controls We also did not find any side effect of EPO consistently reported among trials Our main goal here is to stress that the basic ethical requirement to randomize patients in clinical trials is that physicians and patients must not have preferences for any of the therapies considered i e they should be in the state of uncertainty or equipoise 9 If uncertainty does not exist it is felt to be unethical to ask patients to participate in RCTs 9 To assess if uncertainty regarding a clinical question exists researchers should evaluate the totality of pre existing knowledge if we already knew that one treatment is superior to another nothing new could be learned and we would unnecessarily expose our patients to already known inferior treatment by performing a new trial We showed here that if a SR CMA had been used to formally address the uncertainty regarding the effect of EPO in cancer patients this uncertainty could have been conservatively considered resolved Fig 4 since 1995 Our findings suggest that 65 of the cancer patients included in this SR participated in placebo controlled clinical trials that were reported after EPO was shown to be superior to placebo Had a CMA been performed prospectively it is possible that clinical trialists may have decided against initiating 13 clinical trials We should note that we analyzed trials according to date of their report It is conceivable that some trials were initiated before 1995 but were reported after 1995 However this only means that the uncertainty about the role of EPO could have been solved even earlier if these patients were available for CMA or a large RCT For example if all 656 patients included in randomized studies up to 1995 had participated in only one large randomized study the uncertainty about EPO could have been solved earlier An alternative approach to large studies in solving uncertainty is to use CMA to monitor accumulation of treatment effects in clinical trials 38 The technique of CMA is a powerful scientific instrument to assess the significance of accumulated knowledge 8 38 In more than 100 CMA performed there has never been a single case where the point estimate switched to indicate the opposite effect once the difference between treatments reached statistical significance 8 Conclusion EPO is highly effective for cancer related anemia This effect could have been detected in 1995 if CMA had been performed at that time The techniques of CMA should be used more frequently in the future to preserve the uncertainty principle 9 and protect patients who consent to be randomized in clinical trials Competing interests No funding or honoraria were provided for this work to any of the authors CB and BD
