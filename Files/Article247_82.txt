 The Hell of Gates Jr This week s New Yorker is light on ads Chatterbox picked it up and for a second thought it was the New Republic but thick with highbrow Clintophilic rationalization in the form of an essay by Henry Louis Gates Jr You thought Flytrap was about sex and perjury Wrong It s really about the decline of loyalty among former Clinton aides like George Stephanopoulos and Leon Panetta and the nefarious spread of atomistic individuals loyal to an abstract uniform set of principles such as impartial truth Kenneth Starr is the embodiment of these inhuman principles the Enlightenment s curse All poor Clinton was doing was trying to struggle with the gummy vexed exigencies of the merely human Well Gates is right about the gummy part for sure Three questions though 1 Who says there s more disloyalty in this scandal Chatterbox carries no water for George Stephanopoulos see 1 25 and 2 2 But his sin is less his disloyalty in acknowledging a potential crime by his ex patron than his failure to confess his own complicity in that crime Overall the striking thing about Flytrap is not how much disloyalty there has been but how little Nobody from inside the administration has yet broken ranks though there have been rumblings from cabinet secretaries Rubin and Riley There is no John Dean no Deep Throat Compare those Watergate betrayals with the watered down subversion of Stephanopoulos and Panetta which amounted to saying on television what was obvious that Clinton is in trouble unless he explains himself soon and you would conclude that loyalty has been on the rise since the Nixon years Maybe what has changed is we no longer expect a loyal aide to admit even the obvious We re so accustomed to spin that common sense sounds like treason Gates includes a few to be sure paragraphs about Dean and then proceeds undeterred Like a thinking man s Johnny Apple he surveys various Kennedy and Johnson hacks even tracking down that familiar standby the unnamed Washington veteran and reaps a harvest of self congratulatory harrumphing along the lines of I come from an era when loyalty and gratitude were regally honored not like these young whippersnappers etc He cites JFK s secretary Evelyn Lincoln as one of the ancient paragons of loyalty the embodiment of the courtier s discretion Would that be the same Evelyn Lincoln who after JFK s death according to Slate s David Plotz circulated stories that Jackie had had adulterous trysts in the White House and spent the remaining 32 years badmouthing LBJ and Jackie See Plotz s piece Sounds a bit like Dick Morris defending Bill by badmouthing Hillary 2 Do we really want to place loyalty over truth Gates main straw man is one William Godwin who in 1793 argued that if you can rescue either your mother or Archbishop Fenelon from a burning house you go for the Archbishop since he has the greater social contribution to make Gates words In Gates essay those who would favor a stand of principle over the ties of blut and boden or even business whistle blowers antiwar dissenters anyone who says I often place my duty to society above my duty to my company are characterized as William Godwin types all letting their own dear mothers burn to a crisp with nary a second thought while they grandly escort some silk bedizened cleric to safety Worse they re selfish rootless cosmopolitans sorry they re selfish moral illuminati pursuing their own vision of individual authenticity of unbridled self assertion at the expense of family and group ties the intricately reciprocal character of a life lived within community Of course Gates comically stacks the deck with the Godwin example since Godwin asks that we rescue the cleric not in the name of truth but in the name of some sort of obnoxious aristocratic utilitarianism Nor is betraying Clinton exactly like burning your mother In reality of course it is Clinton s defenders who are making the utilitarian arguments about the overbalancing value of the president s greater social contribution A larger point concerns the value of loyalty whether to family community employer or other social group Is it really such a great thing Loyalty in this sense has given us wars racism tribalism and genocide Selfish uniform principles have given us science human rights and the Constitution The Enlightenment Individualism Take it away Leon Wieseltier 3 Even if Stephanopoulos should be loyal to Clinton why should the rest of us By the end of his piece Gates has subtly slipped from attacking ex aides who criticize Clinton to attacking anyone who criticizes Clinton We must all he says start learning to talk about right and wrong without recourse to abstract principles Anyone else is a mama barbecuing Ken Starr style fanatic Gates never explains why Chatterbox or any other ordinary voter owes Clinton the same loyalty as Stephanopoulos does If the charges against the president are true isn t it he who has betrayed us Chatterbox could go on and on Didn t Bill Clinton champion the very new economy of rootless skilled free agents the very disloyal types Gates claims threaten to subject the president to the laws that apply to other Americans Would we have been better served in Vietnam if fewer officials had quit the Johnson administration to protest the war or if more had quit earlier and more loudly Why should we spend valuable time reading the journalism of Henry Louis Gates Jr if he is happy to place his loyalty to his family his race his colleagues to The New Yorker to the academic empire he s building at Harvard over an annoying abstract principle like truth Maybe Chatterbox has seen On the Waterfront too many times But should we really root for the guys who poison Marlon Brando s pigeons
