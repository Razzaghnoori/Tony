 I was born Sara Ann Snyder in Vicksburg Lou Mississippi excuse me The reason I said Louisiana is because that s where I lived all of my life Everyone went to Vicksburg Mississippi to have their babies at the Mercy Hospital because we had no facilities in Lake Providence the most beautiful place on Earth surrounded by um lakes Cyprus trees good people right on the banks of the Mississippi And so when I was born my mom went over there and stayed 10 days in the hospital with her tummy strapped afterwards because that s the way you did it back in the 30 s to assure yourself of a flat tummy when you got home Um I grew up in a very um warm loving together traditional family Um good manners were extremely important my father would send us from the table if we laughed We all had special places at the dinner table and I being the oldest of four sat at the end opposite my father My mother sat to his left and he served the meat and she served the potatoes or rice and the vegetables and the food was passed around to everybody And at the end of dinner I would get to serve the dessert But if I would spill a glass of milk which I often did then I was sent from the table but I would often be tickled My father was extremely um uh firm but fair totally unemotional and maybe you might be surprised to hear that because I am extremely emotional And my mother on the other hand was a Darling this darling that I love you Constantly Constantly we were told how much we were loved and maybe that made a great um that was a great influence to me but on the other hand my dad um kept a level of of intensity a level of of uh of wanting to do the right thing always um especially to please everybody Um he died when I was 21 years old of a heart attack It was a congenital heart condition and I ve often thought that he would still be in my presence today had we had the medical advances then as we do now When I married my husband soon after well five months after he died I cried every night and didn t realize how much his presence was in my life until he was actually gone My mother was a beautiful woman Very very spoiled Always wanted her way about everything and she was courted by men of all ages after my dad died She remarried much to my dislike I don t think my younger sisters mind so much of the time they were young they were still in high school uh but my stepfather was a very nice man but he was 10 years older than my mom He was a party man and he had sort of a florid face and I it made me a little suspicious But it turned out that they were married actually longer than my mom and dad And I really began and continued to love him very much And his name was Don Um my brother and I were two years apart and I loved him but not until we were 13 I think 13 and 11 we were typically quarreling siblings We went to Florida on a family vacation one summer The only vacation by the way that my daddy ended up taking us because all the way from Louisiana to Miami Florida was almost too much for six people in a car to be together for a 10 day period But coming home we stopped in New Orleans and my dad had been on a roller coaster in San Francisco and he thought it was such fun and so we went to Pontchartrain Beach in New Orleans and that was nearing the end of the vacation and he said he wanted my brother Fred and me to go for the experience he thought it was going to be so much fun So we were all excited about it and got on My two younger sisters did not they were three and seven at the time so they were not made to do this And so we got on and as we climbed the first little hill it just looked wonderful we could look out over the over the beach and wave to Mom and Dad and Gay and Annette my sisters And then we got to the top and my brother and I were at either end of the seat we still were not too fond of being of sitting together so we got up and then suddenly in our lives began to flash in front of us we were going so fast Faster than the speed of sound I know And I looked at Fred and he looked at me and the only thing I could say Dear God if you will let me off of this thing then I will never ever again fuss with my brother And so with ashen faces we finally got back and I have never yet by the way been on another roller coaster That was many years ago And my brother and I from that day curiously became very close I don t know if it was a pact we both made I have no idea what he prayed for But um anyway that was an um early remembrance of family relationships I was extremely close to my sisters because I was 10 years older than the baby and I virtually called her my own I helped rear her because my mother played bridge Every it seemed like every day but every other day and she would have her lady friends and I would have to go in and tend to the babies and make sure that they were dry or had their pacifier or their bottle And then my sister Gay was seven years younger and I felt the same way about her And we ve remained close all through these years we re extremely close family We connect we talk Every little family happening we get on the phone Everybody has to know all of it whether it s good or bad and sometimes it is bad or naughty Um where was I I was talking about my sisters There are just so many things that I remember of my childhood Lake Providence was a town of about 5000 people And it was um lined with wonderful little um hometown small town stores My grandfather had a hardware stare and we all worked there My father was a graduate of LSU and majored in Physics and he opened a radio shop in the back of the store And I used to work there and I the most fond memory was that I had my own special number on the cash register which was a great big piece of equipment in the middle of the store And it s really strange but I still dream about that hardware store I love to um weigh nails If somebody wanted to come in and and purchase some type of hardware then I would get the nails put them in a sack and weigh them Then I would go to the cash register and punch my number in and hand ring the cash register That was really exciting
