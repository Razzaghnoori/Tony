 Background Cells of the innate immune system sense host invasion by detecting structural determinants that are broadly conserved among pathogens of a given phylogenetic group 1 The lipopolysaccharides LPS or endotoxin that decorate the outer membrane of Gram negative bacteria are excellent examples of such determinants In response to minute concentrations of LPS derived from certain Gram negative bacteria macrophages secrete cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor TNF interleukin 1 IL 1 and IL 6 which contribute to the containment of infection and help to initiate a specific immune response On the other hand overstimulation of the innate immune system through this channel can lead to acute systemic inflammation and shock 2 3 Dramatic differences in LPS responses are apparent between closely related species 4 and there are substantial differences even among genetically heterogeneous members of the same species 5 For example whereas humans and chimpanzees are generally considered to be very sensitive to LPS 4 baboons and most other primates are highly resistant It is likely that part of the difference in sensitivity may be explained at a very proximal level although differences in responses to cytokines for example TNF may also have a role Neither interspecific differences nor interindividual differences in LPS responses have until recently been accessible to systematic genetic analysis Advances in understanding LPS signal transduction now permit these issues to be examined Although LPS was once thought to exert its effects through intercalation into biological membranes or to bind to many different receptors on the cell surface it has been clear for nearly three decades that there is in fact a single biochemical pathway for LPS detection This was indicated by the observation that allelic 6 mutations of a single gene Lps in mice could entirely abrogate the response to LPS and did so with great specificity Mice of the strains C3H HeJ 7 and C57BL 10ScCr 8 are highly resistant to LPS showing none of the usual biological effects yet respond normally to other bacterial products and to most cytokines induced by LPS 9 We recently identified the Lps locus through positional cloning 10 and showed that the LPS resistance phenotype was caused by defects in the Toll like receptor 4 gene Tlr4 11 In C3H HeJ mice a point mutation P712H single letter amino acid notation modifies the protein within the cytoplasmic domain creating a codominant inhibitory effect on LPS signal transduction In C57BL 10ScCr mice the gene is deleted yielding a recessive abolition of the LPS response Subsequently overexpression of the wild type Tlr4 protein was found to enhance LPS signal transduction in wild type macrophages lowering the effective concentration EC 50 for LPS by a factor of 30 whereas overexpression of the Tlr4 Lps disoform represented in C3H HeJ mice almost completely suppresses signaling 12 Furthermore genetic complementation studies have demonstrated that LPS and Tlr4 enter into close physical proximity in the course of signal transduction Tlr4 appears to bind directly to LPS Hence the species origin of Tlr4 is the sole determinant of species preference for a given LPS structure 13 Mice of the C3H HeJ and C57BL 10ScCr strains are abnormally susceptible to infection by certain Gram negative bacteria suggesting that timely recognition of LPS is essential for successful containment of infection 14 15 Because deleterious mutations of Tlr4 have become fixed spontaneously in two strains of mice we considered it possible that other functionally important mutations might be identified in mice and humans Moreover information on the degree of Tlr4 polymorphism in these and other species might allow inferences about the importance of different Tlr4 domains Accordingly we decided to sequence the entire Tlr4 gene of both humans and mice and to survey genetic variation at the locus in each species We also examined the TLR4 sequence from two species of subhuman primates that have dramatically different responses to LPS Results Overall structure of TLR4sand Tlr4 The mouse Tlr4 gene is somewhat longer than its human counterpart TLR4 owing to the greater length of intronic sequence 15 337 base pairs bp from beginning to end of the transcribed sequence in the mouse compared with 11 467 bp in the human There are three exons in Tlr4 and each corresponds to a homologous sequence in the human gene Rock et al 16 reported a human cDNA sequence GenBank accession number U88880 that includes a fourth exon positioned between the normal first and second introns When included in the processed transcript however this exon specifies early termination of the polypeptide chain Although it is possible that translation is initiated distal to the added stop codon and that a shorter product results in the human than in the mouse this would be unusual given the length of the 5 untranslated region UTR that would then exist and the presence of multiple upstream initiation codons Moreover there is no murine sequence homologous to the alternative second exon of the human gene The biological significance of this exon is therefore unclear and in all likelihood its inclusion in the mRNA leads to the formation of a nonfunctional protein Neither the human nor the mouse gene has a TATA element or CAAT box in the proximal promoter region A number of conserved promoter and enhancer motifs are apparent on alignment of the murine and human 5 flanking sequences and are described in detail elsewhere 17 Both Tlr4 and TLR4 lie amid repetitive sequences of retroviral origin and no other genes are detected close to either of them using homology searches or the gene prediction algorithm GRAIL In Figure 1 the grayscale images of the human and mouse genes call attention to the repetitive elements in the region and illustrate the relationship between exons and spacing in the two species Genetic variation at the mouse Tlr4locus Among 35 strains of Mus musculus 10 different alleles were identified on the basis of mutations at 22 sites with respect to the reference sequence Of these 13 create amino acid substitutions Table 1 Figure 2 The most common murine allele was represented at a frequency of only 69 The ancestry of different Tlr4 alleles can be traced by haplotype analysis as many deviations from the reference allele occur in conjunction with one another A plausible arrangement of strain relationships is presented in Figure 3 Some strains have accumulated many more mutations than others For example the P J strain Tlr4 gene exhibits 11 mutations the distinguish it from the most common haplotype six of them specifying changes in the Tlr4 amino acid sequence the SEA GnJ strain differs by nine mutations and the strains NZW J and VM Dk which are identical to one another differ from the most common haplotype at six sites Shared mutations suggest that introgression took place after mutational separation had occurred leading to the introduction of groups of mutations by genetic recombination Hence mice of the P J NZW J and VM Dk strains have several mutations that are observed in the A J and BALB c strains but also lack some of the mutations of the latter strains and have unique mutations of their own Most of the murine mutations reside within exon 3 and only two substitutions are noted that modify the cytoplasmic domain Figure 2 Of these however one mutation R761H is fairly common among the strains surveyed and the corresponding residue has been reported as an H in the hamster A single conservative substitution V637I was noted within the transmembrane domain of the P J strain Anthropoid ape and lower primate TLR4sequences and their relationship to the human and rodent sequences The human and chimpanzee amino acid sequences are nearly identical over the interval studied distinguished by only three substitutions The baboon sequence is 93 5 identical to the human in the extracellular domain differs in the transmembrane domain by one substitution out of 30 residues and differs in the proximal cytoplasmic domain by only one residue in 155 At the carboxyl terminus however homology is badly disrupted so that 16 of the last 21 human residues are not replicated in the baboon protein which is 13 amino acids shorter than the human protein Similarly among rodents the carboxyl terminus of the protein is the least conserved Overall the order of conservation with respect to domain is proximal cytoplasmic domain transmembrane domain extracellular domain distal cytoplasmic domain Table 2 Figure 4 Discussion The pathway by which LPS activates host innate immune defenses has been illuminated by the positional cloning of Lps and establishment of its identity with Tlr4 11 a mammalian representative of an ancient family of receptors 16 that serve both developmental and defensive functions The function of Tlr4 as the LPS signal transducer became clear when mapping 10 and sequencing 11 data revealed Tlr4 as the only gene in a critical 2 6 megabase Mb region and furthermore showed that two strains of LPS resistant mice are homozygous for mutations of Tlr4 that are absent in closely related LPS sensitive strains In Drosophila the prototypic homolog of the mammalian Toll like receptors Toll defends against fungal infection 18 whereas the protein 18 wheeler defends against bacterial infection 19 In the case of Toll there is no evidence of direct contact between the receptor and the microbial pathogen or its components Rather infection activates a proteolytic cascade that leads to the production of an endogenous ligand Sp tzle which in turn engages Toll The situation is apparently different in mammals in which Tlr4 is clearly a direct interface with the microbial world As such the primary structure of a Tlr4 molecule determines ligand specificity 13 accounting for the well known observation that mouse cells can recognize tetra acyl lipid A as an agonist 20 whereas human cells recognize it as an antagonist 20 21 22 23 24 As mice of the C3H HeJ strain are highly susceptible to infection by Gram negative bacteria it would seem plausible that among human patients with Gram negative sepsis some individuals may have been at risk by virtue of mutations in TLR4 The first step in determining whether different isoforms of Tlr4 confer added risk of or protection against sepsis is the assessment of genetic variability at this locus in the normal population Whereas ablative mutations of Tlr4 abolish the capacity to detect LPS the question arises as to whether less severe mutation might alter either the specificity of LPS detection as discussed above or the magnitude of the LPS signal Our present knowledge of Tlr4 structural variation in mice may permit an answer to this question insofar as the mutations might easily be recreated and measurements of signal transducing activity through the modified receptors carried out in immortalized C3H HeJ macrophages 13 Animals of the A J and P J strains have defective tumoricidal capacity 25 26 27 28 29 although in neither case is the Lps locus implicated in the defect Deleterious mutations of TLR4 might reasonably be sought in individuals who have developed serious Gram negative infections on the premise that mice with deleterious mutations of Tlr4 are rendered susceptible to such infections Similarly in birds a polymorphism at the tenascin locus which lies a few megabases proximal to Tlr4 in mice predicts susceptibility to Gram negative infection 30 suggesting that it may lie in linkage disequilibrium with a particular form of the avian Tlr4 gene Beyond this it may be assumed given the powerful pro inflammatory activity of the receptor that germline or somatic mutations of TLR4 could in some instances cause constitutive signal transduction as observed with the Drosophila Toll locus 31 such mutations might in principle account for certain inflammatory diseases In fact in the Lpr model of systemic lupus erythematosus the Lps locus was believed a likely modulator of phenotype 32 This would seem still more likely at present given the paucity of other candidate genes in the immediate vicinity of Tlr4 10 The evolutionary conservation of Tlr4 is of particular interest in that different species show preferential responses to some LPS forms and not others 20 21 22 23 24 and have particular set points for responses to toxic LPS molecules An assessment of variability may be made through comparison of different species but is complemented by the study of a large number of individuals within species Both approaches reveal that the extracellular domain of Tlr4 is highly variable compared with the transmembrane domain and proximal cytoplasmic domain of the protein Pooling the number of mutable sites in the extracellular domain and transmembrane domain of humans and mice 17 coding changes are observed compared with two in the proximal cytoplasmic domain Moreover variability does not seem confined to any particular region of the extracellular domain but is spread uniformly across its length The extracellular domain of any receptor is concerned principally with ligand recognition Given that the ligand is an endogenous protein extracellular domain conservation tends to be strict insofar as mutations affecting extracellular domain structure are likely to diminish specificity or affinity of binding Hence protein binding receptors tend to be minimally polymorphic The presumed ligand for Tlr4 is LPS itself presented alone or in conjunction with another protein for example CD14 13 and the relatively high frequency of polymorphism observed in Tlr4 may be viewed as a consequence of the protective effect rendered by LPS recognition and the variability of LPS structure The cytoplasmic domain of Tlr4 is far more stringently conserved than the extracellular domain This is probably due to the fact that the cytoplasmic domain of Tlr4 is not required to cope with a ligand of variable structure Rather when called upon to signal it must do so utilizing transducing molecules with conserved structures On the other hand the intensity of the LPS signal has apparently been optimized for each species 33 perhaps ensuring that the response to LPS is appropriately integrated into the immune response as a whole Humans ungulates and rabbits for example exhibit an intense response to low concentrations of LPS whereas the lower primates and most rodents are relatively more resistant 4 The highly variable carboxy terminal end of the Tlr4 cytoplasmic domain may be seen as the embodiment of interspecific differences in LPS sensitivity although the poor conservation of this portion of the molecule might alternatively be taken to indicate a neutral effect of mutation It is also possible that this region of the molecule is subject to a higher rate of mutation than that applying to the rest of the protein Although most such mutations might be removed by selection some might be discovered in populations defined by the occurrence of Gram negative sepsis Materials and methods Determination of the complete mouse Tlr4 and human TLR4 genomic sequences The mouse bacterial artificial chromosome BAC 152C16 from the 129 J strain Research Genetics was previously shown by us to contain the Tlr4 gene in its entirety 10 and a small fraction of Tlr4 was also found in the overlapping BAC 309I17 10 Human TLR4 was identified in BAC 110P15 Genome Systems by hybridization screening using a PCR amplified human TLR4 cDNA sequence as a probe All three BACs were fragmented by ultrasound shotgun cloned into the vector pBluescript KS and extensively sequenced using ABI model 373 and 377 sequencers using Big Dye terminators 959 reads were obtained from 390I17 1503 reads from 110P15 and 2731 reads from 152C16 The average read length was approximately 700 nucleotides To concentrate data acquisition efforts on the Tlr4 and TLR4 genes themselves PCR primers were fashioned to match regions flanking each gene A 16 kb fragment was amplified from the mouse BAC 152C16 and a 12 kb fragment was amplified from the human BAC 110P15 each containing all exons of the respective gene These fragments were also shotgun cloned and extensively sequenced so that the depth of sequence reached an average of 12 reads over the area of greatest interest Sequence assembly used the programs phred and Phrap obtained from Brent Ewing and Phil Green University of Washington Genome Center Interpretation of repetitive elements was achieved with the program RepeatMasker obtained from Arian Smit University of Washington Genome Center A contiguous high quality sequence 18 974 bp in length containing TLR4 was obtained from the human BAC and a contig 91 748 bp in length containing Tlr4 was obtained from the mouse BAC Over these intervals the error rate was estimated at 1 per 10 4bp These sequences have been posted to GenBank in annotated form accession number AF177767 for the murine sequence and AF177765 for the human sequence All data related to mutations are presented with reference to these sequences Sequencing DNA from mouse chimpanzee and baboon samples Mouse DNA obtained from animals of 35 Mus musculus strains was ordered from the Jackson Laboratories Chimpanzee and baboon DNA were obtained from Kurt Benirschke University of California San Diego and Gregory Delzoppo Scripps Research Institute respectively The three principal exons of Tlr4 were amplified independently from mouse genomic DNA samples leaving a margin of approximately 50 bp to each side of the exons so as to indentify intronic mutations that might alter splicing All exons of the chimpanzee were amplified and sequenced using the same primers used to amplify and sequence the human exons For the baboon the first two exons were also amplified using these same primers however the third exon of the baboon was amplified with a substituted primer at the 5 end The PCR products were isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis Exons 1 and 2 were sequenced using the same primers that were used for amplification Exon 3 was sequenced using the flanking primers as well as a collection of eight internal primers In this manner the entire coding region and all splice junctions of Tlr4 could be covered with a total of 14 sequencing reads All primers used for amplification and sequencing are presented in Table 3 separate sets were used to amplify and sequence mouse and the primate samples Independent assembly of each sample was required as a condition for further analysis and if such assembly failed additional reads were executed using a secondary collection of primers Thereafter mutations were identified en masse by pooling all of the reads from 25 to 30 samples at a time and reassembling with the program polyphred using the phred PhrapPoly script obtained from Natalie Kolker University of Washington Genome Center Consed alpha obtained from David Gordon University of Washington Genome Center was used to visualize reads and mutations The annotated chimpanzee exon sequences have been submitted to GenBank with the accession numbers AF179218 AF179219 and AF179220 The baboon sequences have been submitted with the accession numbers AF180962 AF180963 and AF180694 For genetic comparisons rat Genbank AF057025 and hamster AF153676 Tlr4 sequences were also used Genetic computation A 500 MHz DEC alpha system equipped with 256 Mbytes of memory was used for direct analysis of sequence data as described above In addition to the programs already mentioned the GCG software version 9 0 was used for alignment analysis with the program Pileup used in multiple alignments of protein sequences The windows based program Generunner 3 0 Hastings Software was used for the design of oligonucleotide primers A spline curve describing heterogeneity of the Tlr4 polypeptide sequence from different species was produced using the program Prism 3 0 Graphpad Software Sequences were prepared for submission with the use of the
