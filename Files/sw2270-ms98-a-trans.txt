 okay i guess that s it uh yep i was just thinking about what movies i ve seen lately mostly uh we go to uh the second or third run movies i guess what the ones that we call the dollar used to call the dollar movies yeah uh so we see uh the ones that have been out for a while i was trying to think what the last movie that we went to see was probably Russia House with uh Sean Connery and uh yeah yeah sure found it quite enjoyable myself uh uh had also seen the Hunt For Red October you know with him in that and um hum God i don t have to say kind of caught me off i m more of a looks good in the paper commercials look great on TV um um hum uh i did see Red October yeah uh this is going to be i ve seen a lot of video lot of lot of video VCR stuff um yeah man oh man i have to say uh Chevy Chase uh Christmas you know the Vacation Christmas yeah thing was one here recently we saw at Christmas time um God i haven t been in a movie since maybe Superman Batman maybe Batman might have been one yeah well that s yeah yeah well well i didn t even see Batman so that s uh that s pretty good so it s been or no let s see uh Dick Tracy i did we did see Dick Tracy so that s i haven t seen any of that stuff really yeah so uh so you so then you re not a uh uh not a frequent movie goer either well i love it we uh got a new baby in the house and and and she just turned a year old so it just kind of put the clamp on things um oh yeah yeah so so you watch a lot of videos yeah then uh stop by and get them at you know for ninety nine cents and bring them home but yeah that s right what uh what do you find uh that you re looking at most in those uh the i mean are they are they the comedies and uh that kind of stuff comedies and the PG s and the no skin uh um hum we re uh know like we saw Sally and uh well Billy Crystals in it we saw that one and which was video that s that s probably the last movie i went to see yeah that s probably the last one yeah yeah uh huh yeah we we saw that one uh we find that uh that uh if you can get into those dollar movies you know they re uh they re a dollar and a half what is it dollar and a quarter dollar and a half now quarter Promenade yeah and uh at the Promenade yeah and uh you know we we find those pretty good they re not uh it s not so far you know from when they were first run that you don t enjoy them sure occasionally you ll find one that s you know some of the friends will be talking about them that you wished that you d seen them so you could talk about them sooner but uh i mean fifteen bucks to go see a movie with two with a couple s a little ridiculous yeah that s that s a little bit too much so yeah and some of them that turned to flops we saw other other other night we saw um Lady in Red but um hum okay which is not that old but you know it was bounced around the VCR cabinet there and um yeah yeah but yeah we i used to really you know i d just pick up the paper and we d go see a couple you know three or four movies a month but no we haven t i haven t been to a movie in it s been four or five months uh huh yeah but uh yeah we we find even uh you know even looking at the dollar movies which are you d think those are the ones that uh are coming back around because they were good the first time um hum and we don t find a lot of those uh you know they ll be running uh four to six of those on a weekend um hum and you know two weekends three weekends out of four maybe two or three two out of three or three out of four there won t be anything that we want to go see um hum and uh so then when something comes up they ll usually stay on a while so we we still get a chance to see you know one of them that we want to see but uh we saw Avalon and uh i think we went in to see Avalon because we couldn t get in to maybe we wanted to go see Ghost and couldn t get into Ghost because the line you know they sold out um hum um hum um hum we went to see Avalon and uh i really was not that impressed with Avalon it uh really you know it s uh it s one of these uh more i don t know melodramatic and and i don t know uh not satirical wasn t funny at all but it was kind of drab i don t know had a had a lot of hidden meanings in it i suppose but uh you know ooh my it s got to be something fun yeah you don t have to think yeah sure yeah and uh right but uh i really enjoy uh the espionage type of movies the the uh um hum The Hunt For Red October and Russia House i had read uh the Russia House book before so i i i thought it was a real good movie um is it a good movie great i enjoyed the book quite a bit too so that s that made it made it more interesting to me let s see uh a lot of it the dialogue was uh a little difficult to understand because uh Michelle Pfeiffer had a was speaking with her Russian accent you know the the actress Russian accent so um hum it was part of that was a little hard to understand probably overcompensated a little bit right and uh so you if you knew what was going on you could kind of anticipate what was going to be said so i i had a little bit advantage there over my wife she had not read the book um hum but uh and well i think the now it s all coming back to me what was the one not The Deep but The Abyss um yeah the last year i think yeah we didn t see that one i m not uh i don t see don t go see too many in well i would but my wife doesn t like the the uh the science fiction semi horror type stuff you know um hum things that uh get you on the edge of your seat a little too much for her yeah i m not much of a Rotocop man Robocop you know myself yeah this one it wasn t heavy hi sci you know hi fi because it was a lot of it was actual stuff that takes place and they had of course the breathing apparatus which was liquid and and then all a sudden you know when you actually met this thing and and that that was you know towards like the last third of the movie only really got strange but it was uh um hum you know it was cold in the theater and it s wet in the movie and they kind of just it was it was comfortable it was easy to go in you didn t have to think a lot and and uh and there is nothing worse than going to see a movie where you have to follow a hidden plot yeah and it and then you leave the movie like with your brain you got a headache trying to follow this damn movie right well it s it s bad enough that you know if you got a little back problem or something have to sit in those seats and wiggle and squirm around and usually come out with your back hurting anyway so yep specially those intermission movies yep right and course those those dollar dollar and quarter movies you might catch a spring too so yeah that s right got to be careful well anyway uh i guess if uh if you re don t have anything else to talk about i guess i we can hang up on this one they re great okay okay i appreciate it thanks uh huh thank you sir bye
