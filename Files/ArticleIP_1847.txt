 The Not Yet Around the World Balloonists Of all the sorry moments in the around the world balloon race and God knows there have been the sorriest occurred last week On Jan 9 the Global Hilton balloon burst a helium tank 70 minutes after takeoff and Dick Rutan and his co pilot were forced to bail out at 11 000 feet They parachuted directly into a cactus patch Rutan you may remember is one of the true adventurers of the age In 1986 he piloted the Voyager airplane on its astonishing nonstop around the world journey Now 12 years later the aviation pioneer is picking cactus spines out of his face the latest casualty of the world s most pointless competition What is the great balloon race The irrepressible pursuing the irrelevant Howard Hughes sped around the world by plane and Ted Turner has squandered plenty of his millions on America s Cup yachts But today ballooning is the pastime of the gentleman adventurer Winter is around the world balloon season it s when the jet stream runs consistently west to east so the last few weeks have witnessed and the next few weeks will witness an orgy of circumnavigation attempts A few days before Rutan s crash commodities trader Steve Fossett gave up his effort when his balloon ran out of fuel over Russia A few days before that architect Kevin Uliassi aborted his flight after his balloon blew a hole during takeoff In the next few weeks eccentric Brit billionaire Richard Branson whose last balloon took off without him and Swiss balloonist Bertrand Piccard are each expected to launch their multimillion dollar airships Uliassi too wants to relaunch his balloon The balloonists have captured the public imagination and not without reason The nonstop around the world balloon flight is the only remaining aviation milestone The expeditions make great television They unfold slowly over several days and the visuals of sun kissed balloons are fabulous The balloonists seem genuinely heroic They endure cramped quarters and subzero temperatures and they face real danger In 1995 Belarus jets shot down a racing balloon killing its two pilots while China North Korea and Libya are all thought to be hostile to balloon flyovers And there is something charmingly antiquated about the venture No ballooning story is complete without reference to Phileas Fogg in Around the World in Eighty Days So here it is Anheuser Busch hearkening back to the aviation prizes of the 20s has ponied up 1 million for the first person to circumnavigate by 1999 half for the balloonist half for the charity of his choice Balloonists and journalists are calling the race the Last Great Adventure But that phrase does violence to the notion of adventure Once upon a time adventuring was a purposeful activity Magellan circled the earth in order to open it to trade Lewis and Clark went west to build a country Flying adventurers too recorded genuine necessary accomplishments Charles Lindbergh s crossing wasn t just a stunt It made real the idea of transatlantic air travel Hughes around the world flights made real the idea of global air travel Even Voyager had a scientific aim It vindicated the notion of ultralight planes and proved the value of ultralight materials The around the world balloon race by contrast is a nonsensical exercise We have climbed as high as we can and sunk as deep as we can We ve gone as far north as possible and as far south We ve broken the sound barrier on land and in water circled the globe by water and by air Now it has come to this The balloon race is the hot dog eating contest of aviation No one has ever bothered to break the ballooning record because there s no reason to do it Balloons are a uniquely terrible mode of transportation They are impossible to steer slow and dangerous They are also hideously expensive The journey has no real world utility Passenger balloons can contribute nothing to transportation or science Will a successful circumnavigation usher in an era of commercial balloon airlines This insignificance is a shame because today s adventurers are as brave as their predecessors The balloonists are adrenalin junkies but brainy ones Branson the genius behind Virgin is as bold with his life as with his businesses He has crossed both the Atlantic and Pacific by speedboat and balloon Along the way he s crashed in and been rescued from the Canadian Arctic and the Atlantic Fossett who s worth only 25 million to 50 million is equally insouciant He has driven in the Le Mans 24 Hour Race raced sled dogs in the Iditarod completed the Ironman triathlon run an ultramarathon and set the ballooning distance and endurance records Rutan was a Vietnam fighter jock and test pilot Piccard is a champion hang glider and professional balloon racer Piccard s family history is Exhibit No 1 in the decline of the great adventure His grandfather Auguste Piccard invented the submersible bathyscaph and was the first person to balloon into the stratosphere His father Jacques Piccard set the underwater depth record in another submersible Jacques also invented the tourist submarine The third generation Piccard no less a daredevil is reduced to competitive ballooning Balloon experts give Branson Piccard or Rutan decent odds to complete the circumnavigation eventually All three have pressurized gondolas that allow them to travel fast through the high jet stream All have deep pockets There are doubts about Fossett and Uliassi who fly in unpressurized gondolas Their balloons must travel slowly at lower altitudes and they are more exposed to the cold Fossett and Uliassi are also flying solo making them vulnerable to fatigue on a two week trip In any case let s hope that someone finishes the race soon so the balloonists can move on to something worthwhile such as say the Mars Prize America wants a manned Mars outpost Instead of giving NASA 400 billion to build one Newt Gingrich has suggested that the United States offer a 20 billion reward for the private organization that does it first Branson has mulled over the idea of going into space Why not the Red Planet Its color after all matches his omnipresent Virgin logo The Mars Prize that s an adventure worthy of Branson s courage And that s an adventure that mankind could actually use
