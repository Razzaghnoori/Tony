 Mental health is perhaps the most neglected area of health policy and programming According to the 2001 World Health Report some 450 million people suffer from a mental or behavioral disorder yet only a small minority of them receive even the most basic treatment 1 More than 40 of countries have no mental health policy and over 30 have no mental health program Over 90 of countries have no mental health policy that includes children and adolescents 1 According to the World Health Organization WHO mental and behavioral disorders are estimated to account for 12 of the global burden of disease yet the mental health budgets of the majority of countries constitute less than 1 of their total health expenditures 1 The relationship between disease burden and disease spending is clearly disproportionate Those few who do receive services often fare just as badly Mental Disability Rights International MDRI Washington D C United States a human rights group dedicated to the promotion of rights of the mentally disabled has documented how in many countries severely mentally disabled individuals become targets of stigma discrimination and other human rights abuses Routinely children and adults with mental disabilities are arbitrarily detained in psychiatric facilities social care homes orphanages and other closed institutions Out of public view they are subject to the most extreme forms of inhuman and degrading treatment experienced by any population Figure 1 In Kosovo MDRI learned that women were raped in psychiatric facilities in plain view of local staff and international humanitarian relief workers 2 In Hungary and Paraguay MDRI found people locked in cages 3 4 In Turkey Peru and Bulgaria MDRI investigators learned of a practice called unmodified ECT the use of without any form of anaesthesia or muscle relaxants a practice that is both painful and dangerous 5 6 Defining a Human Rights Approach to Mental Health Policy The starting point for the development of a human rights based policy on mental health is that mentally ill individuals are full human beings who are entitled to rights Although seemingly obvious in practice MDRI has found that the implications of these premises challenge predominant biomedical approaches to mental illness as well as health services paradigms 7 In a rights framework mental health needs are not analyzed as they are in many studies in terms of the application of given diagnostic criteria in isolation from the social context that leads to use of the mental health sector and mentally disabled persons are treated as more than patients who need services 7 8 They have rights to exercise agency in their own lives and to participate as members of their communities and societies and these rights trump other concerns such as general attitudes toward risk containment in society 9 Thus a human rights framework calls for changes that go beyond quality of care to include both legal and services reforms Further a human rights approach demands that we develop policies and take actions to end discrimination in the overall society that has a direct effect on the health and well being of the mentally disabled Legal Reform and Accountability Suspicion of mental illness cannot mean untrammeled discretion to disregard due process concerns in detention Whether or not ideological factors are at play civil commitment laws must provide for minimum substantive and procedural protections that protect mentally ill individuals fundamental agency 10 This is often not the case For example MDRI found that civil commitment laws in Uruguay and Mexico allow commitment upon medical certification of mental illness which MDRI found in many cases to be questionable There are no requirements that a patient be dangerous or in need of psychiatric treatment These laws do not require a right to counsel or a periodic review of commitment as international law requires 11 12 Thus people who are found mentally ill can be deprived of their liberty indefinitely in these and many other countries Once mental health is construed in terms of human rights all states are required at a very minimum to establish a normative framework consistent with international law 13 Such a normative framework provides for procedural protections it also provides for human rights oversight and remedies in the event of abuses Mentally disabled persons have the same right to redress for violations of their fundamental rights as other people do 13 14 15 Recourse may imply judicial remedies but in some cases a human rights ombudsman can be equally effective 16 As mentally disabled individuals are often not in a position to avail themselves of remedies proactive monitoring and enforcement is also necessary In short instituting legal reform accountability procedures and effective mechanisms to provide human rights oversight becomes a cornerstone of a human rights based approach to mental health policy Services Reform Community Integration and Participation Treating mentally ill people as full human beings implies that they have rights to participate in their communities and societies This in turn calls for community integration and service system reform instead of programs that merely rebuild segregated institutions The WHO also recognizes that it is important to provide treatment in the community but its reasoning is largely utilitarian The WHO argues that community care has a better effect than institutional treatment on the outcome and quality of life of individuals with chronic mental disorders Shifting patients from mental hospitals to care in the community is also cost effective 1 From a human rights perspective people are entitled to live in and receive care in the community not because it is more efficient but because all human beings develop their identities within social contexts and have rights to work and study as well as be with family and friends People with mental disabilities are often denied the right to work outside the home to marry or have children A rights based approach calls not only for the location of care in the community but also for the transfer of planning and decision making power to the individuals and communities that the health system is supposed to serve In this case consumers and family members must be integrally involved in the policy making and programming decisions 13 17 18 19 MDRI has repeatedly found that funds are misdirected toward rebuilding psychiatric institutions and orphanages Further international institutions often undermine rights based approaches to policy MDRI has documented how European governments development banks and international humanitarian relief organizations fund projects to build new psychiatric institutions and orphanages throughout the Americas and Eastern Europe rather than focusing on community care 9 Non Discrimination Within and beyond the Health Sector Nondiscrimination is the most fundamental tenet in human rights Under international law discrimination need not be intentional nor de jure in law to constitute a violation of various relevant treaties but merely needs to have the effect of nullifying or impairing the equal enjoyment or exercise of rights paragraph 11 of 20 MDRI has found that discrimination against people with mental disabilities is pervasive and takes many forms In Peru for example the public health insurance scheme does not cover mental disorders 5 However it is critical to recognize that discrimination outside the health sector also affects well being MDRI has seen that children with intellectual disabilities are denied equal access to education in Peru They are placed in programs that in effect warehouse them and assume that they are unable to learn 5 As adults people with mental disabilities are often denied the right to work outside the home to marry or have children or to take part in the religious and social activities that define people as adult members of society 21 A human rights approach to mental health policy demands that special attention be placed on remedying such inequities both within and beyond the health sector which affect the physical mental and social well being of persons with mental disabilities 22 Such an approach depends upon multisectoral strategies including education housing and work and establish that people with mental disabilities are full citizens Conclusions and Reflections on First Steps MDRI works through a human rights framework that links the improvement of mental health services with broader questions of social justice and nondiscrimination relating to the full spectrum of rights set out in international instruments 13 14 As an immediate first step all states regardless of resources can develop national mental health policies and plans of action with measurable targets which provide for open public discussion 13 23 Devising a national policy is a precondition to creating rights based programs that address the multivalent problems faced by persons with mental disability 1 Stakeholder participation in the process affirms that mentally disabled people are rights worthy 13 17 Both international agencies and professional associations can play critical roles in providing technical assistance to countries to develop rights based national mental health policies 1 4 Bilateral and multilateral donors should encourage such rights based policies through their funding prerogatives
