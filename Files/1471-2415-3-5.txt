 Background The retina which is exposed to both sunlight and very high levels of oxygen is exceptionally rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids which makes it a favorable environment for the generation of reactive oxygen species For example retinal pigment epithelium RPE generates a number of reactive oxygen species when illuminated with light 1 Furthermore phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments by RPE causes an increase in intracellular 2 and extracellular H 2 O 2 generation 3 Oxidative stress has been suggested as the cause of a number of retinal pathological conditions 4 5 A number of in vitro studies have attempted to characterize the effect of oxidative stress on RPE Depending on the experimental conditions treatment of RPE with H 2 O 2 can cause an alteration of cellular functions 6 7 or cell death 8 9 Cytotoxic levels of H 2 O 2 can cause significant mitochondrial 10 and genomic 11 DNA damage in RPE simulating the features of programmed cell death 8 12 Studies from other cell types indicate that early cellular events following H 2 O 2 treatment include morphological alterations and actin re organization 13 In addition activation of the ERK p42 44 Extracellular signal Regulated Kinase MAP kinases Mitogen Activated Protein kinases can occur within minutes following cellular oxidative stress Depending on the cell type examined inhibition of the ERK activity can either prevent 14 or enhance H 2 O 2 induced cell death 15 The involvement of actin re organization and ERK activation has not been examined in RPE under oxidative stress Lipid peroxidation products such as 4 hydroxynonenal 4 HNE have attracted considerable attention because of their potential involvement in aging and in a number of neuropathological conditions 16 4 HNE was implicated in the etiology of some pathological conditions in the eye For example levels of 4 HNE increased significantly in the vitreous of patients with proliferative vitreoretinopathy compared with controls 17 Further 4 HNE forms a stable adduct with rhodopsin in the photoreceptor which may interfere with its functions 18 4 HNE even causes cataracts in cultured rat lens 19 20 Whether oxidative stress on RPE can cause accumulation of cellular HNE protein adducts remains unknown Peroxisome proliferator activated receptors PPARs belong to a group of nuclear receptors that include steroid retinoid thyroid hormone receptors and others 21 22 23 There are three types of PPARs PPAR is expressed predominantly in the liver heart kidney brown adipose and stomach mucosa and is important for lipid catabolism PPAR is found in adipose tissues and is important for adipogenesis PPAR is found in most tissues but its role is less well defined RPE cells express all three forms of PPARs but PPAR is the dominant isoform 24 There is a 10 fold induction of PPAR mRNA that reaches a peak at 4 hour after phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments The levels of either PPAR mRNA or PPAR mRNA are not altered under the same conditions Increases in PPAR in RPE cells may be important for handling the lipids generated during the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments 24 Since RPE cells generate large amounts of H 2 O 2 during the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments there is a possibility that activation of PPAR may assist in defending the oxidative stress associated with phagocytosis This study was designed to examine morphological alterations in RPE during oxidative stress the involvement of ERK MAP kinase and 4 HNE and to test the hypothesis that PPAR activation can prevent oxidative damage on RPE cells The human RPE cell line ARPE 19 and primary cultures of adult human RPE were used in this study ARPE 19 is a spontaneous occurring non transformed RPE cell line which expresses RPE specific markers such as CRALBP and RPE65 and exhibits morphological polarization and tight junctions similar to native RPE 25 26 Methods Materials WY14643 15d PGJ 2 azelaoyl PAF

ChemiImager 5500 imaging system with AlphaEaseFC software Alpha Innotech Corporation San Leandro CA Results expressed as percentage of control from replicate experiments were pooled and averaged The primary antibodies used in this set of experiments were from Santa Cruz anti ERK 1 2 used at 1 5000 anti phospho ERK used at 1 1000 anti PPAR used at 1 2000 or from Calbiochem anti 4 HNE used at 1 2 000 Statistical analysis Unless otherwise stated results of cell viability experiments were pooled from 12 replicate samples derived from 3 independent experiments and expressed as mean SEM Statistical analyses were performed by analysis of variance one way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni test to determine the significance of difference Results Cytotoxicity of H 2O 2toward primary human RPE and ARPE 19 cells Initial experiments analyzing the cytotoxic effect of oxidative stress on primary cultures of human RPE cells indicated that H 2 O 2 at 1 mM or less did not affect cellular viability Higher concentrations caused a sharp decrease of viability in human RPE such that a 24 hour treatment of cells with 1 2 mM H 2 O 2 lowered the viability to 13 of controls Fig 1A squares This concentration lowered the viability of human RPE to 62 after a 4 hour treatment Fig 1A circles In a set of analogous experiments ARPE 19 cells treated with various concentrations of H 2 O 2 for 4 hours or 24 hours showed that a 4 hour treatment with 1 mM H 2 O 2 did not affect viability An increase of H 2 O 2 concentrations beyond 1 mM decreased viability such as 2 mM H 2 O 2 decreased the viability to 46 of controls in 4 hours Fig 1B circles Treatment of cells with H 2 O 2 for 24 hours caused a dose dependent decrease of viability with a LD 50 of 1 35 mM Fig 1B squares H 2 O 2 induced cytotoxicity in RPE cells appears to be affected by the density of cells in cultures 29 To study this phenomenon ARPE 19 cells plated in 96 well plates with densities of 10 000 20 000 or 40 000 cells well were subjected to H 2 O 2 treatment Cells grown in a high density culture were indeed more resistant to H 2 O 2 as compared to those grown in a low density culture Fig 1C For example H 2 O 2 at 1 4 mM reduced cellular viability to 11 49 or 94 of control in cultures with 10 000 20 000 or 40 000 cells well respectively H 2O 2induced morphological alterations and formation of 4 HNE adducts To analyze morphological changes of RPE cells treated with a cytotoxic concentration of H 2 O 2 ARPE 19 cells were treated with 1 5 mM H 2 O 2 for various periods of time and then processed for actin staining Without H 2 O 2 treatment stress fibers appeared thin and diffuse in control cells Fig 2A arrow At 15 min after treatment these cells appeared to round up and significant ruffling occurred at the edge of their plasma membrane Fig 2B arrows Overall thickening of stress fibers occurred at two hours after treatment in addition to the membrane ruffling Fig 2C arrows Additional morphological changes after 4 hours of H 2 O 2 treatment Fig 2D 2E 2F included distinctive dense bands at the periphery of some cells Fig 2D arrows peri nuclear staining of actin fibers in other cells which made the nuclei prominent Fig 2E arrows and microspikes Fig 2F arrow on the cell surface of some cells Subsequent experiments with immunofluorescent staining indicated that 1 5 mM H 2 O 2 treatment of ARPE 19 cells for 4 hours led to the formation of 4 HNE protein adducts both in the cytoplasm and nucleus presumably as a result of lipid peroxidation Fig 3A 3B Various protein bands on Western blots were positive for anti HNE antibody reactivity further intensified as a result of H 2 O 2 treatment Fig 3C Densitometry measurements were performed to estimate the collective increase of band intensity in each lane between 39 Kd and 87 Kd Results derived from a total of six independent experiments indicated that treatment of cells with 0 5 1 1 5 or 2 mM H 2 O 2 caused an increase of intensity to 2 5 3 1 3 7 or 7 1 fold of control respectively Though there was significant cytoskeletal alterations and lipid peroxidation at 4 hours after H 2 O 2 treatment nuclear staining using bisbenzimide Hoechst 33258 indicated that most cells maintained normal nuclear morphology at this time Fig 4A untreated cells Fig 4B 4 hours after treatment Nuclear condensation increased with length of H 2 O 2 exposure which was clearly evident at 12 hours after H 2 O 2 treatment Fig 4C arrows and even more prominent at 16 hours after treatment Fig 4D These results suggest that H 2 O 2 treatment caused apoptosis in RPE Nuclear condensation appeared to start at the edge of the culture relatively lower density area Fig 4C arrows and spread to the center part of the culture higher density Fig 4D over time This phenomenon is consistent with the viability assay in which higher density cultures were more resistant to oxidative stress Fig 1C Effect of oxidative stress on PPAR protein expression During rod outer segment ingestion there is a generation of H 2 O 2 2 3 and an up regulation of PPAR mRNA expression 24 in RPE experiments were performed to determine if H 2 O 2 could induce PPAR protein expression over the control levels ARPE 19 cells were treated with various concentrations 0 5 1 1 5 2 mM of H 2 O 2 for 24 hours and processed for Western blot analysis Results indicated a slight induction of PPAR protein levels in some experiments This induction however was not apparent in other experiments Results not shown Densitometry analyses from a total of six independent experiments indicated that treatment of these cells with 0 5 1 1 5 or 2 mM H 2 O 2 for 24 hours caused an alteration of band intensity to 76 108 113 or 104 of controls respectively There was no significant change of PPAR protein level after 30 min or 12 hour H 2 O 2 treatment either results not shown A separate set of experiments also indicated that treatment of primary human RPE cells with 1 mM H 2 O 2 for 24 hours did not induce PPAR protein expression over the control levels results not shown Prevention of oxidative stress induced cytotoxicity by PPAR agonists Even though H 2 O 2 did not increase PPAR protein expression significantly as indicated in the previous study experiments were performed to determine whether PPAR agonists could activate the existing PPAR thus preventing H 2 O 2 induced cytotoxicity in RPE cells Cells were pretreated with the PPAR agonist 15d PGJ 2 overnight followed by H 2 O 2 for one day without 15d PGJ 2 and processed for the MTT viability assay Results indicated that 15d PGJ 2 prevented H 2 O 2 induced cytotoxicity in primary human RPE cultures in a dose dependent manner Fig 5A Subsequent experiments with ARPE 19 cells also indicated this saving effect While H 2 O 2 at 1 3 mM 1 4 mM or 1 5 mM lowered the ARPE 19 viability to 64 46 or 28 of control respectively pretreatment of these cells with 1 M 15d PGJ 2 raised the viabilities to 95 84 or 68 of control respectively Fig 5B Cells stained with Hoechst 33258 indicated that 15d PGJ 2 prevented H 2 O 2 induced nuclear condensation Fig 4E compare this with Fig 4D The other PPAR agonists ciglitazone 30 azelaoyl PAF 31 and LY171883 32 however were not effective tested between 1 10 M 3 independent experiments for each agent results not shown The PPAR agonist WY14643 had some saving effect at a high concentration 40 M however the difference was not statistically significant results not shown Activation of ERK by H 2O 2 A set of experiments was performed to determine the effects of H 2 O 2 on ERK activation ARPE 19 cells were treated with 1 5 mM H 2 O 2 for 1 hour and processed for immunohistochemical staining using antibodies against phospho ERK Untreated cells showed a faint phospho ERK staining while there was an apparent increase of phospho ERK staining in the cytoplasm and nuclei in H 2 O 2 treated cells Fig 6A 6B A separate set of cultures was treated with H 2 O 2 for 30 min and then processed for Western blot analysis This H 2 O 2 treatment of the cells caused only a slight alteration in ERK levels but led to a dose dependent increase of phospho ERK with a maximal stimulation observed at 1 5 mM Fig 6C Densitometry analyses from 3 independent experiments indicated that 0 5 1 1 5 or 2 mM H 2 O 2 caused an increase of p42ERK ERK2 phosphorylation to 2 1 12 7 18 8 or 2 0 fold of control respectively Similar treatment caused an increase of p44 ERK ERK1 phosphorylation to 1 5 15 7 21 4 or 3 4 fold of control respectively The phospho ERK in H 2 O 2 treated samples remained higher than control at 24 hour after treatment results not shown Effect of ERK inhibition on H 2O 2induced cytotoxicity in ARPE 19 Since ERK activation appeared to be an early event associated with H 2 O 2 induced cytotoxicity experiments were performed to determine if inhibitors of ERK activation could affect the cytotoxicity caused by H 2 O 2 ARPE 19 cells were pretreated with 10 M PD98059 a MEK inhibitor which functions upstream of ERK 33 followed by H 2 O 2 challenge Results from 3 independent experiments indicated that this agent could prevent low dose 1 1 2 mM H 2 O 2 induced cell death slightly In contrast it enhanced high dose 1 3 1 6 mM H 2 O 2 induced cell death These effects in either case were not remarkable results not shown This agent at concentrations higher than 10 M was toxic to ARPE 19 cells by itself and could enhance H 2 O 2 toxicity results not shown In a separate set of experiments ARPE 19 cells were pretreated with 10 M AG126 a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor 34 followed by H 2 O 2 challenge The treatment of cells with 1 3 mM 1 4 mM or 1 5 mM H 2 O 2 decreased the cellular viability to 66 40 or 22 of control respectively Pretreatment of cells with AG126 raised the viability to 72 p 0 05 compared to H 2 O 2 treatment only 63 p 0 005 or 35 p 0 01 of control respectively AG126 at concentrations higher than 10 M was toxic to ARPE 19 cells by itself and could enhance H 2 O 2 toxicity results not shown Both AG126 10 M and 15d PGJ 2 1 M could prevent H 2 O 2 induced cytotoxicity in ARPE 19 a set of experiments was also performed to determine whether these two agents had additive saving effects While 1 4 mM H 2 O 2 treatment reduced the viability to 40 of control AG126 raised this viability to 55 of control and 15d PGJ 2 raised the viability to 75 of control A combination of these two agents did not raise the viability above 15d PGJ 2 alone Fig 7 Discussion Cytotoxicity of oxidative stress on RPE Results from this study indicated that both primary human RPE cultures and ARPE 19 cells were susceptible to H 2 O 2 treatment It is important to point out that H 2 O 2 showed a very steep dose response curve in primary RPE cultures under our experimental conditions such that an increase of H 2 O 2 concentration from 1 mM to 1 2 mM for one day treatment caused a decrease in viability from 100 to 10 of control Fig 1A Though the H 2 O 2 titration curve in ARPE 19 was not as steep as observed in primary RPE one day treatment of these cells with 1 8 mM H 2 O 2 could decrease the cellular viability to 10 of control while 1 mM H 2 O 2 did not affect cellular viability Fig 1B The sharp dose response curves demonstrated in this study suggests that it is important to have an effective cellular anti oxidation mechanism to prevent the build up of oxidative stress over a critical level An increase of oxidative stress in RPE is associated with an increase of cellular catalase metallothionein 3 and glutathione S transferase 35 which should serve as a protective mechanism to decrease the cytotoxicity caused by H 2 O 2 and other reactive oxygen species This protective mechanism declines with age because a study analyzing metallothionein levels in RPE of macular region showed a dramatic decrease in aged donors mean age 80 yr as compared to those from younger donors mean age 58 yr 36 A separate report concluded that there was also an age dependent decrease of catalase activity in RPE 37 These studies suggest RPE in the elderly are more susceptible to oxidative stress induced damage which may contribute to age related RPE dysfunction and vision loss The oxidative stress induced RPE cytotoxicity can be aggravated by zinc deficiency as previously reported by Tate et al 9 Significant morphological changes were observed in RPE cells treated with a cytotoxic concentration of H 2 O 2 Actin fiber re organization was noticed as early as 15 minutes after treatment Fig 2 Those images presented in Fig 2D 2Eand 2Fare three representatives of RPE cells at 4 hr after H 2 O 2 treatment The cells shown in 2D and 2F are commonly seen at different locations on the same slide In Fig 2D the dense peripheral bands of actin fibers were very prominent in some cells and the high intensity fluorescence caused an impression that the cells were relatively empty The thickening of dense peripheral bands in this study was in contrast to previous observations in endothelial cells For example Zhao and Davis reported that cultured pulmonary endothelial cells treated with H 2 O 2 underwent a morphological change that was accompanied by an accumulation increase in stress fibers running across the cells while the dense peripheral bands of most cells were disrupted or eliminated 38 Similar observations on endothelial cells were made by Liu and Sundqvist 39 The dense peripheral bands are important in cell cell adhesion which maintains the structural integrity While it is apparent that endothelial cells used in those studies and epithelial cells used in this study respond differently to H 2 O 2 the underlying reason for this difference is currently unknown One may speculate that RPE cells use this build in mechanism to defend the oxidative stress that they are constantly exposed to We currently have no data to support or dismiss this possibility In Fig 2E some cultures responded to H 2 O 2 treatment by a perinuclear distribution of actin fibers In Fig 2F we observed microspikes at the periphery of the cells A detailed study of microspikes by Adams indicated that these structures consist of actin the actin binding protein 55 kd fascin and myosin 40 The perinuclear staining and microspikes of cells under oxidative stress in this study are very similar to those observed by Huot et al in endothelial cells treated with H 2 O 2 41 The functional significance of these structural changes in RPE after H 2 O 2 treatment is not clear There is a possibility that the appearance of microspikes around the cells under stressed conditions is an adapted behavior of the cells in order to attach to the substratum firmly Prolonged H 2 O 2 treatment led to cell death with the appearance of condensed nuclei is an indication of apoptosis Fig 4C 4D This general finding is consistent with that observed by others 8 12 It is of interest to note that cultures with a reduced density are more vulnerable to H 2 O 2 treatment Fig 1C One straightforward explanation for the vulnerability of low density cultures treated with H 2 O 2 is that more molecules of H 2 O 2 per cell were present in these low density cultures which caused a lower viability If this were the case a mathematic analysis of the H 2 O 2 molecules per cell should be able to estimate the cytotoxicity in this experimental system For example 1 4 mM H 2 O 2 in a culture plated at a density of 40 000 cells well should result in a viability close to twice of that generated in 20 000 cells well and four times of that in 10 000 cells well Results from Fig 1Cindicated that the viability of each condition above was 94 49 or 11 respectively It is apparent that H 2 O 2 killed more cells in cultures of lower density 10 000 cells well than expected Because the result could not always be predicted by a mathematic estimation there is a possibility that cell cell contacts and some autocrine paracrine production in a culture may alter the microenvironment thus determine the cytotoxicity caused by H 2 O 2 Since cells with lower density are more susceptible to oxidative stress there is a possibility that a vicious cycle exists such that when an area of RPE loses some of the constituent cells by oxidative stress the remaining cells will become even more vulnerable to this insult PPARs in RPE This study indicated that the PPAR agonist 15d PGJ 2 could prevent H 2 O 2 induced RPE cell death Figs 5A 5Band Fig 4E This suggests that this agent can prevent oxidative stress induced RPE damage This finding is significant given prior reports that oxidative stress on RPE is an important contributing factor of age related macular degeneration 5 42 An earlier report also indicated that PPAR agonists could prevent laser photocoagulation induced choroidal neovascularization in rat eyes and monkey eyes which suggests the possible application of these agents on the exudative form of age related macular degeneration 43 It is important to note that the other PPAR agonists tested in this study ciglitazone azelaoyl PAF and LY171883 were ineffective in saving cells under the same experimental conditions Since three out of four PPAR agonists tested were ineffective this raises the possibility that the saving effect of 15d PGJ 2 is not through PPAR activation In this respect it should be noted that this agent has been shown to exert some biological effects that are independent of PPAR activation 44 45 46 We have previously shown that 15d PGJ 2 can prevent the cytotoxicity of cholesterol oxides end products of cholesterol under oxidative stress 27 Together with results from the current study this agent may have a general protective effect against oxidative stress itself or against cytotoxic agents generated by oxidative stress It is important to note that 15d PGJ 2 functions as a general inhibitor of immune activities For example this agent is a potent inhibitor of microglia the macrophage like cells in the central nervous system 47 48 49 and shown to be effective in reducing the symptoms of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis EAE an animal model for the human disease multiple sclerosis 50 Together these results suggest that this agent may be useful in preventing ocular diseases that result from oxidative stress or inflammation ERK activation and 4 HNE protein adducts formation as a result of oxidative stress Oxidative stress is a potent stimulator of the MAP kinase activities 14 15 51 Phosphorylation of ERK could be observed within 30 60 minutes after H 2 O 2 treatment Fig 6 There are conflicting results in literature regarding whether an increase of ERK phosphorylation is beneficial or detrimental to cell survival Bhat et al demonstrated that 5 25 M PD98059 could prevent H 2 O 2 induced cell death in an oligodendrocyte cell line 14 In contrast 20 M PD98059 was shown to enhance cell death caused by H 2 O 2 treatment in HeLa cells 15 This reagent had no significant effect on H 2 O 2 treated ARPE 19 cells under our experimental conditions AG126 on the other hand appeared to reduce the cytotoxicity caused by oxidative stress Fig 7 While this suggests that inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation or ERK activation after H 2 O 2 treatment might be beneficial for the cells results from PD98059 could not support this statement There is a possibility that the saving effect of AG126 is not related to ERK inhibition Under the current experimental conditions AG126 at 10 M was protective but it enhanced H 2 O 2 toxicity at 20 M These results were consistent with those reported by Sagara et al 52 AG126 belongs to a group of tyrosine kinase inhibitors named tyrphostins Many of these agents can prevent cellular oxidative stress including that generated by glutamate There is no correlation between the kinase inhibition and the observed protective effect Overnight treatment of cells with AG126 can increase cellular glutathione levels Furthermore this agent has some anti oxidant effect based on the Trolox Equivalent Activity Concentration 52 Collectively this may explain the observation that AG126 at 10 M could partially prevent H 2 O 2 induced cytotoxicity This agent can also function as a mitochondria uncoupler thus it actually enhances H 2 O 2 cytotoxicity at higher concentrations 52 An accumulation of 4 HNE conjugated protein has been detected in lesions of aging related diseases including Parkinson s disease 53 and Alzheimer s disease 54 It also accumulates in the affected neuronal tissues of experimental animals experiencing brain ischemia 55 56 and traumatic spinal cord injury 57 4 HNE can impair synaptosomal membrane proteins glutamate transport and importantly mitochondrial functions 58 59 Evidence indicates that 4 HNE increases neuronal susceptibility to oxidative stress 60 and serves as a mediator of oxidative stress that leads to neuronal apoptosis 61 As indicated in the Introduction 4 HNE has been implicated in some ocular pathological conditions 19 20 Several laboratories have attempted to document the formation of 4 HNE protein adducts during oxidative stress by Western blot analysis Uchida et al first reported oxidative stress caused by t butylhydroperoxide or iron ascorbate could lead to 4 HNE protein adducts in hepatocytes 62 Further studies by these researchers attempted to identify the common epitope recognized by the 4 HNE antibodies However no specific protein was positively identified 63 More recently the formation of 4 HNE protein adducts was also demonstrated by Western blot analysis from the heart 64 the liver 65 and the kidney 66 under oxidative stress It is important to point out that the patterns of 4 HNE protein adducts as shown by these Western blot analyses were different among these studies probably as a result of tissue specificity No particular protein was identified as a specific target for 4 HNE adduct formation in these studies Results from the current study indicate that H 2 O 2 treatment of RPE could lead to the accumulation of 4 HNE protein adducts in the cytoplasm and the nuclei of these cells Fig 3 There was a dose dependent increase of 4 HNE protein adduct after H 2 O 2 treatment with a maximal intensity of 7X control at 2 mM H 2 O 2 Fig 3C This may partially contribute to oxidative stress induced ocular disease Even though ocular tissues including the retina contain glutathione S transferases that can actively detoxify 4 HNE 35 67 adverse events may occur if aging or pathological conditions hinder this normal defense from functioning properly It warrants further studies to identify those proteins species that are modified by 4 HNE Conclusions This study demonstrates that oxidative stress induced by H 2 O 2 could lead to RPE cell death which is preceded by distinct morphological changes ERK activation and 4 HNE protein adduct formation The cell death can be prevented partially by AG126 and the prostaglandin derivative 15d PGJ 2 These agents may be useful pharmacological tools in the future capable of preventing oxidative stress induced RPE cell death in human ocular diseases Competing Interests None declared Authors
