 okay well personally i don t have any children i m twenty two and i m doing my Master s at NC State so uh uh children wouldn t be very convenient for me right now oh uh huh well no they wouldn t would they no so what what how do you spend the time with your children well both of mine are boys they re eight and eleven oh okay and they and we re into sports i mean as a matter of fact that s what we re doing tonight yeah what what are you doing uh baseball has started oh okay do do they play like uh like does the eight year old play baseball oh oh yes we start here at uh five okay and and in in in his league do they have like a pitcher or do they have a standing ball or a machine or what up until it s coach pitch until you get nine which my little boy will be nine in May so he s going to be with uh regular pitching and my eleven year old of course you know is pitching okay oh okay yeah i i used to play soccer when i was that age up in New York so uh huh but yes we re into baseball and it seems like soon as that over with we get into basketball we even have peewee basketball here so there s always something yeah and how about how about like on the weekends do you do sports or do you go out both if we re not doing sports we go somewhere do you go uh how about like for uh do you go for long vacations like a week or something when they have school off oh yeah yeah yeah in the summer or like in the Easter time like around now no usually in the summer time and where do you go different places every year we have have you been out of the country no oh okay well first they always say get to know your country first before you leave i mean i i lived in places like when i lived in Washington uh Washington DC i never went to the Washington Memorial and then when i went back to visit i went to the Washington Memorial uh huh you know i ve heard we have a couple of friends that goes to Washington quite often and that must be the thing they really hadn t either they went to the Memorial you know because when they go it s on business it s not really just to getting to sight see right right well it s it s a beautiful city and but the problem is like first example when i was young they they took me to Las Vegas and that was the most boring place on earth oh i bet it is too uh huh oh now my husband and i we go different places but our children but when we go with our children we usually kind of stay close yeah did uh did like did you go to Disneyland oh yes yes yes oh okay so but um now i don t know but um but let s see when i was eleven i went also to the Caribbean oh that that was fun that was and uh then after that i my sister lives in Turkey so when i was like fourteen fifteen i went i went to Turkey and this Christmas i went to Turkey but basically oh it s uh for the past couple of years uh i since my parents are are well i m from Argentina and my parents live down there so all the traveling i do is alone uh huh and uh we were never much of uh a very uh family thing you know may like go skiing in Vermont or something uh huh that was uh that was a lot of fun but what happens is we used to fight a lot so there s never much of a family family thing you know one of those hell family vacations yes yeah yes oh yes but we try you know uh i try my husband also we re involved in everything our kids does because uh yeah my dad died you know when i was less than a year old so i always just had a mother so i always thought when i have kids you know i really want to be involved with them yeah well my dad all he all he wanted to do was get money for us so he could buy us material things and uh huh things yes that is yes and and to me you know it s like now i m twenty two but i still feel you know it s like yeah we never threw a football or something and the way i was brought up and he wants me now he like he you know like he wants to be best friends now and it s very uh huh best friends now yes hard for me because you know it s like you grow up to be twenty years old and it s always the same man and then suddenly he sees that he s getting old uh huh and he wants to be best friends but uh you know it s like yeah i can only express myself so much because you know of everything that he taught me you know that my family taught me which is very hard to change that all of a sudden from one year to the next and say i m sorry you know it s like uh huh you know i love you and let s go out and do things together when i don t feel like it you know um hum yeah and so that s uh that the same thing that you know its like when like like i ve seen my uncle and his family you know does everything together and you know his kids are you know when his little girl was five years old and everything they uh they would go to the beach and she could go to sleep at two in the morning oh uh huh yeah you know and uh i was brought up the same way if if it doesn t matter what age you have if just so long as you can get up to go to class the next morning you can stay up you know but his what he does is when he gets home he separates his his work from his house yes uh huh yeah yeah you have to i mean you honestly do now i have friends that i love to death but and they have children but their children does anything we have to take them and yeah yeah you know to do it and that really gets kind of aggravating after a while because you re saying well i work full time too you know yeah yeah but uh it s just it s just something that you know my theory is you know when when you have kids and all you want to do well what i ll do is you know it like i mean you might have a problems but it s not your kids problems you know and you got to try to to be with them as much as you can and to you know like thing is is that you know like if yeah oh yeah uh huh if they would ever happen to have a drug problem suppose that they could feel comfortable coming to me and saying i got a problem problem uh huh you know and uh and that would make any parent feel good and bad at the same time you know first of all you re coming to me and let s see how we can get rid of the problem you know yeah yeah yeah yeah and that s uh that s very that s very hard to do because once you re best friends with your parents then i think everything go a lot better uh huh yeah uh i agree with you very much so now we waited several years before we started having children because we was still in college and we knew time wise or and money wise too would it would not have been a good idea to had them then yeah yeah my my father was raising four kids oh well three kids before he had me so it was uh you know you re trying to support uh four kids and it s pretty hard you know and i and i told them listen you could have had a lot of money if you would have only had two kids yes uh huh yeah he goes yeah but then i wouldn t have you i go yeah but then you would have a lot of money you know that s right but you can t take this money with us though that s how i keep looking at it yeah but you know like four i mean four four children is expensive especially when you consider like especially for for me which i m paying out of state tuition i m paying you know three thousand no what is it two thousand six hundred dollars for one semester oh yes yeah uh huh oh and uh you know people say you know it s expensive for to send kids to college but if if an everybody would be a little bit responsible you know it s like what what does it cost it costs five hundred dollars a semester suppose that they go to a state college and they live at home uh huh you know and well it costs two hundred dollars for books but you know seven hundred dollars a semester a lot of people can spare that if they planned ahead you know like oh yeah if you can t if you can yeah i mean it s like if you plan a year ahead you can probably save up seven hundred dollars you know one thousand four hundred dollars to send your child to college you know yeah what are you wanting to be oh oh excuse me what degree i mean what are you wanting to do after you get out of college well i i m doing computer science computer engineering oh that that s my husband s into uh computers yeah and and now i m looking for a job before they have to send me back home uh huh because since i m an international student they want to send me back to Argentina well my dad wants me to go back so yeah and you don t want to no no no no because if you go back there then you can never get out oh like you don t have any money to to get out uh huh so uh and uh i was thinking you know like oh my God you know i go back there and then and then i might get married there and then i will have kids there and then i ll never leave the place you know hum then you ll never leave yeah oh yeah i know and that s that s what happened to my brother he came to school up here and then when he went down there he was just so bad off you know from not being able to stay up here that oh uh huh his life just went down the drain so well maybe something will open up for you yeah i i ve been calling a lot of companies there some of them are interested well at least for a year and a half i can work so uh huh well maybe well i ve enjoyed talking to you okay bye bye i ll do it all right same here bye bye
