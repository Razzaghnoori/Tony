 Movies The Matrix Warner Bros Keanu Reeves stars in this complex dystopic sci fi thriller Critics give high marks to the computer enhanced special effects but are divided on the merits of the ambitious plot and the everything but the kichen sink filmic provenance from Soylent Green to Terminator 2 to Hong Kong actioners For some the effects are enough It s one big fat honking comic book of a sci fi martial arts adventure flick It has stu freakin pendous special effects hipster sang froid out the wazoo and a story line that makes only as much sense as it has to Michael O Sullivan the Washington Post A grudgingly appreciative Janet Maslin says that at its best the movie brings Hong Kong action style home to audiences in a mainstream American adventure with big prospects as a cult classic and with the future very much in mind the New York Times Others criticize the convoluted story line and call it strictly genre and strictly for guys in their teens and 20s for whom the script

With the Times by Max Frankel Random House Decent reviews for former New York Times executive editor Max Frankel s memoirs Ward Just calls it a a smart tough scrupulous book in the New York Times Book Review in that fair journal s traditional negative comment spot the penultimate paragraph all Just can come up with is that there s a whiff of the puritan about Max Frankel and perhaps also the rustle of score settling Some reviewers note that his personal life if you can even say he had one gets short shrift and most say Frankel s time at the helm is not half as interesting as his flight from Germany in his childhood and his days as a young correspondent Perhaps the best backhanded compliment is provided by another New York Times review this one from the daily paper Richard Kluger writes that the book has only occasional spasms of the immodesty that almost by definition infects all who venture into autobiography To buy the book click here Find a movie playing near you on Sidewalk com
