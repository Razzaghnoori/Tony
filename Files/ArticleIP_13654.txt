 Opening Arguments This weekend various senators appeared on television to explain why witnesses should or should not testify at President Clinton s trial Not surprisingly every way in which the Republicans frame the question leads to calling witnesses and every way in which the Democrats frame the question leads to not calling witnesses Republicans want to focus attention on the facts of the case which are strong Democrats want to divert attention to the significance of the case which is weak So Republicans want witnesses and Democrats don t Republicans also want to focus scrutiny on the defendant Clinton whereas Democrats want to shift scrutiny to the prosecution the GOP Finally Democrats want to underscore the constitutional costs of Clinton s conviction while Republicans want to underscore the social costs of his acquittal Here is a taxonomy of this week s frames and strategies taken from a debate among six senators on NBC s Meet the Press 1 Sex This is the simplest Democratic frame Its purpose is to keep witnesses out The argument is that they will talk about sex besmirch the Senate and offend the viewing public Example I don t understand why the House feels they have to sully the floor of the United States Senate Sen Barbara Boxer D Calif 2 Rule of Law This is the Republican rebuttal to the sex frame Its purposes are 1 to get witnesses into the trial by arguing that the real subject of testimony is perjury and obstruction not sex and 2 to shift the burden to Clinton s defenders by warning that his acquittal would send the country a corrosive message Example You can certainly argue that someone who breaks the law in not upholding and not telling the truth under oath and someone who obstructs justice does in fact threaten the republic Sen Rick Santorum R Pa 3 Summary Judgment This is the basic Democratic rebuttal to the rule of law frame Its purposes are to shortcut the trial change the subject from the facts of the case to their insignificance and shift the burden back to Clinton s accusers The argument is that even if all the facts are granted they don t rise to the level that would justify his removal Example We re willing to accept the facts because the threshold question is this Even if it s all true exactly as the House managers have put it forward does this rise to the level of impeachment Does it rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors That s the threshold question Boxer 4 Censure This is the advanced rebuttal to the rule of law frame Its purpose is to fast forward past the verdict to the sentence with an emphasis on mitigating circumstances The argument is that a resolution censuring Clinton is sufficient to reaffirm the laws against perjury and obstruction of justice Example I came to the conclusion that the appropriate punishment for this kind of wrongdoing lying about an extramarital relationship was censure Part of the rule of law is that the punishment should fit the crime Sen Charles Schumer D N Y 5 Constitutional Duty This is the Republican response to the censure frame Its purpose is to abort the censure movement before the censure movement aborts the trial The argument is that the Constitution authorizes the Senate to vote only on conviction not on censure Example I don t think our business is to tell the president he has to make some magical act of contrition Our job is defined very clearly in the Constitution Sen Mike DeWine R Ohio 6 Constitutional Duty 2 This Democratic rejoinder turns the GOP s strict constructionism on its head The argument is that the Constitution says the president should be removed only for crimes that imperil the nation Example George Mason I think put it succinctly He said Was this an attempt to subvert the Constitution All of President Clinton s untruths all of his lying under oath if you will about an extramarital relationship does not subvert the Constitution Schumer 7 Jury This all purpose Republican frame posits that the Senate is Clinton s jury and should behave accordingly This accomplishes several objectives First it makes the strongest case for calling witnesses Example I have never seen a trial before where you had factual disputes where you didn t have witnesses where you could watch their demeanor on the stand listen to them judge one witness vs another witness DeWine Second it neutralizes the summary judgment frame since summary judgments are up to the judge not the jury Example We have an obligation to sit back as jurors and let the case be presented Santorum Third it shortcuts the summary judgment and censure frames by organizing the trial s issues in temporal sequence rather than as a decision tree Example We re prejudging this thing when we say it doesn t meet the standard of the high crimes and misdemeanors That s what the trial s all about We re going to listen to the evidence Sen John Chafee R R I 8 Jury Nullification This Democratic rebuttal shatters the jury frame and diverts scrutiny from the defendant to the prosecution The argument is that the Senate should reject the case not because it s unproven but because it s politically motivated Example One of the reasons why we feel that this impeachment trial is really not what it s purported to be is that there have been four years of investigations There are people that just want to get this president Sen Dianne Feinstein D Calif 9 Jury Nullification Nullification This Republican rejoinder grants that the House impeachment process was politicized but argues that 1 the Senate should be above such tawdry politics and 2 the way to regain public confidence is to transcend partisan rancor and skepticism by reverting to the innocence of a jury Example We re sort of like the petit jury How we got there that s up for somebody else to determine What we have to look at is what the facts are DeWine 10 Democracy This nuclear response combines the jury nullification and constitutional duty arguments suggesting that Clinton s removal would violate the Constitution and undo the election The purpose of this rhetorical bomb is to annihilate any discussion of the facts Example Do I think he answered that question honestly No Do I think what he did was reprehensible Absolutely But the question is this alone does it rise to that level where you overturn an election Feinstein 11 Jury Duty This is Clinton s favorite frame In the debate over witnesses its purpose is to strip Republicans of their appeals to the Constitution jury guidelines and the rule of law The argument is that members of Congress have day jobs and every day they spend on Clinton s trial i e jury duty is a day they re not spending on Social Security education and other issues When Boxer raised this concern her Republican colleagues explained that they were two tracking the trial while working on things that affect our constituents That answer won t do It lets Clinton s defenders steer the discussion away from the trial It grants the distinction between the trial and the people s business And it puts the GOP on a collision course with its argument that Clinton shouldn t deliver his State of the Union address on Jan 19 But that s a Frame Game for another day
