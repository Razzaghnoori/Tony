                i guess my basic feeling is that as a middle income tax payer im not paying too much if im sure that im getting value for the dollar i mean that i guess sounds like a cliche but uh looking around at a a lot of the infrastructure particularly in the northeast here uh you know bridges and roads in terrible shape and i dont know  im sort of overwhelmed by it all   do you think that thats because the uh because the politicians have been seduced by the opportunity to get the vote uh so theyve spent the money on on uh popular how should i say it programs that show up immediately you know like giving away uh uh lets see how shall i say it paying money to people that that uh   uh it it takes years for a bridge to begin to show neglect uh whereas a temporary uh   uh input of money can uh which they can never turn off by the way will get this guy votes     yeah its entirely possible certainly anything thats been discussed over the the last dozen years or so or maybe even longer in terms of of tax reform or or revenue reallocation seems to be concerned with just that you know whos whos gonna start getting more and how fast um i kind of came of age in the sixties and it seemed to me seems to me that the the general attitude in the entire country is a lot different then than now i mean i think there was more a a general sense of prosperity   there was   yeah although my       oh excuse me     i was just going to say theres significantly more money and we werent a debtor nation in those days   yeah i ive never been able to reconcile that fact which which does seem to be true with the fact that the typical middle class family today seems to have you know and expect some what more in terms of material possessions and vacations and what not but back then uh i think there is more of a sense of because there was a feeling of prosperity people did not mind paying for social programs for instance or public improvements and today there there seems to be a sort of a jealous guarding by each generation   well i think two things have happened number one uh its like uh   pay play now pay later uh somebodys were were to the point now where where the pay later is uh is here and  and uh when i was growing up they always warned me against borrowing money to go on a vacation because you have all year long to think about those payments       and it just goes by pretty fast well the play now pay later uh mentality uh sounded pretty good at the time when you when you had a fair amount of disposable income and uh   umhum   um the the debt load is way up uh you know in the sixties what was the cost of tuition the cost of tuition in those days was was the cost of uh almost monthly rent today right i dont   yeah pretty much i mean i i paid whatever something on the order of four thousand dollars a year for tuition and room and board and comprehensive fee and uh for those those figures have been dwarfed today certainly   yeah i mean well im not saying monthly rent is four thousand dollars but but tuition uh i bet tuition was about a third of that uh   yeah   you know perhaps anyway what im saying is that everything costs more these days uh and weve reached a point where where people are like i say taxes are going up uh your expenses have gone up and the perhaps the thing thats more important uh uh progressive we are now making what uh what we used to think of as only the rich made you know the daily the minimum wage is  lets see what is it when i was a  im i graduated from college in sixty one and i can remember when i graduated i  hoped someday to make eighteen thousand dollars a year and taxes on eighteen thousand a year uh were a whole lot less than uh you know taxes on what what i thought was a very good salary   yeah   um are about the same as they are today only im making
