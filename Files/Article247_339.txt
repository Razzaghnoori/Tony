 Supreme Court Gridlock Three big Supreme Court decisions yesterday Which to lead with The New York Times the Washington Post USA Today and the Los Angeles Times all choose the ruling that states may ban assisted suicide No Help For Dying is the NYT plaintive subhed A sidebar analysis is headlined somewhat tastelessly An Issue that Won t Die The unanimous ruling that the Communications Decency Act banning smut on the Internet is unconstitutional makes page one of the two Times es and the Post But the third decision rejecting a challenge to the line item veto didn t even rate a front page teaser in the NYT USA Today brings a characteristic human touch to all the dry legal news noting that moments after the Court announced the Internet ruling a staffer for groups opposing the law popped a disk containing the opinion into his laptop computer outside the court and transmitted it by cellular modem to an Internet site The NYT and LAT allot the top of column one journalism s traditional spot for the day s No 2 story to the tax cut bill that passed the House yesterday Two local interest stories with national implications The LAT reports that because of the University of California s recent abandonment of affirmative action in admissions its incoming law school class is likely to include only one black student And the NYT page ones a story that publishing giant HarperCollins is reacting to the slump in book sales by canceling completed books including some already advertised in its catalogs Among the casualties mentioned are a Jell O cookbook and a book about celebrity pets
