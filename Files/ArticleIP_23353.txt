 Splat Bam Pow BR amp Fear no more earthlings the age of frustration and humiliation is over I am the great Shopping Avenger who hath descended to Earth from the planet Galleria in a nuclear fueled Chrysler Town Country minivan base price 27 385 left sliding door standard in most models to save you from the dark forces of turbo charged capitalism and shoddy customer service OK enough with the superhero shtick It s unsustainable over several paragraphs Here s the problem Like most American shoppers I ve been doing my part to fuel the Dow to absurd heights My own personal consumer confidence is high up 2 5 percent just this last month and my spending is profligate laptops and children s toys and weed whackers and coffee tables and SUVs They make it I buy it Retail even But what do I get in return except for 1 billion American Express Membership Rewards points which I can apply toward among other door prizes an NBA Black Leather Zip Daytimer and a personal note from Robert Rubin thanking me for my help Frustration is what I get When I went searching The Home Depot for a replacement charger for the Skil Twist Xtra Flexi Charge Interchangeable Power System Cordless Screwdriver did anyone there know what a Skil Twist Xtra Flexi Charge Interchangeable Power System Cordless Screwdriver even was No When Northwest Airlines charged me 1 000 for a ticket I didn t want and didn t order could I even get anyone on the phone in less than 15 minutes Also no When I ordered Chechnya Calamity in the Caucasus from Amazon com and received instead a copy of Early Islamic Mysticism Sufi Quran Miraj Poets and Theological Writings did I get justice in the form of a refund or a copy of the book I needed No Although I am now a recognized Sufi master Just as I was writing this last paragraph I received an e mail from Amazon boy wonder Jeff Bezos I figured he was writing to apologize Bezos claims to know what I want to read so why shouldn t he also know when I m mad at him but instead his e mail which he apparently sent to other people too flacks his new sure to lose money and at the same time boost his stock price another 200 percent venture Amazon com Auctions I think I ll start by auctioning off my copy of Early Islamic Mysticism Sufi Quran Miraj Poets and Theological Writings But the Shopping Avenger digresses Now I understand retail I m not naive In order to boost quarterly earnings to meet the cosmically greedy expectations of a handful of Wall Street analysts who ve never sold anything in their lives American corporations must cut cut and cut again Pensions are out job security is out and customer service is most definitely out This column will not address such issues as pension rights and job security though it will refer to them from time to time out of guilt at one point earlier in my life I pretended to be a democratic socialist and I was for a time an actual kibbutznik This column instead will seek vengeance for you the loyal American consumer The Shopping Avenger was born a couple of years ago at a dinner party in New York I was seated next to a man who said he was one of the inventors of corporate voice mail routing systems This of course was a lie Al Gore was the inventor of corporate voice mail routing systems I told him that in my humble opinion the advent of voice mail and the disappearance of live operators meant longer waits on the telephone for help He said I was wrong I told him I felt this fairly strongly He again told me I was wrong Surveys show that the waiting period for help has been cut by 98 percent or some such number I then told him that earlier in the day I had spent seven minutes pushing buttons in order to make a single airline reservation He told me it was just my perception that I spent seven minutes pushing buttons Then I called him an asshole and that was that It was then that I decided the American consumer needed help battling the forces of corporate arrogance I felt I was the one to lead the charge But like most selfless impulses I thought about it for a while and the feeling eventually passed But the Shopping Avenger was born again He was born again in Toys R Us where none of the employees seemed to know what a potty seat was and he was born yet again at the Budget Rent a Car counter at La Guardia Airport where the reservation he had made and confirmed suddenly ceased to exist and where he got yelled at for his troubles And so this column Here s how it works You e mail your tale of woe inferior products ignorant customer service to shoppingavenger slate com and the Shopping Avenger will use his reporting skills which have been described by some as almost supernatural in scope and have been described by others as adequate and sort of pathetic to extract on your behalf grudging apologies from faceless bureaucrats at Fortune 500 companies First come first served and be warned the Shopping Avenger looks askance at the bearing of false witness Those companies that deserve praise will be praised Onward P S The Shopping Avenger will also entertain questions about Sufi mysticism
