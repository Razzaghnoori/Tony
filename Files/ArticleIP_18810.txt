 Picasso com The business press played the birth announcement of sothebys com last month as another story about the frenzy for e commerce The snooty British auction house founded in 1744 was going to remodel itself after eBay the 24 hour electronic garage sale Out the window went centuries of snobbery mystique and pretension Up up went Sotheby s stock on the basis of a Web site that didn t yet exist and that wouldn t be selling anything for six months But the dotcomming of Sotheby s is about more than a fusty old company chasing fresh loot It s a harbinger of the dramatic transformation that s about to sweep the entire business of buying and selling rare and precious things The market for art which has long behaved very differently from markets for other kinds of goods is about to be transformed by the irresistible force of the Internet The upscaling of the online auction fad is one aspect of this change but perhaps only a small part of it The trade in art has always been anomalous in economic terms What s unusual about the business is its secretiveness Vendors of most other kinds of goods household appliances cut up chicken parts and condominiums generally advertise what they have for sale and how much it costs Transparency benefits consumers who can compare prices features and quality If you want to buy a 19 inch color television set you start by checking the newspaper for advertised prices In markets where price comparisons aren t easily available Oriental rugs or new cars buyers are at a conspicuous disadvantage The buying experience is unpleasant because consumers suspect they re being fleeced Market secrecy tends to break down because sellers have to reveal their prices if their competitors do In recent years this has happened with cars and even Persian carpets In the art world however secrecy has survived Art dealers seldom advertise prices and sometimes won t even quote them if they re not convinced a buyer is on the hook There was an outcry among gallery owners a few years ago when New York passed a law requiring them to post prices for works that are actually on display Most follow it but grudgingly We re sheepish about posting prices says a dealer I know at a high end SoHo gallery Why give out free information And don t even bother asking what they have for sale At Wildenstein Co which has the world s largest private collection of Old Master and Impressionist paintings not even employees are allowed to know what s inside the vaults There are a variety of reasons for these practices historical cultural and economic Art dealing as a profession originated mainly in France where it began its long association with social snobbery The art dealer cultivates his aura and the more mystical aura of the art object by casting himself as a connoisseur rather than as a merchant He flatters his buyer as a person of taste and distinction rather than a mere customer As a consequence buyers tend not to behave the way consumers do in other fields But the most potent factor is the economic logic of selling rare or unique goods Comparison shopping is hard Even in the case of multiple edition prints where a sizable number of identical lithographs may exist you re not likely to find them competitively priced in adjoining storefronts And virtually everything else is subjective Which is better a green Warhol Marilyn or a red Warhol Marilyn A 1964 Warhol or a 1964 Rauschenberg By making intrinsically difficult comparisons nearly impossible dealers augment their power over the market In other words they can get prices higher than what they would get if everything were laid on the table with a price tag attached The one check on the power of dealers has always been auctions where individuals can buy and sell bidding is public and prices are published Selling more art at auctions and expanding the number of people who can participate in auctions which is what Sotheby s is trying to do by holding them online will bring more efficiency if less drama to the art market But the real way the Internet stands to revolutionize the economics of the art business is simply by breaking down the secrecy that prevails in the nonauction sector of the market If some dealers are willing to sell art to buyers via the Internet and almost all of them are now fanatically eager to do so those who remain coy about what they have and how much they want for it will put themselves at a competitive disadvantage They ll be denying themselves access to the fastest expanding sector of the international art market The chief vehicle for this transformation isn t Sotheby s It s ArtNet on online service which now provides access to the wares of 700 dealers around the world and which is adding new galleries at the rate of 70 a month ArtNet is the brainchild of Hans Neuendorf a German dealer who started the first international art fair in Cologne in 1967 the first actual art market A few years ago Neuendorf founded ArtNet as a database for auction results Now he has turned it into a consortium of galleries offering wares directly over the Internet The company is headed for you guessed it an IPO Neuendorf says he wants to challenge the way the art business works directly This tendency to keep everything secret to take little advantages of information has resulted in a suffocation of the market he says If you wanted to set up a system to keep people away from buying art it would be very close to what we have now The theory behind Neuendorf s business is that the Web will expand the market not only by spreading information but also by making art into a more liquid asset Web auctions like Sotheby s and the competitor Neuendorf plans to launch in March should significantly reduce the transaction costs associated with selling art for dealers and private individuals The seller doesn t have to pay a commission as in an off line auction Gone will be the need for expensive catalogs transparencies FedExed around the world and multiple packing shipping and insurance costs as the work goes from gallery to auction house to purchaser Today the sale of a work of art can add 25 percent to the purchase price and take six months an efficient online sale might add only 10 percent and take but a few days There are a variety of smaller dealer consortiums similar in principle to ArtNet which allow buyers to browse gallery stock and view whole exhibitions online They encourage the kind of comparison shopping that was previously impossible in the art world Not all galleries give prices but enough do to allow the buyer the upper hand occasionally For example looking up the artist Chuck Close I found nine different lithographs for sale online including three copies from the same edition of 50 prints titled Lucas Woodcut The galleries offering this print advertised it at shockingly different prices The Pace Gallery on 57 th Street in New York City had it for 5 000 Jim Kempner Fine Arts a gallery in Chelsea specializing in 20th century prints had it for 12 500 A third gallery Kunsthaus Schaller in Stuttgart Germany had it for 38 000 deutsche marks which is just over 22 000 In the art business old ways die hard I e mailed all three galleries asking them to explain the disparity in their prices Pace responded that they had made a mistake Their price was 18 000 Jim Kempner also claimed a misunderstanding saying that his price curiously enough was really the same as Pace s 18 000 He subsequently offered to sell it to me for 16 000 I never heard back from the gallery in Germany I m not sure how with a pair of e mail messages I managed to effectively double the price of Chuck Close lithographs But you can see why dealers are reluctant to give out prices It makes it harder for them to raise them at a moment s notice when an artist s stock rises as Close s did when he had a big retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art a few months ago In any case if I had actually been interested in buying the print with the help of the Web I would have been in a far better position to negotiate a favorable price What you might ask do dealers stand to gain from making information available online if it merely gives leverage to their customers The answer is that the Internet stands to expand the market as a whole more than enough to compensate them for having to compete with each other A gallery in Geneva or Berlin can now sell artwork to someone who never leaves Iowa City Some even think that while Internet competition may drive prices down initially prices will rise as sellers are matched with buyers and the market clears Neuendorf for one says he expects the Web to drive art prices through the roof Judging from what Pez dispensers are fetching on eBay he might just be right
