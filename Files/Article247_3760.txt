 TV s Mysterious Fascination With Young Adults The successful debut of Once and Again the new drama from the creators of thirtysomething no less about having a love life as a divorced parent has drawn plenty of hosannas from TV watchers who feared that the tube had forever been given over to Dawson s Creek and its myriad clones Once and Again s success has been taken as a sign that a show doesn t have to appeal to that desperately sought after 18 to 34 demographic in order to be a hit As it happens Once and Again s success doesn t necessarily show that at all because it is in fact a huge hit with the 18 to 34 audience Its share of TV watchers in that group is as large as its overall share and larger than the share received by new shows such as Freaks and Geeks and Now and Again In fact Ed Zwick s show about yuppie parents is proving more popular with the young uns than his show about yuppie kids My So Called Life What s weird though is the assumption Once and Again had to combat in order even to get on the air that nothing is more desirable than those 18 to 34 viewers This is not an assumption unique to television It s certainly at work in movies and has also been propelling changes in the magazine world most notably in the ascent of pseudo lad magazines like Maxim and in the pressure that s being felt by older magazines to make themselves more youth friendly But the fact that the assumption is ubiquitous doesn t necessarily mean that it makes sense Now I m part of this fabled demographic albeit at the high end chronologically and in a lot of ways willingness to consume love of new stuff appetite for pop culture of all kinds I m an ideal target for advertisers So I have no problem with TV programmers Hollywood execs and magazine editors trying to appeal to me But I am perplexed by the avidity with which I am being courted because of one simple fact There aren t that many of me I don t mean that I m unique I mean that literally there are fewer many fewer people in my generation than in the generations ahead of and behind us And while it s certainly true that people in their late 20s and early 30s at least in cities where those people are less likely to have families have a lot of disposable income it can t compare in absolute terms to that still wielded by the baby boomers Even in the New Economy earning power rises with age Most people make a lot more when they re 40 than when they re 30 So why do advertisers think we re the ideal audience Partly because of our ability to spend without worrying about our childrens education partly because some advertising is aspirational so that you push products that people will want to buy when they can afford to and partly because of ill considered assumptions about brand loyalty in particular the idea that if you hook me on a particular kind of car or suit or beer at 25 you ll have me for life But surely an important reason for the hegemony of the young adult audience is simply that young adults tend to be the ones who are buying advertising time designing the ads and increasingly writing and programming the shows and films that we see I become the ideal consumer because my friends are the ones selling me the products The picture is more complicated than this of course There aren t many 21 year olds even today writing ads for Chiat Day or programming for NBC Though I suspect there are a lot of 30 year olds doing those jobs who think they re still 21 And I m not sure if Dawson s Creek and Felicity are really targeted at 28 year olds In fact I pray they aren t Finally at the bottom end of the demographic there a lot more people than at the top end Those are the oldest Echo Boomers and advertisers should really want them The point is not that the 18 to 34s should be disregarded It s just that from a purely economic point of view they shouldn t be regarded with such fascination Last week the combined ratings of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Dawson s Creek added up to just 13 percent of all the people who were watching television while those shows aired And even a very stylish 13 percent of all the customers you could be reaching is still just in the end 13 percent
