 This is the story of how I met my husband It s kind of like a Brady Bunch story I was the lady with the two daughters and he was the man with the two sons We had each been divorced for a while and we each were too busy to do any dating or meeting of perspective mates So my daughter Michaela had a group of friends affectionately called The Quail Girls and his son Ryan had a group of friends I won t tell you what we d name them but anyway they were normal high school seniors and both of the children were seniors at South Mecklenburg High School at the same time And the boys and girls interacted a lot they were uh they were all friends One of the girls in Michaela s group Shelle just got an inspiration one day when she was staring out a window riding down the road and she said Chaela We need to get your mom to meet Ryan Speckman s dad And Michaela said Really Cause she was of course very protective of her mom So finally Michaela said Well maybe that will work And all of the other girls are saying Yeah yeah yeah So that was when the idea was born And for the next few months Michaela kept saying You know Mom you need to meet Mr Speckman And I said Now why do I need to meet Mr Speckman Well you need to meet Mr Speckman because he s single and all he has time for is his job and the boys He s really cute and he s a really nice guy and he s real involved with the kids I said Well if he is really cute and he s a really nice guy then I m sure that he s got a girlfriend And she said No no no I know he doesn t I just know he doesn t because the girls say he doesn t and he never goes to the games with anybody and you need to meet Mr Speckman So I said All right whatever I ll meet Mr Speckman So then I would forget about it and the girls would come over and they would say Ms Quinn you need to meet Mr Speckman And I m like Yeah yeah yeah I ll meet Mr Speckman So um a soccer game would come up because the boys played soccer the Speckman boys played soccer Michaela would say How about it Can you go to the soccer game on Thursday night And I had an evening job and I would say Well no I can t go Thursday So then a few more games would go by um I could go to the game but she couldn t go to the game and next time she could go to the game then I couldn t go to the game and she would say Well Mr Speckman wasn t there anyway So this fixture in our house became this Mr Speckman person So um there was at the end of the sports season the fall sport season and the spring sport season at South Mecklenburg there was always a what they called a banquet and they didn t serve any food but for some reason they called it a banquet They had all the children the students from the fall sports up on the stage to be introduced get whatever recognition were appropriate and um there was going to be one in early December of 1995 And uh that was when it was decided since I was going to be there because Michaela played tennis in the fall and Mr Speckman was going to be there since Ryan and Eric played soccer in the fall that was when this meeting would take place So in order to make sure that I would be there one of the Quail Girls who lived right around the corner from the Speckmans said she would come and she would pick me up Michaela couldn t drive me because she had to be there early to be in this program So Michaela helped me pick out what I was supposed to wear and uh Wendy came to pick me up And you have to understand Wendy is this she s a wonderful girl but she s kind of a silly girl She s always like Ha uh ha uh So Wendy came to pick me up and I was all nervous and everything which was ridiculous I was I felt like a high school girl myself And um when we got there uh we s sat with Wendy s parents who again live around the corner from Mr Speckman They said this is uh Wendy s mother said to me Oh You re going to meet John Speckman Whew I hope this works out You ve got good taste I m like Oh boy What am I getting myself into So Wendy and I sat down and were just kind you know of chatting She s squirming and looking all around and everything and the program started and it s quiet and all of a sudden she says There he is Right over there right over there I said Sssh So anyway I got I got a chance to take a look at Mr Speckman and um he looked just like Michaela had described so through the whole thing I kind of did an analysis of you know do I or do I not want to meet Mr Speckman And if I do you know Basically do I or don t I want to meet Mr Speckman but I felt like I would let Michaela and all of the girls down if I did not So after the program was over Michaela came down off the stage And she came and uh came with me to the little lobby of the auditorium where they were serving food So all the Quail Girls and I were together and we were having punch and cake or whatever and the guys and Mr Speckman were over kind of in another area So uh you know Wendy was saying How are we going to do this How are we going to do this And I said Well you know if it happens it happens If it doesn t happen I ll I ll you know it can happen at another time I m sure We ll be in the same place another time because minutes went by and nothing happened So I said to Michaela after about five or 10 more minutes You know maybe this isn t the right time Let s just leave and and you know I ll I ll just meet him another time And all of a sudden I got this tap on the shoulder and I turned around and I looked up into the eyes of this high school boy and it was Ryan Speckman And he said Don t you want to meet him And I fell in love with Ryan Speckman first and I said Well sure So he went and he got him and I walked in that direction and Mr Speckman came over and said Hi You must be Ms Quinn And I said You must be Mr Speckman So we introduced each other and had a few awkward moments and then we left So the next th OK that was the Monday of Thanksgiving week so I had to work the day after Thanksgiving in the medical clinic where I worked and it was a crazy crazy crazy day and Michaela called me in the middle of the day this was on a Friday and she said Guess who called and left a message And I said Who And she said Mr Speckman And I said You re kidding And she said Are you going to call him Are you going to call him Are you going to call him So I said Yeah I ll call him So I went home that night called him left him a message he wasn t there So a couple of days later I get home from work again in the evening and there was a message that said Call me back whatever time So I called him back and we arranged to have dinner on that following Friday So I called and talked to Michaela and I said Well we re going out to eat And she said I knew it I knew it I knew it Ryan came up to me at school and he said He called her I think they re going to go out And apparently another one of the Quail Girls worked at Boston Market and some of the boys who were in Ryan s group crossed the serving line and said He called her and he s going to ask her out So everybody knew before I knew that he called me and was going to ask me out So Friday came and we were supposed to go out I came home from work so there was a message and on the voice mail was Shelle the girl who had this brainstorm to begin with and she said Hi This is Shelle Just wanted to tell you good luck tonight Don t be nervous You ll be fine And I m like I m old enough to be your mother I m sure I ll be fine So everybody s eager to find out what s happening on this date So um Michaela was going out and I had instructions to call her as soon as I got home to beep her as soon as I got home so we could discuss the date So we went out to dinner at a place where Mr Speckman had asked one of his sons friends where we should go and he said that s where we should go and so we went there to eat And the whole evening was talk the discussion the whole evening was how all the preparation and all the discussion that was going on with me and the Quail Girls was also going on with John and with all Ryan s friends And they had cleaned out the car they called him at work and made sure that he was there in time for the date so I mean we had a lovely evening lovely evening And um just talked about how funny it was that these kids were trying to to make us meet So the next day um Michaela yeah I called Michaela and she said What did you think What did you think I said You know he s a very nice man but he is so busy with his business and with his two boys that I don t even think he s even got time for another date but he he is very nice But if he asked me out again I d probably go out again So this was Friday night early so the next day I went out and I bought a Christmas tree and I had a lot of errands to do In the afternoon Mr Speckman calls and said Really had a good time last night I said I did too It really was fun He said I d like to do it again sometime And I said Yeah I would too So we re talking some more and I said I went and got a Christmas tree He said What are you going to do this evening I said I ll probably put the Christmas tree up He said You know I would really like to go to McAdenville So anyway I said Cool You want to

believe it she s going out with him again You re going out with him again So we went out again and we went out the next Friday and Saturday and the next Friday and Saturday and the next Friday and Saturday and meanwhile all the kids at school are in absolute shock that we liked each other and we were going out I don t know what they expected And one friend of Ryan s Brandon said to Michaela one day Wouldn t it be weird if your mom and Mr Speckman got married And like you moved into that house and you were taking a shower and Ryan Ryan s your stepbrother and he s going to knock on the ba how weird would that be Michaela told me that and I said That is so weird She said That is so weird Well it wasn t long before um probably a month or two later she said to me Mom he s wonderful Would you

wedding party was the Quinn girls and the Speckman boys and the guest list was the Quail Girls and all of Ryan s friends and they all lived happily ever after
