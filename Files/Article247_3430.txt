 When Rolling Stone Rocked ELLEN Well that s a lot to chew on I m not convinced by your Nation like the country is basically being run by global corporations rap That s too easy If what you say is true then Clinton wouldn t have been able to pass his huge tax increase in 93 If what you say is true the estate tax an absurd violation of family values wouldn t exist and capital gains taxes would be slashed I agree that the president and Congress has less to do with the economy than is believed and what they take credit for when things are going well but I don t believe that GM Microsoft GE etc run the country If that were true the crazy amount of entitlements handouts and obscene regulations on business wouldn t exist I m with you on most social issues pro choice obviously pro First Amendment pro gay rights etc Legalize pot It wouldn t bother me and would be an economic boon to the country I am in favor of capital punishment and think all this nonsense about hate crimes is just that nonsense Rhetoric that obscures the debate Any crime is hateful whether it s committed against a white Jew black gay Muslim or Scientologist As for Columbine I think the media especially television behaved disgracefully It was all about ratings just as the intrusive coverage of John Kennedy s tragic death and selling newspapers End of story so to speak And it simply encourages copycat crimes Columbine had the great hook kids especially the unfortunate girl who professed her belief in God and became an instant martyr It s no surprise that CNN the prime offender didn t spend one tenth the time on the Atlanta massacre After all those murders were carried out in a financial work setting it didn t have the juice of a high school for TV producers Never mind that the kook killed his own family a truly horrendous event Magazines I agree with Rolling Stone although it was far more vital in the first half of the 70s after the move to New York things went downhill My framework also includes Rolling Stone from that era the Voice in the 60s and early 70s Spy in the late 80s The Atlantic usually bores me it seems like a giant James Fallows mix I read The Nation for Hitchens he s been great on Clinton if Bush wins I m sure we ll be on opposite sides Cockburn although he s far better in NYPress and just to be irritated Katha Pollitt and Eric Alterman I didn t like the first issue of Talk at all whatever you feel about Tina Brown and I admired much of her work at Vanity Fair and the New Yorker she s clearly lost any sense of vision That s it for today Look at NYPress tomorrow on line via the Drudge Report or directly at nypress com Best RUSS
