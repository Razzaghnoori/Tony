        well i think we pay too much in taxes  how about you   yeah well i think they waste what we pay   excuse me   i think they waste what what all the money that we pay   yeah thats what i think too i dont know how you feel um we moved here from another state weve lived here before went out and came back and that particular state had an occupational income tax but no sales tax   umhum   and what you find out is theres one evils the same as the other here you dont theres no occupational tax but its a heavy sales tax so they get you coming and going   umhum no its even its even higher in Dallas County so was it   yeah its really i know its just um   eight and a quarter i think   yeah it is i was shocked i went we bought a new washer and the man said and thats eight percent i said eight percent what so its really kind of sad yeah   umhum   and then i dont know how you know in terms of when you all do your federal but it just seems like if youre strictly middle income it seems like you get hit the worst   yeah   is that what you think   yeah because it different at some point it goes up to thirty three percent and then the people that make you know five hundred thousand dollars and and and higher than that they dont have to pay sometimes they have to pay even less taxes   umhum doesnt seem quite fair does it because they have the money to shelter things and i dont know somehow get a huh   no it isnt what   oh i thought you were going to say something they somehow seem to get around the the things that we cant you know that make dont make that kind of money   no right   i dont know   i mean if theyre in business and and theyre making money i i could see if theyre losing money but theyre making money then they should pay taxes then   umhum i know and just somehow it doesnt seem you know and and theyre not you mean you look at somebody like uh that country singer uh whats his name Willie Nelson   umhum   i was reading about him in the paper and i said well you know he knew he was making money somebody he didnt look that stupid why didnt he pay his taxes you know   right umhum   in a way its almost like he had so much debt that uh filing bankruptcy was a way to get out of all of it you know so   right   do you file federal or a joint income tax or do you   i just file federal income tax every year   and do you feel like you get hit by you know too much   yeah i just got divorced so im single again so and you know its its its a lot worse for single people because they pay the same amount as as the people that make the same amount of money and theyre married that   umhum and we right now we dont own any property we lease so were in the same we dont have children so were in the same kind of its not as bad as being single and divorced but its sort of like if you have like X point five children and own you know      umhum   you kind of get hit with you know i i mean it doesnt even pay for me to earn a good wage because and that sounds stupid but i mean theres actually less tax implication if i dont work full time compared to what my husband does you know   umhum right   so its kind of hard   whoever works less they get a tax credit for that   excuse me   if both of the both of the spouses work then you get a tax credit for that umhum   uhhuh right yeah otherwise youre just you know and if you have kids you get like seven hundred fifty dollars or something   well its two thousand now yeah for everybody   oh it is oh oh my well thats not too bad   umhum then you get a you get a child care exemption but its not enough you know i mean you pay from fifty to a hundred dollars a week in child care and and they only give you like   uhhuh   well i think its about five or ten percent of that you know it doesnt even its not even   oh my goodness yeah i guess thats my call i guess i better go   oh okay   okay well it was nice talking to you uhhuh byebye   nice talking to you byebye
