 Introduction Endotoxin is a major component of the cell wall of Gram negative bacteria It is normally cleared from the blood by macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system predominantly localized in the liver 1 Acute endotoxemia characterized by excessive levels of endotoxin in the blood can lead to endothelial injury hypotension multi organ failure and death 1 Endotoxin induced tissue injury is associated with an inflammatory response and an accumulation of phagocytes at sites of damage Neutrophils are major cellular components of an acute inflammatory reaction These cells are rapidly recruited to areas of injury where they become activated to release reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates cytokines and lipid mediators which aid in antigen destruction but may also contribute to tissue injury 2 Neutrophils are relatively short lived cells removed from the body under homeostatic conditions by the process of apoptosis To exert their biological effects during inflammatory reactions neutrophils must remain at the injured site for prolonged periods of time In this regard recent studies have shown that inflammatory mediators such as lipopolysaccharide LPS granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor and leukotriene B 4 delay apoptosis and prolong neutrophil survival in culture 3 4 Neutrophils migrating into rodent lungs in response to LPS challenge have also been reported to exhibit delayed rates of apoptosis 5 6 Similarly increases in cytokine and growth factor activity and reduced neutrophil apoptosis have been described in various inflammatory lung diseases in humans including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease acute respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia 3 7 8 In the present study we characterized the effects of acute endotoxemia on the response of a unique population of neutrophils which we have previously demonstrated are tightly adhered to the lung vasculature 9 Because of their location within the tissue these cells are likely to be more relevant than circulating neutrophils or neutrophils recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage BAL to the pathophysiology of endotoxin induced lung injury We found that administering endotoxin to rats resulted in an increased number of functionally active adherent vascular lung neutrophils Moreover these cells exhibited decreased apoptosis and expressed the anti apoptotic protein Mcl 1 This was correlated with the induction of total mitogen activated protein MAP kinases as well as NF B and cAMP response element binding CREB protein transcription factor activity in the cells These findings suggest a potential mechanism mediating decreased apoptosis and increased functional activation of adherent vascular neutrophils in the lung during acute endotoxemia Materials and methods Animals and treatments Female specific pathogen free Sprague Dawley rats 200 225 g 6 8 weeks were purchased from Taconic Germantown NY USA Animals were housed in microisolator cages and were

endotoxin on adherent vascular lung neutrophil number and survival Approximately 1 10 6adherent vascular neutrophils were recovered from the lungs of control animals Fig 1 Treatment of rats with endotoxin caused a time related increase in cell number This response was rapid occurring within 0 5 hours of endotoxin administration and biphasic Thus the initial increase in cell number was followed by a decrease towards control levels and then a secondary increase at 24 hours which persisted for 48 hours To determine if neutrophils responding to endotoxin administration exhibited reduced apoptosis we analyzed the cells by DNA agarose gel electrophoresis Freshly isolated neutrophils from control animals displayed significant apoptosis as indicated by the appearance of cytoplasmic DNA in the gels Fig 2 upper panel Treatment of rats with endotoxin caused a time related decrease in cytoplasmic DNA which was evident within 2 hours and became undetectable by 12 hours The effects of in vivo endotoxin on neutrophil apoptosis persisted for at least 48 hours We also analyzed apoptosis in adherent vascular lung neutrophils using Annexin V binding Cells isolated from control animals showed significant apoptosis as demonstrated by increased Annexin V binding Fig 2 middle panel Treatment of rats with endotoxin caused a time dependent decrease in Annexin V binding by adherent vascular lung neutrophils Endotoxin administration induces Mcl 1 expression in adherent vascular lung neutrophils Mcl 1 is an anti apoptotic member of the Bcl 2 family whose expression is correlated with decreased apoptosis and increased survival in human neutrophils 15 16 Western blot analysis showed that neutrophils from control animals did not express Mcl 1 protein Fig 2 lower panel Treatment of rats with endotoxin resulted in a rapid induction of Mcl 1 which peaked between 2 and 12 hours Although expression of Mcl 1 in the neutrophils declined with time significant amounts were still detectable 48 hours after endotoxin administration In contrast we were unable to detect Bcl 2 Bax or Bcl X L in adherent vascular lung neutrophils even after endotoxin administration data not shown Effects of endotoxin on functional activity of adherent vascular lung neutrophils To determine whether acute endotoxemia activated adherent vascular lung neutrophils for increased functional responsiveness we initially analyzed their chemotactic activity towards bacterially derived fMLP This peptide was found to be a potent chemoattractant for adherent vascular lung neutrophils Fig 3 Induction of acute endotoxemia resulted in a dramatic increase in their responsiveness to fMLP which was evident in cells isolated 0 5 hours after treatment of the animals Fig 3 However the effects of endotoxin were transient Thus by 12 hours post endotoxin administration chemotactic responsiveness was at or below control levels Previous studies have demonstrated that acute endotoxemia activates peripheral blood neutrophils to release prostaglandins 17 These lipid mediators are produced during inflammatory reactions largely via the enzyme COX 2 18 We found that COX 2 mRNA was markedly upregulated 40 400 fold in adherent vascular lung neutrophils following endotoxin treatment of the animals Fig 4 This was evident within 0 5 hours of endotoxin administration and persisted for at least 12 hours Subsequently COX 2 mRNA returned to control levels Induction of COX 2 mRNA following endotoxin administration was correlated with expression of COX 2 protein However in contrast to mRNA protein levels remained elevated for 48 hours Acute endotoxemia also resulted in a time dependent increase in TNF mRNA levels in adherent vascular lung neutrophils which was evident within 0 5 hours Fig 5 As observed with COX 2 mRNA TNF mRNA levels began to decline at 12 hours and by 24 hours were at control levels Effects of endotoxin on biochemical activity of adherent vascular lung neutrophils We next examined biochemical signaling pathways known to regulate cell survival and activation to determine if their expression was altered in adherent vascular lung neutrophils during acute endotoxemia Initially we analyzed total p38 and p44 42 MAP kinases Freshly isolated cells from untreated animals expressed low levels of both total p38 and p44 42 MAP kinase as determined by western blot analysis Fig 6 upper panel Induction of acute endotoxemia caused a rapid within 0 5 hours and persistent increase in expression of both proteins Activation of MAP kinases is associated with their phosphorylation 19 Neutrophils from control animals were found to express phospho p38 MAP kinase Endotoxin treatment of the animals was associated with a transient decrease in expression of activated p38 MAP kinase Fig 6 upper panel In contrast to phospho p38 MAP kinase we were unable to detect phospho p44 42 MAP kinase in adherent vascular neutrophils data not shown The effects of acute endotoxemia on expression of PI3K and its downstream target PKB were also investigated Adherent lung neutrophils from control animals expressed low levels of PI3K Fig 6 lower panel In contrast PKB was not detectable in these cells Administration of endotoxin to the animals induced PI3K expression which peaked 12 hours post treatment and persisted for 48 hours This was correlated with induction of PKB However in contrast to PI3K the effects of endotoxin on PKB were transient Thus PKB levels began to decline after 12 hours Fig 6 lower panel NF B CREB and C EBP are transcription factors known to be important in regulating the expression of various genes controlling apoptosis and inflammatory mediator production including Mcl 1 COX 2 and TNF 20 21 and these were next examined No NF B nuclear binding activity was detected in cells from control animals Fig 7 left panel Endotoxin administration caused a biphasic increase in NF B binding activity which was most pronounced 0 5 hours and 24 hours post treatment of the animals Two major complexes were formed Antibodies to p50 and p65 completely blocked the migration of the slower moving complex in the gel and partially blocked the migration of the faster moving complex Binding was also abolished in the presence of excess unlabeled NF B demonstrating the specificity of the probe As observed with NF B constitutive CREB and C EBP nuclear binding activities were not evident in cells from control animals Fig 7 middle and right panels Although endotoxin administration caused a significant induction of both of these transcription factors in adherent vascular neutrophils the kinetics of their responses was distinct Thus whereas CREB activity peaked 0 5 hours after endotoxin administration C EBP binding activity was maximal at 12 hours For both transcription factors binding was abolished by excess unlabeled probe demonstrating specificity Moreover antibodies to CREB as well as phospho CREB blocked the nuclear binding activity of CREB while antibodies to C EBP and C EBP blocked C EPB nuclear binding activity Discussion Recent studies have suggested that phagocytic leukocytes including macrophages and neutrophils contribute to the pathophysiology of endotoxin induced lung injury 22 Whereas macrophages are normally present in the tissue the majority of neutrophils responding to endotoxin must emigrate into the lung from the blood The initial step in this process involves tight adherence of the neutrophils to the vasculature 23 In this study we analyzed the effects of acute endotoxemia on functional and biochemical responsiveness of these cells Treatment of rats with endotoxin was found to stimulate neutrophil adherence to the lung vasculature Thus following endotoxin administration increased numbers of adherent vascular neutrophils were recovered from the lung A similar increase in vascular lung neutrophils has been observed in rabbits following i v administration of LPS 24 25 Interestingly in our model this response was biphasic occurring initially at 0 5 hours and then again at 24 hours after endotoxin administration We speculate that this represents two distinct populations of responding cells Sepsis is associated with a rapid release of CXC chemokines by alveolar macrophages as well as up regulation of lung vascular intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ICAM 1 expression 26 and these may contribute to the initial increase in adherent vascular neutrophils in the lung Activated neutrophils have also been reported to express increased macrophage inflammatory protein 2 MIP 2 mRNA following endotoxin administration 21 It is possible that the secondary increase in adherent neutrophils in the lung vasculature is due to the generation of chemotactic factors by activated neutrophils Mature neutrophils have a circulating life span in vivo of about 6 10 hours after which time they undergo apoptosis 27 The present studies demonstrate that adherent vascular neutrophils from the lungs of endotoxin treated animals exhibit decreased apoptosis as evidenced by reduced cytoplasmic DNA and decreased Annexin V binding when compared to cells from untreated animals These results are in accord with previous studies demonstrating delayed apoptosis in neutrophils recovered from BAL fluid and from peripheral blood after LPS challenge in mice and humans 5 28 and correlate with our findings of increased survival of these cells in culture 29 Acute endotoxemia caused a marked induction of Mcl 1 in freshly isolated adherent vascular lung neutrophils which peaked between 2 and 12 hours and remained elevated for at least 48 hours These findings indicate that prolonged neutrophil survival in the lung vasculature following endotoxin administration may be mediated at least in part by Mcl 1 In contrast to cells from endotoxin treated animals adherent vascular neutrophils from control animals did not express Mcl 1 protein This is consistent with the relatively high levels of apoptosis observed in these cells and their reduced survival in culture 29 Our findings are in accord with a recent study demonstrating that Mcl 1 expression in human peripheral blood neutrophils decreases with aging 15 As previously reported for human peripheral blood neutrophils 30 we were unable to detect Bcl 2 in rat adherent vascular lung neutrophils even after endotoxin treatment of animals We were also unable to detect Bax or Bcl X L in rat adherent vascular lung neutrophils which is in contrast to results with human peripheral blood neutrophils 30 31 These differences may be due to unique attributes of human and rat cells their distinct location in the vasculature and or to their exposure to inflammatory stimuli in vivo We have previously shown that acute endotoxemia primes adherent lung neutrophils for increased production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates suggesting that these cells are functionally activated 9 The work reported here demonstrates that adherent vascular lung neutrophils from endotoxin treated rats are also activated to respond to chemotactic stimuli and to express TNF and COX 2 mRNA and protein The effects of endotoxin administration on these responses were rapid occurring within 0 5 hours Subsequently chemotactic responsiveness and TNF mRNA expression declined and by 12 hours were at control levels Similar transient increases in neutrophil chemotaxis and pulmonary TNF production have been described previously during experimentally induced endotoxemia 32 33 These findings are consistent with the idea that chemotaxis and TNF production are important in early inflammatory responses of neutrophils 34 In contrast protein levels for COX 2 remained elevated for 48 hours after endotoxin administration This most likely reflects the sustained role of prostaglandins during the inflammatory process 35 36 Inflammatory mediators induce their biological effects by binding to specific receptors on target cells This initiates biochemical signaling pathways leading to increased survival and functional activation Members of the MAP kinase signaling cascade have been shown to delay apoptosis in a number of cell types 37 38 39 Proteins belonging to this family are also involved in cell signaling leading to functional responsiveness of inflammatory cells including chemotaxis and mediator production 40 Treatment of rats with endotoxin induced expression of total p38 and p44 42 MAP kinase in adherent vascular lung neutrophils within 0 5 hours a response which persisted for 48 hours Our findings that these MAP kinases are upregulated within 0 5 hours in response to endotoxin suggests that they may contribute to increased chemotactic responsiveness and TNF production In this regard inhibition of p38 MAP kinase activity has been reported to block chemotaxis and TNF release by lung neutrophils epithelial cells and eosinophils 40 41 42 Interestingly significant phospho p38 MAP kinase was also detected in neutrophils from control animals Phospho p38 MAP kinase is known to promote apoptosis in human peripheral blood neutrophils 37 and a similar pathway may be involved in adherent vascular lung neutrophil apoptosis in control animals Alternatively endotoxin administration to animals may induce phosphatases that degrade phospho p38 MAP kinase 43 In contrast to phospho p38 MAP kinase we were unable to detect phospho p44 42 MAP kinase in rat adherent vascular neutrophils even after endotoxin administration This may be due to an inability of the antibody to recognize phosphorylated residues on these proteins in primary rat neutrophils Abraham et al 44 have recently reported p42 MAP kinase activation in mouse lung neutrophils in response to endotoxin administration Differences between our results may be due to unique attributes of rat and mouse models Inositol lipids generated via PI3K and downstream targets such as PKB have been implicated in the regulation of cell survival as well as in induction of MAP kinases and TNF 45 46 47 We found that endotoxin treatment of the animals caused a significant increase in expression of both PI3K and PKB at 12 hours which is consistent with reduced apoptosis in these cells However our findings that PI3K levels remained elevated for 48 hours while PKB decreased suggest that PI3K regulates signaling pathways in adherent vascular neutrophils that are distinct from PKB Our data also suggest that in lung neutrophils PI3K and PKB are not co ordinately regulated with chemotaxis or expression of TNF or MAP kinases The transcription factors NF B and CREB have been reported to activate COX 2 in LPS stimulated monocytes and macrophages in vitro 48 49 Moreover endotoxin induced increases in neutrophil TNF as well as interleukin 1 and MIP 2 in vivo appear to be mediated by NF B and CREB 21 We found that activated NF B and CREB were present in the nucleus of adherent vascular lung neutrophils from endotoxemic but not control rats suggesting that these transcription factors play a role in increased responsiveness of the cells These findings are in accord with previous studies on mouse lung neutrophils during endotoxemia 21 Our observation that nuclear binding activity appeared in the cells rapidly after endotoxin administration within 0 5 hours indicates that NF B and CREB are involved in early functional activation A similar role has been suggested for these transcription factors in the response of intraparenchymal mononuclear cells to hemorrhage 50 The fact that NF B and CREB activation occurs prior to expression of PI3K and PKB indicates that these transcription factors may regulate these proteins in lung neutrophils Interestingly a secondary increase in NF B was observed in cells isolated 24 hours after endotoxin administration This may reflect the activity of a second distinct neutrophil population responding to endotoxin Administration of endotoxin to the animals also induced C EBP nuclear binding activity In contrast to NF B and CREB this was most pronounced 12 hours post treatment of the animals It is possible that NF B and CREB mediate the early phases of neutrophil activation while C EBP proteins function to maintain this response 50 The observation that the temporal pattern of expression of activated C EBP and PKB are similar suggests co ordinated regulation of these proteins 51 A decrease in activation of transcription factors like NF B and CREB and an increase in C EBP may also contribute to reduced activity of pro apoptotic genes resulting in prolonged longevity of neutrophils in the lung vasculature Recent studies have demonstrated upregulation of C EBP in lung injury induced by LPS in vivo 52 53 Our findings are consistent with this report and suggest that this transcription factor may be a marker of tissue injury Conclusion The present studies demonstrate that acute endotoxemia causes increases in the number of adherent neutrophils in the lung vasculature Moreover these cells exhibit decreased apoptosis and increased chemotaxis and TNF expression activities known to be important in early inflammatory responses Acute endotoxemia also rapidly induced NF B and CREB as well as total p38 and p44 42 MAP kinases We speculate that NF B and CREB regulate the activity of biochemical signals leading to prolonged survival and inflammatory mediator production in the lung Further studies are needed to determine the precise role of these signaling molecules in endotoxin induced inflammatory responses in the lung Abbreviations BAL
