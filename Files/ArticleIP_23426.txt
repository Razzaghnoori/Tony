 Altman s Gold I don t want to project too much onto Robert Altman s bluesy charmer Cookie s Fortune to argue for instance that it s the work of an old master summing up But it sure feels that way The screenwriter Anne Rapp has provided Altman with a blueprint not only for an ensemble comedy but also for a comedy that honors the very idea of an ensemble It s no wonder Altman fell on it As early as M A S H 1970 the director seemed more taken with the ebb and flow of groups than with the isolated treks of individuals It s not just that he likes to tell stories with multiple strands or that he gets bored easily with one consciousness or even that he cherishes some 60s utopian fantasy of the collective What Cookie s Fortune suggests is that for Altman order in the universe can t be discerned in the comings and goings of lone heroes but in the interactions among vast and disparate collections of people This time out he transforms the bad vibes of his other films into a vision that s positively serene He celebrates a universe that has found its equilibrium and the easy way in which it rights itself when a nasty bit of flotsam threatens to throw it out of whack The movie takes place in the Deep South which was also the setting for Altman s edgy disharmonic thriller The Gingerbread Man 1998 The opening is teasingly misleading as if to make you think you re seeing The Gingerbread Man II In Holly Springs a small Mississippi cotton town Willis Richland Charles S Dutton staggers out of a blues joint semi drunk then drops his bottle of bourbon when a police car glides ominously past So he heads back into the bar steals a fifth of Wild Turkey then ambles past the railroad tracks and peeps into a van where a young woman Liv Tyler has been undressing Then he climbs in the window of a big antebellum house and takes some guns from a glass cabinet at the foot of the main staircase So far so Southern Gothic Except that Willis it turns out is the town s gentlest spirit loved even by those passing police who are his fishing buddies He s a caretaker at that house he couldn t find his keys The girl he was spying on is the runaway niece of the elderly widow Cookie Orcutt Patricia Neal he works for He d promised to clean those guns before he went to bed And the next afternoon Willis buys a fifth of Wild Turkey and surreptitiously slips it behind the bar of the blues joint to replace the one he d swiped The owner Rufus Thomas pretends not to notice but when Willis leaves he turns to his chesty singer Ruby Wilson and says Willis is even again That s the core of Cookie s Fortune Willis is even again It suggests a community in which everything is in balance in which people accept the good and the bad in faith that it will all even out in the end The picture sits vaguely in the comic mystery genre but it s more of a relaxant than a thriller There s a violent death and a cover up and the police have to figure out what really happened before an innocent person is condemned to prison or worse But Altman doesn t let the audience s outrage mount The act that kicks the movie into a higher gear comes nearly half an hour in and Altman is in no hurry to get to his narrative point That s probably because he has to eliminate Cookie to do it and Patricia Neal isn t someone you want to get rid of The actress now in her 70s has shrunk in physical stature but has otherwise swelled I don t remember her having such power in her lungs When she sucks on her pipe and stares at the gun cabinet and upbraids her late husband for leaving her behind Altman clearly wants her to take all the time in the world How do you convince young directors to watch and emulate Altman It s so much easier to push a filmmaker like Stanley Kubrick whose brilliant sequences you can screen and dissect in a cinema studies class Altman uses a distinctive color palette here a lot of neonlike primary colors as if the whole Mississippi town were a blues joint but his mastery is in his offhandedness in how he conceals his own storytelling There s always a sense that his characters are living even when you re not watching them maybe because the actors don t seem on the way they do for other directors Altman catches them in his gaze and gives them the once over and then they go about their business Actors I didn t think I d want to see again Ned Beatty and Donald Moffat I wanted to see more of and Chris O Donnell is positively reborn as a bumbling young policeman who only wants to make out with Liv Tyler against the station house soda machine Courtney B Vance shows up as an officious homicide detective from a nearby city who finds Holly Springs lazy informality irritating but none of the women wants to answer his queries They want to flirt with him and he can t help falling into their easy rhythms Glenn Close plays Camille Orcutt Cookie s histrionic niece and the director of the church theatricals currently Oscar Wilde s Salome whose hysterical obsession with hiding the disgraceful truth throws the town into an uproar I was surprised to find Close in the movie since her clenched overly controlled acting seems at odds with what Altman usually goes for But this might be her best performance ever Her Camille is like a steely demented temperance activist who keeps charging into otherwise relaxed settings and throwing them into chaos You d think the police could take their stupid crime tape with them when they leave She pairs beautifully with Julianne Moore as Camille s simple minded vaguely schitzy sister Cora who s so browbeaten that whenever she s called on to talk the Scripture comes flowing out of her mouth like lava The truth in Cookie s Fortune isn t ferreted out la Murder She Wrote it emerges in dribs and drabs a witness here a piece of evidence there as if by natural law You might even say that the truth emerges as a consequence of chaos and not from some misguided pursuit of order What seems on the surface as ingratiating a movie as Altman has ever made is actually packed with subversive ideas It ends on a note of blithe miscegenation just the sort of punch line to send the Camilles of the world screaming from the theater swiping at invisible bugs As a young movie critic I made the wrong sort of name for myself by swooning in print over many a nubile actress Yes I was often promiscuous in my praise and yes my affaires de la t te were often sadly short lived But I ve practiced the critical equivalent of abstinence for many years now and it s time to reassert what can never be forgotten It is the right nay the duty of a critic to fall and fall hard I see no point in writing about Never Been Kissed a pleasant but annoyingly insubstantial teen comedy unless I can pull out the stops and say it s worth seeing it demands to be seen for Drew Barrymore who is at once the dizziest and most magically poised comedienne in movies today Barrymore plays a frumpy newspaper copy editor who s ordered to go undercover as a high school student by a nuttily competitive publisher Garry Marshall Is Drew a convincing frump Surprisingly so She hits her slight speech impediment harder than usual and further relaxes her already shlumpy posture Trying to fit in with the cool kids she seems heartbreakingly defenseless You could mistake her for an ordinary unaffected nerd except that the genius Barrymore timing is in every breath every screwy inflection every pratfall After an hour I thought that Never Been Kissed might be the most fun teenpic since Clueless but ultimately the movie takes too many shortcuts even on its own dumb formulaic terms and it can t make up its mind whether it wants to pander to teen age fantasies of good looks and popularity or to scold teen agers for being so shallow No matter The picture would have to be a hell of a lot worse to keep me from going back to watch Drew bite her lower lip and that shy smile spread meltingly across that sweet eternally girlish face and Wait maybe I d better switch to The Matrix which made 37 million in its first week and seems poised to become a phenomenon Directed by Larry and Andy Wachowski it s a mishmash of Hong Kong sword fighting ghost epics Kafkaesque virtual reality fantasies Cronenbergian visions of cybernetically enhanced flesh Alice in Wonderland surrealism post apocalyptic urban grunge Terminator like battles of man vs machine and portentous lumpen Zen posturing I can only show you the door You have to walk through it It shouldn t make a lick of sense let alone feel all of a piece but The Matrix is actually one of the more lyrical sci fi action thrillers ever made in which space and time become love slaves to the directors witty visual fancies Keanu Reeves makes a lean strikingly beautiful tabula rasa hero twisting out of the way of bullets that elongate like silver beads of mercury and he s partnered by the equally hard blank and androgynously gorgeous Carrie Anne Moss Walls and pillars explode around them but the sleek geometric lines of their bodies never soften The machines in comparison seem fuzzy
