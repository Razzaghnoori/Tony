                well how do you use your credit cards   um i use them carefully i guess um   yeah   i uh i usually dont i usually use them to consolidate billing   umhum   uh for convenience sakes but i usually just pay them off at the end of the month   yeah especially what i do   i dont i dont avoid the finance charges uh as high as they are   yeah   i dont uh   ridiculously high   dont you know i dont let them carry over you know i uh   umhum   ive been lucky i guess i havent had a bill big enough where i couldnt pay them off at the end of the month but i i try to try to live within a budget you know and so   well so   i keep that in mind i just dont you know i guess it takes selfrestraint when you have a credit card to know that that theres really you really have to pay these things off   yeah plus a lot more   plus a lot more you know and you got to realize that theres only this much money in the bank and if youre going to live you know   yeah well   if youre not going to try to you know say well ill pay it off sometime in the future   yeah for so many years i was so deep in debt on credit cards and i finally dug my way out of them and that was enough to teach me you know you just  i can do without them   umhum right  some people have a rip theirs up just because they cant you know they cant resist them   yeah         i got rid of a lot of them especially the ones where i paid fees   right   uh i kept the ones that were free   right   and basically the same thing i use them if im running short of cash and theres something i want or sale a sale or   umhum   when i travel i use them   right i use them to float sometimes if its near the end of the month and you know and you know i dont have a check coming in a few days   yeah yeah yeah its about   ill go ahead and and charge it knowing that the money will be there   yeah thats what i do   by the time the bill comes   yeah if theres running into a cash short or something theres some things some purchases i make that i will do always on credit card just so i have a record of them just like when i take all my cats down to the vet i always pay that on credit card   uhhuh right you know we go out to eat a lot of times   yeah   i dont like to carry a lot of cash with me   humum   i have so i just carry my credit card and and for things like that   yeah   as long as i know you know that im im not over doing it   yeah   its a and yeah i have i have what i have two credit cards thats all i use im always getting stuff in the mail all the time   yeah yeah i   you are a preferred such and such and you

flurry of these things so i i did i have picked up three gas credit cards in the last couple months   oh   but uh   sometimes they just send them to you and say here have a credit card   yeah   i have that one   oh do you yeah     yeah i just ripped i just cut it up and threw it away but you know   oh you should have used it you wouldnt have been liable for the payment   is that right   yeah   huh i didnt know that   they yeah they send you card that   that you didnt want   that you didnt apply for its yours   is that right   yeah     huh   of course they could always stick something in the credit bureau   thats right thats right they could they can make your life miserable if they want to   sure yeah i had a i had a tough battle with Exxon several years ago   is that right   uh and i i tore up their card and sent it to them and now ive got another one           we dont have too many Exxon stations out this way   oh really what do you got out there   uh weve got lots of Mobil   Mobils yeah   Mobils are big and we have a few Exxon weve got some other ones like Citgo   yeah   yeah is a is a one   yeah well i dont think i dont think weve got a Citgo here in Raleigh no matter of fact i know we dont   yeah got some Shell stations   um   a few Texaco stations   we have several convenience stores that sell Citgo gas but theyre not Citgo stations i guess   uhhuh right   the biggies around here are Exxon Texaco and um well gosh thats about it BP i guess   and theres another local one i cant i cant remember what theres some few Sinclair stations   gosh i havent seen a Sinclair station in years   yeah the few theyre the green dinosaurs are   yeah   their their   gosh there used to when i was a when i was a kid there was a Sinclair station about three blocks away thats where i used to go to pump up my tires and get my flats fixed and all of that   logo   yeah theres not that many down here that you know once once in a while youll see one   yeah   i guess theyre still in business   just barely i guess   yeah yeah   well just   you ever you ever gotten in trouble with your credit card where they theyve charged charged you for something you didnt didnt   no uh i ive nope ive never had that   didnt purchase   i i did have a problem with American Express one time about ten years ago when i first got started in a business um   yeah i have uhhuh   they got my name of course   umhum   and i said yeah this will be handy because i can use this for all my business expenses so i used it went on a went on a trip and used it got the bill and paid it about three weeks later i get this nasty letter from them saying you havent paid youre overdue pay it   right   so i ignored it assuming that the things had crossed in the mail about two weeks after that i get a phone call   right from someone saying   say you are really overdue you need to pay this thing and i said what are you talking about ive already paid you and by that time the bank statement had come in and i had the canceled check   uhhuh uhhuh   so they said okay well take care of it two weeks later i get another nasty letter threatening legal action         so i sent them a letter with a copy of the canceled check and their card cut up into about a hundred pieces i said here is your card here is the copy of my canceled check never send me anything else and never heard from them   uhhuh somebody blew it   but i just yeah i just you know i aint got time to mess mess around with them   right   too many people want my money out there i dont have to pay somebody to take it   right do you have the Discover card   no i dont i i kept wanting i kept thinking about getting it but i just dont use the things enough to justify getting it   either either do i they they i dont know i dont know how anybody can fall into this you get cash back and buy into that because   umhum   all theyre giving you back is a little bit of the interest you paid in   thats right thats thats right youre paying youre paying a higher interest rate so they can rebate you two percent of it   yeah their interest right their interest rates twenty two percent   umhum   higher than any other ones and then they said that well give you back some of your money   hum thats right yeah right and in the meantime for that entire year theyve got the use of that money   uh like right   uh yeah its   it its a ripoff   oh it is i theres so   but a lot of people think its wonderful i guess said theyre theyre doing well everything ive read theyve been getting a more market share i guess theyre theyre advertising and promotions and   well uh Americas Americans are suckers   yeah i guess so   yeah   i dont know   they dont know how to sit there and look at the interest rate and say well this one is only sixteen percent and this ones twenty two hum   yeah umhum yeah i have a on my credit cards i have a grace period if i pay it off within when the bill comes i i dont have to owe any interest   yeah i yeah right thats   and uh   ive only got ive only got two uh two cards now ive got a Bank of Scotland Visa and a Citibank MasterCard   right umhum   and and thats it i mean i i dont need anything else now   umhum yeah once in a while uh my i have an American Express they have this  a buyer protection thing   umhum   where you they extend the warranty   yeah   so uh they both can be nice around Christmas time and stuff if youre going to buy a TV or uh or uh  electronic   yeah yeah something something like that   then   my roommate really believes in American Express hes got the green card or the gold card and the the Optima card and   and everything huh   he just he just thinks theyre terrific   uhhuh   and i sit there and say yeah look what you pay for that every year   he pays for that yeah a couple hundred bucks probably for that like high end card   yeah gosh   well if you have the money i guess   yeah yeah im im thinking myself   get what you pay for huh   really yeah you know hes hes impressed because they send you this nice statement every i guess its every year they itemize all your purchases and they break it down in little categories for you and all that uh yeah its a nice report but is it worth you know is it worth sixty bucks a year   for that little   for that report   right     dont be crazy   yeah   uh when i was over in England i picked i picked up that uh Bank of Scotland Visa card and i i dont know hardly i dont ever use it except when i want to play the currency market um thats thats when it becomes handy because if i know that you know if the if the uh if the pound is high i can buy more dollar things   umhum   for what im getting and then if if i think the rates going to drop then i pay them back in less dollars   right    right right   and it its worked out most of the times im im usually pretty good on calling the the currency market   uhhuh yeah a lot of people do that for a living i guess   yeah   trade trade money   yeah i i did it when i lived over there i did it quite often   uhhuh   um and i really i really had a racket going because uh my paycheck was being uh electronically deposited here in the states and the bank that i banked with i could write them a check on an American bank and they would give me instant credit for it so   uhhuh   and and i and over and over the course of a year i i figured out how long it took them to clear that check and the and the shortest period of time was eight days so generally about eight days before payday depending on what the currency markets were doing i would go up and start buying id id start cashing in my checks for pounds   hum right   and then by the time   the other check went through   it the it the rate was either down or up depending on what i was doing and it it was great i mean i i could   made a little extra money there huh   yeah and i mean one day you know i might be able to get
