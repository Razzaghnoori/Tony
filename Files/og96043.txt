 Office of the General Counsel B 274403 September 26 1996 The Honorable Alfonse D Amato Chairman The Honorable Paul S Sarbanes Ranking Minority Member Committee on Banking Housing and Urban Affairs United States Senate The Honorable Thomas J Bliley Jr Chairman The Honorable John D Dingell Ranking Minority Member Committee on Commerce House of Representatives Subject Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 11AC1 4 Limit Order Display Rule and Amendments to Rule 11 AC1 1 Quote Rule Pursuant to section 801 a 2 A of title 5 United States Code this is our report on Rule 11AC1 4 Limit Order Display Rule and Amendments to Rule 11 AC1 1 Quote Rule RIN 3235 AG66 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission We received the rule and amendments on September 9 1996 They were published in the Federal Register on September 12 1996 61 Fed Reg 48290 The Commission adopted the Limit Order Display Rule and amended the Quote Rule pursuant to its authority under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 15 U S C 78a 78ll The Limit Order Display Rule requires the public display of customer limit orders priced better than an exchange specialist s or market maker s quote The rule also requires that specialists and market makers add limit orders priced at their quote to the size associated with their quote when that quote represents the best marketwide price The rule will set standard display requirements for limit orders in all GAO OGC 96 43 markets The rule represents a major change for the handling of limit orders in the Nasdaq market where such orders have never been displayed The Commission believes that the new rule will benefit investors because the publication of trading interest at prices that improve specialists and market makers quotes presents investors with improved execution opportunities and improved access to best prices when they buy or sell securities The Commission also adopted amendments to its Quote Rule to ensure that all investors are fully informed of the best price at which specialists or market makers are willing to trade a security Currently specialists and market makers may privately display a better price than their public quotations through certain private trading systems in which priced orders are invisible and inaccessible to investors at large The amendment to the rule benefits investors by bringing into public view the better prices in these systems and by allowing all investors to trade at these prices In addition the rule was amended to require that substantial market makers for any security listed on an exchange publish their quotations for that security According to the Commission this benefits investors by enhancing the public availability of prices for all listed securities some of which were not published before Enclosed is our assessment of the Commission s compliance with the procedural steps required by sections 801 a 1 B i through iv of title 5 with respect to the rule and amendments Our review indicates that the Commission complied with the applicable requirements If you have any questions about this report please contact Kathleen E Wannisky Associate General Counsel for Operations

1 B i iv OF RULE 11AC1 4 LIMIT ORDER DISPLAY RULE AND AMENDMENTS TO RULE 11 AC1 1 QUOTE RULE RIN 3235 AG66 ISSUED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION i Cost benefit analysis The Securities and Exchange Commission stated in its report to us that it was not required to prepare and did not prepare a cost benefit analysis of the rule and rule amendments Instead pursuant to section 23 a 2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 15 U S C 78w a 2 the Commission is directed to consider the impact that the rule may have on competition The Commission stated that the competition analysis which it prepared provides information very similar to that provided by a cost benefit analysis The Commission concluded that the rule and rule amendments will not impose any unnecessary or inappropriate burdens on competition ii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 U S C 603 605 607 and 609 Section 603 Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis In its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 60 Fed Reg 52792 October 10 1995 the Commission included a summary of its Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis In accordance with sections 603 b 1 and 2 the Commission describes the reasons for the proposed agency actions and its objectives and legal basis With regard to sections 603 b iii and iv the Commission states that it uses certain Commissionadopted definitions of small entities for purposes of its analysis and concludes that it is unable to quantify reasonably the impact that the proposed rule and amendments would have on small dealers and brokers The summary of the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis does not address any other relevant federal rules that duplicate overlap or conflict with this rule and amendments as provided for by section 603 b 5 Finally the Commission rejected the alternative of exempting small entities from the proposed rules and amendments GAO OGC 96 43 Section 604 Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The Commission published a summary of its Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in the Federal Register on September 12 1996 61 Fed Reg 48325 and provided us with a copy of the full text of the analysis Pursuant to section 604a 1 the Commission provides a statement of the need for and objectives of the rule and the rule amendments In accordance with section 604a 2 it provides a summary of the significant issues raised in the comments submitted in response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis and its reaction to those comments It specifically addresses concerns raised suggesting 1 that the Commission should better quantify the effects of the proposals on the market especially the anti competitive effects and 2 that the Commission s estimates under the Paperwork Reduction Act 44 U S C 3501 3520 were too low The Commission discusses how it amended the proposals in response to these comments The Commission discusses the two possible groups of small entities that would be subject to this rulemaking and concludes that as many as 100 broker dealers and as many as 960 Nasdaq Small Cap issuers could be affected by this rulemaking The Commission describes the projected compliance requirements of the rules and describes the steps taken to minimize the economic impact on small entities including consideration of several significant alternatives to both the Quote Rule and the Display Rule The Commission states that it believes that the rule and amendments as adopted impose a smaller burden upon small brokers and dealers than any of the alternatives The Commission provides generally descriptive statements of the effects of the rules as suggested in section 607 of the Act The Commission has informed the GAO that to encourage small entities to participate in the rulemaking process as called for by section 609 it distributed a plain English version of the proposing release it posted the proposals under the Items of Interest to Small Businesses section of its Internet Web site it met with groups that represent small businesses such as the security Traders Association and the New York Specialists Association and its senior officials gave speeches describing the proposals and encouraging comments iii Agency actions relevant to sections 202 205 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 2 U S C 1532 1535 The Commission states in its report to us that the Unfunded Mandates
