 Report Farm workers plagued by pesticides Legal aid group alleges laws violated Coleman Cornelius The farm workers said they knew they had breathed poison moments after a crop duster buzzed nearby spraying a field of sweet corn with pesticides to kill mites and worms Most of the 20 migrant farm workers in an adjacent lettuce field in Olathe said they felt sick immediately They gasped for breath had pounding headaches irritated eyes and swollen numb tongues Some vomited as a cloud of white chemicals settled on fields around them The farm workers in the western Colorado community said they left the lettuce field when sprayed but a foreman ordered them to continue working saying the crop duster had released a harmless solution of soap and water A new study by Colorado Legal Services the first of its kind in the Rocky Mountain region says such migrant workers at farms statewide are regularly exposed to hazardous pesticides in violation of federal laws The company that hired the workers for the Olathe farm and the farmer whose land they were working have denied any role in making the workers sick The lettuce workers talking about their incident last week said their experience illustrates the problems We were cutting lettuce and we saw the plane coming It was spraying and the wind was blowing so it blew toward us said Blanca Chavez 44 who sought shelter in a portable toilet We ingested it It was like a fog Another farm worker 22 year old Marcelina Lopez was five months pregnant during the reported Olathe spraying incident on June 29 She developed stomach cramps and a rash on her belly and arms Lopez said as she and six others on the lettuce crew discussed the incident last week Lopez saw a doctor three days after the spraying but that heightened her concern The doctor couldn t tell if the baby was affected her husband said in Spanish We worry a lot because we don t know if the baby will be affected Jim Dorsey an officer of Cactus Produce the Scottsdale Ariz farm labor contractor that employs the crew said company policy requires that incidents of pesticide exposure be reported immediately He said crew supervisors did not report what workers described Lacking field or physician reports he questioned whether the incident occurred Grower Tom Humphrey also was skeptical I think this is a crock said Humphrey a vegetable farmer for 30 years You re listening to somebody who wants money for nothing Nevertheless Chavez took her case to Colorado Legal Services a nonprofit law firm that represents low income clients in civil cases around the state She and the other farm workers said they agreed to publicly discuss the Olathe incident to illustrate the hazards laborers face in the fields and to push growers to abide by pesticide safety laws Chavez s case mirrors the findings of the survey by Colorado Legal Services which reports that migrant workers at farms statewide are regularly exposed to hazardous pesticides in violation of federal laws The exposure comes from chemical residue on plants in farm fields and from pesticide drift such as the incidents lettuce workers described according to the survey Legal Services conducted interviews with 88 farm workers in some of Colorado s most abundant agricultural regions last year and found that half of those surveyed had experienced symptoms of pesticide exposure The symptoms included skin rash inflamed eyes headaches and irritation of the nose and throat Those surveyed worked in Weld County the Arkansas Valley the San Luis Valley and the Western Slope and took part in 30 minute interviews at farm labor housing in those regions Kimi Jackson author of the Colorado Legal Services study said the surveys were detailed and the responses consistent across the state It s striking that so many farm workers report experiencing symptoms of pesticide exposure said Jackson director of the agency s pesticide project Imagine in your own office if half the workers had experienced symptoms like that That s very high Ray Christensen executive vice president of the Colorado Farm Bureau said growers on the state s 20 000 farms consider pesticide safety important for themselves and their employees in part because they want to maintain a productive workforce and avoid liability Pesticides can be very injurious if they are not handled properly I think farmers across the United States realize that Christensen said Yet the Legal Services report faults growers farm labor contractors and crop dusters for routinely failing to abide by federal regulations meant to protect worker health The study also demands that the U S Environmental Protection Agency and Colorado Department of Agriculture better enforce the 10 year old laws collectively called the Worker Protection Standard The laws require that farm workers be prevented from entering fields treated with pesticides until recommended times have elapsed The laws also mandate that workers be trained in pesticide safety are notified of fields that have been sprayed have fresh water to wash chemicals from their skin and receive emergency medical help in cases of pesticide exposure or illness EPA records show employers regularly fail to follow the rules Last year the agency s regional office inspected 23 Colorado farms and 20 failed to fully comply with federal laws meant to protect farm workers from pesticides said Tim Osag an enforcement coordinator Those farms got warning letters and will be inspected again he said Workers were not being trained There was no central location where the required information was being posted and several of them did not have decontamination supplies said Britta Campbell an EPA enforcement officer who conducted most of the farm inspections Obviously we have a regulation which is not being followed Osag said There is a potential that we re exposing workers to increased health risks Migrant farm workers 16 000 to 40 000 in Colorado according to the U S Department of Labor are critical to the state s 1 23 billion agriculture industry They travel from farm to farm tending and harvesting fruits and vegetables Farm workers earn an average of 5 15 an hour for jobs that often require fieldwork from sunup to sundown during the growing season Jackson said Many migrant farm workers are reluctant to report pesticide problems because they fear they will lose their jobs laborers said We do the work in the fields because we don t have a lot of education and in this country you need to have an education to have a good job We don t feel like we have any options said Maria Figeroa 54 a member of the lettuce crew reportedly overcome by pesticide drift in Olathe She and other crew members spoke in Spanish through an interpreter Pesticides widely used to increase crop yields have become a leading health concern among migrant farm workers Coloring books distributed to the children of farm workers in Weld County warn youngsters to run when they see crop dusters spraying pesticidas In 1998 Cesar Chavez fasted for 36 days in California to underscore the dangers of pesticides to farm workers and their children It was the last and longest fast for the 61 year old civil rights activist The following year Chavez s organization United Farm Workers released a seminal study addressing the health effects of pesticides on farmworkers The report Fields of Poison found that California farmworkers face greater risk of pesticide poisoning than any other segment of the population and are not adequately protected Like the Colorado report it called for stronger enforcement of existing laws Little research has been conducted on the long term health effects of pesticides on farm workers But some research points to danger A study published earlier this year in the American Journal of Industrial Medicine found that migrant farm workers in California most of them Hispanic have a 59 percent higher risk of developing leukemia than other Hispanics in the state Field laborers have a 69 percent higher risk for stomach cancer Male workers also have a higher chance of developing brain cancer while female workers have a higher risk for uterine cancer according to the study which linked the risks to pesticide exposure Researchers compared farm worker data from United Farm Workers with that from the California Cancer Registry It is hard to prove that worker illness is a result of pesticide exposure in the field because other things both on and off the job can trigger physical symptoms said Dr Suzanne Wuerthele an EPA toxicologist in Denver Yet dozens of chemicals commonly used to kill weeds fungus and insects on agricultural crops can cause immediate sickness in people who inhale swallow or absorb them through skin contact Wuerthele said Recent research raises questions about the connection between pesticide exposure and long term health problems such as chronic headaches sleep disorders vision problems nerve damage cancer and birth defects Wuerthele said These chemicals are always dangerous to humans That s why they have to be used correctly she said They are designed to kill things and they can be toxic to humans Chavez said she called Colorado Legal Services because she felt sick and did not know where to turn They re not worms said Guierrmo Othon Chavez s husband who is also a lettuce worker These are human lives
