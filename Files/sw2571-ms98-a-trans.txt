          all right   um there was a crime here in McKinney uh a rather heinous murder there was no um remorse shown by uh   uhhuh   at least one of the perpetrators and yet for whatever reason um his crime was not considered a capital crime   uhhuh uhhuh   an and quite honestly i i feel very strongly that the man has the has no redeeming social values and if if and when he comes gets free again he will have no compunction but to complete that that same kind of lifestyle i mean continue that same kind of lifestyle and perhaps do the same thing again so it really bothers me that theres not a way of getting him out of the way forever   really i think that i dont know i dont i dont think our prison system isnt set up where we um       rehabilitate or you know restore anybody i think itll only make them worse but i i believe that God can come in and change a persons heart and genuinely change it but that doesnt negate that you do reap what you sow and if you do kill a person and it is you know youre found to be guilty i believe God establishes the authority of our court system and i believe that you know that i do believe that capital punishment is uh alternative even you know God can still change your heart but that doesnt mean like the alcoholic that charges up all the bills on the credit card or the shopaholic you know you get your life right with God but you still have to pay your Visa bill you still have to   thats thats right   you know so but God sent us his grace and they give pardons but i believe if its a genuine conversion theres a genuine and those prison people know they know a genuine turnaround in a persons character they see that and i i worked in a prison in Fort Worth   but yeah did you   yeah i have a degree in social work you see it you know the ones that have a genuine character change it is obvious and they know that theyre theyre not going to pardon someone from the governor   uhhuh   you know what im saying theyre not going to go without going through every channel of authority in the prison so i feel like you know thats is there is occasions where there are they do spare lives and you know i leave that with the governor who of course is going to go through every authority because they want to be be reelected so   yes but my concern is first of all that not all all persons who i think should be receiving capital         uh whatever capital uh that uh that   uhhuh   hum punishment thank you im sorry i just got home from work and im just kind of spaced out a little bit uh that not all of them are being um   punishment uhhuh no thats okay   convicted of it that that the the theyre not even being charged with that appropriate i agree with you that that a persons heart can be changed   uhhuh   but the same God that can work that miracle also established the laws that said um for certain kinds of sin certain kinds of sins certain kinds of of uh breaking of the law there would be a capital punishment right then it was it was uh almost immediate as soon as as the trial was over then it was stoning we dont have a speedy trial we dont have speedy um punishment and so it kind of loses its meaning if you sit on death row for months and years   uhhuh right but in in the Old Testament yeah   and so forth   right we dont well yeah we definitely have lost the JudeoChristian ethic of the judicial system for sure but the base the base is still there the foundation is still there though but of the system but i know what youre saying uh but also theyre under a law because we havent been removed from the law weve just been taken out from under under a law because under the law if your child mocked back talked you he would be stoned   thats correct   yeah under the law he would be stoned so weve been removed from the law of under from being under the law but were still you know were still accountable to it we dont need to back talk but you know its like God changes your heart to not do that he changes your heart not to look upon a woman in lust because in the Old Testament they could look all they wanted just couldnt do it but in the new hes looking at your heart and so i guess thats what what i mean by their character changes and you know what i mean its like looking beyond what theyre doing and looking at a heart and seeing what is the heart whats the character showing me here and those and then any of if i dont think see if i dont believe that theres not a character change and the authorities agree that this person needs to be excused i believe for murder uh rape i even believe incest things   uhhuh   that will permanently damage uh the character of the child i believe crimes against children should be punished but by by death i believe   i tend to agree on that very strongly   sexual crimes unless theres a true change of character and thats where we just have to to trust the authorities and theyre not going to excuse people if it was was run like that i dont there would probably be very few exceptions to that and if it was done quickly and done swiftly and but its not because the judicial system has rejected theyve rejected the answer to all these problems they have pretty much   plus the all the judicial system is overloaded with all kinds of um problems and crimes and so forth and then all of the um civil things that clog the courts   right uhhuh   and having sat on both uh uh criminal and a civil uh jury  some of what goes through our courts is a total waste of time   uhhuh yeah   because were suit happy but but back to the to the capital situation sounds like you and i have a lot of of of uh common ground at least as as far as as   yeah yeah   capital punishment is concerned i would like to see some some kind of reform or some kind of streamlining so that if a person is um convicted   uhhuh   and sentenced to to death that that automatic appeal which goes in could be more quickly dealt with   uhhum yeah   and and go ahead and get the punishment phase out of the way because it doesnt do the criminal or the victims family or or any of us the taxpayer any good to have him sitting around for months and years   yeah anybody yeah yeah   an an but him could be a her   right   but you see   i know in Jamaica uh it think its Jamaica i think its Jamaica i know that they have you know crimes punishable by death and im sure they hit a few every now and then and i wouldnt want to be one of them that are not guilty but i know that they have like uh their crime rate its not Jamaica i dont think i cant remember which its uh one of the Caribbean Islands and and they Singapore is it like that my husbands going Singapore and they dont have a lot of the crime because there is a law and the law is enforced and thats what what when you have lawlessness i mean the laws not being enforced and all that does is lawlessness we were we went on a mission trip to Manhattan and to the Bronx and stuff two years ago and all these kids were up on there getting arrested for crack and everyone was out uh we were across from that big bus station i forget what you call it but anyway and everyone they had like fifteen people lined up on the fence and within two hours there were fifteen boys sitting there doing the same thing   um   and youd see the same kid who were back out there in two days   thats sad   because theres no the answer is not being given to them in the court system and i think initially when our country was set up it was set up with God and it was really an integral part and no you cant you cant force people but i think people are hurting and theyre out doing crack sitting on the street they were the kind of people that i think mostly we would want to receive it if it was presented to see i dont know i guess im kind of frustrated that you know weve gotten away from the Christian basis that our court system was founded upon i mean it reeks of the Bible just the whole thing the whole system and so i feel like if that was presented more openly and not just relying upon and para church ministr y to come in and do it but that the system itself you know you know what i mean   yeah   i feel like that might be better if it was run on a more scriptural basis which would include you know you know and expediting the penalties and just getting it over with   however certain uh very liberal minded groups who do not um subscribe to the same ethical system that you and i do such as the uh civil liberties unions and so forth   right   will lobby against that and hold that out as long as they have breath which is most unfortunate because we all lose out when people go so far out to the extreme on either side   right yeah yeah   because too too often theyre can be extremism that that hurts from from any direction regardless of whatever whatever youre arguing or concerned about and   right right   we all lose out   yeah i know youre right they would lobby that and and i see that and thats why you know im like okay whats my role in this thing  you know whats my part because i dont think the system is going to get fixed i think its crippled   yeah
