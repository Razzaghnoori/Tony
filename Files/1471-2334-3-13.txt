 Background Testing the hypothesis We can test this hypothesis by 1 Identifying genes likely to have been transferred directly or indirectly to E coli O157 H7 from archaea 2 Investigating the distribution of similar genes in pathogens and non pathogens and performing rigorous phylogenetic analyses on putative transfers Have any transfers been described between archaea and E coliO157 I have demonstrated that a gene coding for a bifunctional catalase peroxidase is likely a transfer from archaea to a variety of pathogenic bacteria including E coli O157 H7 9 Although not yet directly implicated in O157 H7 as a virulence factor this enzyme has been implicated as a virulence factor in Mycobacterium tuberculosis 24 26 and in Legionella pneumophila 25 Furthermore this E coli O157 H7 catalase peroxidase has been associated with enterohaemorrhagic hemolysin in a variety of shiga like toxin producing verotoxin producing E coli 30 31 This correlation of the presence of the catalase peroxidase in many virulent but not in avirulent strains suggests a direct role in the virulence of enterohemorrhagic E coli How can we identify other genes likely to have been transferred directly or indirectly to E coliO157 H7 from archaea We can use the three complete E coli genomes available 8 20 21 to identify a subset of genes present in one or both of the O157 strains but not in K 12 This subset of genes although most have not been directly identified as virulence genes are more likely to be virulence associated This subset will be the focus of our search for genes likely to have laterally transferred from archaea Perna et al 8 identified 1 387 genes in the EDL933 O157 strain they sequenced that are O157 specific This number does not include the O157 specific plasmids that were previously sequenced 32 from which some of the preliminary work 9 described below was derived As a preliminary step to testing this hypothesis I have searched the E coli O157 H7 strain EDL933 8 genome for open reading frames ORFs meeting the following criteria 1 present in O157 strain EDL933 but not in E coli K 12 2 highly similar having a BLASTP similarity bit score 95 to ORFs found in at least two archaeal genomes 3 having few or no highly similar proteins BLASTP score 85 in other bacterial genomes This search was facilitated by the Clusters of Orthologous Groups COG database at NCBI 33 34 This preliminary non systematic search produced 6 ORFS worth considering as LGTs from archaea to pathogenic bacteria Table 1shows these ORFs with their location and if any information was available a possible function Although the putative functions in Table 1are not generally associated with virulence many genes under the right circumstances can facilitate infection or contribute to pathogenicity There are examples in the literature where both ABC transporters in Streptococcus gordonii 35 and helicase genes in Legionella pneumophila 36 have been directly implicated in virulence Further testing of this hypothesis will require rigorous phylogenetic analyses of each suspected transfer The procedure of comparing similarity scores to identify potential lateral transfers used above although commonly employed 6 7 37 it is fraught with potential errors 15 38 39 40 41 42 34 35 and must serve only as an initial screen Ragan 15 recently wrote This study demonstrates the need for a systematic comprehensive approach to the study of LGT based on first principles i e rigorous inference and statistically based comparison of molecular phylogenetic trees As more genomic sequences appear a tree based approach will become both more challenging and more rewarding Implications of the hypothesis Although this hypothesis focuses on archaea and E coli the model of distant gene transfer as a major contributor of new virulence genes to pathogens or potential pathogens has broad applicability to a large number of pathogenic systems Archaea represent both the most distant source and in many ways the most unlikely source for virulence genes If E coli can acquire virulence genes from archaea then potentially any organism is a reservoir of virulence genes for pathogens 43 The implications should this hypothesis be proven are myriad Our understanding of potential sources of virulence genes will be expanded to include virtually all life on earth at first glance a frightening prospect At the same time however it would allow us to move from a descriptive reactionary view of infectious disease towards a predictive science of infectious disease It would be dramatic evidence of what some microbiologists suspect that lateral gene transfer is the predominant engine of variation in prokaryotes and the catalyst for the emergence of new bacterial pathogens Competing interests None declared
