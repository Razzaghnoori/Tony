 Republican Shakeout This weekend s straw poll in Ames Iowa kicked off the 2000 presidential race and sorted out the Republican field Everyone agrees that George W Bush is the front runner that Steve Forbes is in second place and that Dan Quayle who finished back in the pack with Lamar Alexander will soon join Alexander on the sidelines But Ames failed to resolve the fate of the candidates who came in third and fourth Elizabeth Dole and Gary Bauer and the one who skipped Ames John McCain For these three the post game spin contest is crucial Here s a playback of their takes on the straw poll results and a look ahead at their playbook of messages for the remainder of the race Elizabeth Dole Playback 1 Top three Dole needed to get within striking distance of Bush and to seal off the rest of the pack behind her On Meet the Press Face the Nation and Late Edition she boasted that she had cracked the top three Pundits bought the three winners line treating Ames as a horse race win place and show and noting that no one s ever won the Republican nomination without finishing in the top three at Ames Newspapers cramped for space confined their headlines to Bush Forbes and Dole Though Dole s 14 percent was closer to Bauer s 9 than to Forbes 21 she earned a solid third and a place among the leaders by crossing the double digit threshold As Fox News Carl Cameron put it The other seven candidates could not crack double digits 2 Race for third Since Bush and Forbes were expected to finish first and second many pundits concluded as Lisa Myers put it on Meet the Press that the real race here was for third Elizabeth Dole won that The Boston Globe called Dole the winner of this contest within the contest Dole touted her victory on every talk show and cited the Myers and Globe quotes in a press release At a news conference an aide introduced Dole as the straw poll s real winner 3 Underdog In every TV interview Dole claimed to have been outspent by millions of dollars Her spokesman told reporters that on a dollar per vote basis Elizabeth Dole trounced George Bush and Steve Forbes Reporters love an underdog From a strict cost benefit standpoint the big winner may be Elizabeth Dole concluded Time 4 Comeback kid Dismissive coverage of Dole before the straw poll played to her advantage as everyone marveled at her surprisingly strong third Dole Revived the Washington Post s front page proclaimed On This Week George Will conceded There had been a lot of very skeptical stories about whether her people would show up She therefore I think is the biggest winner Playbook 1 Race for second Forbes wants to fast forward the GOP tournament to a finals bracket Bush vs Forbes To prevent this Dole needs to create a semifinal playoff Forbes vs Dole to determine who gets to play Bush Despite Forbes huge financial advantage we finished close to second Dole told reporters Saturday night This is going to become a two person race The press agreed Forbes had growing hopes that he might upset Bush or finish a close second recalled the Post Instead he finished closer to Dole than to Bush 2 Experience Having narrowed the field to three Dole needs to focus the contest on criteria that favor her The first of these is political experience of which Bush has little and Forbes has almost none On every talk show Dole vowed to demonstrate that the candidate with the most experience is more qualified than the candidates with the most money We re talking about president of the United States 3 Gender This is the more obvious criterion that distinguishes Dole She hardly needs to mention it the media bring it up anyway but she invokes it subtly alluding as she did on two Sunday talk shows to women who drive their daughters halfway across the state to shake my hand a woman they dare to believe in Newspapers hail Dole s female followers as evidence that she can attract new voters to the GOP Gary Bauer Playback 1 Top four Like Dole Bauer needed to crack the top tier and seal off the pack Since sports analogies tend to cut off the top tier at three rather than four e g bronze medal win place and show Bauer changed metaphors telling reporters that he had reached the first rung of candidates and that lower finishers might soon perish On Meet the Press he called himself the breakout candidate While some pundits lumped Bauer with the winners others offered him the next best position leading the rest of the pack or at least distinguished him from the losers 2 Social conservative quarterfinal This was Bauer s big spin win Like Dole he won a crucial contest within the contest His scant margin over Pat Buchanan 8 9 percent to 7 3 percent became a huge factor in the post poll analysis Pundits concluded that Bauer did what he had to do beat Pat Buchanan and therefore can legitimately say he is the candidate of the Christian right establishing himself as one of the winners the three or four candidates who got their tickets punched to stay in the race Talk show hosts reminded Buchanan that he had lost to Bauer and asked whether Buchanan was finished 3 Conservative semifinal Having scored well ahead of Bauer and Buchanan Forbes anointed himself the conservative in a two man race against Bush Bauer disagreed and the media took his side Forbes Bauer Battle for Right the Post proclaimed concluding that because Forbes failed to break away he and Bauer are likely to continue a long and tough fight for the leadership of the conservative wing 4 Underdog Bauer couldn t claim to be more strapped than Dole so he claimed underdog status on the basis of low name recognition inexperience and working class heritage I am running against some big bios the son of a former president the son of a tycoon and the wife of a senator Bauer argued on Late Edition I have never run for president or office before And yet here we come in fourth place Newsweek s David Brooks wrote that Bauer overcame his own financial disadvantages and joined Dole as the two surviving Have Not candidates Playbook 1 Buchanan will defect Since Buchanan s combativeness and loyal base make him hard to write off as a candidate his rivals have persuaded the media at least to write him off as a Republican by inferring that his low score at Ames will prompt him to transfer to the Reform Party The more Buchanan fends off comparisons to Bauer by emphasizing his protectionism the more he plays into this scenario 2 Populism With Buchanan out of the way Bauer will go after Forbes When asked on television about Forbes claim to represent the right Bauer cited Forbes wealth and called himself the son of a maintenance man On This Week George Stephanopoulos agreed that Bauer is becoming the populist in the race noting that Bauer s supporters love the fact that he was the son of a janitor 3 Conservatism If Bauer wins the social conservative quarterfinal and the conservative semifinal he gets to run as the Reagan candidate against Bush Gore moderation on abortion Hollywood China and other hot button issues This bracket by bracket tournament strategy reduces Bauer s obstacles from three candidates to two He can target Forbes knowing that if he prevails either Bush or Dole will have vanquished the other in the moderate semifinal Indeed Dole s success at Ames arguably helps Bauer by giving Bush a semifinal contest John McCain Playback 1 Ames meant nothing to him Despite having skipped the straw poll McCain was invited onto Face the Nation and Fox News Sunday to discuss it If you re going to be taken seriously Brit Hume asked him don t you have to face up to the fact when all the other candidates decide that an event is worth attending that maybe you ve got to play too In reply McCain repeatedly called Ames meaningless His chutzpah bowled over the pundits Stephanopoulos called McCain s no show a pretty smart move and portrayed the 83 votes he won in the straw poll putting him in last place among active Republican candidates as evidence of his strength 2 Ames meant death for others Noting that McCain had bypassed the event Quayle explained on Face the Nation that he too almost took a pass on this It wasn t until George Bush said he was going to participate that then I said OK we ve got to do it out of respect to the Iowa Republican Party The result Quayle pleaded was that he lost to candidates who had been in Iowa years and months McCain explaining his decision to stay out espoused a less sentimental philosophy You always want to fight on ground that is most favorable to you For this the media executed Quayle and spared McCain Quayle and Lamar Alexander might be gone but I think McCain is still in concluded NPR s Mara Liasson Ames was Vietnam in reverse McCain ducked the fight and Quayle took the beating 3 Viability Once the dust has settled from the straw poll McCain regally announced I will review the new political landscape and begin engaging the other Republican candidates Why does McCain get a bye Because he has convinced the media that he has enough money and support in New Hampshire South Carolina and other states to skip Iowa and catch fire later Newsweek the New York Times the Los Angeles Times and several TV pundits agreed that McCain remains formidable wasn t hurt by Ames and may well end up as the principal alternative to Bush 4 Vote buying To undermine the straw poll s authority as an arbiter of his candidacy McCain called it a fund raiser a sham and a joke in which campaigns spent millions to buy votes My campaign theme is to try to reform the system that is now awash with money and the influence of special interests he argued on Fox News Sunday Brit Hume s retort that this whole process isn t quite pure enough for you played right into McCain s hands McCain doesn t need to persuade the media that his reasons for skipping Ames were morally sound He just needs to persuade them that his reasons were moral rather than political Playbook 1 Real votes The vote buying complaint only gets McCain a bye on the straw poll To get another bye on February s Iowa caucuses he ll rely on two other moral arguments First he ll claim that caucuses aren t real votes We ll have real votes in New Hampshire McCain argued on Fox News Sunday That s where real people are motivated to vote On Face the Nation he suggested that he would focus on the genuine balloting process which takes place in New Hampshire and then South Carolina 2 Ethanol Many pundits fancying themselves shrewd suggest that McCain s true reason for skipping Iowa is that he has taken a position on ethanol subsidies that s unpalatable to voters in Iowa On This Week Stephanopoulos suggested that McCain might have to do something dramatic such as make a stand and say We re not going to compete in Iowa We think these ethanol subsidies are an abomination This is McCain s greatest triumph He has conned the media into disbelieving his political calculations and accusing him instead of principle I ve taken a lot of unpopular positions he conceded on Fox News Sunday 3 Experience The longer McCain stays out of the race without damaging his credibility the more the field narrows to his advantage Alexander and Rep John Kasich R Ohio are already gone Quayle and Sen Orrin Hatch R Utah won t be far behind If the field dwindles to Bush Forbes and Bauer McCain can sell himself as the only experienced officeholder running against Bush But Dole s third place finish at Ames coupled with her victory in the post Ames spin contest complicates this plan So here s how the race shapes up Bauer will frame it as a populist showdown chiefly between himself and Forbes Forbes will frame it as a fight between the establishment led by Bush and conservatives led by himself Dole will exploit feminism as well as feminine stereotypes pitching herself as the candidate of change civility and moral renewal And McCain will fortify his war chest while his rivals battle and bleed Ames has organized the contestants Let the games begin
