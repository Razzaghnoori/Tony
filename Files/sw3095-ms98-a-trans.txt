          i guess we are just to discuss trials and and punishment if its to be given by the judge or not did you did you catch your explanation of that okay   yes i did its its uh the uh the uh maybe im a hard liner but i think that there should be some preset penalties in criminal cases rather than uh degrees of sentencing   you mean the crimes or the punishment should fit the crime   right right uh again having participated in jury duty myself i know  i know how such a diverse group of   okay yes i did also   people get together the different backgrounds different ideas that sometimes you can have one person or two that can hold up what i consider the proper sentencing of the person person   right could you hang on one minute Jim thank you   yes maam   i am so sorry to keep you on hold are you at work okay i am too   no problem yes yeah um i think what you have is the way the   um   the justice system works is they bend over backwards trying to protect the guilty so many things in their back pardon yes i know   oh its insane its insane   my wife participated in a jury trial several years back wherein the individual after it was over and they had came up with the maximum sentence   yes yes   in the jury form they found out that uh the gentleman involved had a long history of the same type offense which was theft of uh property   right uhhuh oh yes   and yet the district the attorney for the prosecution could not enter these uh the good mans background into it it was like this was a first time offender   yes   whereas uh i think thats those that should be in jail should be in jail   it seems huh thats correct and theres too much leniency theres too much uh um underhanded uh things going on that the public are not aware of   yeah   and it seems as though we are uh giving the criminal the benefit more than the victim the victim has been victimized twice not only by the perpetrator of the crime but also the courts that try to do the justice   well i think this is one of the reasons that also that attorneys have such a a unsavory reputation shall we say   i do not have any i dont have an ounce in my body of credibility toward the the judicial system in the United States   yeah well what you got is the situation wherein uh if you ever get in trouble you want to hire the smartest crookedest lawyer you can find   isnt that terrible   and uh thats not the idea its the idea is not to get the guy off of the crime that he committed but to punish him for the crime he committed   well to punish him for the crime but also to try and reeducate the mans thinking   yeah   to get him out of that uh uh criminal mind that he has and to direct him into a more productive life     yeah well we have uh a situation again that i am familiar with where uh the son of an acquaintance of mine was killed while trying to stop a robbery   um oh yes how sad   and the person that killed him was a young woman who had left the house with full intent to commit crimes carrying a gun in her purse   uhhuh   and anyway itd get to the she was sentenced to jail but then due to technicalities she was going to be out of jail within eighteen months after she was sentenced   oh   of course it took eighteen months for the thing the trial to happen so   right   then uh there was a letter writing campaign that went in  and the parole board received approximately a thousand letters protesting putting this person back on the street within eighteen months after killing someone and uh fortunately it worked they uh eliminated they corrected the technicality and the person now will have to serve three to four years of the seven or eight they were sentenced to   well if yes if enough of the public responded       to uh the direct the uh parties that are involved and if enough they will listen to the voice of the people i have found that out that if enough people respond and rise up against the injustices being done something is going to change   right   people have to be involved     this is it and most people dont take the time   yeah thats right   and again the only reason  i took the time is because i was personally acquainted with these people im just as guilty as the rest in that respect   thats right you were yes uh but and im not making an excuse but we our priorities are a bit backward   oh yes well they again the and im not knocking the civil rights program or anything like that but weve gone overboard to uh protect persons from being having their civil rights violated to the point where the person that is damaged is not protected its again the victim gets worse punishment then the person that commits the crimes   thats correct yeah yeah   yeah   okay  i think were both in agreement on this subject   well i am too i mean i i just cant i you know i served on a jury for a lady that was having a mental problem and we found her not guilty because the lady obviously was not in their right mind so if the person is not in the right mind i mean they had to uh put her away   yeah   but for her own safety and for because she didnt know what she was doing and we couldnt we just dismissed the case you know and and she was uh taken care of by the proper   yeah   facility   yeah well another side of the coin that with our justice system there are a lot of frivolous cases that go to court there are a lot of things that could be settled out of court   yes thats true   which uh or should never have gone to court and then the amazing thing of course is how uh some cases can come to trial in thirty days and others it takes eighteen months
