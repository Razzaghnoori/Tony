                     My earliest recollection is with my Aunt Mary         Um Mom and Dad were married on August the ninth  and that was my mamas birthday         Thats when my mom and dad were married and they both are from here         My dad was Earl Wilson Propst and he was born and raised uh downtown Concord         If you remember the sign it was down next to the Red Pig right on Corben Avenue                     Uhhuh                     They just tore that old building down where the house was         My mom uh grew up on in an area near Blackwelders Toyland         Do you remember that                     Uhhuh                     I dont know if you remember that or not                     Uhhuh                     But uh she grew up where the Eleven is now         Theres a real pretty old twostory clapboard house and thats where she grew up         Um but they were married in  and had uh my three brothers and I But uh and my dad died in  died January  of lung cancer         Uh died in Madison WI         The Mayo Clinic up there                     Uhhuh                     My mom never got over that um just really really close to him         And she just after all those many years she never got over it         Uh but she did an admirable job         I think so far         She is still living and uh somewhat healthy         She does have Alzheimers                     Uhhuh                     But other than that shes a lot of fun and has a wonderful personality but my dad and she both came from big families         My mom came from a family she had six brothers and sisters and she was a Calloway         Her mother my grandmother on my moms side was a Howell and that was Howell Baptist Church down towards Monroe on  down towards Monroe         So thats where they were from         Um and my dad came from a big family         He he had  brothers and sisters         And uh as I said he grew up in town but his parents my grandparents originally lived out on the eastern part of Cabarrus County which is uh they lived out Gold Hill Road and Irish Potato                     Uhhuh                     Uh probably sometime around the turn of the century just prior to the turn of the twentieth century they did move into town         and they built an old house and lived          excuse me where uh HeiligMeyers is         I think your church just did a thing with uh Concord                     Uhhuh                     But there was an old house there next to the Brown Livery Stable         Thats where my greatgrandfather William Propst and his wife my greatgrandmother Etta Caroline Etta Ritchie Propst lived         But as I said what Im getting to my Aunt Mary         My dad had a sister         had several sisters had three had four sisters but there was one her name was Mary Propst Mary Elizabeth Propst         She never married and lived to be she was born in  August tenth  August ninth rather         My mother was the tenth and she was the ninth         She lived to be about  years old never married was a schoolteacher I like to say all her life                     Uhhuh                     As most teachers are uh which is I guess the first thing that I learned to admire about her         And uh thats where my respect for all teachers comes from from her         She was also a principal         She was a schoolteacher and a principal at what was Clara Harris                     Uhhuh                     A school near town and um but                     Its hard to believe that somebody could be  both a teacher and a principal                              And she was          Theres a story         I guess probably some  to  years ago         We had one of many bond referendums school bond referendums that I was really working hard on         And Mary uh read in the paper one day about the bond referendums         It was   million dollars an incredible amount of money and she asked me to come down         She wanted to talk to me about this bond referendum         She wanted to know all about it         You know Why are we doing this         What do we need the money for         How is it going to be spent         She genuinely                     Uhhuh                     She was a voter         Although she was  or  at the time she was going to get in her car and go vote one way or the other         And so I would try to explain to her how it was very important with all the growth we were experiencing in Cabarrus County to keep the uh the number of kids in the classrooms to less than  if we could and we werent meeting that with the growth         So we needed to fix up some buildings and try to keep that         And she said I understand         I understand and I went on further to say you know just just I gave several reasons that she she agreed with         And I went a little bit too far I said uh And besides you know when kids get up to around  a classroom size of  these teachers could never do it without an assistant                  She said to me she says An assistant with          She says My when I was coming up you know well I I had  and  students and I didnt have an assistant and I was principal                  She didnt say it that way she didnt mean it that way         I said Yes maam                  But the kids didnt come prepared like they did then         They didnt come disciplined uh now as they did then         And um and I believe that         But but my Aunt Mary again she was a very instrumental part of my life         I love history and I love genealogy and it is because of her that I do         Um          her her grandfather pardon me yes my greatgrandfather was William Propst         I forgot now that when he was born probably uh probably sometime around             He served in the Civil War as a captain th Regiment out of Cabarrus County and he didnt die uh until the early s         Lived to be almost almost a hundred         And as I said Mary never married                     Uhhuh                     And she lived in the house there at Corben and and Church Street         Um and when my greatgrandmother died sometime in the early teens my greatgrandfather came back with to live with my grandparents and Mary         And she took care of this man         And to this day its its phenomenal its a fantastic story         My wife initially Annette really couldnt understand why I would get so excited about it         But here I am I knew and became very close to someone my Aunt Mary who in turn took care of my greatgrandfather and knew well was old enough to recollect you know his stories                     Right                     Not only of the Civil War but of his childhood                     Uhhuh                     And it is fascinating         Its fascinating some of which Ive got on tape         Um she would never allow me to video         But I got a good bit of that on tape and uh just interviews similar to this uh fascinating                     Uhhuh                     I recall her talking about how she cared for him once he did come back from the war and he had a smallpox scar that he always had problems with which I understand there was a lot of that         But especially through the war years he would write her and talk about you know his arm and she knew exactly what it was         But uh uh or or she didnt know at the time but later he he described that and she recalled taking care of it even even in the later years of his life         Just a lot of different stories         But she he had my greatgrandfather had written a lot of letters during the Civil War home to my greatgrandmother         And uh fortunately Mary kept them all those years and then when she passed away just a few years ago she left them to me         And so its amazing reading the history of those letters not just not just the history of the war but the letters what they talked about         They have a plantation probably five or  acres out at Irish Potato Road at the time and a lot of what the letters talked about to my greatgrandmother were ideas of what to do                     Uhhuh                     If you could imagine and and let me say this some of the letters that I have that I love the most that are dearest to me are some of the letters that that she wrote him         And he were he was able to get                     Uhhuh                     And to know that he kept them and then brought them home         So these are some of the dearest letters         And in reading her letters to him wherever he might be a lot of the letters come from obviously in and around Fredericksburg VA in           And uh she would ask What do we do now about the wheat         What do we do about the oats         What do we do about the cattle         What do we do about this         What about this timber                     Uhhuh                     You know You always talked about doing         So and so has called me         Do I trust this man         You know you think about it uh probably prior to the Civil War she she didnt have this information                     Uhhuh                     You know they probably she if you think about it she not that he kept anything from her its just that uh she probably took care of the house if you will                     Uhhuh                     And he in turn took care of the other affairs         And all of a sudden hes up and gone for four years for three and a half years         Similar situation happened with my parents uh just you know WWII         But uh then he would respond you know Well you can trust this man or you cant trust this person or I would suggest that you do this         But always to a t         He would always you could see the respect building in him for her         But you do what you think is right         Heres Im trying to answer some of your questions but and this is what I think maybe you might want to consider doing                     Uhhuh                     But you and I will support you         Here I am not knowing if Ill ever come home                     Right                     And so its just its just a wonderful history         So Mary established I guess what I was getting she established the love I have for family
