 My earliest recollection is with my Aunt Mary Um Mom and Dad were married on August the ninth 1937 and that was my mama s birthday That s when my mom and dad were married and they both are from here My dad was Earl Wilson Propst and he was born and raised uh downtown Concord If you remember the sign it was down next to the Red Pig right on Corben Avenue Uh huh They just tore that old building down where the house was My mom uh grew up on in an area near Blackwelder s Toyland Do you remember that Uh huh I don t know if you remember that or not Uh huh But uh she grew up where the 7 Eleven is now There s a real pretty old two story clapboard house and that s where she grew up Um but they were married in 1937 and had uh my three brothers and I But uh and my dad died in 1969 died January 1969 of lung cancer Uh died in Madison WI The Mayo Clinic up there Uh huh My mom never got over that um just really really close to him And she just after all those many years she never got over it Uh but she did an admirable job I think so far She is still living and uh somewhat healthy She does have Alzheimer s Uh huh But other than that she s a lot of fun and has a wonderful personality but my dad and she both came from big families My mom came from a family she had six brothers and sisters and she was a Calloway Her mother my grandmother on my mom s side was a Howell and that was Howell Baptist Church down towards Monroe on 601 down towards Monroe So that s where they were from Um and my dad came from a big family He he had 10 brothers and sisters And uh as I said he grew up in town but his parents my grandparents originally lived out on the eastern part of Cabarrus County which is uh they lived out Gold Hill Road and Irish Potato Uh huh Uh probably sometime around the turn of the century just prior to the turn of the twentieth century they did move into town and they built an old house and lived excuse me where uh Heilig Meyers is I think your church just did a thing with uh Concord Uh huh But there was an old house there next to the Brown Livery Stable That s where my great grandfather William Propst and his wife my great grandmother Etta Caroline Etta Ritchie Propst lived But as I said what I m getting to my Aunt Mary My dad had a sister had several sisters had three had four sisters but there was one her name was Mary Propst Mary Elizabeth Propst She never married and lived to be she was born in 1901 August tenth 1901 August ninth rather My mother was the tenth and she was the ninth She lived to be about 95 years old never married was a schoolteacher I like to say all her life Uh huh As most teachers are uh which is I guess the first thing that I learned to admire about her And uh that s where my respect for all teachers comes from from her She was also a principal She was a schoolteacher and a principal at what was Clara Harris Uh huh A school near town and um but It s hard to believe that somebody could be both a teacher and a principal And she was There s a story I guess probably some 10 to 12 years ago We had one of many bond referendums school bond referendums that I was really working hard on And Mary uh read in the paper one day about the bond referendums It was 22 23 million dollars an incredible amount of money and she asked me to come down She wanted to talk to me about this bond referendum She wanted to know all about it You know Why are we doing this What do we need the money for How is it going to be spent She genuinely Uh huh She was a voter Although she was 92 or 93 at the time she was going to get in her car and go vote one way or the other And so I would try to explain to her how it was very important with all the growth we were experiencing in Cabarrus County to keep the uh the number of kids in the classrooms to less than 30 if we could and we weren t meeting that with the growth So we needed to fix up some buildings and try to keep that And she said I understand I understand and I went on further to say you know just just I gave several reasons that she she agreed with And I went a little bit too far I said uh And besides you know when kids get up to around 30 a classroom size of 30 these teachers could never do it without an assistant She said to me she says An assistant with 30 She says My when I was coming up you know well I I had 40 and 50 students and I didn t have an assistant and I was principal She didn t say it that way she didn t mean it that way I said Yes ma am But the kids didn t come prepared like they did then They didn t come disciplined uh now as they did then And um and I believe that But but my Aunt Mary again she was a very instrumental part of my life I love history and I love genealogy and it is because of her that I do Um her her grandfather pardon me yes my great grandfather was William Propst I forgot now that when he was born probably uh probably sometime around 18 1828 1830 1831 He served in the Civil War as a captain 57th Regiment out of Cabarrus County and he didn t die uh until the early 20 s Lived to be almost almost a hundred And as I said Mary never married Uh huh And she lived in the house there at Corben and and Church Street Um and when my great grandmother died sometime in the early teens my great grandfather came back with to live with my grandparents and Mary And she took care of this man And to this day it s it s phenomenal it s a fantastic story My wife initially Annette really couldn t understand why I would get so excited about it But here I am I knew and became very close to someone my Aunt Mary who in turn took care of my great grandfather and knew well was old enough to recollect you know his stories Right Not only of the Civil War but of his childhood Uh huh And it is fascinating It s fascinating some of which I ve got on tape Um she would never allow me to video But I got a good bit of that on tape and uh just interviews similar to this uh fascinating Uh huh I recall her talking about how she cared for him once he did come back from the war and he had a smallpox scar that he always had problems with which I understand there was a lot of that But especially through the war years he would write her and talk about you know his arm and she knew exactly what it was But uh uh or or she didn t know at the time but later he he described that and she recalled taking care of it even even in the later years of his life Just a lot of different stories But she he had my great grandfather had written a lot of letters during the Civil War home to my great grandmother And uh fortunately Mary kept them all those years and then when she passed away just a few years ago she left them to me And so it s amazing reading the history of those letters not just not just the history of the war but the letters what they talked about They have a plantation probably five or 600 acres out at Irish Potato Road at the time and a lot of what the letters talked about to my great grandmother were ideas of what to do Uh huh If you could imagine and and let me say this some of the letters that I have that I love the most that are dearest to me are some of the letters that that she wrote him And he were he was able to get Uh huh And to know that he kept them and then brought them home So these are some of the dearest letters And in reading her letters to him wherever he might be a lot of the letters come from obviously in and around Fredericksburg VA in 1862 1863 And uh she would ask What do we do now about the wheat What do we do about the oats What do we do about the cattle What do we do about this What about this timber Uh huh You know You always talked about doing So and so has called me Do I trust this man You know you think about it uh probably prior to the Civil War she she didn t have this information Uh huh You know they probably she if you think about it she not that he kept anything from her it s just that uh she probably took care of the house if you will Uh huh And he in turn took care of the other affairs And all of a sudden he s up and gone for four years for three and a half years Similar situation happened with my parents uh just you know WWII But uh then he would respond you know Well you can trust this man or you can t trust this person or I would suggest that you do this But always to a t He would always you could see the respect building in him for her But you do what you think is right Here s I m trying to answer some of your questions but and this is what I think maybe you might want to consider doing Uh huh But you and I will support you Here I am not knowing if I ll ever come home Right And so it s just it s just a wonderful history So Mary established I guess what I was getting she established the love I have for family
