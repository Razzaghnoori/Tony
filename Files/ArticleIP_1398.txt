been vindicated are having more and more trouble finding anyone on Wall Street who was this optimistic Even analysts who had argued for loosening the old standards by which the market was clearly overvalued now think it has maxed out for a while The rosy view is that the market s remarkable rise makes sense because conditions have been perfect The pessimistic view is that investors have been
