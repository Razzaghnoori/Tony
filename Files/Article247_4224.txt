 Why i Saturday Night Live i Is Not Anti Semitic Is anti Semitism always anti Semitic or can it be something else Abraham Foxman of the Anti Defamation League thinks it s always anti Semitic but Culturebox disagrees The case in point A little more than a week ago Foxman wrote a letter to NBC asking it never to rebroadcast portions of a Dec 4 Saturday Night Live skit he said were offensive to Jews NBC first agreed not to But after SNL s executive producer Lorne Michaels objected the network put the matter under review The sketch in question parodies a recent CBS Christmas special And So This Is Christmas The idea is to do a promotional spot for the forthcoming CBS special And So This Is Hanukkah For those who didn t tune in on Dec 4 it went like this Strains of bad klezmer music and a portentous voice over give way to clips of pop stars played by SNL cast members singing Hanukkah songs The female performers wear scanty clothing and make crude sexual gestures The men wear yarmulkes and rap exaggeratedly or dry hump their backup singers The songs range from the mildly amusing to the unfunny Lou Bega replaces Monica with Hanukkah in his famous refrain A little bit of Monica in my life Ricky Martin does the same with La Vida Loca Tori Amos sings a torchy holiday ballad while nearly having sex with a piano leg And divas Britney Spears played by guest host Christina Ricci Mariah Carey and Celine Dion share their feelings about the Jewish holiday Spears thinks it s OK because the Christians have forgiven the Jews for killing Christ Dion recalls that when she asked her mother what Hanukkah was her mother said it was a holiday celebrated by the people who own the movie studios and the banks It s those last two bits Foxman wants pulled from circulation Out of context this isn t crazy since the Christ killer epithet has justified pogroms for centuries and the international Jewish banking and media conspiracy theory is alive and being propagated But Foxman is wrong to think he needs to defend his people from the producers of SNL however tasteless they may be The people being made fun of in this sketch are not Jews They re pop stars Culturebox doesn t mean to suggest that your average pop star is not an ignorant self promoting ditzbrain of course In the scene Foxman objects to however the mockery is not aimed at pop stars in general It targets a specific kind of pop star the one from a background so low class she doesn t know enough to hide her anti Semitism In other words it s white trash pop stars who are being insulted so it is the trailer park pop star anti defamation league not Foxman s that should be demanding a retraction If you want to understand who exactly is being skewered in Spears and Dion it helps to think of a scene in a better television comedy in which a white trash country singer makes a similarly anti Semitic remark This insight by the way is not Culturebox s It was sent to her by a Slate reader who insists on anonymity but who seems to be possessed of an astonishing memory Whether his memory is accurate cannot be confirmed since Columbia Tristar Television which owns the tapes in question says it is unable to look the incident up Culturebox s correspondent writes With respect to current controversy over SNL Christina Ricci Britney Spears you may recall an almost identical line from Mary Hartman Mary Hartman back in its first season Loretta Haggers Mary Kay Place Mary s neighbor and a country singer got her big break on a Carson like show She told the host that everyone had been so nice to her in L A and rattled off a bunch of Jewish names Then she added I can t believe they re the same people who killed our Lord I m not sure if it was controversial at the time in the real world It did kill Loretta s career on the show
