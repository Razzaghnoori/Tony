 Man on the Dark Side of the Moon I agree about one thing Bradley is one of the most compelling arguments for the NBA s cancellation of the Old Timers Game Actually since the debate occurred around twilight on this coast I experienced most of it on the radio and I thought Bradley was responding to coaching that he be slightly more punchy in his delivery On the other hand when the subject of religion came up he told precisely the same story in precisely the same words that he had used on his one on one on MSNBC the day before I know that s my fault for paying attention I m an admirer of Jim Carrey and Milos Forman I enjoyed Flynt as well but mother nature hasn t made enough wild horses to get me to see a movie about Andy Kaufman Having both seen him as an audience member and shared stages with him I became convinced that he was how shall we put this gently mentally ill and that charging money to see him alternately irritate and infantilize his audiences was the modern equivalent of Bedlam Why the posthumous cult of Andy in Hollywood Here s a theory Kaufman acted out in arguably interesting ways the hostility toward the audience that most people in show business feel but try with varying degrees of success to conceal He seemed to me to be part of the wave of people in comedy who learned the wrong lesson from Albert Brooks In his standup and Tonight Show work Albert demonstrated how you could delay the laugh really prolong the suspense and get a much better laugh at the end Andy and some of the SNL people took this to mean you could postpone the laugh forever Man did you open a can of worms Now as for Hollywood s penchant for releasing the classy movies as close to Oscar time as the rules and the calendar allow I agree that the ravages of memory have a lot to do with it There s also the fact the industry has developed a code that you can t release anything short on special effects in the summertime so adults and movies that appeal to them aren t welcome in the plexes until at least October Semi serious or intelligently funny like Galaxy Quest movies around the Christmas break is at least a better cultural tradition than the one in Britain where Christmases are rated by whether the BBC had a good slate of specials and whose awful record made the Christmas No 1 list See you at Andy s Harry
