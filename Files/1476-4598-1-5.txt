 Background One mechanism by which tumors evade immune destruction is through cytokine production or induction 1 Prostaglandin E 2 PGE 2 constitutively produced by many NSCLC has been identified as one factor that has direct immunosuppressive properties and is known to induce IL10 in mononuclear cells 2 3 4 5 6 7 IL10 is a dominant immunosuppressive cytokine found in the NSCLC environment known to directly affect T cell mediated immunity 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Both PGE 2 and IL10 have been shown to suppress antigen presentation to suppress cytotoxic T cell CTL responses and to inhibit cytokine production by T cells and antigen presenting cells perhaps most importantly IL12 that plays a central role in initiation and potentiation of cellular immune responses 2 3 4 5 6 7 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 We asked whether PGE 2 levels and or IL10 levels were elevated in plasma of NSCLC patients whether monocytes from NSCLC patients produce more IL10 than normals and whether there was correlation within our findings As an additional in vitro correlate we evaluated differences in IL10 production by normal adherent peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultured in conditioned media from cell lines that produce variable amounts of PGE 2 Results PGE 2 produced by tumor cell lines correlated with IL10 production by normal donor adherent PBMC To confirm observations from the literature supernatants from 6 different NSCLC cell lines producing variable amounts of PGE 2 ranging from 100 pg ml 5 10 5cells to 50 000 pg ml 5 10 5cells were compared directly for their ability to induce IL10 in adherent mononuclear cells Each cell line induced IL10 in adherent mononuclear cells that was greater than control This relative increase in IL10 correlated with PGE 2 produced by each cell line p 0 05 Figure 1 PGE 2 levels in plasma of individuals with NSCLC Two separate assays yielded similar elevations in plasma levels of PGE2 above normals Each assay used different sets of normals for comparison Significant differences were seen when comparing measurements from 38 NSCLC samples to 9 normals 234 40 vs 519 54 p 0 0167 and 27 NSCLC patient samples to 16 normals 846 62 vs 1838 213 p 0 0011 Figure 2 Absolute measures of PGE 2 differed between assays that prevented the pooling of results relative values may reflect differences in sample handling or assay conditions or differences in ELISA kits themselves Plasma IL10 levels measured in 29 patient samples were not significantly elevated above controls 6 6 4 6 vs 3 9 3 6 p 0 1 not shown PGE 2 levels did not correlate with stage or histology p 0 1 all comparisons Cytokine profiles of adherent mononuclear cells from NSCLC patients Adherent cells predominantly mononuclear phagocytes from 13 individuals were evaluated for IL10 production Data show adherent mononuclear cells from NSCLC patients produced baseline levels of IL10 significantly greater than those of normal volunteers 40 25 vs 574 127 p 0 01 Figure 3 IL10 production did not correlate with stage or histology not shown Correlation of PGE 2 levels and IL10 production from adherent mononuclear cells Paired comparisons of plasma PGE 2 levels and mononuclear cell IL10 was possible in 11 patient samples Paired comparisons in patient sample did not reach statistical significance p 0 1 although in a subset of 9 patients excluding 2 samples with the highest PGE 2 levels a positive correlation of PGE 2 levels and IL10 production was apparent p 0 05 Figure 4 There was no simple explanation for these outliers nor rationale for excluding these samples There was a significant correlation between PGE 2 levels and IL10 production in normal samples p 0 05 but combining normals and patient data did not strengthen the statistical observations Discussion COX 2 is an inducible enzyme upregulated in inflammatory states 20 21 Notably many NSCLC and what have been characterized as premalignant lung lesions have been shown to constitutively express the COX 2 enzyme and produce prostaglandin E 2 PGE 2 the primary product of the COX 2 pathway 22 23 24 25 26 Importantly PGE 2 production by tumor cells has been linked to tumor induced immunosuppression in NSCLC 2 3 4 5 PGE 2 has been shown to directly suppress T cell mediated immunity the primary effector against tumor cells at a variety of levels 2 3 4 5 6 7 Further PGE 2 has been shown to induce the IL10 in mononuclear cells 4 5 IL10 is a prominent immunosuppressive cytokine that may have a dominant role in preventing innate antitumor responses in the NSCLC environment 2 3 4 5 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 Among myriad suppressive effects on T cells and antigen presenting cells IL10 is known to inhibit IL12 production 14 15 16 17 18 IL12 plays a key role in the initiation and potentiation of cellular immune responses and alteration of the IL12 producing function in circulating mononuclear phagocytes may be a critical factor in suppressed T cell immunity to NSCLC 27 28 We evaluated both PGE 2 and IL10 in plasma of NSCLC patients finding only PGE 2 to be significantly elevated above controls Elevations were independent of stage of disease or tumor histology Data also show mononuclear phagocytes from NSCLC patients produce significantly more IL10 over 24 hr in primary culture than controls consistent with reports of altered cytokine profiles of adherent mononuclear cells from breast cancer patients 29 Although in vitro experiments suggest there could be a direct link between elevated plasma PGE 2 levels and increased IL10 production by adherent mononuclear cells in NSCLC the measurements of patient samples do not support a simple causal relationship The correlation seen in a subset of 9 11 patient samples may reflect only the presence of underlying malignancy however it is tempting to speculate on the physiologic relationship between the two PGE 2 can be induced by a number of inflammatory conditions however no single factor other than cancer is likely to account for the significant differences seen in this series Absolute values of PGE 2 that may vary with different assays are likely less important than the observed differences between NSCLC and normals The lack of association with disease stage or histology and the nonspecific production of PGE 2 by multiple cell types may limit the usefulness of PGE 2 as a specific independent marker for NSCLC Apart from standardized measurement of PGE 2 as a marker for disease a biologically relevant aspect of elevated PGE 2 would be in the association with altered immune profile of mononuclear phagocytes specifically IL10 induction Importantly serum IL10 levels were established as an independent marker for disease and response to therapy by De Vita et al 10 The source of the IL10 in that series was thought to be from mononuclear cells Based on the observations and conclusions of these investigators and the measurable increases in IL10 production by mononuclear phagocytes derived from NSCLC patients compared to controls plasma levels of IL10 from these patients might be expected to also be elevated In the current series however there was no difference between patient and control plasma IL10 levels The reasons for this discrepancy are unclear and may be related to differences in handling processing samples or differences in the sensitivity of the ELISAs used in the studies Further there was no significant correlation between IL10 production by mononuclear cells and disease stage as might be inferred from the previously mentioned studies There was no correlation with histologic type of lung cancer Conclusions Plasma PGE 2 levels may be a nonspecific marker for NSCLC and warrants further investigation In contrast plasma IL10 levels did not appear to be sensitive markers in our studies IL10 production by circulating mononuclear cells however appears to be associated with disease The reasons for IL10 production by mononuclear cells in NSCLC are speculative and may be varied Plasma PGE 2 may contribute but cannot be simply and directly linked Methods Cell lines Six established NSCLC cell lines UKY 104 NCI 460 NCI 820 NCI 1155 NCI 1355 and A549 were evaluated Cell
