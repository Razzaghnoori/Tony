 Protecting the President The Clinton years haven t been easy for the U S Secret Service First agents were blamed for spreading rumors about marital spats involving household furniture between the president and the first lady Then they drew jeers for closing part of Pennsylvania Avenue after two near assaults on the White House Last fall muckraker Seymour Hersh s book about John F Kennedy s sexual exploits relied on dirt from whistle blowing ex operatives Now Clinton s guards are being forced to tell all about the president s alleged affair with Monica Lewinsky It s an uncomfortable role for a group that prides itself on its low profile indeed on its secrecy From the Zapruder film to the Clint Eastwood film the popular image of the Secret Service agent stiff posture of dark suit and shades the walkie talkies the microphone in the sleeve is one of laconic unflappable and self abnegating cool Though always at the center of things the agent cherishes his anonymity he s expected to sacrifice not just life but also ego to protect the president Who are these guys anyway And how did they develop such importance and mystique From the beginning Secret Service operatives have been thought to have pretty sexy jobs Abraham Lincoln and Gen George B McClellan conceived of the organization during the Civil War as an espionage agency Under the control of the Department of War its first head was the legendary private detective Allan Pinkerton a friend of McClellan s who had learned of and helped avert an attempt on Lincoln s life in 1861 When Lincoln fired the famously inept McClellan Pinkerton went too He was replaced eventually by a brigadier general named La Fayette C Baker who recorded his exploits of derring do in a memoir called The Secret Service in the Late War 1874 the first in a long line of agents kiss and tells click for a brief review Later Baker ran afoul of President Andrew Johnson for having allegedly set up his own espionage network within the White House Johnson abolished the organization and Baker wound up testifying against the president during his impeachment hearings Meanwhile another Secret Service the forerunner of today s was created as a division of the Treasury Department On April 14 1865 Lincoln met with Treasury Secretary Hugh McCullough about the need to fight rampant wartime counterfeiting During the war the U S government had issued its first paper money or greenbacks previously only private banks had issued paper notes and one third to one half of all paper currency in circulation was believed to be queer McCullough and Lincoln discussed setting up a Secret Service to root out counterfeiters It didn t occur to them unfortunately to have this new division protect the president and that very night Lincoln was assassinated when the Washington D C policeman assigned to guard him wandered out of Ford s Theater to a tavern down the street La Fayette Baker s men coincidentally helped bring John Wilkes Booth to justice The assassination delayed things and July 5 McCullough swore in the new service s first chief the appropriately named William P Wood In the absence of other federal law enforcement agencies there was no FBI until 1908 the service over time took on new jobs combating the terrorist acts of the Ku Klux Klan which had sprung up in the Reconstruction South conducting espionage during the Spanish American War and World War I investigating the Harding administration s Teapot Dome scandal and helping to apprehend the gangster Al Capone for tax fraud Its main job though has always remained fighting counterfeiting and other forms of fraud check credit card postage stamp food stamp and the like Which is to say if you cash your neighbor s Social Security check it s the Secret Service that will come after you Conspicuously absent from the agency s duties was the job of presidential protection Until Lincoln s murder no president had been assassinated When in 1835 a would be assassin pointed his pistol at Andrew Jackson the pugnacious president simply charged at the assailant brandishing his cane To his good fortune both the gun and a backup pistol failed to fire In 1881 James Garfield was the second president to be killed and during Grover Cleveland s second term a time of fierce labor unrest the president finally began using Secret Service agents informally for defense Only when Theodore Roosevelt took office following the 1901 assassination of William McKinley did the Treasury Department authorize full time presidential protection Five years later Congress passed the Sundry Civil Expenses Act which made the service s protective duties official For 62 years the Secret Service ably sheltered the president from danger despite assassination attempts on Franklin Roosevelt as president elect in 1933 and Harry Truman in 1950 John F Kennedy s assassination although the service s greatest failure nonetheless brought it renewed acclaim for its agents heroics One leapt onto the president s moving limousine to shield Jackie Kennedy while another Rufus Youngblood gained fame for covering Vice President Lyndon Johnson s body with his own Likewise Agent Timothy McCarthy was celebrated for taking a bullet for Ronald Reagan in 1981 The Kennedy assassination thus marked the arrival of the romantic myth of the self sacrificing agent the myth that Larry Cockell and Clinton s other agents trade on when they publicize their anguish over having to betray the president s trust In the 60s and 70s the danger of assassination seemed suddenly to expand Martin Luther King Jr and Robert Kennedy were murdered in 1968 George Wallace was crippled in 1972 and Gerald Ford was targeted twice within three weeks in 1975 and the Secret Service s custodial duties expanded accordingly Protection had been unofficially extended to presidents elect in 1908 Now others came under the shield former presidents 1961 vice presidents and vice presidents elect 1962 former presidents spouses and families 1965 presidential and vice presidential candidates 1968 visiting foreign heads of state 1971 vice presidents families 1974 foreign diplomatic missions 1975 and spouses of foreign heads of state 1986 Even the Mona Lisa got Secret Service guardianship during her visit to the United States in 1962 Naturally the agency s size and budget exploded see David Plotz s explanation in Strange Bedfellow In 1963 it had 520 employees and an annual budget of 8 million Today it has approximately 4 600 employees a 590 million budget and field offices around the world This massive growth has periodically elicited cries from lean government types What s more in our egalitarian times people resent the privilege that serves to insulate a somewhat random quasi aristocracy from contact with citizens This same egalitarianism fuels the feeling that the Secret Service shouldn t serve in the mot du jour as the president s Praetorian Guard that it shouldn t take metaphorical bullets to protect his dalliances Even that unpleasant task however has some precedent In The Dark Side of Camelot of course Hersh found four ex agents who told him about JFK s reckless sexual escapades and about how they were pressed into providing cover Less well known if less salacious is the fact that in 1915 the Presbyterian moralist Woodrow Wilson then a recent widower used agents to run interference for him in his amorous pursuits Edmund Starling who guarded Wilson wrote in his memoir Our boss was in love He was courting a handsome widow Mrs Edith Bolling Galt it was all taking place at the White House where Mrs Galt was brought by her friends Soon Starling was conscripted into following the couple on their walks through Washington s Rock Creek Park for more details click and fending off reporters Though Wilson was unmarried dating another woman so soon after his wife s death seemed vaguely scandalous in 1915 especially because as Starling discreetly put it Wilson was afraid another woman a Mrs Peck whom the President had known years before would make trouble if an engagement were announced Starling and his colleagues held their tongues at least until he penned his memoir History teaches few practical lessons but here it may have a small one to offer Larry Cockell call your agent If you missed the review of Secret Service kiss and tell memoirs and
