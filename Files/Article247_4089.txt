 George W Is Like Cool Evan I think you re right that ideologues in the Republican Party and I m using ideologue here as a euphemism for people of principle rather than wild eyed nut cases are going to wake up one morning early into the Bush presidency with a terrible hangover Bush is considerably less conservative than many of his fans believe not that he s ever made any secret of it He s run so far as an out of the closet moderate someone who genuinely cares about bipartisan compromise or the appearance of it anyway He brags about his friendships with Democrats He hired Mark McKinnon who s not only an excellent media consultant but also an old friend of Paul Begala and Mandy Grunwald not to mention a former songwriter for Kris Kristofferson and by far the coolest person on the Bush campaign The message of all this is unmistakable I m no winger It s been a terribly effective strategy so far and it leaves no messy pandering to clean up during the general but I think it has consequences for conservatives Bush as you point out is in some ways a Reagan like figure But here s one difference Reagan came to office in 1980 with a large outstanding debt to the right particularly evangelicals He rewarded them by giving them jobs and access and in many cases real power It was the ideological conservatives who worked for Reagan Bill Bennett and Gary Bauer to name two who are still very much around who pulled his domestic policy to the right and kept it there Bush is the first GOP front runner in memory who owes no such debt to conservatives Congressional Republicans squandered their leverage over him almost immediately They threw their endorsements to Bush at the very beginning of the cycle and without demanding anything in return They shouldn t have been surprised when Bush repaid the favor by casting Denny Hastert as Sista Soulja But they were And wounded too But by that point there was nothing they could do My guess is they ll be every bit as shocked when President W strikes up a warm personal friendship with Dick Gephart doubles the budget of the Department of Education and appoints several more David Souters to the Supreme Court Republicans never learn Though I must say they ve been pretty good about the drug thing Bush has all but admitted cocaine use or admitted that it would be a bad idea to admit it which strikes me as roughly the same thing and nobody apart from Gary Bauer has thrown a fit Good for everyone involved I say Admittedly I hold the minority view on the drug question pro drug but anti legalization but I m convinced a lot of people must feel the way I do Who d want a 53 year old president who d never done a line A dork in other words Not me Then again maybe a lot of people don t feel the way I do about it I m taken by Bush s loudmouth frat boy shtick for instance Just about everyone else I know thinks it s odd even troubling to see a serious presidential candidate run around punching people in the arm and giving nicknames to strangers They use the phrase towel snapper as an epithet like there s something hideous about being mildly boorish with your male friends I don t get it I don t have my finger on the pulse of America Evan I m not the man to figure out who buys Texas Monthly and why Sorry Best Tucker
