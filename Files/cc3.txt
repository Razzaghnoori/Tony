 Introduction Aggressive methods of decreasing oxygen consumption such as therapeutic musculoskeletal blockade are used for patients with marginal oxygen delivery associated with cardiac and respiratory insufficiency This is especially true during exotic mechanical ventilation methods designed to increase efficiency of oxygen utilization and decrease peak airway pressures In addition hemodynamic deterioration from the effects of unrestrained musculoskeletal hyperactivity can precipitate angina heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias by increasing myocardial work and oxygen consumption in the face of compromised coronary artery output 1 Escalating doses of sedatives followed by oppressive hemodynamic and ventilatory side effects sometimes provide an indication for therapeutic musculoskeletal paralysis to rapidly get control of life threatening agitation syndromes Brain wave monitoring by portable non invasive computer processed monitors allows quick recognition of some brain functions under titrated suspended animation in real time facilitating modulation of therapy when the visual clues of neuronal function disappear The classic EEG is usually recorded on a ponderous console with 8 to 32 channels to improve sensitivity Difficulty using strip chart EEGs utilizing analog technology stimulated the development of electronically processed digital EEG monitoring The processed EEG does not require as many head electrodes to generate a satisfactory signal that can be utilized for useful clinical data in the ICU Current practice for digitally processed electroencephalography is to non invasively place soft moist contact electrodes across the forehead after skin preparation with an anti oil solution This procedure is quick and easy for the ICU staff to perform and requires no sophisticated training The interpretation of an EEG tracing involves the quantification of signal strength and recognition of patterns 2 Quantification of the amplitude and frequency can be effectively accomplished with any signal monitor EEG Pattern recognition that of signal morphology spatial and temporal distribution and wave form reactivity is more difficult and is subject to observer interpretation These parameters are not evaluated very effectively by raw signal EEG monitors but some progress has been made using computerized processed signal EEGs The electrical activity from eye movements facial muscles respiration and the heart s electrical limits the effectiveness of bedside EEGs for routine use in the ICU but under neuromuscular blockade these artifacts are minimized and a relatively pure signal is obtained Advantages of the processed EEG during neuromuscular blockade are that the data are more easily interpreted by physicians not specifically trained in electroencephalography These trends may then be interpreted more quickly in the acute care setting resulting in a faster clinical intervention where needed 3 Practical electroencephalography The frequency ranges of brain electrical activity are divided as follows where the amplitude is measured from peak to peak Delta 4 Hz Theta 4 8 Hz Alpha 8 12 Hz Beta 13 Hz The continuum from wakefulness to sleep involves a progressive decrease in the alpha band followed by increased activity in the beta theta and delta bands The alpha rhythm contains waves of 8 12 Hz and is very responsive to volitional mental activity increasing with excitement and decreasing with tranquility These rhythms occur mainly in the posterior head and are the predominant brain activity in the normal brain The beta rhythm occurs in the prefrontal regions and has been associated with increased cognitive activity Higher levels of beta activity have also been associated with anxiety and delirium 4 During the induction of general anesthesia transient beta activity can also indicate the initial anxiolytic and amnestic stage of sedation Both theta and delta waves are seen in stages three and four of normal sleep and not in awake adults 5 Interpretation of signals commonly used medications in the ICU Narcotic analgesics Fentanyl and morphine The effect on the EEG of intravenous fentanyl in doses of 30 70 g kg following premedication with oral lorazepam 4 5 mg or 10 mg intramuscular morphine was studied in cardiac surgery patients 6 Within 1 min the normal alpha rhythm was replaced by diffuse theta waves followed quickly by predominant delta activity consistent with anesthesia Lower doses of fentanyl resulted in slowed alpha activity with an increase in theta bands In the cat very high levels of fentanyl in the range of 40 80 g kg produced seizure like activity 7 The EEG response after administration of morphine is similar to that of fentanyl and resembles the pattern demonstrated by the centrally acting serotonin uptake inhibitors and alpha 2 agonists such as clonidine 8 Meperidine Administration of meperidine in usual analgesic intramuscular doses produced a picture of alpha activity voltage reduction and the appearance of slow waves of intermediate voltage consistent with mild hypnosis 9 Benzodiazepines In low doses the anxiolytic action of benzodiazepines tends to decrease the percentage of alpha activity while increasing the prevalence of beta waves over 18 Hz 8 At high doses theta and delta activity occurs expressing the sedative activity of the drug Midazolam In one study of ICU patients receiving midazolam alpha frequency decreased and beta activity became prominent In higher doses these changes disappeared to be replaced by delta theta activity 10 The onset of action and recovery following intravenous administration of midazolam is rapid When administered to counteract sedative effect the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazinil quickly normalizes alpha wave activity 11 Lorazepam EEG effects were relatively slow in onset reaching base line over 30 min after infusion and with a prolonged duration of action compared to diazepam Increased activity in the 13 30 Hz range was prolonged followed by increased sedative activity 12 Non benzodiazepine hypnotics Propofol Administration of propofol for anesthesia initially produced an increase in the amplitude of the alpha rhythm followed by an increase in delta and theta activity and burst suppression in some patients consistent with anesthesia 13 There is a very rapid onset of action and recovery following intravenous administration of propofol Barbiturates Adjuncts to sedation An alpha 2 adrenoreceptor agonist is capable of potentiating narcotic actions EEG effects of clonidine are similar to narcotics Clonidine The sedative action of the alpha 2 agonist clonidine is commonly appreciated in the ICU setting 15 The EEG response to clonidine is similar to that of morphine and thought to have a similar central mode of action 16 Clonidine increased the time rats spent in the drowsy stage of wakefulness which corresponds to behavioral sedation and inhibited REM sleep for 6 9 h after administration 17 Interpretation of signals altered physiology Carbon dioxide Hypocarbia causes slowing of the EEG Small increases in pCO 2 5 20 above normal cause decreased cerebral excitability and an increased electroshock seizure threshold Higher levels 30 above normal result in increased cerebral excitability and epileptiform discharges High levels 50 above normal produce EEG depression 18 Oxygen Hyperoxia causes a low amplitude fast frequency EEG pattern characteristic of cerebral excitation 19 Decreased brain oxygenation initially causes increased cerebral excitability as a result of peripheral chemoreceptor stimulation and its attendant effects on the brain s reticular activating system 20 If hypoxia persists and overwhelms compensatory systems diffuse EEG slowing occurs eventually leading to EEG silence as anoxia approaches 21 Body temperature Hypothermia causes progressive slowing of brain activity at core temperatures below 35 C Complete electrical silence occurs with profound hypothermia 7 20 c 22 Sensory stimulation In the awake patient stimulation of the senses usually results in desynchronization of EEG patterns increased amplitude and increased frequency 23 This increase in activity is directly correlated with increased brain metabolic activity High amplitude delta waves can be associated with global cerebral dysfunction indicating brain damage or potentially reversible metabolic suppression of cerebral function Blood flow to the brain EEG changes correlate well with blood flow to the cortex EEG changes begin to occur when blood flow decreases below 30 of normal 24 However neurologic outcome has not been demonstrated to be strictly dependent on EEG changes during periods of low flow but more on duration of flow deficits 25 Role of bedside electroencephalography in the ICU The therapeutic use of musculoskeletal paralysis with non depolarizing paralytic agents has increased largely because of the advent of exotic mechanical ventilation modes that require subjugation of the patient s normal ventilation activity 26 During such ventilation modes paralysis may benefit ventilation efficacy by decreasing chest wall muscle tension and peak airway pressure In addition the disparate inhalation and exhalation timing necessary for these modes is difficult for the patient to tolerate and paralysis is necessary to avoid the patient fighting against this unequal inhalation exhalation I E ratio Other uses for therapeutic musculoskeletal paralysis such as chemical restraint to protect health care personnel from violent behavior 27 and the decreasing of cerebral blood flow during unstable intracranial pressure following head injury 28 are relatively rare Agitation episodes that threaten hemodynaimc stability are becoming more common in the ICU as a larger range of sick patients are identified are cared for Life threatening agitation is usually signalled by escalating musculoskeletal hyperactivity in the face of increasing sedative administration Eventually a point is reached where the direct effects of agitation combined with suppressive side effects of pharmacologic agents threaten respiratory and hemodynamic stability Agitated delirium syndromes such as ethanol withdrawal may constitute genuine medical emergencies as they have potentially disastrous hemodynamic and metabolic consequences and may become an indication for therapeutic musculoskeletal paralysis 29 Severe agitation syndromes such as delirium tremens alter physiology and can precipitate hemodynamic deterioration by increasing musculoskeletal activity and metabolic activity to the point where increasing cardiac output cannot be sustained by cardiac physiology 30 This can precipitate angina heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias by increasing myocardial work and oxygen consumption in the face of a compromised coronary artery output 27 In addition musculoskeletal hyperactivity produces metabolic acidosis that can precipitate arrhythmias and compromise oxygen delivery Hyperactivity in muscle groups not used to increased work can cause myoglobinuria and renal failure as well 31 If agitation resists the titrated effects of rapid acting short duration sedatives and becomes so severe that hemodynamic stability is threatened therapeutic musculoskeletal paralysis endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation and titrated hemodynamic support may be necessary to prevent cardiorespiratory collapse True suspended animation can be induced to gain complete control of the situation early rather than chance the increased hazards of partial control in unstable circumstances Unlike benzodiazepines that cause musculoskeletal relaxation non depolarizing neuromuscular end plate neurotransmission antagonists affect therapeutic musculoskeletal paralysis Suspended animation using musculoskeletal paralytic agents will effectively stop the effects of muscular hyperactivity on end organs It is also extremely important to remember that underneath therapeutic paralysis lies unprotected cerebral function Therefore the amount of sedation needed to ameliorate the helpless feeling of paralysis in the awake state is virtually impossible to determine from any information gained by a physical examination or an objective sedation scale such as the Ramsay Score 32 For the intensivist advantages of the computer processed EEG are that the data are more easily interpreted by physicians not specifically trained in electroencephalography 33 This technology uses a single bipolar lead to accentuate trends in brain wave activity mostly frontal cortex which may then be interpreted more quickly in the acute care setting resulting in a faster clinical intervention where needed Sophistication in bedside EEG hardware is increasing with multi channel EEG recording various data reduction functions such as the Bispectral Index and evoked potential analysis becoming available to the ICU Modern cerebral function monitors survey brain electrical activity in real time and reflect changes in brain activity caused by sedatives and other therapeutics 34 There is accumulating evidence that regimens utilizing continuous infusion of sedative agents can be effectively titrated assuring patient comfort and neuronal stability under paralysis while the search for underlying pathology and effective treatment programs follows 35 36 Different classifications and combinations of sedatives analgesics or antipsychotics can be tried until the combination that brings about the most appropriately calm cerebral function tracing is discovered Potential practical application of bedside electroencephalography Modern miniaturized electroencephalographic monitors Fig 1 can be positioned at the bedside visible to the clinical team but out of the way of nursing procedures They are attached to the patient s frontal cranium by non invasive patches similar to electrocardiogram EKG leads The EEG monitor depicts gross brain wave activity in an easily interpretable fashion allowing quick recognition of sedation adequacy during therapeutic neuromuscular blockade when the visual clues disappear Some objective measurement of cerebral function can be frequently and rapidly assessed before the patient undergoes therapeutic obtundation or specifically neuromuscular blockade then the effects of sedation can be followed in real time Figs 2and 3 The effects of specific sedatives such as midazolam Figs 4and 5 lorazepam Fig 6 and fentanyl Fig 7 can be assessed in real time The effect of extremely deep sedation differs from clinical brain death by the presence of delta waves and the absence of EKG artifacts Fig 8 A sedated patient undergoing neuromuscular blockade who is vigorously stimulated shows a brief waking pattern demonstrating the sensitivity of monitoring cerebral responsiveness when the visual clues are not present Fig 9 Adequacy of sedation can be titrated in real time reflecting relatively small changes in therapy such as inadvertent oversedation on brain function Fig 10 Once a patient with compromised respiratory or vital functions is placed on life support hardware sophisticated monitoring devices such as continuous pulse oximetry continuous mixed venous oximetry and capnography effectively monitor hemodynamic and ventilatory parameters However for patients with intrinsic or iatrogenically initiated brain failure it is exceedingly difficult to monitor the combined effects of delirium and oppressive sedation regimens on neuronal function once visual clues are removed Musculoskeletal paralysis does not attenuate the effects of catecholamine release In the past sedation has been titrated under paralysis until tachycardia and hypertension normalize suggesting that patient comfort has been achieved This is an inaccurate way of determining patient comfort under the effects of paralysis and may be unreliable in ICU patients on medications like beta adrenergic antagonists to control heart rate and sympathomimetic drugs such as dopamine or dobutamine to support hemodynamics The advent of cerebral function monitoring has improved on this old method dramatically The processed EEG is potentially valuable in the ICU because of its ability to continuously monitor the end result of therapeutics at the neuronal level improving the timing of therapeutic intervention by physicians not timing of therapeutic intervention by physicians not trained in the interpretation of standard analog strip EEGs The most persistent argument against cerebral function monitoring in the ICU is the issue of cost versus benefit Cerebral function monitoring as an accurate method of assessing and controlling sedation during therapeutic musculoskeletal paralysis seems desirable but there are virtually no data yet demonstrating that such monitoring significantly alters patient outcome There are those who require hard data supporting any therapeutic modality before they will embrace it This is as it should be However this argument assumes the ready availability of convincing substantive evidence supporting an improved outcome with the use of the test modality When a modality resides on the frontier of medical practice and there are no hard data available it seems logical to look for convincing data other than those which are necessarily outcome related as justification Perhaps the assurance that the patient is comfortable under sedation regimens instituted when visual clues of neuronal function disappear is a substantive enough argument until hard data from future research projects come along In deciding how much we can afford to monitor we must also consider what we cannot afford not to monitor Massive overdoses from multiple sedatives analgesics and even musculoskeletal paralytic agents are a real possibility when regimens have no objective guidance Conversely skimpy sedation regimens arbitrarily instituted from a lack of the same objective guidelines may cause lasting psychiatric complications in patients paralyzed and awake at the same time Real damage to patients resulting from therapeutic misadventures during periods when cerebral function monitoring is not assessed are not only possible they are likely The risk to the patient from non invasive cerebral functioning is non existent and the potential benefits at least theoretically possible The relatively small purchase price for one monitor spreads out quickly if the monitor can be used for numerous patients in an ICU setting It seems likely that the protection and preservation of man s most valuable organ is entirely justified 37
