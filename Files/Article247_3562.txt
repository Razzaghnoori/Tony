 Beauty Contest 2000 Dear Tamar First a little personal history I grew up in a black town called Chester Pa in the 1960s just South of Philadelphia which was stone cold Republican and I think did not elect a non Republican mayor until some time in the late 80s or early 90s I do not think I met a Democrat at all until I was about to graduate high school I have often written about Democratic malfeasance and feather bedding and such in upper Manhattan I am frankly not an ideological person If you have to call me something call me well libertarian Would I like it if Hillary turned out to be a hard core lefty In fact no That time has passed way passed as my 17 year old stepson to be would put it What distresses me really is the Clintonian inabililty to articulate a central tendency of any kind That s old news I know and as a battle hardened editorialist for the New York Times I should be over disappointment But it disappoints me nonetheless Garry Wills wrote in the New York Review of Books a few years ago that tacking back and forth between left and right was an honorable way of getting from the status quo to a new philosophy and a new vision I admire Mr Wills but the essay did not convince me As Juan Gonzalez says in todays New York Daily News the idea of people actually believing in a cause must be alien to Bill Clinton But alas we may have reached a time when believing anything openly and publically if indeed you wish to be president consigns you to political death What we have now is a beauty contest I think in which the candidates will say as little as possible and wait for the rival or rivals to crack under the camera lights As you say let s pick this up tomorrow All best Brent
