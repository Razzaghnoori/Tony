 Background Pneumocystis carinii causes pneumonia in immunocompromised patients with a high morbidity and mortality rate However the interaction between this organism and the host cell is not well understood The target cell for P carinii is believed to be the type I pneumocyte After contact with the type I pneumocyte P carinii trophozoites anchor themselves to the host cell It was found that the major surface glycoprotein of P carinii up regulates the expression of integrins on the surface of cultured lung cells 1 to facilitate this attachment P carinii attachment to type I pneumocytes may also be mediated by laminin vitronectin 2 3 or mannose 4 Alveolar macrophages interact with P carinii in the lung as the first line of defense against infection The major surface glycoprotein of P carinii has been shown to be a chemotactic factor for macrophages and monocytes in vitro 5 The interaction of alveolar macrophages with P carinii is mediated by fibronectin 6 P carinii organisms are phagocytized when they bind to mannose receptors on the surface of macrophages 7 Alveolar macrophages have been shown to release TNF prostaglandin E 2 and leukotriene B 4 upon interaction with P carinii 8 These compounds are potent modulators of pulmonary inflammation and lung injury 9 These are early and important events in the acute response to infection and clearance of P carinii organisms from the lung 10 Although it is not certain whether P carinii organisms attach to type II pneumocytes type II pneumocytes do respond to P carinii infections Type II pneumocytes maintain the structural integrity of alveoli for gas exchange They produce alveolar surfactant and replicate and differentiate into type I pneumocytes after lung injury 11 Type II pneumocytes have been shown to increase the production of surfactant protein A SP A in patients with P carinii pneumonia PcP and the increase of SP A correlates with the organism load in the lung 12 The secretion of phosphatidylcholine from type II cells has been found to be inhibited upon P carinii infection 13 leading to a deficiency of phosphatidylglycerol and the loss of surfactant function in patients with PcP 14 The purpose of this study was to detect alterations in host cell gene expression that occur in response to P carinii infection We have compared gene expression patterns in P carinii infected and mock infected cells using mRNA differential display and found that the mitochondrial ATPase 6 gene is over expressed in response to P carinii infection in rats We also found that type II pneumocytes and Clara cells are responsible for over expression of the ATPase 6 gene in P carinii infected rat lung Results In order to determine whether P carinii infection causes increases in gene expression in host cells experiments using mRNA differential display were performed Human embryonic lung HEL cells were used as host cells and were inoculated with lung homogenate of dexamethasone immunosuppressed and P carinii infected rats A separate set of HEL cell cultures was inoculated with lung homogenate of dexamethasone immunosuppressed non infected rats to serve as non infected mock infected control Several PCR product bands were seen in the P carinii infected but not in the mock infected lanes of the mRNA differential display gel Three of these bands Fig 1 designated A4II A6I and A8I were selected for further study To identify the genes represented by the differentially displayed PCR products the DNA was recovered from the gel re amplified cloned and sequenced The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool BLAST was used to identify the sequences thus obtained The A4II product was determined to be a 234 bp DNA fragment with sequence approximately 60 homologous to nucleotides 134 234 of the yeast mitochondrial ori 1 sequence gb K02488 YSCMTORIA This product was not further investigated since it is not a human or rat gene The A6I product was found to be a 332 bp fragment with sequence identical to nucleotides 177 508 of the rat ribosomal protein S19 gene emb X51707 RRRPS19 The 287 bp A8I product was 100 identical to nucleotides 3421 3707 of the rat mitochondrial ATPase 6 gene gb J01435 RATMTCYOS Since we sought to detect genes that were up regulated in the human host cell line HEL 299 in response to P carinii infection it was surprising that none of the three selected PCR product bands were of human origin To verify the expression pattern seen in the mRNA differential display the cloned A6I and A8I fragments were used to probe Northern blots of RNAs derived from non infected and P carinii infected rat lungs The A6I probe reacted with a 0 8 kb RNA band but the intensities of the RNA bands of samples from mock and P carinii infected rat lungs were approximately the same Therefore the A6I product band was not further studied The A8I probe reacted with an RNA band of approximately 0 7 kb Fig 2 which is the size of the rat ATPase 6 mRNA 15 Both P carinii infected and mock infected RNA samples showed the 0 7 kb band The intensity of the band of the RNA sample from P carinii infected rat lung is approximately 4 times stronger than that of the sample from non infected rat lungs based on densitometric analysis of the autoradiogram The band intensities of the same blot probed with a fragment of the 18S rRNA gene were used as an internal control for variations in the amount of RNA loaded on the blot Fig 2 These results indicate that non infected rat lungs have a basal level of ATPase 6 gene expression and that this expression is increased in P carinii infected lungs To verify over expression of the ATPase 6 gene in rat lung tissue in situ hybridization with digoxigenin labeled riboprobes was performed Slides each of which contained lung tissue sections of both dexamethasone immunosuppressed non infected NRL and P carinii infected PcIRL rats were probed with sense and anti sense riboprobes of the ATPase 6 gene The sections reacted with the sense probe served as a control for non specific background signal The sections reacted with the anti sense probe were expected to show a dark blue precipitate in cells as an indication of ATPase 6 gene expression A dark blue precipitate was not seen in NRL and PcIRL sections reacted with the sense riboprobe Fig 3 ATPase 6 probe panels NRL S and PcIRL S but was seen in 2 3 cells per alveolus in the NRL sections reacted with the anti sense riboprobe Fig 3 ATPase 6 probe NRL AS Large alveolar macrophages with blue precipitates were also seen in some of the alveolar spaces In addition some of the epithelial cells of the very distal parts of the respiratory tree also showed blue precipitate Data not shown In sections of PcIRL reacted with the anti sense riboprobe hybridization signal was seen in many more cells per alveolus when compared to those of NRL Some alveoli were packed with foamy exudate indicative of a heavy P carinii infection Most of the cells in the septal areas around these alveoli reacted with the probe Fig 3 ATPase 6 probe PcIRL AS but there was no reaction with the probe in consolidated alveolar spaces indicating that the probe did not react with P carinii organisms Cells in the apical areas of the alveoli are usually type II pneumocytes and the non ciliated cuboidal epithelial cells in the very distal parts of the respiratory tree are usually Clara cells 16 The observation that cells reacted with the ATPase 6 gene probe are located in these two areas suggests that type II pneumocytes and Clara cells are the cell types that over expressed the ATPase 6 gene To confirm this possibility in situ hybridization with a probe specific for type II pneumocytes and Clara cells was performed This probe was a 202 bp fragment of a portion of the rat surfactant protein B SP B gene emb X14778 RNSPB that is expressed only in type II pneumocytes and Clara cells 17 As seen in Fig 3 SPB probe S tissue sections NRL or PcIRL reacted with the SP B sense probe showed no hybridization signal Similarly to those probed with the ATPase 6 gene cells in the apical area of alveoli 2 3 per alveolus and epithelial cells lining the distal airways of NRL sections showed blue precipitate when reacted with the anti sense SP B probe Fig 3 SPB probe NRL AS In PcIRL sections reacted with the anti sense probe more cells than in the NRL sections in apical areas of alveoli had blue precipitate indicating SP B expression Fig 3 SPB probe PcIRL AS To confirm that ATPase 6 expressing cells are type II pneumocytes and Clara cells double probe fluorescent in situ hybridization was performed Sections of NRL and PcIRL tissues were hybridized simultaneously with fluorescein labeled SP B and digoxigenin labeled ATPase 6 riboprobes Hybridized fluorescein labeled SP B or digoxigenin labeled ATPase 6 riboprobes were visualized as green or red fluorescence respectively using the appropriate filter on a fluorescent microscope Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI and emitted a blue fluorescence under the appropriate filter Sections of NRL and PcIRL hybridized with the sense probes for both ATPase 6 and SP B showed little red or green fluorescence Fig 4 G and H These sections exhibited predominately host cell nuclei that appeared as large blue elliptical rings or spherical masses whereas P carinii nuclei appeared as small blue punctate clusters in the alveolar spaces Fig 4H Composite images of NRL Fig 4A and PcIRL Fig 4B sections hybridized with the anti sense riboprobe for both ATPase 6 and SP B exhibited large blue nuclei surrounded by yellow fluorescence in the cytoplasm This yellow fluorescence was due to complementation between red and green signals derived from anti sense ATPase 6 red signal and SP B green signal probes that hybridized with RNAs in the same cells Panels 4 C and D and E and F are images of 4A and 4B respectively split into individual green SP B and red ATPase 6 channels With very rare exceptions cells that expressed the ATPase 6 gene also expressed the SP B gene In addition no hybridization signal red or green was seen in areas that had clusters of P carinii organisms These results strongly indicate that type II pneumocytes and Clara cells are the sources of ATPase 6 over expression during P carinii infection Discussion The technique of mRNA differential display has been used to detect differences in gene expression between different types of cells 18 19 during cell transformation 20 21 and in various stages of disease development 22 In this study we used it to detect genes that are over expressed in P carinii infected cells Homogenates of lungs from non infected and P carinii infected rats were used to inoculate a human cell line the HEL cell line to determine whether P carinii would up regulate or induce gene expression in infected HEL cells Unexpectedly we detected and identified the mitochondrial ATPase 6 gene which appears to be over expressed in response to P carinii infection as demonstrated by Northern blot analysis Fig 2 and in situ hybridization Figs 3and 4 in rat lungs The possibility that the observed increase in hybridization signal to the rat ATPase 6 probe was due to crossover contamination by yeast or P carinii derived ATPase 6 mRNA is remote because the mitochondrial ATPase 6 gene of yeast shares only 16 sequence identity with that of rat Furthermore there was no indication of ATPase 6 signal originating from yeast or P carinii organisms in the in situ experiments that were performed Figs 3and 4 ATPase 6 is a component of the F 0 F 1 ATP synthase complex which converts the energy stored in the form of the proton motive force to chemical energy in the form of ATP This complex is composed of 2 major domains F 1 and F 0 F 1 is the catalytic portion of the enzyme It lies on the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane and is composed of 6 subunits of 3 3 23 24 and an ATPase inhibitor protein 25 F 0 is the integral membrane domain of the complex and functions as a proton channel in ATP synthesis F 0 has 2 domains the stalk like domain and the integral membrane domain The stalk like domain of F 0 is composed of two proteins OSCP oligomycin sensitivity conferring protein 26 and F 6 27 OSCP is found as a dimer in each F 0 sector It interacts with the F 1 sector and is required for H translocation 28 The integral membrane domain is composed of 3 main proteins subunits 6 A6L and 9 Subunit 6 is the product of the ATPase 6 gene Little is known about the structure and function of the subunit 6 protein except that it is an integral membrane protein that interacts with the OSCP subunit and may be involved in energy coupling to the F 1 sector The A6L subunit is also an integral membrane protein associated with the F 0 sector 29 There are approximately 10 copies of subunit 9 involved in forming the proton channel 30 Except for ATPase 6 and A6L which are encoded by the mitochondrial genome all of the subunits of the F 0 F 1 ATP synthase complex are encoded by nuclear genes 23 It is not clear how expression of each of the protein subunits is regulated or how the complexes are assembled on the mitochondrial inner membrane It has been shown that triiodothyronine T3 increases the transcription of the ATPase 9 gene of the F 0 complex but has no effect on the transcription of the subunit of the F 1 sector 31 This result suggests that the two sectors of the complex are not necessarily coordinately expressed As mentioned above the cells that expressed the ATPase 6 gene were found to be located at the apical areas of the alveoli and in the epithelium of the very distal parts of the respiratory tree The apical areas are where type II pneumocytes are located and the very distal parts of the respiratory tree are where Clara cells are located Cells in these locations were also found to react with the SP B probe Since the SP B gene is known to be expressed only in type II pneumocytes and Clara cells the results suggest that these two types of cells are over expressing the ATPase 6 gene in response to P carinii infection The fact that the rat mitochondrial ATPase 6 gene was isolated from HEL cells inoculated with homogenate of P carinii infected rat lungs suggests that rat cells were present in the inoculum and survived in culture This possibility is consistent with the nature of type II pneumocytes as they are known to be long lived in culture 32 In this study the HEL cells were incubated with the inoculum for 5 days before the cultures were processed for RNA isolation This 5 day incubation was to allow sufficient time for P carinii organisms to interact with the feeder layer HEL cells and for apoptosis of the short lived rat derived cells that were present in the inoculum It is likely that type II pneumocytes survived for the entire 5 day period of incubation It is also likely that some of the HEL cells died in the incubation period and that differentially expressed HEL RNAs were missed Since no human genes were found to be over expressed by the mRNA differential display performed in this study the effects of P carinii infection in gene expression in HEL cells or in human lungs remain to be investigated The significance of over expression of the mitochondrial ATPase 6 gene in P carinii infected lung is unknown Since type II pneumocytes transform into type I pneumocytes in response to lung injury 11 it is possible that this process requires a higher amount of ATP To satisfy this need these cells may increase the expression of the genes of the F 0 F 1 ATP synthase complex This hypothesis implies that the expression of all or most of the genes encoding various components of the ATP synthase complex would be up regulated in response to P carinii infection It is also possible that ATPase 6 plays a role in other functions that also respond to P carinii infection If this were the case genes of other components of the ATP synthase would not necessarily be up regulated together with the ATPase 6 gene All of these possibilities remain to be studied It also remains to be determined whether over expression of the ATPase 6 gene is specific for P carinii infection It is conceivable that over expression of the ATPase 6 gene can be a diagnostic marker if it is unique to P carinii infection Studies are underway to explore these possibilities Conclusions The technique of mRNA differential display was used to detect genes that have an altered expression in Pneumocystis carinii infected hosts The nucleotide sequence of one differentially displayed fragment was found to be identical to that of the gene encoding the rat mitochondrial ATPase 6 which is a subunit of the F 0 F 1 ATP synthase complex Northern blot analysis of total RNA extracted from P carinii infected rat lung versus that from mock infected rat lung revealed that the ATPase 6 gene is over expressed during P carinii infection Cells that expressed the ATPase 6 gene were found lining the distal parts of the respiratory tree and in apical areas of alveoli by in situ hybridization With a two color fluorescent in situ hybridization most cells that expressed the ATPase 6 gene were also found to express the SP B gene indicating that type II pneumocytes and Clara cells are the cell types responsible for the over expression of the ATPase 6 gene in P carinii infection Materials and Methods Development of P cariniiinfections in rats and preparation of P cariniiinoculum To develop P carinii infection Sprague Dawley female rats were immunosuppressed with dexamethasone and then trans tracheally inoculated with 0 2 ml of homogenate of an infected rat lung containing 1 10 6 P carinii trophozoites or with a homogenate of uninfected rat lung as controls as described previously 33 After development of P carinii infection approximately six weeks after inoculation rats were sacrificed and lungs were removed and homogenized in minimal essential medium MEM Life Technologies Inc Grand Island New York containing 10 fetal calf serum and 1 non essential amino acids Following removal of gross cellular debris by centrifugation at 400 g the number of P carinii organisms per ml of supernatant in the infected lung homogenate was determined as described previously 34 Cell cultures The human embryonic cell line HEL 299 American Type Culture Collection Rockville MD was used for P carinii culture When the cell monolayer was confluent the cells were split into six 75 cm 2flasks and grown to confluence The medium on all 6 confluent HEL cell culture flasks was then removed Two flasks designated non infected NI controls were each replenished with 30 ml of fresh complete media Two flasks designated mock infected M were inoculated with an aliquot of normal rat lung homogenate in 30 ml of complete media The remaining two flasks designated infected I were each inoculated with an aliquot of P carinii infected lung supernatant containing 7 10 5 P carinii organisms per ml in 30 ml of media These 6 flasks were then incubated in an isolation chamber containing a gas mixture of 5 O 2 10 CO 2 and balance N 2 at 35 C for five days RNA extraction RNA was isolated using the hot acidic phenol extraction method described by Chuang et al 35 HEL cells were dislodged from the flask with a trypsin EDTA solution washed with DEPC treated PBS and then resuspended in 6 ml of ice cold resuspension buffer 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7 5 10 mM KC1 5 mM MgCl 2 Six ml of hot 70 C lysis buffer 20 mM Tris HCl pH 7 4 0 4 M NaCI 40 mM EDTA 1 mercaptoethanol 1 SDS and 1 ml of citrate buffered phenol pH 4 0 were added to each cell suspension The resulting mixtures were boiled for 1 minute and then extracted with phenol chloroform 1 1 The aqueous portion of the extraction was layered onto a cushion of 5 7 M CsCl in ultracentrifuge tubes The tubes were centrifuged at 147 000 g for 18 5 hours at 18 C After ultracentrifugation the supernatant was removed and the RNA pellets were dissolved in TE buffer 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8 1 mM EDTA and then treated with RNase free DNase I 100 U ml to remove any residual DNA To extract RNA from tissue 100 mg of rat lung was ground in 6 ml of ice cold resuspension buffer The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 400 g for 10 minutes to remove the gross cellular debris The supernatant was then treated as above starting with the addition of 6 ml of hot lysis buffer Eight g of each RNA was electrophoresed in triplicate on a formaldehyde agarose gel to check for integrity of the RNA and to perform Northern hybridizations which were done as described previously 36 Densitometry of Northern Blots The intensities of hybridization signal on autoradiograms of Northern blots were determined by laser densitometry An LKB 2202 UltroScan Laser Densitometer set in absorbance mode was used to scan 20 mm long areas of each lane on the autoradiogram Height width and area of each peak were determined by a least squares fit method and the amount of absorbance over the scan length was evaluated and corrected for baseline absorbance by the LKB 2190 GelScan software package mRNA

extension at 72 C for 30 seconds The final cycle included five additional minutes at 72 C to ensure complete extension of all products and a subsequent hold at 4 C Approximately one fifth of the PCR products from each reaction were electrophoresed on a 6 denaturing polyacrylamide gel to display the PCR product bands The samples of reactions performed with the same primer pairs but different templates M or I were loaded into adjacent wells of the gel An autoradiogram of the gel was obtained and analyzed to detect bands which were present in one of the paired lanes but not in the other Each band was labeled with a three part designation representing the anchored primer H T 11 A H T 11 G or H T 11 C arbitrary primer API 8 and the number of the differential band in the lane from the well Therefore band A4II was found in the A anchored primer H T 11 A reaction with the AP4 arbitrary primer and was the second differentially displayed band in that lane Differentially displayed bands were isolated and reamplified with the same primer pair as that used to produce the isolated differential display band The amplified DNA was cloned into the TA cloning vector pCRII Invitrogen Carlsbad

minutes The resulting RT PCR product was cloned into TA vector pCR2 1 Invitrogen Carlsbad CA Two clones pCR21 4SP B and pCR22 lSP B which had the SP B gene fragment in opposite orientations were selected Generation and preparation of riboprobes The ATPase 6 clones were used as templates in PCRs with primer pairs RATPase6F 5 ACCCCCATCTCACTAATTCC 3 and RATPase6R 5 AGTACTAGGGTAGCTCCTCC 3 to generate a 145 bp fragment to make ATPase 6 riboprobes Similarly a 202 bp fragment was amplified from pCR21 4SP b with primers SP BF and SP BR see above to produce SP B riboprobes Each PCR product was ligated to adapters that contained an SP6 promoter sequence SP6 adapter in one reaction or to adapters with a T7 promoter sequence T7 adapter in another reaction according to the Lig nScribe Ambion Austin TX protocol The ligation products were amplified with an adapter specific primer and either the probe specific forward primer RATPase6F or SP BF for the T7 adapter ligation or the probe specific reverse primer RATPase6R or SP BR for the SP6 adapter ligation Four PCR products were thus generated RATPase6F T7 adapter SP6 adapter RATPase6R SP BF T7 adapter and SP6 adapter SP BR The
