 Background Girls who experience a relatively early sexual maturation typically assessed by age at menarche tend to be more obese as adults 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 For example Garn et al 1 found that women ages 20 to 35 y who reported menarche before age 11 y were 2 to 3 kg m 2heavier than those who underwent menarche after 14 y In addition to this association with adult levels of body mass index BMI kg m 2 menarcheal age is also inversely related to adult skinfold thicknesses 1 2 3 9 Although there is at least one negative report 11 the lack of association between menarcheal age and adult obesity may be due to the difficulty in recalling an event that occurred several decades in the past 12 Although the biological mechanisms underlying the inverse association between menarcheal age and adult obesity are uncertain it has been suggested that early maturing girls may have a longer period of positive energy balance 1 or that various endocrine factors influence both the rate of sexual maturation and the accumulation of body fat 6 However it is also possible that the apparent influence of menarcheal age on adult obesity reflects the underlying importance of childhood obesity with relatively fat children at increased risk for both early menarche 7 9 13 14 15 and adult obesity 7 16 Disentangling these interrelationships requires information on menarcheal age childhood obesity and adult obesity and one study 7 found that adjustment for BMI at age 11 y reduced but did not eliminate the association between menarcheal age and adult obesity A substantial proportion of girls in this study however experienced menarche close to age 11 y and it is unclear if BMI levels at younger ages could also account for the apparent influence of menarcheal age on adult obesity The present study explores the interrelationships between childhood levels of BMI menarcheal age and adult ages 18 to 37 y obesity in a biracial sample of 1179 women Methods Sample Bogalusa Louisiana a semi rural community in Washington Parish population 40 000 is 70 miles northeast of New Orleans Seven cross sectional studies of schoolchildren ages 5 to 17 y were conducted in Ward 4 of Washington Parish between 1973 74 and 1992 94 17 In addition four studies of adults ages 18 to 37 y who had been previously examined as children were conducted between 1982 and 1996 Protocols were approved by appropriate institutional review boards and informed consent was obtained from all participants Because many subjects participated in multiple examinations we could conduct various longitudinal analyses A 6 year old examined in 1976 for example was eligible for re examination in studies conducted in 1978 1981 1984 1987 1991 and 1996 age 26 y Of the 5 to 17 year old girls who were examined in the Bogalusa Heart Study between 1973 and 1994 a total of 3041 girls 1 participated in a risk factor examination before menarche and 2 were age eligible to be re examined in adulthood A 7 year old examined in 1988 for example could not have been re examined as an adult Of these girls 1232 were re examined in adulthood We excluded 53 subjects from the analyses because 1 the reported menarcheal age was younger than the age at a previous examination 2 the first report of menarcheal age was made after age 30 y 3 menarcheal age was never reported or 4 data on premenarcheal weight or height were missing The final sample size was 1179 with each girl being examined on average 5 times between the ages of 5 and 37 years In most analyses premenarcheal levels of height BMI and triceps skinfold thickness TSF were based on data from the initial childhood examination mean age 8 8 y and adult levels of the anthropometric dimensions were based on those at the final mean age 26 y examination Because errors in recalling age at menarche likely increase with the duration of time menarcheal age was based on data provided at the first report of this event There were various combinations of baseline and follow up examinations in this cohort but the largest numbers of girls were followed from 1973 74 to 1988 91 n 343 or from 1973 74 to 1995 96 n 313 Anthropometry The examination procedures used in the Bogalusa Heart Study have been described 18 Weight was measured to the nearest 0 1 kg using a balance beam scale and height was measured to the nearest 0 1 cm with a manual height board BMI kg m 2 was used as an index of relative weight Because of the variability in levels of weight height and BMI by age among children national US data 1963 to 1994 were used to convert these values into sex and age specific Z scores 19 20 These Z scores express childhood levels of weight height and BMI in the current study relative to those of similarly aged children examined between 1963 and 1994 The TSF was measured three times in succession with Lange skinfold calipers and the mean value is included in the analyses The subscapular skinfold thickness was not measured until 1978 1979 the third examination of schoolchildren and levels are shown only for adults The ratio of the subscapular skinfold thickness to TSF is used as a measure of central fat distribution Menarcheal History As previously described 15 information on menarcheal age was obtained by a registered nurse Girls in the 3 rdgrade and above were asked whether they had ever had a menstrual period and if necessary the term menstrual period was explained Post menarcheal girls were asked to identify the year of their first period with the help of questions such as Do you remember what grade you were in when you started having periods Because most subjects provided the year but not the month of menarche we assumed that all girls experienced menarche at the midpoint July 1 of the specified year Menarcheal age was then calculated by dividing the number of days between birth and July 1 of the reported year by 365 25 Statistical Analyses Levels of various childhood and adult characteristics were contrasted between white n 771 and black n 408 women Race specific levels of weight height BMI and skinfold thicknesses among adults and children were also examined within categories early 12 y intermediate 12 to 13 4 y or late 13 5 y of menarcheal age Spearman rank correlation coefficients and odds ratios were also used to summarize the relation of menarcheal age to both childhood and adult levels of weight height BMI and skinfold thicknesses To assess whether childhood differences in the anthropometric dimensions could account for the association between menarcheal age and adult obesity regression estimated differences in adult levels of BMI and TSF between early menarche 12 y and late 13 5 y maturers were compared in two models The first regression model controlled for only age while the second model further adjusted for childhood levels of BMI and TSF We assumed that the estimated differences in adult levels of obesity across menarcheal age categories in the fully adjusted model represented the independent relation of menarcheal age to adult levels of BMI and TSF whereas differences between the two models represented the effects of menarcheal age that were attributable to childhood obesity Smoothed levels of BMI by age based on lowess 21 are also shown for women who experienced early intermediate or late menarche These analyses were further stratified according to childhood BMI Z score 0 vs Z score 0 Results Mean levels of various characteristics are shown in Table 1 On average girls participated in approximately five examinations and the mean age at the initial examination was 9 y Childhood levels of weight and height at the initial examination were similar to those expected with Z scores close to 0 but blacks were slightly taller and heavier than were whites These racial differences in both weight and height resulted in very similar BMI levels among white and black girls but the mean TSF was thicker among white girls The mean menarcheal ages of whites and blacks were similar 12 8 vs 12 9 y but blacks tended to be more likely 30 vs 25 p 0 10 to undergo a relatively early 12 y menarche At follow up mean age 26 y black women had higher mean levels of weight 6 8 kg BMI 2 6 kg m 2 and subscapular skinfold thickness 4 mm than did white women but there was no racial difference in TSF Menarcheal age was inversely related to adult levels of weight BMI and skinfold thicknesses among adults Table 2 As compared with late maturers menarcheal age 13 5 y women who had a relatively early menarche 12 y weighed more 8 to 11 kg had a higher BMI 3 7 to 4 2 kg m 2 and had thicker 5 to 7 mm skinfolds in adulthood p 0 001 for all differences The magnitudes of the various correlation coefficients r 0 21 to 0 24 with menarcheal age were similar between black and white women but the associations were not linear Whereas women who underwent an early menarche had elevated mean levels of BMI weight and skinfold thicknesses in adulthood levels of these characteristics differed only slightly between women who experienced an intermediate age 12 13 4 y or late age 13 5 y menarche Early menarche was also associated with a higher subscapular triceps skinfold thickness ratio among white women but this was largely because of the higher BMI levels among women with a central distribution of body fat r 0 37 Menarcheal age was not significantly related to adult height but among white women early maturers were on average 1 cm shorter than were late maturers p 0 08 Among both white and black girls higher pre menarcheal mean age 9 y levels of BMI weight height and TSF were associated with an earlier menarche Table 3 Among white girls for example those who underwent menarche before age 12 y had higher childhood levels of BMI 1 7 kg m 2 weight 5 1 kg height 4 cm and TSF 2 mm than did those who underwent a relatively late 13 5 y menarche Furthermore menarcheal age was more strongly related to levels of these characteristics in childhood with correlations ranging up to 0 32 than in adulthood Table 2 r 0 21 to 0 24 Logistic regression analyses final column indicated that a difference of 1 standard deviation in levels of weight height and BMI approximately doubled the odds range 2 0 to 2 6 that a girl would experience menarche before age 12 y Additional analyses indicated that these associations were evident even among the youngest children with BMI levels among 5 to 6 year olds inversely associated r 0 22 whites and 0 30 blacks with subsequent menarcheal age We then examined whether the inverse relation of menarcheal age to adult levels of BMI and TSF resulted from the earlier menarche of girls who were already overweight in childhood Table 4 As estimated in regression models that adjusted only for examination age girls who underwent menarche before age 12 y were on average 3 2 kg m 2 blacks to 3 6 kg m 2 whites heavier as adults than were girls who underwent menarche after 13 5 y However adjustment for pre menarcheal differences in levels of BMI and TSF reduced these adult differences by 60 75 to 0 8 kg m 2 blacks and 1 4 kg m 2 whites Adjustment for childhood height which was also associated with an earlier menarche did not alter the relation of menarcheal age to adult levels of BMI and TSF Controlling for childhood levels of BMI and TSF also substantially reduced the adult differences in TSF between early and late maturers Adult levels of BMI and TSF were more strongly associated with childhood levels of these characteristics Table 4 bottom with differences of 8 6 kg m 2 whites and 12 1 kg m 2 blacks between the outer fourths of the BMI distribution Furthermore in contrast to the associations with menarcheal age these adult differences in BMI and TSF were only slightly reduced 10 after adjustment for menarcheal age The joint effects of menarcheal age and childhood BMI levels are shown in Figure 1for whites top and blacks bottom BMI values from all examinations were used in this analysis resulting in a total of 5621 values among 1179 women Smoothed levels of BMI by age are shown in the left panels for girls who experienced an early 12 y intermediate or late 13 5 y menarche and the higher BMI levels of early maturers are evident at all ages However further stratification by childhood BMI Z score 0 vs Z score 0 right panels greatly reduced the differences between early and late maturers and emphasized the greater importance of childhood BMI For example white women with an early menarche had an overall 3 5 kg m 2higher mean BMI level after age 18 y than those with late menarche but as seen in the upper right panel this difference was reduced to 2 1 kg m 2within the two groups of women categorized by childhood BMI In contrast among both early and late maturing white women those who had a childhood BMI Z score 0 were 4 7 to 4 8 kg m 2heavier in adulthood than women who were thinner in childhood Discussion The recent secular increase in obesity among US adults 22 particularly among black women emphasize the importance of identifying children who are at high risk for adult obesity With only one exception 11 girls who undergo a relatively early menarche have been found to be more obese in adulthood 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and our results confirm that a relatively early menarche is associated with adult obesity among both white and black women However most 60 to 75 of the apparent effect of menarcheal age is due to the faster maturation of girls who are relatively heavy for their age and the importance of childhood obesity on the subsequent timing of menarche was evident even among 5 to 6 year olds In addition we found that the inverse relation of menarcheal age to adult obesity was nonlinear with differences in adult levels of BMI and skinfold thicknesses most evident between subjects with an early 12 y menarche and those who had either an intermediate or relatively late menarche Although it has been suggested that rapid sexual maturation may have long term consequences for the development of obesity among women 6 our results indicate that it is more likely that childhood obesity influences both menarcheal age and adult obesity These associations may be mediated by various interrelationships among hormones sexual maturation and body fat For example levels of leptin are increased among overweight children and adolescents 23 24 and this hormone is secreted by adipocytes Other results indicate that leptin may play a role in the initiation of puberty 25 and each 1 ng mL increase in serum leptin has been associated with a 1 month decrease in menarcheal age 24 The apparent effect of early menarche on adult obesity may therefore result from the influence of childhood obesity on both the timing of menarche and the risk for adult obesity 16 It should be realized however that although controlling for childhood BMI and TSF greatly reduced the inverse relation of menarcheal age to adult obesity a relatively small independent association remained Various behavioral factors may also be important in this association with an early puberty possibly resulting in changes in eating habits or physical activity 26 Among women black white differences in BMI levels become apparent after age 12 y 27 suggesting that adolescence may be a critical period 28 29 for the development of obesity It is possible that the more rapid sexual maturation of black girls 9 15 30 31 may in part account for the high prevalence of obesity among black women 22 Although we observed only a small difference in the proportion of black 30 and white 25 who underwent menarche before age 12 y most women in the current study experienced menarche before 1980 More recent data indicate that black girls in the US on average experience menarche 6 months earlier than do white girls 9 15 30 31 Furthermore the mean menarcheal age of black girls in Bogalusa decreased by approximately 9 months between 1973 and 1992 15 A somewhat similar but not statistically significant trend was also reported in a recent study with the median menarcheal age of black girls decreasing by 5 5 months between 1960 70 and 1988 94 31 These trends may at least in part be due to the influence of various programs in the US such as the National School Lunch Program aimed at improving the nutritional status of children Menarcheal age was also inversely related to adult BMI levels in the British Birth Cohort with a mean difference of 4 1 kg m 2at age 33 y between women who underwent menarche before age 12 y n 159 or after age 15 y n 232 7 In agreement with our findings Power et al 7 found that adjustment for childhood age 11 y BMI levels substantially reduced but did not eliminate the apparent influence of early maturation on adult obesity However these investigators did not provide an estimate of the independent association between menarcheal age and adult obesity and it is possible that BMI levels at age 11 y were influenced by the many changes that occur near the time of menarche 32 We found that even among 5 to 6 year olds BMI levels are inversely associated with the subsequent timing of menarche In agreement with our findings as well as those of a previous report from the Bogalusa Heart Study 15 other investigators have found childhood levels of obesity 9 33 34 and height 35 36 to be associated with an early menarche The previously reported positive association between childhood height and adult obesity 37 may therefore be in part due to the earlier menarche of relatively tall girls Although several investigators have also found that an early menarche is associated with shorter adult stature 2 5 9 10 13 possibly because of the loss of several years of growth due to the early fusion of the epiphyses of long bones 5 most of the reported differences in adult height have been small e g 2 cm In the current study we found a 1 cm difference in adult height across categories of menarcheal age among white girls p 0 08 but there was no association among black girls Any association between menarcheal age and adult height is likely to be small Several limitations of the current study should be considered when interpreting our results Despite the large sample size only 1179 of the 3041 age eligible children were reexamined as adults and included in the analyses However the sample appeared to be representative of the larger population and childhood levels of BMI weight and height did not differ between the 1179 re examined children and the other 1862 3041 minus 1179 children The agreement of our findings concerning the interrelationships among childhood obesity menarcheal age and adult obesity with those of other investigators also indicates that our results are likely to be generalizble to other populations The most important limitation of the current study may be the use of self reported menarcheal age and the misclassification associated with this recall over several decades may explain the negative findings that have been reported 11 Over shorter 10 years periods however correlations between the first report of menarcheal age obtained close to the time of menarche and a subsequent report have generally been high 38 with 60 of girls accurately recalling the month and year of menarche 39 Among the 1014 girls in the current study who participated in more than one examination after menarche 73 of the recalled ages at the first and second reports differed by one year or less and only 5 differed by more than two years The mean interval between these two examinations was 5 years but was more than 10 years for 10 of the sample Although this reproducibility is somewhat lower than in other studies a non differential misclassification of menarcheal age would have resulted in an underestimation of the actual associations In addition it is possible that the information on menarcheal age obtained at the first examination following menarche mean interval 3 y may be more accurate than subsequent recalls Additional analyses indicated that both childhood and adult obesity tended to be more strongly associated with menarcheal age reported at the first examination than at the second examination following this event e g r 0 22 vs 0 19 with adult BMI Conclusions Our findings indicate that much of the apparent influence of menarcheal age on adult obesity is in reality due to the influence of childhood obesity on both menarcheal age and adult obesity However there is still an independent association which in conjunction with the increase in childhood obesity 40 and the recent secular decrease in the menarcheal age of black girls in the US 15 30 31 will further increase the prevalence of adult obesity Additional longitudinal studies of childhood and adult obesity as well as predictors of early menarche are needed but is likely that the prevention of childhood obesity will lower the incidence of obesity related complications among adults Abbreviations BMI body mass index TSF triceps skinfold thickness Competing interests None declared Authors contributions DSF participated in the
