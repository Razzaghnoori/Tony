        seem to have the topic already on top of the tip of your tongue there so why dont you go ahead and start     yeah isnt the uh the subject auto repair for tonight yeah thats great   yes sir   reason i say that is pretty timely because just tonight i went out and changed the oil in my car and thats something i like to do and uh something i   okay   something i can do with now the sophisticated auto cars we have today with all the computers and everything   right exactly   its uh and theres not a whole lot you can do without the equipment and electronic analysis that needs to be done on a car but i do like to get out and tinker with a car and its something i can do still do you enjoy working with your car   i sure do i uh in fact the last thing i have ive done i cant i dont even remember what it is ive had to have oil changes done myself because i live in an apartment complex where were not allowed to work on our vehicle we cant even wash our vehicle so   oh dear oh thats too bad   uh but the last thing i can remember doing where i had a sixty six Mustang and that was all right because like you said that was pretechnology days i guess   ooh oh yes   and uh you know you could do a lot of it yourself still and uh i didnt tinker too much with the engine it was it was in pretty good shape but my main concern and what i enjoy doing was was the interior and uh it was it was pretty shelled uh but it was fun it taking the whole thing you know the whole interior apart and ordering new carpeting and   oh   uh   and did you install all that yourself   right and   well that was i bet that was a lot of fun   it it was i my wife enjoyed uh she you know helped out a little we sanded down the the insides of the door panels   umhum   and painted those and   wow do you still have the car   no i sold it   well thats too bad A sixty seven Chevrolet uh Mustang is about the uh top  top year for the Mustang  car   yeah it was fun though it was fun i i really enjoyed it and i was surprised at at uh the availability of parts yet   yes   you know you can you can still get factory original parts   hm   but uh you pay a premium but you just dont get them i i didnt i went ahead and got you you know Japanese made duplicates or wherever they were made Canada you know prefabs and all that stuff but   yeah well it you know thats thats fine i i dont think that there would be uh you know a a quality difference i dont know you wouldnt you didnt notice the difference did you   well actually there was   oh   and uh i had heard rumors that it was because they couldnt duplicate  certain patterns uh exactly   umhum   and so like the the glove box was just a little little wider little harder to fit in and the carpeting uh   oh dear  umhum   stretched a little too far i had to cut some of the sides down   oh dear   but just just little things you know one of the screws on on the door regulator uh window regulators you could get three of the three of the four to lineup the fourth one you couldnt get to lineup no matter what you did   oh i bet that was frustrating wasnt it   you know thing oh it was but the end result is after you put your your panels on nobody sees that you got one screw missing in your your window regulator anyway and it it runs it works just the same so     right right yeah thats thats true well you know that that is something i really enjoy doing um working on our car too the uh i just changed my oil oil tonight but uh i enjoy also working on things like the brakes and uh in fact just two weeks ago i helped my neighbor out on his brakes on his car and uh either if its a drum or or disc brakes i enjoy working on those kind of things   disc brakes dont seem to give me too much problem but i i honestly i dont have the tools for the drum i know you got uh certain spring lever that you got to have or some uh some spring pulley or something that you got to pull that spring back over onto that notch   yeah spoons and yes you do   uh my dads got all that and and i i helped him when i was growing up but i dont have that stuff now comes to drum brakes i   umhum yeah   you know dont have any choice but to take them in   yeah thats true and you know it it doesnt doesnt hurt every once in a while to have them done professionally too because um i was helping my neighbor out and one of his drums needed to be resurfaced and i dont have of course the equipment to do that so he took it into a shop and had it resurfaced uh resurfaced and and fixed that way but yeah it is true uh you know   sure   i did have a sixty four Ford truck that i wish i still had and loved to get inside that and tinker around with it and work with it because you didnt have all the extra extra stuff thats in there now   uhhuh   ill tell you what the other the nicest thing about them is uh everything was standard you didnt have to worry about finding a metric anything   oh yeah   boy i tell you   and you know
