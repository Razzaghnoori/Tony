                 yeah go ahead   okay well um ive never ive didnt really ever have to have a budget um until i quit going to Georgia Tech and um then i learned to budget really fast  um       i had been working parttime before that and uh my parents were helping me some but um i got to where i mean i knew where every penny was going but then as i started making more money um my budgets kind of hasnt doesnt exist except for at certain times  you know   right and you make more money but it goes away anyway   right well i dont have to worry i mean i dont have to think ahead as much like you know but i havent really saved anything im still trying to uh ive i have school debts im still paying back and stuff   yeah i have three children and a house so uh its a serious its a serious matter but uh my wifes just starting to go back to work maybe thatll take the   oh okay so you have to budget   pressure off but i must  i must confess the only control i have over our budget is to try and make as many things as constant as possible like   right   tuition and try to make things monthly so that there are as few surprises as possible but i dont ive started keeping a budget on computer   right   i guess each of the last five years and never followed through and about this time of year is when i get religion i have to do my income taxes i realize that better recording keeping wouldve helped and uh     umhum   i still havent managed to uh uh do it the way i should   yeah but even even if you do break your budget i think when you write things down or however if if you do it on the computer whatever or something where you can just constantly see exactly what where your moneys going   right   then you its its easier even if you dont stick to it i think it you know its better to have you a little bit more conservative hm   right i believe if i had to that i could  estimate all the major form all the major sources of spending uh on a monthly basis and come pretty close but im sure that there are a bunch of surprises in there that uh i would find and maybe learn how to control if i uh kept a formal budget or uh financial plan   yeah   but   but even if you cant i dont think have enough a really when before when i had a strict budget its because i had too i knew exactly where every penny was going before i had it but its its a little bit harder when you have a little bit more leeway   yeah   but also it i think its bad to have like you know say you have these debts and you you know youre paying a lot of interest on one and you wanna go ahead and get it you know paid off sometimes ive looked at it that way and really just you know pinched myself in other places so that i could do that you know uh pay it off and   yeah the only problem is that if you have if you have children  what youre gonna need for them a few years from now is what you need to be putting aside now and thats uh you can fool yourself if you dont set that up somehow   right and thats hard to see but if you if you try to be too strict on yourself then your then you just end up getting really frustrated dont ever you know just   right   just blow a little bit thats you know   right but youll find that the  kids dont really have a very good sense of where the money is going and so theyll ask for things pretty much constantly   right i remember doing that as a child   and ive i learned to say no pretty much constantly  and uh uh so i would be better if i had a budget and i had a certain amount of uh fun money that had to be spent each month or that was allowed to be spent each month id feel better about it   yeah yeah   so who knows maybe thisll get me to do it   you dont have children   yeah no i sure dont   well thats a big change in life in a lot of ways but budgeting is one of them   oh i know i mean ive ive had i have a cat and thats you know  thats     well thats one solution   thats hard enough i mean i know but i mean you know thats a lot  some sort of you know when some theres times when i if i couldnt afford to buy myself groceries i would buy them for her first       you know just because you i mean you feel a lot worse because this being is completely dependent on you you know   thats an interesting spirit but and i suppose cats are like children they dont take no for an answer  as easily   well then  uh yeah they are a lot simpler but  but im im just saying you know i   yeah   it it would it would be hard to know that someone elses life was completely dependent on you you know   yeah the hard part though is not uh it the hard part is um um setting aside for what theyre gonna need in five or ten years  thats uh really difficult   right its hard to see that right now even though you know you have too   yep right well ive made my confession   yeah im   and   im glad we had this conversation because it makes me think i need to sit down and  maybe write
