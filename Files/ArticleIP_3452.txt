 I Private Parts I Note Life and Art is an occasional column that compares movies with the lives they re based on Toward the beginning of Private Parts a heavily made up Howard Stern playing himself as a college student explains in a voice over that to enjoy the movie you ve got to suspend disbelief Exactly how much disbelief does this biopic require us to suspend Not all that much actually Private Parts may be hyperbolic but it basically adheres to the facts at least as they are laid out in Stern s memoir also called Private Parts 1993 in interviews and in an unauthorized biography Howard Stern King of All Media by Newsday reporter Paul D Colford Stern grew up on Long Island went to Boston University and worked at stations in Westchester N Y Hartford Conn Detroit and Washington D C before making it in New York City Along the way he dropped his fake sounding FM voice and became a shock jock talking more and more about himself sex sex with his wife etc The movie does gloss over the lengths Stern was willing to go to shock In the movie his racial comedy tends toward the mildly offensive he invents a militant black traffic announcer In his book he writes of Rodney King They didn t beat this idiot enough On the air he encouraged police to shoot at rioters during the uproar in Los Angeles He s talked about having sex to Negro race music and he s asked his mother on the air if she got on all fours during sex and if she was a three input woman On screen Stern says he s remained faithful to his wife and by all accounts that is true On screen Stern s penchant for exposing the details of his marriage strains it somewhat That was also the case in real life In the movie Stern kisses and consoles a pregnant Alison when she complains I look like a house In his memoir however Stern writes I find nothing attractive about the pregnant form I m like Elvis If a girl got pregnant he couldn t go near her In the movie Stern s rise to the top is impeded by villainous scotch swilling network executives Were his bosses at WNBC really that bad In real life Stern definitely tangled with the station heads The movie s main meanie Pig Vomit is a composite of several oppressive managers based most heavily on Kevin Metheny a program manager nicknamed Pig Virus by Stern But Stern also had what he terms a savior in then general manager Randall Bongarten who doesn t figure in the movie Randy would occasionally tell Stern to watch his content he advised against a Bestiality Dial a Date routine for example but he also promoted Stern s career Among other things Bongarten arranged for advertisements in which Stern WNBC s afternoon drive deejay and Don Imus the station s morning drive star got equal billing In the film Imus won t deign to speak to Stern much less appear in an ad with him However in 1985 NBC executives did instruct Bongarten to fire Stern Colford writes in his biography that Howard has elevated the final chapter in his war with NBC to the myth of the inventive radio personality clashing with the stuffed shirts of a mighty network but goes on to record events that sound a lot like stuffed shirts clashing with Stern Bob Rukeyser NBC s director of corporate communications at the time said that he alerted Grant Tinker then chairman of NBC to Stern s material and that Tinker decided Stern had to go Stern reached No 1 in New York City during morning drive the most competitive time period in the fall of 1991 but at a station that does not appear in Private Parts WXRK FM 92 3 K ROCK owned by Infinity Broadcasting Infinity hired Howard just months after NBC fired him During the film s last scene as Alison and Howard kiss he explains in a voice over that life is good even if the Federal Communications Commission gets on his case every now and then What he doesn t say is that in response to mounting fines from the FCC for indecency on Stern s radio show Infinity paid a settlement of 1 7 million in 1995 Nor does he mention that in the end he did make a few compromises to stay on the air Infinity instituted a seven second delay so that offensive portions of Howard s program could be bleeped before they were broadcast He was also forbidden to refer to his boss Mel Karmazin on the air See Slate s review of Private Parts
