 The Campaign on the Web By their Web sites ye shall know them The presidential candidates have staked their places on the Web to raise money to distribute speeches and position papers and to show off their cybersavvy Some sites are better than others Here s a quick guide Democrats Bill Bradley Bradley pitches himself as a reformer disdainful of big money The site even offers a copy of his personal financial disclosure statement However you ll soon discover that clicking around the site causes an unsolicited Make a Contribution box to pop up repeatedly on your screen Bottom line Large confident and dull Al Gore Lest anyone associate Gore with Bill Clinton s sex life two of the departments you can click to from any page are The Gore Family and Tipper Gore And while other sites gloss over the legal rules for giving money this contribution form requires donors to check boxes stating I am not a foreign national who lacks permanent resident status in the United States and The funds I am contributing are my own personal funds and not those of another Bottom line Cybersprawl Republicans Gary Bauer Bauer s site lets you pledge to write a check but unlike other sites doesn t let you use your credit card online There s also an Online Internship Application which offers students experience in correspondence grassroots organization volunteer coordination fundraising events planning and coordination and media events Hurry the deadline for the fall term is Aug 6 Bottom line Low tech high dudgeon George W Bush This site takes personalization to the next level asking for information in return for an individualized pitch An Issues page focuses on Bush s favorite topics such as Faith Based Initiatives The En Espa ol section offers several pages in Spanish including this item which touts Bush s coraz n y visi n An audio message of the day communicates directly to supporters The Youth Zone explains Bush s view of politics it s just like baseball The parties are leagues the primaries are playoffs and the general election is the World Series Bottom line Prosperity with a surface Steve Forbes Calls itself America s first full scale Internet campaign and is by far the most technically sophisticated site with an array of slide shows videos and a personal control panel that repackages his position papers speeches and press releases as links from an icon symbolic of high tech individual empowerment Bottom line The gold standard Orrin Hatch Uncharacteristically hip in appearance the home page features Hatch silhouetted against a black background Supporters are encouraged to stuff virtual ballot boxes by a vote online page which links to Internet polls A page of media links invites disciples to write editors and create the illusion of a groundswell for their favorite dark horse Weekly Hatch Toons attack the senator s opponents A cartoon of a wayward youth smoking something quotes the parents impression that their boy is presidential material If we can just hang on til he s 40 Bottom Line Spare and strange Alan Keyes The site is utterly disorganized but lovingly maintained by Keyes acolytes Its audio and transcript archive of his speeches and radio shows is amazing Bottom line Grassroots fire and brimstone John McCain A special page for the Bush campaign exposes Bush s server as the largest single source of visitors to McCain s site and offers 10 reasons why Dubya staffers should browse Reason No 1 to contribute A link to a campaign finance petition underscores McCain s reformist position His Campaign Store offers Official Campaign Material that may be ordered for a small contribution A biographical video costs 25 Clicking John McCain on the Issues takes you not to his position papers which requires a further click but to the McCain Poll which invites you to weigh in on a rigged question Since McCain is presumably too principled to change his mind based on this poll it seems to be a participation device for the gullible Bottom line Curious George gets caught Reform Pat Buchanan When Buchanan switched parties he also switched his Web site and logo For a Reform candidate he s surprisingly upfront about his pro life plank though Cleaning Corruption Out of Government is more suitably his No 1 issue His new book which prompted critics to call him soft on Nazi Germany is proudly displayed on his home page so you can judge it for yourself but first you ll have to buy it The low tech site lets Pat s peasant army contribute join an e mail list and browse speeches press releases and policy statements Bottom line Peasants with PCs Donald J Trump The home page calls Trump the experienced decisive can do businessman America needs as President The How Can I Help Donald page claims you can convince Donald to run by giving him 25 or

Donald J Trump is the very definition of the American success story continually setting the standards of excellence He is the archetypal businessman a deal maker without peer Bottom Line Too autoerotic for underage viewing Libertarians Harry Browne When you enter the site a pot leaf signifying medical marijuana pops up on your screen If you click the link to join Browne s exploratory committee you get a form that begins Due to the complexity of FEC regulations we are unable to accept on line donations at this time If you click Join the Libertarian Party you re required to check a box affirming that you do not believe in or advocate the initiation of force as a means of achieving political or social goals just to make sure you re not Tim McVeigh Bottom line Wild Wild Web Unannounced Warren Beatty A pretty logo with literally nothing behind it Bottom line Inauspicious metaphor Criticism and Parody All Gore Clever parody site that captures Gore s ticks and shticks Headline on the Goretopia page Envisioning a post present future for the generations that will follow the children of our parent s generation The Socialized Medicine page exults New treatments are slowing the development of acne Gore also vows to give each child a talking Chihuahua and reduce class sizes to 0 Bottom line If only Gore had such a light touch Bore 2000 The graphics bear an uncanny and possibly actionable resemblance to Gore s official site but the content is weak All jokes all secondhand Includes a Bulletin Bored Bottom line Stiffer than its subject The Bush Watch A serious site light on graphics but heavy on content with links to dozens of articles scrutinizing Bush and several plugs for itself from major news organizations Calls itself a non advocacy site and claims to be the First George W Bush Site on the Web Bottom line Opposition research headquarters GWBush Excellent libertarian oriented anti drug war site Its theme is Hypocrisy with Bravado A stamp on the home page boasts DRUG FREE SINCE 1974 A mock press release has Bush promising to raise the age at which minors can be tried as adults to age 40 Best joke Every picture of Bush includes a digitally added white streak under his nose Bottom line Best parody site of the campaign
