 Russians in Space The Soviet Union put the first satellite in orbit Sputnik and the first man in space Yuri Gagarin The space race was once regarded as a metaphor for the Cold War and the Communists seemed to be winning Today the Russian space program is a joke symbolized by the space station Mir What happened Sputnik was launched on Oct 4 1957 the first man made object to orbit Earth Its eerie beep broadcast over U S radio signaled the Soviet Union s commanding lead in the space race Masterminded by Sergei Korolev the Soviet counterpart to the United States Wernher von Braun and unlike von Braun a native product Sputnik seemed to represent a system superior to capitalism and proved useful in wooing developing nations that had yet to choose sides in the Cold War Sen Lyndon Johnson declared Control of space means control of the world One month later Sputnik 2 carried Laika the dog in orbit for seven days Laika suffered the first death in space With no means yet of safe re entry she was put to sleep inside the floating capsule On Dec 6 1957 the first American attempt to put a satellite in orbit exploded on the launch pad It was instantly dubbed Flopnik Kaputnik and Stayputnik The first successful American launch came on Jan 31 1958 The Soviets with their Luna program 1959 achieved the first solar orbit the first impact on the moon and the first photographs of the moon from a lunar orbit which allowed them to map and triumphantly name geological features of the moon s far side Their next program the Vostok east series shocked the United States even more On April 12 1961 Vostok 1 launched the first human into space Yuri Gagarin s module was controlled from the ground engineers were unsure if he would function competently in weightlessness After 76 minutes of orbital flight the capsule began its descent Gagarin ejected as planned at 23 000 feet and parachuted to Earth The Soviet government did not reveal that Gagarin landed separately from the craft At Gagarin s post flight press conference the pioneering cosmonaut claimed While in outer space I was thinking about our party and our homeland Two days later President Kennedy met with advisers and asked Is there any place we can catch them Consensus held the Soviets were so far ahead that only a manned lunar landing could win the space race On May 25 1961 Kennedy addressed Congress and called for a moon landing by the end of the decade Three weeks before this announcement the United States had launched its first manned flight a 15 minute journey by Alan Shepard that didn t even reach orbit By 1963 when John Glenn orbited Earth three times in five hours the Soviet Union was launching daylong flights and a 48 orbit mission Valentina Tereshkova the first woman in space orbited Earth on June 16 1963 20 years before Sally Ride Tereshkova announced Warm greetings from space to the glorious Leninist Young Communist League that reared me In March 1965 a Soviet cosmonaut took the first spacewalk A U S spacewalk came that summer But the Soviet Union racked up a series of unmanned firsts between 1965 and 1968 the first impact on another planet Venus the first soft landing on the moon and the first orbit of the moon with a safe return The Soyuz union program beset by vastly inferior funding marked the end of Soviet space domination In 1969 Americans walked on the moon as the Soyuz suffered from malfunctioning launchers With Soyuz 10 in 1971 the Soviet Union announced a shift in its goals Introducing the Salyut 1 space station a salute to Gagarin the Soviets began a focus on long term orbital space living that endures today Soyuz 11 blew a hatch on re entry killing three cosmonauts but after this early catastrophe the Soviet program boasted constant space habitation and scientific experimentation for more than two decades The Soyuz craft ferried cosmonauts to a series of Salyut stations and once to a 1975 docking with Apollo 18 the first international space rendezvous The Soviet Union put the first man of African heritage in space in 1980 America s first black astronaut flew in 1983 The crew of Salyut 7 1982 set a duration record of 211 days in space a record since repeatedly broken by various cosmonauts In 1986 the core unit of Mir peace or world was launched As NASA reeled from the Challenger disaster the Soviet Union briefly enjoyed a return to its dominant reputation But as Mir floated in orbit the Soviet Union fell apart Russia took over the space program with massive expenditure cuts Mir s life span has been extended well past what it was designed for as Russia cannot afford a replacement Financial desperation has led Russia to endeavors shunned by NASA Russia s program places advertisements on its rockets and allows its cosmonauts to film commercials one for Israeli milk another for Pepsi in space for a fee In 1990 a Japanese television network paid 12 million to send a journalist to Mir for eight days as a ratings booster On June 25 this year a supply ship slammed into Mir Since then Mir s main oxygen system has failed repeatedly forcing its crew to burn chemical candles to survive its commander has developed heartbeat irregularities caused by stress and a cosmonaut has accidentally unplugged its main computer which is less powerful than the chip in some cellular phones Mir s crew was docked pay for its incompetence The main computer failed again Sept 8 but the replacement crew reported that the situation was normal
