 Meet John Doe As the forces of rebellion gathered momentum this spring in the Republic of Zaire commentators felt obliged to offer a thumb sucking retrospective on the country s embattled and dying president Mobutu Sese Seko who had held power for more than three decades All the commentaries at some point brought up the subject of the departing leader s full name Born Joseph D sir Mobutu in 1930 he changed his name after consolidating his dictatorship to Mobutu Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu wa za Banga In Mobutu s native Lingala language according to one group of press reports the name means the all powerful warrior who because of his endurance and inflexible will to win will go from conquest to conquest leaving fire in his wake An alternative translation according to a second group of reports is the cock whose prowess leaves no hen untouched In an age when national power inheres less and less frequently or at any rate less and less legitimately in the hands of an all powerful individual the adoption of a symbolic personal name by way of an aggrandizing personal epithet has sadly fallen out of favor Among world leaders today the few practitioners of this form of personal rule include Syria s Hafez al Assad Assad means lion in Arabic and Turkmenistan s Turkmenbashi father of the Turkmens the form of address favored by President Saparmurat Niyazov the landlocked republic s op ra bouffe strongman who has commissioned a stunted replica of the Eiffel Tower with a revolving statue of himself on top for the center of his capital city Ashkhabad Most of the world s remaining monarchs possess a number of colorful inherited titles Defender of the Faith in Great Britain Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques in Saudi Arabia but these are functional designations and little more than quaint vestigial appendages like a whale s arms There is certainly no contemporary leader with an adopted name as coldly presumptuous as Stalin meaning man of steel an epithet adopted when Josef Dzhugashvili was still more than a decade away from power much less one comparable with Richard the Lionhearted or Vlad the Impaler The one place where adopted names retain an organic vitality is in occupations where professionals can still claim some prestige based on a perception of personal exploits or exotic capabilities such as organized crime Gregory The Grim Reaper Scarpa Anthony Gas Pipe Casso and pornographic entertainment Lisa Lipps Sandra Scream to name two of the more serene As decision making has devolved from the autocrat to the ordinary citizen it is the ordinary citizen the anonymous Everyman an embodiment of rights and responsibilities shared by all whose name is increasingly invoked There are a number of generic possibilities A 1992 New Yorker cartoon showed one campaign worker talking to another in an office near the Capitol and bore a caption that read So what you re saying is that Joe Sixpack and Joe Blow are one and the same person Yes and he may also be John Q Public Joe Zilch the Common Man and the Unknown Citizen invoked by W H Auden in his poem of that name The epitaph on the monument to this Citizen reads in part The Press are convinced that he bought a paper every day And that his reactions to advertisements were normal in every way Policies taken out in his name prove that he was fully insured And his Health card shows he was once in hospital but left cured John Joe and the others are probably also related to the people whose names are found on the credit cards and driver s licenses displayed in advertisements and I assume they all know the mysterious M Marts whose name appears on dunning letters from American Express above a signature that looks like it was drawn on an Etch a Sketch The most venerable among the common names in the English speaking world for an ordinary male citizen or indefinitely for any male person is John Doe and for his female counterpart Jane Roe Both names along with the no longer common John a nokes and John a stiles derive from legal custom dating back almost to medieval times in cases where suit needed for arcane reasons to be filed against a legally fictitious person They served precisely the same function that the names Gaius Titius and Seius did in ancient Rome John Doe Jane Roe and a handful of similar variants are used today to shield the identity of an actual person whose identity is known as in the famous abortion case Roe vs Wade or to indicate as in a so called John Doe summons an actual person whose identity is not yet known Law enforcement officials investigating the Oklahoma City bombing spent months looking for a suspect who within hours of the crime was given the designation John Doe No 2 eventually tracking the man down and also establishing his innocence The lawyers for Timothy McVeigh who was designated John Doe No 1 argued that the bombing was actually the work of a broader conspiracy The chief defense attorney Stephen Jones stated We certainly will contend that there is a John Doe 2 and maybe 3 4 and 5 Such a plurality of Does is typically cause to invoke the variant forms The Supreme Court this month will hand down a decision regarding a pair of cases from Washington state and New York involving the legality of assisted suicide The individual plaintiffs in the Washington case were listed in the appeals court opinion as Jane Roe John Doe James Poe Harold Glucksberg M D Glucksberg of course is not some ambitious new departure in the field of generic fictitious names and there will not soon be a movie called Meet Harold Glucksberg Glucksberg is just the real name of a doctor involved in the case New words for Everywoman and Everyman are proliferating albeit with a qualitative difference Whereas Jane Roe and John Doe at least give a nod to status based on the fact of mere personhood the new terminology seems to confer status on the basis of some salient generic attribute consider occupant head of household user the consumer This has come about owing to the continuing merger of demographic science and marketing and the tendency is probably not reversible All the more reason perhaps to insist on a little more bravura individuality on the part of our world leaders One could stop well short of anything as elaborate as the Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie s old tag line King of Kings Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah or the array of distinctions paraded by the young ruler in Evelyn Waugh s Black Mischief a proclamation begins We Seth Emperor of Azania Lord of Wanda Bachelor of the Arts of Oxford University and yet still provide an evocative garnish One possibility might be to allow sitting American presidents for example to add the name of at least one former president or other historic American to their official names One can easily see though how in some hands this could lead to pandering the nominal analogue of ticket balancing I William Jefferson Roosevelt Kennedy Patton Rosa Parks Harvey Milk Sitting Bull Clinton do solemnly swear A more promising direction is simply to require American leaders to absorb their Secret Service code names into their proper names The Secret Service perhaps owing to the quotidian proximity that the role affords has demonstrated a proven knack for understated aptness in its selections Ronald Rawhide Reagan Dan Scorecard Quayle Edward Sunburn Kennedy Jimmy Deacon Carter Bob Patriot Dole Should an unelected tribunal be entrusted with such power That is a question for the political philosophers For myself I d be willing to let the creators of Roger Headache Clinton at least give it a try
