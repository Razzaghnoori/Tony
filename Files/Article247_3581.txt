 Chattermailbox FDR and Rock n Roll Walter S Mossberg who writes the Personal Technology column for the Wall Street Journal but whose true expertise lies in the field of music when Chatterbox worked at the Journal s Washington bureau he was the only person there who knew all the words to Woody Guthrie s Union Maid takes exception to this column s assertion that baby boomers were not the first large mainstream audience to embrace rock n roll which previously of course had been embraced by blacks In an e mail Mossberg writes I agree that it s absurd to make some sharp delineation between generations in the late 1950s and early 60s Clearly there were boomers who didn t get rock music and some members of the prior generation of teens who did get it Early rock co existed with pallid pop music Nothing was as clear cut about those days as it seems from today s perspective But let me tell you why I think you may have been too dismissive when you wrote Were the consumers who turned Rock Around the Clock and Heartbreak Hotel into hit records 9 and 10 years old Of course they weren t They were teen agers who d been born during and shortly before World War II As a second year boomer March 1947 about six months younger than Clinton I can testify that between the ages of 9 and 13 we were very musically adept in my whitebread spanking new suburban neighborhood in R I And we had allowances and we bought rock records It was during those years in the late 50s in fact and not the 60s that many of us older boomers were first turned on to rock began following the artists and defying parental wishes began listening clandestinely to the handful of DJs who played rock n roll And believe me if a city had one such DJ that was a lot It was during the fifth sixth and seventh grades for me not high school that I began to buy 45s and listen to people like Elvis Little Richard and Duane Eddy Now we didn t go to any Bill Haley concerts and older teens with more money and freedom probably did play a big role in all of that But there were significant differences between most people in these two generations Unlike our predecessors I knew of nobody in my group in the late 50s who had ever listened to or liked people like Frank Sinatra or Perry Como That was our parents music we thought The prior generation of teens thought folk music was the clean cut Kingston Trio by the early 60s we were into Peter Paul and Mary and through them Dylan When I marched on the Pentagon PP M were singing away on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial They tended to like Pat Boone s covers of Little Richard We liked the real thing Remember that most early rock n roll artists including Haley and shockingly Elvis had repertoires that included lots of swing type music or syrupy ballads or pop tunes which made them transitional artists able to appeal to both generations Early rock was crossover music that allowed the older teens to support it until the transition stopped and it got too loud and unruly for many of them By then it was the 60s and we boomers were the teens So it all worked out A terrific account of all of this though not of the demographics per se is in the new book Flowers in the Dustbin by James Miller He does a great job chronicling the early proto rock among other things Chatterbox is intrigued but not surprised to learn that his friend Mossberg was a rockin and a rollin from the age of 9 Indeed Chatterbox finds it impossible to picture the 9 year old Mossberg as anything other than a precocious know it all The question is how many other 9 year olds exempting the other kids in Mossberg s whitebread suburban neighborhood who no doubt fell under his influence were buying rock n roll records Surely not many But Chatterbox concedes he may be wrong about this and invites others in Mossberg s age cohort 52 53 to submit testimonials on this question to the Fray to do so click below
