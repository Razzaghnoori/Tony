 God Bless Monica Lewinsky God Bless Monica Lewinsky Slate had more than 270 000 individual visitors in January These are people or at least browsers who visited slate com at least once during the month As we have explained in the past we regard individual visitors or technically unique browsers as the best measure of Web readership It is not perfect It treats a single brief drop in and a dedicated daily visitor exactly the same when counting for technical reasons some visitors don t get counted and it doesn t include the 25 000 who get Slate by e mail or the thousands more who are e mailed Today s Papers every day But the other common measurements pages served or hits are even more defective Just for the record though in December we reported serving 140 000 pages a day That is now up to about 200 000 These numbers have risen dramatically in the past few months and especially in the past few weeks How to explain it We like to think of course that it is due to loyal Slate readers spreading the word about our splendid editorial product We also would like to and do credit our recent alliances with America Online the Microsoft Network Hotmail and the Motley Fool But it just might be that recent developments in Washington have had something to do with it too Like all responsible media outlets Slate deplores the deplorable situation that forces us to discuss deplorable matters such as alleged fellatio in the White House rather than global warming or the strategic balance in the Persian Gulf We deplore the tawdry chain of events itself whether the deplorable scenario should turn out to be a president misbehaving and lying about it under oath or the government brought to a halt by the fevered imaginings of an overexcitable young woman Whatever happened exactly it is deplorable And we deplore it That said we can t help acknowledging that whether or not Monica Lewinsky serviced the president she certainly has serviced us Not just us but CNN the New York Times Leno and Letterman and every other outlet of news analysis and commentary in every medium She also has serviced the president s political opponents all of whom of course deplore the situation as much as we in the media deplore it For that matter the general public though generally disgusted whether by the alleged activity or the process that made it a public issue or both has also gained considerable pleasure and excitement from this admittedly deplorable episode Let us all therefore take a brief moment off from all this deploring to say Thank you Monica Thank you thank you thank you And if there s anything we at Slate in particular can ever do some software perhaps We now return to our regularly scheduled deploring This site works best using Internet Deplorer TM True Story So a guy from CNN a guy from a defense contractor and a guy from an oil company are talking at a Washington reception It s around 1993 Someone asks the CNN guy How are the ratings these days CNN guy hint now at Slate Not so good We could use another war Defense contractor So could we Oil guy So could we as long as it s in the Middle East Moral Oral sex saves lives We don t need a war to give the media a boost after all Monica thank you again What it all does for the oil and defense industries is less clear Readme Special The next Readme column will be available two days early on Wednesday Feb 18 It will contain the details of our plan to begin charging for access to Slate and a special offer for early sign ups Michael Kinsley
