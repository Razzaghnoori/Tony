administrative authority and the lawyers behind the move say it was inspired by Spain s attempts to try former Chilean dictator Gen Augusto Pinochet The Suharto case has better legal standing the

Hun Sen promised the United Nations that he would help apprehend Khmer Rouge leaders and bring them before an international tribunal for crimes against humanity Can Mr Hun Sen now justifiably refuse to hand them over to an international tribunal particularly at a time when war criminals from the former Yugoslavia have been indicted and former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet is under siege
