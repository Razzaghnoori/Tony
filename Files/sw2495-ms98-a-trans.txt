 so what is your latest experience with painting well i don t i haven t done any painting since i was a child and my father would be painting and i d ask him if i could you know take a turn or something but uh when we bought our home it was recently uh huh updated they did that maybe improvements so they could sell it and things so we didn t have to do any painting right and the condominium we moved in before my husband went over and painted but i the experience that i ve had is that um whatever time he gave said oh it would take me about just about four hours because it was only about like eleven or twelve hundred square feet over there and he said oh it s going to be just about four hours well he was gone the whole day and he said well all i got done was the taping around isn t that amazing it it looks so easy just slapping paint on i had an addition put on uh huh and um we and i decided because my inner room looked so dingy because i put these beautiful French doors in uh huh and so i decided okay i ll just you know have them paint this little room you know a little ten by ten dining area it took four days uh huh and even the painter couldn t give me a good estimate he said well i ll be done this afternoon you know uh huh and pretty soon before you know it you know he s run into so many problems and it s just there s nothing there to be a problem i thought but um it just took him so much longer and uh huh and he was there to paint the French doors also um and if you ve ever painted French doors which my husband just finally said he wasn t going to do because it looked so formidable um then then just yeah we we got this painter and i just called him because i got a little ad out of the you know the adcose or whatever in the mail and uh you know just got this painter person over here and he said yeah i can finish it in a day oh right so the whole project basically took a week oh i know it s just awful funny and i go what makes you a professional you know how much you know more do you know than i know about this whole situation but he just kept painting on those French doors you know and each little um paint stroke you know the paint wasn t going on right is what it was pane uh huh so he had to redo them like three times before i was happy with them before he was happy you know that they even looked halfway decent and um so it s just been painting yeah i mean hire a professional but that doesn t guarantee anything no and it really like you said always takes way longer than anyone um is able to guess because i know my husband he he painted when he it was just the preparation time was so long that when he actually got down to the painting part right he it was like ten times longer than he already thought he would be done and and uh he did part of the in the at night because we were trying to hurry up and get it ready so we could move in and um and he didn t notice until the next morning that the shades of paint between the two paint cans he had finished one can off and started another one oh no and then when we went in there you know one was blue they were white but one had more blue to it oh and that can make a difference too i mean uh huh and they bring the uh you know little samples and you ve got like maybe five hundred well that s an exaggeration uh huh but there are just so many tints upon tints upon tints and you don t know what you to want to put up there and by the time it s on i i selected a what i thought was white and it was like you said you know it was blue blue cast to it and it looked awful on uh huh uh huh so that was the next problem he had to redo that too i yeah this was a and it was a major project getting the money together to do it too by the end of the whole project but right you know we worked something out because he was kind of apologetic that it took so long he really came over here to paint i think because he kept offering to paint the outside of my house i don t think he did the interiors very well oh boy and yeah well i don t recall my parents having that much trouble with their s i mean you know they painted our rooms all the time and we had a a wooden we hardly we just had brick on like as accent no uh huh on a certain area of our home growing up and so he had to paint the outside all the time and um i just don t think you know that there was that big problem it wasn t a big deal for them i don t know no but to us you know we re going oh we re so glad we have a brick home all we have is like trim around the windows or something and i think my husband s really glad about that no uh no painting to have to do i i don t know that we for sure like uh say we re freshly graduated from school and things so we haven t gotten to the point where we re hiring professionals to do too much of our needs do you you just you just get in there and do it yourself we ve been trying to you know we ve done that the whole time we were in school like trying to repair our own cars and things and yeah uh huh yeah so i i want to get to the point where i could feel like i could just hire someone well it s it s not that easy it s like it s uh i don t even know if i you know i would not even recommend this person again to anybody i don t know uh huh a i guess you get i i don t know if you get into the mind set where you just say well i ll accept something or you just really have to get on their back i mean about things and and working with what they say are professional painters i mean uh huh i tell you what the fumes that the the paint gives off makes you wonder what these people do anyway that s true i mean the fumes are amazing and i i don t think i could stay sane you know and no working with all that so i mean i know it s not lead based any more paints but my goodness but still it s harmful and they have to live with that every day i well yeah i think so in in their clothes and everything oh it does the only painting job that was really painless for us was in this condominium that the um association that manages it they have to take care of like the structural damage there was a roof leak and that was not something that we had to pay for so they sent their painters in to to repaint a corner of the ceiling and then you know repaint the whole ceiling in a certain room but they came in and um oh yeah they came in and did it and left in just no time at all and i think it s because they you know they were accustomed to working in that environment in those particular condominiums and i don t i didn t watch them but i couldn t imagine that they came in and painted it the whole ceiling you know just within a couple of hours ri ght and uh well maybe there are some professionals out there it makes you wonder uh huh really it does uh for all that well um i hope you have a nice day today um well you too i guess it s getting getting to be lunch time i need to go take care of the kids but you have a good day and you take care okay okay bye Kay bye
