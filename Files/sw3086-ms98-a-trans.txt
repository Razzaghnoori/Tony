        so do you have PC     i have a personal computer at home its an AT compatible   huhuh   i dont use it very much any more i used to use it quite a bit   uhhuh   i also have a PC at work that i use as a terminal i do some PC stand alone work on it and i can transfer data back and forth between the PC and the main frame   uhhuh   what about you do you own a computer   um well i sort of own a computer we have two PCs at home but neither one do we really own um both are no both of them are sort of work related and   are you leasing them loners loaners from work   yeah  thats the nicer way right of   do you work for TI   no no um i actually im doing consulting right now because i just had a baby and my husbands working at Bell Labs but hes really from France and these computers actually are from France   what brand are they   one of thems a Compaq   umhum   its a three eighty six   im jealous   and the other is actually a IBM PC compatible its a three eighty six guess its twenty five yeah three eight six twenty five C maybe i dont know no we dont have the cash thats right we decided not to get the cash which is actually another loaner one too that weve picked up for a consulting job that my husband was doing  and   what kind of consulting do you do   um well i actually do some work working at MIT and at NIST National Institute of Standards and Technology   uhhuh   in Washington and then i worked for Dragon Systems for a while   what kind of work do you do when youre consulting   um well it depends its very different in the different places but   is it programming related   yeah yeah program related research related ive i work in speech the speech field and i i do a lot about acoustics phonetics and   uhhuh   looking at the uh acoustic characteristics of speech and so i do that type of stuff typically for other people and we use uh here we use the PCs to do that and mostly i use it for writing papers and things like that   word processing   well more uh do you know Latek   no im not familiar with it   word text word text processing so i dont i dont use  i mean you can call it word processing but i dont usually use a word processor to do it   umhum   and we dont have too much standard software like i havent bought we havent really bought any commercially available software at all so we dont use it for things like our accounts and addresses and things like that we use it more for just writing programs when we need to or um doing research looking at the speech signal and then doing writing and also as a just as a terminal and we connect to other computers to read our net mail and things like that   so youve got youve got a modem in it then   uh neither one has a modem but we have a modem   at home you have a modem that you can connect to each of them   neither one right   uh and so its an external modem i got when i got mine i had an internal modem in it i used it uh quite a bit when i was um   yeah we have uhhuh   uh looking at uh information on a large bulletin board sponsored by a newspaper in a in Fort Worth but uh went out of town for a while and and sort of got off the uh uh bulletin board and of my micro completely   umhum uhhuh   and after a while the modem started making noises on its own without uh even without using it on the computer i could turn a computer on itd start squawking so i finally opened up the box and took it out     so that was it   i think thats the thirty second warning   oh i didnt hear it do you hear the the beep in the background   yes   oh thats a an ambulance or something going on here i think   okay where   i havent ever noticed the thirty second warning actually   where are you and uh   in Manhattan   are you at home now so youve got a lot of traffic noise real close   yeah im at home uhhuh so itd be interesting for the people that look at this signal i mean because theres a lot of background noise that you know people can hear so itll be interesting how much of it actually gets picked up um yeah and often times that i cant talk on the cant do this much later than now between sort of like six five thirty and six thirty or something like that because the traffic outside they honk the horn so loud i cant even hear the phone conversation   what time is it now where you are   uh about twenty after four   so youre an hour ahead of where i am im in Central Central time zone   okay yeah were Eastern and um what did did you ever try using like Prodigy or any of those systems   no i havent done that uh i know someone who has and and shes uh very uh pleased with it she told me some of the things you can do and its just a a very uh handy tool to have   uhhuh   yeah and and you can do a lot it it makes things very convenient you can save a lot of money too certainly cut down on long distance charges if you if thats what you have in mind   uhhuh yeah ive never tried using that i dont know too much about it what about have you did you use commercially available software or   i have uh i have used Lotus i have used uh Word Perfect uh i not heavy use ive used uh D Base and uh ive used a substantial amount of shareware   uhhuh   um i havent done much Lotus work connected with my job ive been through three classes and i have a great deal of respect for it   uhhuh uhhuh   um i havent done much word processing work with my job i do some and i and the D Base work ive done was strictly class related     umhum ive never used D Base  um but ive heard both good things and bad things about it   well its probably the granddaddy of most uh data base management systems there its got some pretty uh strong competitors some of them have reviews that are better than D Base so i uh i uh i think uh by now its a matter of uh personal taste   uhhuh yeah people told me that it was sort of cumbersome to use   i can understand that very easily ive used uh ive had a class on um R Base and also in Paradox and both of those seem very easy to use compared to D Base   uhhuh uhhuh do you think you D Base is more flexible or allows you to do more or do you think the others are pretty much compatible these days   um  i wouldnt say compatible but there certainly comparable   well i dont i yeah i didnt mean compatible i meant comparable my brain is going to mush   um   and what do you work on at TI   im a computer programmer on the IBM main frames  i do uh main mainly business data processing   umhum uhhuh uhhuh   i also handle production support for the systems in my area of responsibility   uhhuh okay   um sometimes i get called late at night at home because theres a production problem and that gives me the opportunity to come in to work and fix it if i cant think of some thing to tell the trouble shooter while were on the phone     right   um   fun   i also uh handle most of the calls from our users and other programmers who need to find out something were connected
