                so do you keep a family budget   well not a real strict one but we do work hard at saving for the future and do that primarily through uh payroll reduction at my employment   thats a good way to do it what what we usually do my wife and i fortunately she likes to keep the numbers and i i dont um   uhhuh   so what what happens is uh i make the money and she spends it but she spends it carefully and then at the end of the month she just tallies it up and uh       we have basically categories spend this much in this area this much in that area and uh although i dont keep that in mind as we spend we do um kind of get to the end of the month and see how we did   uhhuh   and uh you know at the beginning of the month too we also take out some some savings and put them aside so we we know we dont have that to spend that appears to work pretty well   i actually use a computer to keep track of our family uh expenses i enter all the all the checks that we write and most of the cash that we spend and all the credit card transactions into a computer program that and keeps track of where all of our expenses go and every few months i look at that to get an overall idea of of uh how our expenses compare to my income and make sure that were not getting a beyond uh what we should be spending in any particular area and try and figure out for the for the year whether were going to be able to to cover the unusual expenses such as property taxes and others things that come up from time to time   umhum do you have a uh specialized program or do you or do you just use something like a spreadsheet   uh its a specialized personal finance program        and it seems to seems to work real well   weve got uh a couple of those but uh ive been trying to get get my wife sold on a spreadsheet   uhhuh   and have her uh doing it that way and she prefers still just to do it by hand um   huh   she says as long as shes dealing with the numbers and its just adding them up and then subtracting from the the target totals she says its just as quick to do that way as to to uh enter it on the computer and have it check the arithmetic   yeah i think i think generally people do find that that probably is just as quick to keep by hand the only question is whether whether the additional reports and the uh   so   you know the the nice record keeping that it gives you is worth a little bit of extra time   well thats kind of the way i feel and uh i use spreadsheets a lot and a lot more than she does so i feel like shes you know if if she did do it for a couple months shed probably like it but she was just that   right right do you have any uh any particular ways that that feeds into your longterm uh savings or retirement plan   um our as far as our family budget goes yeah what we do is we kind of know what what were making and weve been doing keeping track long enough that we know what we need to spend and pretty much all the difference   yeah   goes uh well it goes into two or three different places what have what we call an education account where we put aside some money for each of our children every month   uhhuh right   with the desperate fear that by the time they are old enough to use it its not going to be enough anyway     have have you right   and uh then we have kind of just a savings account and and right now all weve been doing is taking that and and putting it away in a money market account we havent been investing or anything like that uh   huh   yet we just moved last year into a home just last week bought a car and so we have some kind of substantial other commitments to take care of right now but     makes it difficult yeah   we uh you know we even with all that were still able to put some aside   yeah   how about you   well i contribute as much as i can to our four O one K plan at work and we also have a a uh company stock purchase plan which i contribute to and between those two thats thats pretty much all that were able to save but fortunately those are fairly substantial and i feel like thats at this point the uh the the most important part of our longterm uh savings plans and then hoping the hoping if i get a few raises that ill  be able to get beyond that but right now thats all im able to save   well its its nice to have something you know people say that if youre if youre not saving money youre spending more than you earn and uh thats probably the case   uhhuh right   you know you never can live down to the last dime so youre either coming out ahead or coming out behind   right        i know were just getting started on our family so
