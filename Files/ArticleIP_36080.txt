 P Is the quot Sensation quot Art Worth the Fuss P Click here to view the entire Sensation show online Hey are you the same Deborah Solomon I thought you were The author of sensitive biographies of Jackson Pollock and Joseph Cornell And you say Sarah Lucas is major Margaret Thatcher whom I quote with trepidation following your comments on the unappeased longings of conservatives once observed that there was no female equivalent of the masculine word puerile Puerile is surely the only word for Lucas Her gendered mattress is the kind of garbage an immature college student would turn out the night before an exam in a desperate bid to seem iconoclastic and relevant It is a squalid irrelevance even in the context of Sensation but major would put her in bed with the leading artists of our time e g Lucian Freud now he knows what to do with a mattress And the idea that an oblique hardly probable cross reference to Rauschenberg s quilts helps Lucas on the path to greatness is risible the jury is still out on Rauschenberg anyway More likely with an artist of Lucas intellect and attention span is that her work is a mock homage to the cast mattresses of Rachel Whiteread as her chum Tracy Emin s resin cast urinals exhibited in New York earlier this year are a mock homage to Whiteread via Duchamp In vaunting two of the nastiest and silliest exhibits in Sensation you have a soft spot for Mat Collishaw s bullet hole because it reminds you of some other orifice you say you expose a disturbing infatuation with literalness that precious real life you tell me you want in art It is this quality or lack of quality of simply transplanting the real and making it into shocking art which is in my opinion the bane of contemporary art today nowhere more painfully than at the Brooklyn Museum By this stage in art history we can surely draw a line under appropriation Some genuine artists earlier in the century did inspired things with the found object and unleashed extraordinary images but the spurious alchemy of lifting things unmediated from the common culture and plonking them down in the art gallery is truly exhausted now that it has become the academic norm It rests on a contradiction It demystifies skill and imagination and yet relies on artists having privileged elective powers Your cravings for real life and youthful exuberance lead you to exactly the same folly as the popular press You focus on the sensationalist at the expense of the subtle and reflective Vastly more provocative and unsettling in my opinion than the ludicrous Lucas is Jane Simpson s Sacred a vanity chest that is colored like skin or is it smudged lipstick and oozes dry ice and is almost anthropomorphic in its voluptuous erogenous curves It doesn t jump at one s throat with an obvious sexual political meaning but evokes genuine enriching ambiguity It is an old fashioned sculpture in respect of its interplay of forms of the way all the elements feel like they have been thought through in relation to the pervasive mood of the finished work These elements surface shape color associations add up to something substantial a variety of sensations rather than merely a sensation This is what I think art should do Anyone else who thinks the same way come join me in the closet David
