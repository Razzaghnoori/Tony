 Warren Beatty Since Arianna Huffington floated the idea of a Warren Beatty presidential campaign last week the actor s ambitions have been the summer s most delectable political story The jokes abound what Warren would do on the Oval Office carpet whom President Beatty would hire as his intern etc The 62 year old Beatty has stayed virtually silent but his friends are encouraging speculation Warren has been consulting with Democratic and Reform Party activists they say Warren is taking this very seriously Click for Jacob Weisberg s revelation that Jesse Ventura may be courting Beatty for the Reform Party nomination Wife Annette Bening they report is enthusiastic The right thinks Beatty is a ridiculous preening glory hound who would preach limousine liberal ideas The left thinks he can illuminate a grand populist vision with pure charisma Both sides mistakenly assume that because Beatty is an actor he like Ronald Reagan could flatter seduce and inspire voters He charmed the panties off Natalie Wood Madonna Faye Dunaway Julie Christie Isabelle Adjani Diane Keaton et al Surely he could charm the pants off a few million disaffected Democrats And even if the only people who vote for Beatty are women who slept with him he could make a strong showing in the California primary But Beatty has always been in the words of film critic David Thomson a very uneasy actor Beatty is too cool and distant to be great on screen He has made his mark on Hollywood more as a producer and director and it is this that explains his political ambition The media snicker at the actor politician who presumes to speak on the day s great issues But consider Beatty as a self made businessman Beatty sympathizers such as Huffington rightly ask why Steve Forbes who inherited his millions is a serious candidate while Beatty is a joke Beatty has shown a ruthless brilliant talent for manipulating the politics of his industry In Hollywood where no one gets his way all the time Warren Beatty has got his way forever In Easy Riders Raging Bulls Peter Biskind chronicles how Beatty parlayed the heartthrob status he d won from 1961 s Splendor in the Grass into a controlling position as a producer He almost single handedly brought Bonnie and Clyde to the screen in 1967 and made his fortune off it by negotiating a contract for 40 percent of the gross In the 70s he bullied screenwriters and directors into making Shampoo and Heaven Can Wait his way In 1981 during the height of the Cold War he persuaded Gulf Western to pony up 25 million for Reds a movie sympathetic to communism A few years later he got Columbia to spend the then preposterous figure of 40 million on Ishtar It flopped but Beatty walked away unscathed Most recently he compelled Rupert Murdoch s 20 th Century Fox to put up 35 million for Bulworth and to give him absolute creative control over the film even though 1 it was a political movie and hence a lousy investment and 2 it propounded ideas Murdoch detests There are endless stories about how Beatty charmed or threatened or kneecapped this director or that executive into doing what he wanted Beatty brought those same skills to his second career as an activist Ron Brownstein who chronicled Beatty s politicking in The Power and the Glitter notes that Beatty may be the only star in Hollywood history who preferred to participate in politics from behind the scenes Beatty doesn t need the ego gratification of public politics He has been famous his entire adult life In 1972 Beatty gave speeches on George McGovern s behalf but he disliked the high profile role He was an awkward embarrassed speaker He understood why the public is skeptical of a guy who makes 10 million a year talking about the class struggle Brownstein says But Beatty excels at the backroom nitty gritty In 1972 he aided McGovern most by organizing fund raisers even persuading Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel to reunite for a McGovern benefit If that isn t great politics nothing is When he advised Gary Hart in 1984 and 1988 Beatty remained in the shadows planning media and campaign strategies Political pros in that campaign thought he was a positive force Brownstein says Of the few public statements Beatty has made about his potential campaign the most revealing is this There has to be someone better than me This is not modesty Beatty has no modesty It is his cool and honest pragmatism He recognizes that he d be a better operator than candidate Though he s supposed to be a liberal icon Beatty lacks the crystallizing vision of a Reagan His politics are a muddle It s not happenstance that he is backed by such an odd assortment of people ranging from Republican populist Huffington to earnest liberal Bill Moyers Beatty is not cynical He desperately believes the political system is broken and needs fixing He just seems unable to explain how it s broken and how it should be fixed In interviews Beatty repeatedly chokes when asked for specific political ideas He seems vaguely to believe that there is too much money in politics corporations are too powerful welfare reform was wrong and race is a big problem He says he wants to conjure up the spirit of Robert F Kennedy and 1968 Bulworth the closest thing to a Beatty political platform is a mess as political science an incoherent condescending slop about the evils of lobbyists and the innate decency of black folk Bulworth is fabulous on day to day campaign tactics This is Beatty s curse His political principles tell him to deplore gamesmanship but gamesmanship may be what he understands best Similarly Beatty spends a lot of time savaging Washington corruption yet he cultivates friendships with folks such as Henry Kissinger Larry King and John McLaughlin Washington incarnate Beatty is meticulous even anal As an actor he is famous for demanding take after take till he s sure it s right Click to see how his general caution contrasts with his brazen womanizing Movie stars can control their images Beatty can forbid interviews decline to answer questions and refuse to appear in public He didn t speak to reporters from the late 70s till the early 90s But politicians must answer questions take abuse and keep smiling The first thing candidate Beatty would have to learn says Huffington is to get comfortable with ridicule It s not clear that Beatty is willing to do that He s too cautious After all he twice declined opportunities to run for office in the 70s when he was a much more credible candidate than he is now According to Brownstein Beatty led the polls in the 1974 race to succeed Reagan as California governor but refused to run And in 1976 Beatty resisted pleas to make a late primary challenge to Jimmy Carter Beatty s flirtation with the presidential campaign may be a canny political tactic He doesn t really want to run but perhaps he can use the threat of a candidacy to make himself a behind the scenes player the guy who delivers the left to Al Gore or Bill Bradley In the early 60s Beatty turned down the opportunity to play John F Kennedy in a movie then became a producer This year Beatty may turn down the opportunity to play Robert F Kennedy in a campaign then become a power broker
