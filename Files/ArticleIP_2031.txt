 Putting on Heirs Metaphors like magic tricks may dazzle through deceit Take for example the recurring metaphor of society as an extended family a particular favorite among those who aspire to be the head of the household The accompanying patter goes like this Families do not allow one member to prosper while another struggles ergo we need something like a bigger welfare system or a more progressive tax code Note the rhetorical sleight of hand While you were still pondering whether society is really like a family I slipped in the wholly invented fact that families take from the rich and give to the poor The truth at least as it is revealed by last wills and testaments is otherwise Apparently among the children even when some children are much wealthier than others A bequest is a final opportunity to redistribute income among those you love the most if most parents reject that opportunity then it s pretty hard to see anything familial in using the tax system to redistribute income among strangers But bequests aren t the only economic transactions within families Does the family function as a welfare state in other ways What about schooling Let s think about that Who would you rather send to college your smart kid who can make the most of an education or your dumb kid who needs all the help he can get The answer even if you have an egalitarian impulse to pour resources into the dumb kid is to send the smart kid to college and make it up to the dumb kid through bequests or other cash gifts That strategy maximizes total family income which allows you to do more good for both your children So even if parents really wanted to equalize their children s incomes they If not schooling then what about time and attention At least in large families the big winners in the time and attention sweepstakes are the firstborns and the lastborns those who get to spend a few years as an only child The middle siblings perform significantly worse on sixth grade This suggests that time and attention are valuable in much the same way that schooling is and that they are therefore equally unsuitable as a medium for redistribution So the general rule is that if people wanted to redistribute among offspring they d do it through bequests An exception might be poor families where bequests are insubstantial In those circumstances lavishing the less skilled children with schooling time and attention might be the only way to transfer income in their direction This exception incidentally could explain why programs like Head Start are disappointingly ineffective When little Johnny is accepted into the Head Start program his parents compensate Johnny s brothers and sisters by spending more time with them and less with Johnny There s a nice irony here By and large the folks who want to argue that most people are instinctively redistributionist are the same folks who want to argue for the efficacy of programs like Head Start But the stronger the redistributionist instincts of Johnny s parents the less he ll gain from the Head Start program Returning to the general rule the best way to redistribute income is through bequests But parents don t use bequests to redistribute income We are entitled to conclude that parents don t consider redistributing income to be terribly important That leads to a natural follow up question What do parents consider terribly important How do they decide what to leave to whom I like the theory that parents believe there is something intrinsically fair about giving equal amounts to everyone But to test that theory we d need to know more about the distribution of parental gifts like schooling time and attention during the parents lifetime I don t know whether my pet theory would survive that test An alternative theory is that a bequest is a mistake According to this theory parents would prefer to spend everything they ve got before they go The only reason there s anything left over is that death arrives unexpectedly But if this alternative were correct we d see old people using all their savings to purchase annuities that pay them a guaranteed income for life The limited market for such annuities suggests that people prefer to leave something behind Yet another theory is that parents are governed by a strategic bequest motive using their estates to purchase attention from their grown children The threat of disinheritance keeps those children in line when the threat is effective nobody is actually disinherited If this theory were true you d expect parents with a lot of bequeathable wealth stocks bonds etc to get far more visits from their children than parents with an equal amount of nonbequeathable wealth such as pensions That prediction and found accurate which is one good reason to believe the theory Parallel to the strategic bequest motive we can hypothesize a strategic gift motive that operates while the parents are still alive Those children who are struggling and hence more likely to burden their parents say by returning to live with them get extra help in the hope that they the children will become self sufficient As a variation on this theme one can imagine a strategic schooling motive whereby the least accomplished children get extra schooling in the hope that they will become more interesting to converse with At bequest time the strategic gift motive would evaporate and the favored child would be favored no longer Bequest motives interact with economic policy in surprising ways The effects of a deficit financed tax cut can depend on whether most parents are altruistic or strategic Altruistic parents would save the money from their tax cuts and leave it to the children who must pay off all that government debt someday that saving would hold interest rates down Strategic parents might spend a large portion of their tax cuts causing interest rates to rise It s that interaction with fiscal policy that has drawn economists attention to bequest motives in recent years But a deeper reason for investigating bequests is that they reveal something about people s instinctive sense of justice That instinctive sense is the best guide we have to economic policy in every sphere
