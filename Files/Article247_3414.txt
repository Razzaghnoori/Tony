 Take Those Old Records Off the Shelf Dear Chris Here we are on the 22nd anniversary of Elvis Presley s death debating rock n roll or at least James Miller s version of it Miller brings a deep intellectual understanding of what certain major acts have contributed to rock n roll but short shrifts others I admire Miller s erudition but I found his book dull Miller first heard rock in 1956 as a teen ager won early renown as a rock critic in the late 1960s with Rolling Stone and was rock critic for Newsweek in the 1980s He tells the history of rock anecdotally through a few dozen isolated vignettes and conventionally Here s how it goes Rhythm n blues the music of the black South and other manifestations of the black sound like urban doo wop came to the attention of whites like the record mogul Ahmet Ertegun in Washington the songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller who wrote Hound Dog and Kansas City in Los Angeles DJ Alan Freed in Cleveland and Elvis Presley in Memphis who was totally immersed in black music almost by accident As Sam Phillips Elvis first producer said If I could find a white man who had the Negro sound and the Negro feel I could make a billion dollars Miller s training as an intellectual historian is the source of most of the strengths and weaknesses of Flowers in the Dustbin In a To the Finland Station sort of way ideas have consequences and Miller has an intellectual genealogy for everything Freed and Ertegun bring commercial rapacity to rock Dick Clark brings technical fixing lip synching and the dressing up of weak voices The Beatles globalize this music Drugs enter when Bob Dylan turns the Beatles on to pot and become central with the Grateful Dead The Velvet Underground through Andy Warhol marries rock to a bleak minimalist urban counterculture Janis Joplin invents primal screaming and Jimi Hendrix a kind of vatic solipsism David Bowie brings in kitsch and hype Finally the Sex Pistols unite all the nihilism and flimflam that s been accumulating like sediment in the rock industry and the rock mind set and an era ends roughly around the time Elvis dies All these trends strike me as artificial and overdetermined One of the striking differences between this rock history and others is that Miller looks at rock as being over since roughly 1977 we ve had nothing but reprises of old themes Do you buy that I distrust it When Miller says that the most profound sentimental basis of rock is nostalgia I hear not a critical insight but the moaning of one who s like the rest of us getting old And what about the general sweep of the narrative I m particularly impressed with Miller s discriminations from the late 1960s and early 70s when rock must have been freshest to him Marvin Gaye is every bit the giant Miller paints him as and Jim Morrison every bit the pseud Some of the freshest lines in the book come with his description of Oliver Stone s film The Doors which offers an inadvertent parody a portrait of an amateur oracle s excruciatingly dull metamorphosis into a pitiful drunken slob But I m troubled by things that are missing Where is Sam Cooke who is a plausible bridge between the Mills Brothers I Found My Million Dollar Baby In the Five and Ten Cent Store and Gaye s Let s Get It On Where s Woodstock which played such a role in turning a counterculture into a culture Where are the Beach Boys whose dissolution particularly Brian Wilson s shows that the drug addled despair of the 1960s ran as deep in glee club Middle America as it did in Andy Warhol s Factory Where is disco surely as reliable an indicator of musical decadence as the Sex Pistols Where are Steely Dan and Frank Zappa And what do you think of Miller s take on race Most accounts tend to view rock as either 1 a fifth column in the war on racism or 2 another venue for capitalist race theft Miller is subtler On one hand he shows just how many 1950s rock hits had two versions a Bad White One like Pat Boone s Ain t That a Shame that hits No 1 and a Better Black One like Fat s Domino s Ain t It a Shame that languishes in the middle of the charts But he also shows that borrowings worked both ways and that white audiences were more daringly receptive to certain rock innovations if their delight in Little Richard s filthy lyrics is any indication The musical descriptions in Miller s book strike me as flat and formulaic as in An up tempo rocker built around a boogie riff and a dramatically unconventional modulation between major and minor keys Hold Me Tight was written in one style alone that of John Lennon and Paul McCartney This is equal parts music theory pseudery and Teen Beat gush But strip it away and what are you left with Business writing a narrative of how Agent X reneged on Performer Y s contract and took her to Label Z So a closing question for you Chris Why is it so hard to write well about rock Best Chris
