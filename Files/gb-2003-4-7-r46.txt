 Background Since the seed and soil hypothesis of Paget in the 19th century 1 it has been understood that the microenvironment or soil surrounding the tumor seed plays a critical part in its development However investigations into the molecular biology of cancers are often carried out on cells grown in vitro in culture where the environment is unlike that of the in vivo tissue environment in which cancers naturally develop The effects of these environmental differences on cancer cells may account in part for the fact that only a small percentage of anticancer drugs that are found to effectively kill cells in vitro are successful in subsequent animal and human studies In this study we explored the changes that occur at the transcriptome level as cells grown in vitro are transplanted into an in vivo environment where they develop as a tumor The in vivo environment represented here is that of the subcutaneous intrascapular region of the nude mouse Two different cell lines were studied A549 derived from human lung adenocarcinoma and U118 derived from human brain glioblastoma Our study examined the differences in global gene expression between A549 mouse xenograft tumors and A549 cell cultures and between U118 xenograft tumors grown in the same location as the A549 tumors and U118 cultures We looked for in vivo versus in vitro differences that were common to the two cell lines and for differences that were found in one cell line but not the other In modeling mechanisms of cancer development global gene expression profiling of human derived cells grown as tumors in mice has some distinct advantages over profiling of tumors obtained from patients Whereas a great deal of genetic variability exists among different tumors from different patients lesser genetic heterogeneity would be expected in xenografts of cancer cells originally derived from a single patient Furthermore patient derived tumors are composed of both cancer and non cancer cells making it difficult to precisely ascertain gene expression patterns specifically attributable to cancer cells For example in many cancer microarray studies the actual percentage of cancer cells in a profiled sample may be as low as 30 40 2 Even when using techniques such as laser capture microdissection which can improve tumor purity 3 the relative contribution of cancer cells and non cancer cells to the overall gene expression profile remains uncertain In contrast profiling human genes expressed in a mouse xenograft using a human microarray chip might uncover genes specifically expressed in human cancer cells in xenograft tumors comprised of a mixture of human and mouse derived cells 4 The data obtained in a microarray experiment can be overwhelming and the challenge is to understand on a global systems level the biology behind the differences in expression observed in hundreds of genes In this study we have searched for significantly enriched classes of genes among all differentially expressed genes These are classes or functional categories of genes that appear overrepresented in the set of differentially expressed genes As a result valuable clues could emerge as to the dominant biological features or processes that might underlie the coordinate expression of these genes Such clues could be especially convincing if it can be shown that the enriched classes are unlikely to represent a chance occurrence Gene classes can be defined by common gene annotations or concepts from the biomedical literature Results Global differences in gene expression between xenograft tumors and cell cultures A549 and U118 cells were each transplanted subcutaneously into the intrascapular region of immunodeficient mice within which sizable tumors developed after 21 days Global mRNA expression profiles from these tumors using Affymetrix HuGeneFL chips were compared with profiles obtained from the cell lines as grown in culture Between the A549 xenograft tumors and the A549 cell cultures 357 genes 375 probe sets differed significantly at p 0 01 with a fold change greater than two either way 134 genes being higher in tumors and 223 genes being higher in culture a number much greater than the 24 to be expected by chance as determined by permutation testing Between the U118 xenograft tumors and cell cultures 368 genes 387 probe sets differed significantly 112 genes being higher in tumors and 256 genes being higher in culture with 29 expected false positives due to chance Table 1shows the genes with highest expression in tumors compared with cultures for each of the cell lines From histological analysis the amount of mouse tissue in a xenograft tumor was estimated between 10 and 20 To determine the extent of hybridization with the human HuGeneFL chip that might be attributable to mouse RNA a sample of mouse lung tissue was also profiled Whereas the total amount of hybridization measured in the xenograft tumor profiles was comparable to that of the culture profiles with equal amounts of RNA the total hybridization measured in the mouse control profile was found to be about one fifth that of a xenograft profile with the same amount of RNA As the control profile was from a sample of 100 mouse tissue the contribution of mouse genes to differences observed in gene expression between cell cultures and tumors was considered to be minimal From a comparison of the individual probe set intensities of the mouse lung profile with those of the culture profiles and assuming a 20 contribution of mouse tissue to the human xenograft sample we estimate that in only about 20 out of the 7 069 probe sets on the HuGeneFL chip a number on the level of measurement noise in a microarray experiment would the amount of hybridization from mouse tissue alone have been high enough to account for greater than twofold changes between cell cultures and tumors In contrast nearly 800 probe sets showed a greater than twofold increase on average from A549 culture profiles to A549 xenograft tumor profiles It can therefore be concluded that in all but a handful of genes the numerous significant changes observed in gene expression in the xenograft tumors are due to the cancerous human cells and not the surrounding mouse host tissue Principal components were extracted from the cell culture and xenograft expression data using all 7 069 probe sets considered in the analysis The first principal component captures the greatest fraction of the overall variance in gene expression the second captures the greatest fraction of variance subject to being independent of the first and so on From the first two principal components a pair of coordinates was determined for each xenograft and cell culture profile to construct a two dimensional view that reflects the relative locations of the profiles in the higher dimensional space On the same two dimensional view we plotted one dataset of 86 profiles from lung adenocarcinomas and another dataset of 45 profiles from glioblastomas and astrocytomas generated from previous global gene expression studies 5 6 Figure 1shows this principal components analysis PCA plot of the gene expression profiles from cell cultures xenografts and human lung and brain tumors Although none of the human tumor profiles was used to define the principal components coordinate space lung tumor profiles appear well separated on the plot from brain tumor profiles A549 profiles both xenograft and culture are grouped with lung tumors rather than brain tumors and U118 profiles with brain tumors rather than lung tumors Of the 134 genes found expressed more highly in A549 xenograft tumors over A549 cultures p 0 01 fold change 2 70 were also higher in stage I adenocarcinomas over A549 cultures p 0 05 Of the 112 genes upregulated in U118 xenograft tumors over cultures 50 were also higher in high grade glioblastomas over U118 cultures p 0 05 Overrepresentation of genes involved in cell division and metabolism among genes upregulated in cancer cells in culture relative to xenografts Searches were made for significantly enriched gene classes as defined by Gene Ontology GO annotation or Medical Subject Heading Index MeSH term association see Materials and methods for both the set of 223 genes upregulated in the A549 cell cultures over A549 tumors and the set of 256 genes upregulated in the U118 cell cultures over the U118 tumors p 0 01 fold change 2 In each case the p values for the most enriched classes appeared highly significant compared to what would be expected based on simulation results in a randomly selected set of the same number of genes For example for the A549 set of 223 genes 35 enriched LocusLink annotation terms were found that had a p value less than 1 9E 03 where one term with a p value less than 1 9E 03 would be expected in a given set of 223 randomly selected genes Out of 100 simulation tests no single test had more than eight terms with a p value less than 1 9E 03 Table 2shows the top gene classes found in both the A549 set and the U118 set with p values less than 0 05 There are far more gene classes common to both gene sets with p 0 05 in each than would be expected in two randomly selected gene sets of 223 and 256 for example for the MeSH term classes 37 were found to be significantly enriched in the actual data whereas about two would be expected to occur by chance see Table 2 Taken together the significantly enriched classes found for both the A549 and the U118 genes in cell culture compared with tumors are highly indicative of processes of cell division and metabolism with significant MeSH term classes for the two gene sets including Cell cycle 62 genes for A549 66 genes for U118 DNA replication 30 33 Mitosis 28 37 Mitochondria 38 52 and Cyclin dependent kinases 21 30 and significant GO terms including Cell proliferation 36 39 Metabolism 108 134 Cytokinesis 8 6 Tricarboxylic acid cycle 3 5 and G1 S transition 5 7 A search for enriched gene classes was also made for 157 genes that were expressed more highly p 0 05 fold change 2 in both A549 and U118 cell cultures over tumors and the significant classes found were the same or of the same nature as the classes listed in Table 2 For the entire set of enriched classes for genes upregulated in cell cultures over the xenograft tumors including which genes belong to which classes see Additional data files and 7 Overrepresentation of genes involved in cell adhesion the extracellular matrix and vascularization among genes upregulated in cancer cells in xenografts relative to cultures As with the genes expressed at higher levels in culture compared to xenografts searches were made for significantly enriched GO and MeSH term classes for the set of 134 genes with significantly higher expression p 0 01 fold change 2 in the A549 tumors over the A549 cell cultures and the set of 112 genes upregulated in the U118 tumors over the U118 cell cultures Again in each case the p values for the most enriched classes found were quite significant over what would be expected by chance For example for the A549 set of 134 genes 36 enriched MeSH terms were found that had a p value less than 7E 04 where one term would be expected to have p less than 7E 04 in a set of 134 randomly selected genes out of 100 simulation tests no single test had more than six terms with a p value less than 7E 04 Table 3shows the top gene classes found in both the A549 set and the U118 set with p values less than 0 05 Taken together the significantly enriched gene classes for A549 and U118 genes that were upregulated in tumors compared to cell culture are highly indicative of processes involving cell adhesion and the extracellular matrix ECM Significant MeSH term classes for the two gene sets included Cell adhesion 26 genes for A549 21 genes for U118 Extracellular matrix proteins 15 16 Cytokines 28 26 Collagen 28 33 Fibroblasts 40 35 Metalloendopeptidases 11 12 Growth Substances 14 16 Proteoglycans 11 15 and Transcription factor Sp1 11 10 Sp1 is important for the basal expression of various collagens and blocking Sp1 broadly inhibits expression of ECM genes 8 Terms such as Pathologic neovascularization 13 9 and Vascular endothelium 29 26 can refer to processes of angiogenesis the generation of new blood vessels from preexisting vessels for the delivery of nutrients to tumors Other disease related terms include Precancerous conditions 11 8 Pulmonary fibrosis 5 5 a condition involving chronic inflammation and progressive fibrosis of the pulmonary alveolar walls and Systemic scleroderma 4 6 characterized by hardening of affected tissues Also of interest is the significant term Stem cells 23 20 as similar signaling pathways are thought to regulate self renewal in stem cells and cancer cells and as tumors may include stem cells 9 The entire set of enriched classes found for genes expressed more strongly in the xenografts over the cell cultures including which genes belong to which classes is available as additional data files and from 7 Upregulation of genes specific to cell line lineage in xenografts While several gene classes were found in common between the 112 genes upregulated in U118 tumors and the 134 genes upregulated in A549 tumors over cultures p 0 01 fold change 2 only 10 upregulated genes were shared between the two gene sets At a significance level of 0 05 26 genes were shared between the 301 genes upregulated in U118 tumors and the 229 genes upregulated in A549 tumors over cultures whereas 12 would be expected if the two gene sets were independent of each other By comparison 46 genes over four times the 10 expected by chance were common to the 223 genes upregulated in A549 cultures and the 256 genes upregulated in U118 cultures over tumors p 0 01 fold change 2 Whereas processes of cell division and metabolism may be more in common from one cancer to the next processes of cell adhesion and ECM interaction are likely to be very different between different cell types These observations gave rise to the hypothesis that when placed in comparable tissue environments cancer cells from different lineages may express different cell adhesion and ECM related genes To test our hypothesis that A549 cells and U118 cells each express a restricted set of ECM related genes in tumors we built a classifier for distinguishing between A549 and U118 cell culture profiles We used as the training dataset the A549 and U118 tumor profiles with the expression values for the 30 genes that had both an association in the literature with the MeSH term Extracellular matrix proteins and were significantly upregulated p 0 01 fold change 2 either in A549 xenograft tumors over cultures or in U118 tumors over cultures We then tested the classifier on the six profiles from A549 and U118 cell cultures The classifier distinguished perfectly between A549 and U118 profiles which indicates that the expression pattern of ECM related genes upregulated in the A549 tumors is more similar to the expression pattern of the same genes in the A549 cell cultures than it is to the expression of these genes in the U118 cell cultures and vice versa We built three other similar classifiers one used the expression values of the 47 genes that are significantly higher in either A549 or U118 tumors and had an association with the MeSH term Cell adhesion the second used the values for 95 genes associated with Cell differentiation and the third used the expression values of all 236 genes higher in A549 or U118 tumors with p less than 0 01 and fold change greater than two All three classifiers correctly distinguished between A549 and U118 cell cultures Figure 2shows a cluster diagram of the expression signatures of the 47 cell adhesion related genes across all profiles showing most of the genes as appearing more highly expressed in either the A549 tumors or the U118 tumors but not in both Discussion Cells grown in culture have unlimited access to nutrients under conditions most favorable for growth and proliferation and little exposure to extrinsic factors such as cytokines that modulate growth and differentiation In contrast cells in a tumor growing in a host tissue environment face conditions with more limited nutrients and oxygen and are subjected to or benefit from a wide variety of host factors The ability of cancer cells to proliferate within a tissue depends on their response to adhesive and growth factor cues within the ECM 10 and self sufficiency in growth signals is one of the hallmarks of cancer 11 To stimulate their own growth and proliferation in tissue tumor cells can overproduce and release their own growth factors or obtain them from the matrix as they are released by matrix metalloproteinases 12 The endothelial vasculature grows into the tumor and provides nutrients and oxygen 13 This model is illustrated by the experimental results presented here as both A549 lung and U118 brain cell lines are observed to upregulate one set of genetic programs related to cell growth and proliferation when in culture and another set related to cell adhesion the extracellular matrix growth substances and neovascularization when developing as an in vivo tumor In terms of new biological insight into cancer development our findings suggest that cancer cells of different origins interact in different ways with the same extracellular environment to survive and proliferate as tumors These lineage specific genetic programs for cell adhesion and ECM interaction although less active in cell culture are not lost but may be reactivated when cells are transplanted back into an in vivo environment even if the new environment is different from the tissue of origin of the cancer This conclusion is based on the significant representation of genes associated with cell adhesion and the ECM in both the A549 and the U118 xenograft tumors However the genes in each case represent two very distinct sets the set in the U118 tumors being more similar in their expression pattern to that of the U118 cell cultures than to the A549 cultures and vice versa Although tumors are known to express high levels of genes involved in cell adhesion and the ECM as we observed in the xenografts assessment of the specific contribution of cancer cells to the increased expression may be difficult In the case of human tumor xenografts in a mouse host however it can be determined conclusively that expression of cell adhesion and ECM genes is upregulated in the cancerous cells in the tumor tissue This conclusion is based on the following two observations First profiling mouse tissue alone using probe sets designed for human genes gives poor hybridization to the extent that the contribution from mouse genes would not have been enough to account for the differences in gene expression observed Second different cell adhesion and ECM related genes are upregulated in tumors of different cell types A549 versus U118 if the upregulation were due to a common mouse source then the same genes should have appeared upregulated in both cell types given that the cells were grown in the same site The findings presented here suggesting that different ECM signaling pathways are active in different cancers could have important clinical implications as knowledge of the specific pathways dysregulated in a particular cancer may be valuable for devising effective therapy that targets those pathways As candidates for further investigation we have identified genes that appear upregulated in certain cancers in vivo compared to in vitro and that belong to distinct functional classes related to tumor progression Also of interest are genes that are upregulated in both the cancers including IGFBP3 insulin like growth factor binding protein 3 which interestingly is thought to have proapoptotic activities 14 and GSN gelsolin which has a role in cellular motility and acts as both a regulator and effector of apoptosis 15 Further xenograft studies of the type presented here could examine the responses of the host tissue to the tumor using a mouse microarray chip as well as temporal changes in gene expression within the developing tumor Materials and methods Cell lines and tumors Both the A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line and the U118 brain glioblastoma cell line were cultured at 37 C in a 6 CO 2 humidified incubator in DMEM supplemented with 10 fetal calf serum 100 U ml penicillin and 100 U ml streptomycin The cells were passaged weekly upon reaching confluence We produced tumors in immunodeficient SCID C B 17 mice by inoculating 5 10 6cells either A549 or U118 subcutaneously per mouse in the intrascapular region Tumors greater than 5 mm in diameter range 5 7 mm were observed within 21 days in all the mice inoculated The tumors were harvested under sterile conditions and trimmed of adipose and connective tissue Total RNA was prepared from tumor tissue Gene expression profiling Three A549 xenograft tumors obtained from different mice three U118 tumors from different mice three A549 cell culture samples and three U118 culture samples were each profiled using HuGeneFL microarray chips Affymetrix Santa Clara CA which consist of 7 069 probe sets each representing an mRNA transcript To assess the amount of hybridization with the HuGeneFL chip designed for human mRNAs that could be attributable to mouse mRNA in a xenograft tumor sample a sample of mouse lung tissue was also profiled Preparation of mRNA hybridization of the arrays and computation of probe set intensities were as previously described 5 16 17 The exogenous probe set controls on the HuGeneFL chip probe sets that give constant hybridization from sample to sample were used to determine scaling factors for comparing the mouse lung profile with the xenograft and culture profiles For each probe set we computed the fold changes for human cell line cultures U118 and A549 with 20 mouse lung compared to the pure cell line using the expression 0 8 human 0 2 mouse human This assessed the potential impact of mouse tissue on differences observed between xenograft tumor and cell culture profiles As criteria for determining significant differences in mean gene mRNA expression levels between groups of samples we used both a p value less than 0 01 using the two sample t test and a fold change greater than two either way Probe set intensities less than 50 were set to 50 Permutation testing was used to assess the number of genes that could be considered significant for any arbitrary separation of the profiles into two groups Hierarchical clustering using the Eisen software 18 19 was applied using the average linkage method as an aid to visualizing gene expression patterns of interest Global views of the variation in gene expression among cell specimens were obtained using PCA 17 Significantly enriched classes within gene sets For a given set of genes showing significant differences in expression between comparison groups a search was made within the set for significantly enriched functional classes of genes as described previously 20 For the entire set of genes profiled on the HuGeneFL chip each gene was grouped into one or more classes as defined by one of the following criteria a common Gene Ontology GO annotation term where on the order of 1 000 terms were considered 21 and a common MeSH literature term 22 association as defined below GO term gene assignments related to categories of biological process or molecular function were obtained from LocusLink 23 24 and the GO term hierarchy was obtained from the Gene Ontology Consortium 25 For each GO term assigned to a given gene in LocusLink we also assigned all hierarchical parent terms of the term to the gene For each gene profiled in the study the summaries of the 50 most recent articles that mention the gene by any one of its common aliases in the article abstract were downloaded from the web using the Entrez utilities described at 26 An association was then made between the gene and any MeSH index terms included within those summaries To reduce search time and spurious or uninteresting results before searching for common MeSH term associations we first reviewed the MeSH terms downloaded for the entire set of genes profiled We removed from further consideration any MeSH term that appeared to have no relevance to our study for example MeSH terms describing experimental protocols or the healthcare system MeSH terms that were associated with fewer than 20 genes were also discarded leaving some 4 000 MeSH terms that were considered in the analysis Similarly GO gene classes that applied to less than four of the genes under study were not considered For a given set of k significant genes two separate searches were made for enriched GO term classes and MeSH term classes For a given gene class common to n genes within the k set where the class applied to a total of A genes out of the entire set of G unique genes under study the probability p for the term occurring n or more times within a set of k genes randomly selected from the chip was calculated using the one sided Fisher s exact test As multiple gene classes were tested for our set of genes of interest the true significance of a low p value for an enriched class was estimated using 100 separate Monte Carlo simulation tests For each test k genes were first randomly selected from the set of G genes and p values for the classes occurring within the k set of genes were then calculated For a p value for a given class found in the original k set of genes we calculated the number of classes that could be expected to have a p value as low or lower in a set of k randomly selected genes based on the simulation results For each class found to be represented in two given sets one with k genes and the other with l genes with p values less than 0 05 in both cases we calculated on the basis of simulation results the number of classes expected to be found in both a random k gene set and a random l gene set with p values less than 0 05 in both In this case we carried out 100 simulation tests in each of which one set of k genes and another set of l genes were each randomly selected from the entire set of G genes under study For each gene class that was found to be represented in both random gene sets p values for enrichment were calculated for each of the two sets Classification of cell line lineage based on gene expression In order to determine whether the lineage A549 or U118 of a given cell population could be predicted on the basis of its gene expression profile we built a classifier using a training set of profiles with a set of genes of interest to be used as markers To classify a test sample as either A549 or U118 we computed the correlation coefficient between the expression values of the markers in the test sample profile and the same genes on each of the profiles in the training set using log transformed values The class identity of the majority of the top five training profiles having the greatest correlation with the test profile was then assigned to that profile This strategy is known in the classification literature as five nearest neighbors with majority voting 16 Additional data files The following files are available with the online version of this article expression
