        ill start in the first place i dont have a family and i dont have a budget     okay i dont either neither do i  its called scraping together   and its called what   scraping together   yeah in my case um i i turns out that i have a pretty good job right now but i grew up in a family that was fairly poor my dad was a college teacher and a high school teacher and we werent really destitute but we never really had a lot of money so i never really got in the habit of spending a lot of money and so now i just it turns out that i spend less than i make so i never really bother to keep a budget   well i i my family was they were okay because i mean my dad uh he um was in the military and then he also had like two other jobs so we lived comfortably id say but   uhhuh   um i pretty well i i get paid i work for the state um i get paid like once a month so i i kind of learn to to set aside a certain amount of money it you know that i could spend each week for like lunch and all this other kind you know expenses and pay the bills with the rest of it   so you dont keep actual records of what your expenses are and what your income what you income is and stuff   uh well i know what my income is but uh uh my but as far as keeping records i i i have a a ledger that will uh uh how much i owe people whatever and i deduct it out of that   oh so you do keep track of it   yeah i i i keep i i keep track of it uh im not exactly accurate of it every month i mean  but you know i keep up with it like once every other month or so get it caught up   do you actually balance it at the end of the month   uh yeah   oh   im not real good about uh keeping track in checks and stuff like that but uh uh i always keep track of of the ledger who i pay and when and whatever and what the balance is   well i just started balancing my checkbook for the first time in my life since ive had a checkbook and im im thirty two now so for i guess fourteen or fifteen years ive had a checking account but ive never actually bothered to balance it i just always made sure there was enough of money in there if i wrote out a five hundred dollar check id transfer five hundred dollars in   yeah   and i never actually checked to see if my balance matched the banks and the other day i was well a couple months ago i started thinking you know i should really do that and i had just learned learned how to use Lotus on a PC and uh with Lotus it was pretty easy to set up a a little checking program so i could so itd keep the balance for me   well i work with uh im work with an an accounting uh section of Department of Corrections   uhhuh   in in North Carolina for the state so i i work with Lotus and DataEase a lot so i im real familiar with that   so that comes second nature to you   yeah   yeah my i still havent balanced i figure if i keep doing keep this up long enough eventually someday itll balance and then at that point then i can try to keep it balanced   well i bank with Wachavia and they have this system of of where you can call a number you can call and get all your checks and what your balance is and and what checks is cleared that month or whatever and i do that like maybe twice a month i check to see what you know what checks ive written and always write paid on it when its paid so i get an idea you know subtract what  what what i have in you know in the in my account and what ive ive written checks for that havent been cleared or whatever so i keep up with it that way too   yeah well you spend more time on it than i do thats for sure   uh i wouldnt say that i just you know i just i just dont want to write bad checks   does your balance match balance match the banks at the at the end of the month   um for the most part yeah i i ive got a real good banker uh personal bankers i mean if if i do if i am ever overdrawn she always calls and tells me   uhhuh   and tells me i need to get the money in or whatever so i say okay and i get it to her     oh i dont get that i just get a letter that says we just charged you ten dollars please take care of this   oh i wish i wish mined only charge me ten dollars or here they charge eighteen   eighteen   yeah   oh so you get a personal call but you also get the charge   well not not all the time its its like uh this time i i i filed electronically my taxes and uh   uhhuh   i didnt have quite enough for my mortgage payment and um i told her and i said im waiting for them to file that and they said if the mortgage payment you know check gets that before that and i said but it should be you know i it should be deposited before it hits but   right   and it it didnt the mortgage check hit before but she told me that if it did not to worry about it that she would just uh she she wouldnt charge me she since i let her know a head of time that i was waiting on that and whatever so but the the mortgage payment was due so   yeah you like to live on the edge i see     well sometimes yeah uh uh i believe in that philosophy of of praying that it dont hit the bank before the check does or deposit does if i want something bad enough i ill do it but normally i dont do that but in case its something thats   uhhuh
