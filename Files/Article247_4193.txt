 Toast Coffee and the Obituaries Dear David At the Breakfast Table these days quite literally the first thing I turn to after scanning the front page of the Times is the obituaries Years ago some people had a prurient interest in these such as those who went to the funeral of the thuggish Hollywood producer Harry Cohn to make sure that he was dead But nowadays so many of my contemporaries and colleagues are going five at Harvard and MIT in the past months that I turn to those pages with what Kierkegaard called the concept of the Dread The other day I read in the Times of the death of Niccolo Tucci at age 91 I had not thought of Tucci in years He had come to the United States just before World War II as an Italian cultural attach and a fascist A fascist Yes People forget or most never knew that in its early years fascism was a powerful intellectual movement Mussolini had been a prominent left wing socialist and editor of the party s newspaper Marinetti the founder of Italian futurism was a fascist As were the modernist playwright Luigi Pirandello the poet d Annunzio and the major Italian philosopher Giovanni Gentile who influenced Collingwood and was minister of education in Mussolini s government Tucci had been a follower of Gentile but broke with fascism during the war and became a member of Dwight Macdonald s circle around Politics where I met him He had a tart wit In 1945 when I was managing editor of the monthly magazine Common Sense my editor was Varian Fry who had returned to New York after saving countless lives of artists and writers by arranging for their exit from Vichy France to Spain and Portugal and then to safer havens I had asked Tucci to write a monthly column On what He asked Oh I replied on say Travels to America Strange country he said Why do they call this America It was the first name of the man Amerigo Vespucci Why not Vespuccia Fine I said we can call it Travels in Vespuccia and you can write about the Daughters of the Vespuccian Revolution or the Vespuccian Legion march down the street He did not It reminded him too much of fascism There are or have been strong differences between obituaries in the American and in the English press Those in the American press are usually dry and thin and fail to catch the personality of a man or woman Those in the English press are often quite personal and written at times by a friend of the individual This month Hugh Massingberd published in England The Fifth Volume of Obituaries from the Daily Telegraph Obituaries are history Yet the times are changing Witness the long obituary of Joseph Heller in the Times yesterday beginning with two columns on the front page and continuing after the jump to almost a full page inside One of the older arts of homage has been poetry Alfred Lord Tennyson published In Memoriam AHH more than a hundred verses of elegy and sorrow for his friend Arthur Henry Hallam And W H Auden published In Memory of W B Yeats d Jan 1939 He disappeared in the dead of winter The brooks were frozen the air ports almost deserted And snow disfigured the public statues The day of his death was a dark cold day Yeats of course wrote his own death poem Under bare Ben Bulben s head In Drumcliff churchyard Yeats is laid On limestone quarried near the spot By his command these words are cut Cast a cold eye On life or death Horseman pass by For us as Jews the eulogy is not literary but religious In going each year to the cemetery we place a stone on the monument in commemoration of the acts of Joshua and Samuel in giving praise to the Lord But the most affecting act is the kaddish the statement of mourning that a son says on the death of his father It is haunting its recurring refrain and keeps pulsing through my mind now every day I think of my close friends Dick Hofstadter Lionel Trilling Sidney Hook They are now part of history But the breakfast is finished and here is the rest of the cold day ahead Love Dad
