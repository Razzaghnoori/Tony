 Lose One for the Gipper During the past few years Republicans have dallied with social conservatism libertarianism and Gingrichian revolutionary conservatism Now they are flirting with a new or rather an old doctrine nostalgism The GOP has been trying to recapture Ronald Reagan s magic ever since Reagan went west in 1989 So it s not surprising that at this moment of low ebb Republicans are again evoking the Gipper They have placed two early 80s Reagan issues at the heart of their platform across the board tax cuts and a national missile defense The tax cut notion enthralls the party s top echelon especially conservatives Senate and House leaders pushed a 10 percent income tax cut as the centerpiece of their legislative plan until they abandoned the idea Monday Last week Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott trekked to Macomb Mich the wellspring of Reagan Democrats to flog the tax cut Presidential candidate John Kasich is touting the income tax cut as the key to his campaign Steve Forbes Gary Bauer and Bob Smith are equally enthusiastic Someone has also wound up the Jack Kemp doll which declares the 10 percent proposal timid and pitiful Tax rates Kemp says should be cut back to Reagan levels Dan Quayle too is dissatisfied with 10 percent off He would slash rates 30 percent Even as I write this a letter from the Heritage Foundation has been dropped on my desk It says the tax cut idea harkens back to the supply side days of President Ronald Reagan And not a minute too soon The national missile defense has similarly claimed a top spot on the GOP s agenda Conservatives began talking about the Star Wars revival last summer when a blue ribbon commission concluded that the United States was increasingly vulnerable to missile strikes by rogue states The enthusiasm has mushroomed since North Korea shot a test missile over Japan Lott calls missile defense one of our most critical legislative priorities Bauer is making it one of his lead issues When I saw him speak at a conservative conference in January the missile defense exhortation was his biggest applause line Quayle and Smith too are making missile defense a campaign priority The Republican National Committee is obsessed with the topic berating the Clinton administration weekly for failing to deploy a shield The clinging to these two id es fixes is in some ways a Republican failure to accept victory Reagan s tax cuts and tax reform were Republican triumphs They lowered marginal rates from ludicrously high levels to more reasonable ones and they spurred the economic expansion of the 80s as well as the deficits of the 80s Star Wars helped win the Cold War convincing Mikhail Gorbachev that the Soviet Union could not compete This Reaganite fundamentalism is not ideology It is faith If he believed it it must be so But the problem with id es fixes is that they are fixed Tax cuts and missile defense circa 1999 are not wrong ideas They are insignificant ones Like the Democrats of the 80s who campaigned on the New Deal 99 Republicans are refurbishing bygone notions for an age that doesn t want them In 1981 Reagan cut taxes to spur consumption and revive a sickly economy Today Americans are consuming voraciously and the economy could hardly be fitter In 1983 Reagan funded Star Wars to intimidate the Soviet Union Today we don t need a national missile defense to defend against Russia Nor is a missile shield a wise investment in the battle against rogues Terrorists are more likely to park a bomb filled truck on Pennsylvania Avenue than lob a missile Better to spend the billions on intelligence and nonproliferation What must be especially frustrating to GOP strategists is Americans indifference to this Reaganism Republican dogma says you can never err by offering to cut taxes But Americans have greeted the tax cut schemes with a shrug Democrats have successfully and accurately painted the across the board tax cut proposal as regressive Clinton has countered it with targeted interest group tax cuts child care senior care health care offset by targeted tax increases tobacco Republicans would spend much of the surplus on a tax break Clinton would spend it on Social Security debt repayment and Medicare Only about 11 percent of Americans favor spending the surplus on a tax cut while about 70 percent favor spending it on Social Security or debt repayment Polls have found that when it comes to taxes Americans trust Democrats formerly tax and spend Democrats far more than Republicans and Clinton far more than congressional Republicans Clinton and the Democrats have won the tax issue so completely that congressional Republican leaders have now abandoned the 10 percent tax cut plan Instead they are pushing marriage penalty tax relief The presidential candidates of course are still clutching to the across the board cuts On missile defense too Clinton has outfoxed the GOP He killed Star Wars in 1993 but the budget he introduced several weeks ago proposes 6 6 billion for missile defense research This is part of an enormous proposed increase in military spending The missile defense money has pulled the rug out from under Republicans leaving them with the flimsiest of criticisms The president has delayed the decision on whether to actually deploy a missile defense until June 2000 The administration wants time to conduct R D and renegotiate the ABM treaty with Russia The treaty bans national missile defenses Republicans have been reduced to insisting that Clinton declare now that he will deploy a defense In essence the GOP argument is that we need to decide now instead of 17 months from now whether to deploy something that doesn t exist today won t exist in 17 months and probably won t exist until 2005 This is hardly enough to base a presidential campaign on There is another reason besides nostalgia why Republicans started talking about tax cuts and missile defense Clinton has already co opted Republicans on welfare family values the death penalty crime etc Taxes and missile defense were among the few issues he hadn t stolen But now he s the one who s got the tax plan Americans like He s the one who has set aside billions for a missile defense that won t work No wonder arch Reaganaut Paul Weyrich is urging conservatives to give up on politics They can t even out Reagan Clinton
