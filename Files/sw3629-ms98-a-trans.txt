        um what do you feel about child care     well fortunately my children are pretty much beyond that   mine are too but i think its a real real a real serious situation for a lot of people   it certainly is   and i dont you know a lot about it where where youre working for this school department   yes um our YMCA has after school child care um at several of the schools so that they dont even have to you know go anywhere yeah   leave the school uhhuh   um and then for other schools that they dont have it at the school they have it at the Y and they pick them up in a a you know a van or whatever i think it kind of depends on how many   umhum well youre probably in a more uh oh what we we live in a rural rural area   students oh okay   and so i think most of the people around here that have to leave their children leave them with uh neighbors or people you know in a home situation   umhum umhum umhum well thats always nice too i did that when mine were were littler   so uhhuh   the uh first couple of years that i i worked only halftime when my first child was born and and he just stayed with a friend or somebody that maybe had one child you know his age   umhum   um  and that always seemed to work out real well and you know when somebody would decide to quit or something i always felt real panicky   umhum   but always seemed to manage to find somebody that i thought was just as wonderful as the other one you know so it seemed to work out   yeah did you have you worked all the time your children were little   um uh when i had my second one i stayed home for three and a half years   oh uhhuh   and then and then went back   so but thats about the time then they could go into a preschool situation   right right unfortunately the preschool that i wanted the second one to go to because my first one had   oh   is a preschool that does not have any day care at all but its such a wonderful preschool so i had to find somebody else to keep them and then and then somebody to take them there   uhhuh oh   so thats always another problem   oh yes uh you know i dont know how people we its pretty cold here in Utah in the winter and i think i just think it would be so hard to have to get a child up a baby   um umhum umhum   and take it in the cold to someone early in the morning   right yep   i think that that i would let i think i would sooner have it in someone in the home taking care of it   umhum but then thats awfully expensive too   in a home   yeah well i mean if so you have someone come into your home   oh yes uhhuh to come into your home but i   you know that that would be real nice but just almost almost cost prohibitive prohibitive you know   umhum yes unless you can get could get a a nanny or something that i know a lot of the girls here go off as nannies   uhhuh   and stay in peoples homes and take care of them after theyve graduated from high school not a lot but some of them   oh uhhuh uhhuh   but uh i think thatd be an ideal situation ive never had to to uh work out of the home ive had we had uh six children and they just   uhhuh   i would just  i was just here with them   well you just worked period huh  if you had six children   right  and right  well there was seventeen years between them but that uh yeah well i just i just really thats what i wanted to do you know and but i know that my   uhhuh yeah   childrens spouses and i have five boys and a girl and uh   oh  where did the girl come   in the middle uhhuh we kept trying  but uh the our our daughter or none of them have worked very much while their children have been little   middle oh thats good umhum   so but uh we have fourteen grandchildren so       this is i i feel lucky that they have not had to go out of the home   right right   because i i  i dont know i just think that those first two or three years and then again in high school they they need their mother there   yeah thats true yeah that is true well how cold is it up there   so uh its in the  how cold is it honey right now about twenty eight   oh okay well its about fifty here so  uh no its quit yeah it was bad there for a little bit but uh anyway   is it still raining oh good are you umhum what do you do in the school district do you   im a librarian   oh well thats be interesting i love books   umhum yeah i liked that a lot and i kind of wanted to continue it even though my children were you know when they were born but like i said i was able to stay home for   so uhhuh   those three years so it made a difference   well i think if youre trained and i think if you feel it within yourself that you want to be out  you know and you you have uh you have the ability and stuff thats great there were times when i would have loved to have got you know uhhuh to left to have left my kids and you know   umhum to get out yeah thats true i think and everybody feels that way at times at least   im sure they do   and then also that youd love to be home  at   im sure thats so too   at other times but uh one thing i think it does do is it it it forces  it forces you to make your children be organized and   and i think it makes them more independent umhum   and independent thats right that
