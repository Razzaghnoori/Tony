 Introduction The precise role played by CD8 T cells in the pathogenesis and inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis RA is unclear In the synovial membrane the most common IFN producing cell is the CD8 T cell suggesting that this population of T cells plays a major role in macrophage activation and perpetuation of the inflammatory response 1 CD8 T cells were recently associated with the presence of germinal centers in RA synovium 2 suggesting a role for CD8 T cells in the formation or maintenance of those lymphoid structures in the synovium Further studies indicated that CD8 T cells exhibit oligoclonality in the peripheral blood 3 4 and synovial fluid of RA patients 5 raising the question of whether this oligoclonality is antigen driven However recent studies have indicated that large numbers of virus specific CD8 T cells preferentially accumulate in the synovial fluid of RA patients and that these cells are also oligoclonal suggesting that non antigen specific homing may be responsible for the observed oligoclonality of CD8 T cells in the synovial fluid 6 Because chemokines such as macrophage inflammatory protein 1 and RANTES regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted are expressed in RA synovial tissue 7 8 subsets of CD8 T cells may be preferentially recruited into the synovial tissue in a non antigen specific manner If the expression of chemokines is also accompanied by a perturbation in CD8 T cell homeostasis in the periphery that favors differentiation into cell types that can be recruited into the synovium then a vicious cycle may be set up in RA in which there is continuous generation of CD8 T cells that can be recruited into the synovium resulting in chronic inflammation and joint destruction Recently memory CD8 T cells were classified into three distinct populations based on phenotype 9 10 11 a central memory population which is CD45RA CCR7 CD62L CD28 IL 2 IFN and two effector memory populations namely the CD45RA CD62L CCR7 and the terminally differentiated CD45RA CD62L CCR7 populations The two latter effector memory populations contain perforin secrete IFN and tumor necrosis factor are cytotoxic and are capable of rapid effector function after stimulation 9 10 11 Although a linear model of differentiation has been suggested for these memory populations i e central memory T cells CD45RA CCR7 CD62L effector memory T cells CD45RA CD62L CCR7 effector memory T cells CD45RA CD62L CCR7 10 the exact relationship between these populations is not fully established Indeed Champagne et al 12 suggested that the differentiation may not be linear at all The central and effector memory phenotypes of CD4 and CD8 T cells in peripheral blood of RA patients are unknown Determination of these phenotypes in RA may provide important insights into T cell homeostasis and we therefore examined the distribution of CD4 and CD8 T cells into these subpopulations because such a study may reveal differences in the differentiation of T cells in RA patients Decreases in some of the subpopulations in peripheral blood may indicate that there is a selective migration of these cells out of the peripheral blood decreased survival of these cells or blockade in their differentiation Perturbations in the homeostasis of memory T cells may play an important role in the pathogenesis of RA by generating effector cells that can contribute to the synovial inflammation of RA Patients and methods Patients Peripheral blood was obtained from patients with RA systemic lupus erythematosus SLE and healthy control individuals following Drexel University Institutional Review Board approval and obtaining informed consent The RA group consisted of eight patients seven women one man with an age range of 33 63 years mean 49 years All patients in the group were receiving disease modifying antirheumatic drugs and were clinically stable The SLE group consisted of 12 women with an age range of 22 68 years mean 45 years who were clinically stable All patients in the two groups met the American College of Rheumatology criteria for SLE and RA respectively Patient profiles and characteristics are shown in Table 1 Age and sex matched healthy control groups were included for the RA and the SLE patient groups control group for RA n 8 age range 32 61 years mean 50 years and control group for SLE n 12 age range 22

Cary NC USA Results Na ve and memory subpopulations of CD4 and CD8 T cells from RA and SLE patients were compared with those in healthy control individuals to determine T cell maturation differences between those groups As compared with the healthy control group RA patients had fewer CD45RA CD62L CD4 na ve T cells 32 4 8 in RA patients n 8 and 42 6 5 in healthy controls n 8 respectively although this difference was not statistically significant Fig 1a 1b The CD45RA CD62L CD4 central memory T cell population was significantly increased in RA patients 50 3 7 n 8 as compared with the healthy control group 38 4 4 n 8 P 0 05 Fig 1a 1b No differences were found in the CD45RA CD62L CD4 effector memory population 15 2 2 for RA patients and 18 2 6 for healthy controls n 8 each or in the

healthy controls 38 4 8 n 8 P 0 05 Fig 1a 1b No significant differences were found when CD4 and CD8 T cells of SLE patients were compared with the CD4 and CD8 T cells of matched healthy control individuals Fig 1c In the CD4 T cell population 35 4 6 of cells from SLE patients and 45 4 7 in the healthy controls exhibited a na ve phenotype the central memory phenotype was expressed by 42 3 8 of the CD4 T cells from SLE patients n 12 and in 37 3 1 of the CD4 T cells from healthy controls n 12 Of the CD4 T cells 20 3 6 and 16 2 0 were effector memory cells in the SLE and healthy control groups n 12 in each respectively and only a very small population of the cells were terminally differentiated effector memory CD4 T cells in SLE patients 2 4 0 9 and healthy controls 1 7 0 5 Fig 1c The CD8 T cell compartment of SLE patients consisted of 42 5 6 CD45RA CD62L na ve cells 14 2 9 CD45RA CD62L central memory 20 4 1 CD45RA CD62L effector memory and 24 4 9 CD45RA CD62L terminally differentiated

terminally differentiated effector memory CD8 T cells were found n 12 Fig 1c A positive correlation was found between the age and the percentage of CD45RA CD62L terminally differentiated effector memory CD8 T cells in the healthy control group r 2 0 64 n 13 P 0 001 Fig 1d indicating that this effector population increases with age However no such correlation was detected in RA and SLE patients Fig 1d Finally the frequency of CD45RA CD62L CD8 T cells did not correlate with disease duration or treatment in either RA or SLE patients data not shown Discussion The present study shows that the differentiation of peripheral blood CD8 T cells is skewed in patients with RA and results in an increase in central memory CD45RA CD62L CD8 T cells with a concomitant decrease in terminally differentiated effector memory CD45RA CD62L CD8 T cells The increase in central memory CD45RA CD62L T cells was also found in the CD4 T cell population in RA patients This skewed differentiation was not observed in healthy age matched control individuals and in SLE patients indicating that this perturbation in homeostasis of T cells is a specific feature of RA Although the na ve memory phenotype of T cells has previously been investigated in RA in numerous studies using CD45RA and CD45RO expression as markers of na ve and memory cells respectively that approach has suffered from the limitation that large numbers of CD45RA CD8 T cells are actually effector memory cells 10 13 The CD45RA CD45RO oversimplification has also resulted in rather confusing conclusions regarding T cell homeostasis such as defects in primary T cell homeostasis based on reduced T cell receptor excision circle TREC levels in na ve CD4 T cells defined as CD45RO in RA patients 14 Our findings suggest that reduced TREC levels in the CD45RO CD4 T cell population may not be due to a reduction in TRECs in na ve cells but rather to reduced TRECs in the CD45RA CD45RO CD62L effector memory CD4 T cells It should be noted that previous studies have reported false na ve CD45RA populations of CD4 and CD8 T cells in peripheral blood of RA patients 15 however the nature of these cells the exact phenotype and the significance was not known at that time Our finding that peripheral blood CD8 T cells exhibit increased central memory phenotype and decreased terminally differentiated effector memory phenotype suggests that the peripheral blood homeostasis of CD8 T cells is perturbed in RA Perturbations in CD8 T cell maturation have been shown for HIV specific CD8 T cells in which there is an accumulation of preterminally differentiated CD45RA CD62L CD8 T cells 12 16 and such a lack of differentiation may result in functional or homing defects In RA we found a decrease in terminally differentiated CD45RA CD62L CD8 T cells with a concomitant increase in the CD45RA CD62L central memory population If one accepts the linear model of differentiation 10 which we note has been challenged 12 then our findings indicate that in RA there may be an accelerated differentiation of na ve cells into central memory CD4 and CD8 T cells This accelerated differentiation may be due to a non antigen specific effect in RA that differentiates all peripheral T cells irrespective of their specificity or it may actually reflect an antigen specific expansion of T cells potentially driven by autoantigen The decrease in CD45RA CD62L effector memory CD8 T cells in peripheral blood we found in RA patients may reflect a decrease in the survival of these cells It should be noted however that peripheral blood T cells from RA patients do not exhibit an increase in apoptosis in in vitro cultures which is in contrast to synovial membrane T cells 17 18 This may suggest that the skewed phenotype of the CD45RA CD62L effector memory CD8 T cells is more likely due to an increase in the migration of these cells into sites of inflammation However a blockade of the differentiation of central memory CD45RA CD62L CD8 T cells into effector memory CD8 T cells would also result in an increase in the central memory population with a concomitant decrease in the effector T cells as observed in the present study Studies of the phenotype of CD8 T cells in the synovial membrane and fluid may shed light as to whether this skewed phenotype is also found in these sites or whether there is an enrichment for CD45RA CD62L CD8 T cells indicating increased recruitment into the inflamed synovium in RA Inflammation and production of chemokines such as macrophage inflammatory protein 1 and RANTES 7 8 in the synovium may result in preferential recruitment of such effector memory CD8 T cells which are important contributors to IFN production and subsequent macrophage activation because terminally differentiated CD45RA CD62L CD8 T cells have been shown to express higher levels of perforin and may be more potent effector cells 10 The question arises of whether the observed skewed differentiation of CD8 T cells in RA patients is due to medication especially steroids As shown in Table 1 38 of the RA patients and 58 of the SLE patients were receiving steroid treatment However the skewed memory phenotype was only observed in the RA patients suggesting that this treatment is not responsible for the differences in CD4 and CD8 T cell phenotypes Findings from the present preliminary study show that peripheral blood CD8 T cells in RA exhibit a skewed effector memory phenotype This skewed phenotype was not found in CD4 T cells in RA and was not seen in age matched healthy control individuals or in SLE patients The skewed phenotype may be a result of accelerated differentiation and migration into sites of inflammation An understanding of the mechanisms that are involved in this skewed differentiation of effector memory CD8 T cells may prove valuable in elucidating the pathogenesis of RA Conclusion In peripheral blood of RA patients a skewed homeostasis of CD8 T cells was found with an increase in central memory and a decrease in terminally differentiated effector memory T cells Fig 2 This skewed T cell phenotype was not found in healthy age and sex matched control individuals or in patients with SLE Reduction in peripheral blood effector memory CD8 T cells in RA may indicate an increase in the migration of these cells into sites of inflammation and therefore may contribute to ongoing synovial inflammation Competing interests None declared Abbreviations IFN interferon IL interleukin RA rheumatoid arthritis RANTES regulated upon
