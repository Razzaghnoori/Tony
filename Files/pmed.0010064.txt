 Introduction Antiretroviral therapy ART has been a milestone in the treatment of HIV infection Current treatment guidelines for HIV 1 infection in the United States recommend the initiation of ART in patients with CD4 T cell counts of less than 350 cells l 1 In implementing these guidelines health care providers face the ongoing challenge of developing treatment strategies that minimize drug related toxicity and adverse effects while retaining effective control of viral replication Furthermore treatment associated costs particularly in resource poor areas difficulty in maintaining long term optimal adherence 2 and the emergence of viral resistance 3 4 5 have limited the feasibility of life long ART mediated viral suppression increasing the need for alternative treatment strategies Intermittent therapy strategies consisting of alternating cycles on and off ART have increasingly emerged as a potential intervention to address limitations of continuous ART 6 7 8 9 Therapy interruption TI studies in ART treated patients with suppressed HIV infection 10 have addressed the general questions as to whether such strategies can achieve greater viral control through increased antiviral responses autoimmunization hypothesis or simply serve as a strategy to reduce cost of long term therapy and drug associated toxicity While pilot studies and uncontrolled or incomplete trials in patients with chronic HIV infection have addressed viral and immune outcomes of fixed length TI and fixed on drug cycles 11 12 13 14 15 16 no completed randomized controlled trial has yet addressed by intent to treat analysis the outcome during an open ended TI of sequential TIs versus continuous treatment in patients with confirmed suppression The largest study to date in this area is the prospective single arm Swiss Spanish Intermittent Trial SSITT conducted in 133 recruited patients undergoing sequential 2 wk TIs and showing a lack of impact of this strategy on achieving sustained viral loads of less than 5 000 copies ml off therapy in those that completed the study 11 However the lack of a control arm in this study has left unanswered questions about the impact of multiple TIs on time to rebound immune reconstitution therapy failure and viral resistance when analyzed against a randomized control arm of continuous treatment followed for equal time before a single open ended interruption We completed a randomized controlled trial on the outcome of repeated 2 to 6 wk TIs in patients with chronic infection in which the comparator group maintained continuous therapy and then an open ended interruption period was applied in both treatment groups The study addressed the potential for repeated interruptions of therapy to delay time to viral rebound as a primary outcome and analyzed secondary outcomes regarding study defined safety criteria viral suppression and resistance and retention of immune reconstitution Methods Participants Between August 2000 and December 2003 we enrolled 42 patients infected with HIV who were older than 18 y and on ART eligibility criteria included CD4 counts of greater than 400 cells l on ART with a nadir of no less than 100 cells l ART mediated suppression 500 copies ml for more than 6 mo and less than 50 copies ml at recruitment on any antiretroviral regimen Approval of the study protocol was obtained from the institutional review board IRB of the Philadelphia Field Initiating Group for HIV Trials Philadelphia Pennsylvania United States Written informed consent was obtained from all patients Human experimentation guidelines of the United States Department of Health and Human Services and of the authors institutions were followed The study protocol including the patient consent form the CONSORT form and the IRB approval can be found in Protocols S1 S4 Randomization and Study Design Forty two eligible patients from the Jonathan Lax Immune Disorder Clinic in Philadelphia Pennsylvania were randomized via sealed envelopes in a 1 1 fashion to a first phase phase I of either 1 three successive TIs of 2 4 and 6 wk respectively or 2 maintenance of ART for 40 wk before a final interruption of therapy in both arms phase II subject to therapy reinitiation criteria as described below Phase II consisted of an open ended interruption to allow for virological and immunological comparisons between the groups off therapy Study visits were every 2 wk for the repeated interruptions group and every 4 wk for the continuous ART group during phase I Both groups were followed every 2 wk during phase II We followed a study design with step wise increases in the length of TI cycles to address potential safety concerns resuppression was confirmed after shorter TIs before longer interruptions were initiated and the hypothesis that sequential viral replication intervals would stimulate viral control and a delay in time to viral rebound Phase I procedures for the repeated interruptions group included the following 1 Interruption of therapy was individually timed to occur after two HIV RNA measurements of less than 50 copies ml without any viral load measurements greater than 400 copies ml in between these interruptions increased from 2 to 4 to 6 wk sequentially 2 If a 0 5 log or greater reduction in viral load did not occur by 6 wk of reinitiated therapy or less than 50 copies ml was not achieved within 20 wk of reinitiated therapy patients were withdrawn as therapy failures and a resistance test was performed 3 Patients were also withdrawn as therapy failures if a the CD4 cell number declined by more than 45 of the baseline CD4 count b participants developed an opportunistic infection even if retaining required CD4 count levels or c a viral load of greater than 500 000 copies ml occurred once with or without development of acute retroviral syndrome as defined by fever skin lesions and pharyngitis Phase I procedures for the continuous therapy arm included the following 1 patient monitoring if detected viremia was between 50 and 999 copies ml with the patient withdrawn if their viral load did not return to less than 50 copies ml immediately prior to phase II and 2 patient study withdrawal as therapy failure if during the 40 wk ART period viral load rebounded to more than 1 000 copies ml at two consecutive time points Phase II procedures for both arms included the following 1 monitoring for patient study withdrawal criteria as described in phase I 2 determining time to primary end point of a viral load greater than 5 000 copies ml 3 monitoring until the time of therapy reinitiation at a viral load greater than 30 000 copies ml for three consecutive time points and 4 after reinitiation of therapy follow up on therapy to confirm resuppression to less than 50 copies ml at 6 10 and 14 wk on therapy Clinical and laboratory parameters CD4 count and viral load were monitored at each visit and venous blood was collected for additional secondary outcomes during selected study visits In both phase I and II participants taking non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors NNRTIs were instructed to stop them a day earlier than the remaining drugs in the regimen Primary and Secondary Outcomes The primary outcome was time to confirmed virological rebound during phase II Rebound was defined as first time point with greater than 5 000 copies ml Viral replication magnitude as defined by mean HIV 1 plasma RNA area under the curve AUC HIV RNA was measured as a secondary outcome at weeks 12 and 20 of phase II based on reinitiation of therapy criteria outlined above Additional secondary outcomes included 1 safety outcomes serious adverse events SAEs and patient withdrawal based on criteria defined above 2 retention of ART mediated immune reconstitution and 3 detection of viral resistance Retention of immune reconstitution was analyzed by 1 same day whole blood flow cytometry based analysis of CD4 and CD8 T cells including total and na ve CD62 l CD45RA and memory CD45RO subsets as described 17 and 2 same day recall response analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cell lymphoproliferative responses to Candida albicans as described 17 Viral resistance mutations were retrospectively analyzed on cryopreserved plasma samples by genotyping of first available sample with viral load greater than 100 copies ml following each interruption using the TruGene Assay Visible Genetics Toronto Canada at the Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology San Francisco California United States as previously described 18 19 Sample Size The sample size required was calculated using PS 20 software and based on a type I error of 0 05 with 90 power to detect a difference of 4 wk or more in time to viral rebound between arms Eighteen patients per group resulted in sufficient power 18 for 90 13 for 80 to determine a difference of 4 wk or greater between groups in time to rebound of virus during the open ended interruption Assuming a loss to follow up of 15 we targeted 21 patients per group or 42 total Statistical Analysis The primary analysis was an intent to treat analysis in which dropouts were assigned a week 0 rebound time e g maximum failure to delay rebound In secondary analyses these dropouts were excluded The log rank test was used to test the null hypothesis of no difference between arms in the number of weeks from initiation of the open ended TI to reaching viral rebound as defined Patients not reaching end point at 26 wk after the beginning of the open ended TI were censored Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare baseline and week 0 of the open ended interruption between groups Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to test for no change from baseline to week 0 of phase II Finally Wilcoxon rank sum tests were employed to test between groups for equality of the mean AUC HIV RNA up to 12 and 20 wk In all cases a two sided alpha level of 0 05 was used to define statistical significance Unless otherwise stated results are presented as median interquartile range in text and tables Results Patient Flow and Discontinuations Trial patient flow is summarized in Figure 1 Between August 2000 and December 2003 42 patients at the Jonathan Lax Immune Disorder Clinic at the Philadelphia Field Initiating Group for HIV Trials were enrolled randomized and followed as shown in Figure 2 In the continuous therapy single interruption arm 16 of 21 patients reached the open ended interruption Reasons for study discontinuation in this arm were loss to follow up n 1 patient moved away and virological failure during continuous therapy n 4 further discussed below In the repeated interruptions arm 18 of 21 patients reached the open ended interruption following three TIs of 2 4 and 6 wk duration with median peak rises in viral loads of 136 50 2 590 13 651 180 222 589 and 18 887 3 893 96 101 copies ml respectively Median time to less than 50 copies ml after resumption of therapy was 2 0 4 3 1 8 12 and 9 5 2 12 wk respectively with 9 18 and 20 wk as the maximum time needed to achieve suppression in 100 of patients before reaching the open ended interruption Study discontinuation in the repeated interruptions arm was due to protocol violation n 1 patient restarted therapy during interruption out of protocol loss to follow up n 1 patient imprisoned and virological failure during on therapy period n 1 further discussed below Baseline Criteria and Follow Up The demographic and clinical characteristics of the two groups at baseline are summarized in Table 1 Seventy five percent of participants were on their second to fourth regimen while 25 were in their first regimen No significant difference was found in baseline parameters between arms with 33 47 of patients on protease inhibitor containing and 61 71 on NNRTI containing regimens Owing to the high participation of patients on NNRTI based regimens and concerns about TI and safety in general patient outcomes and treatment failure were reviewed monthly by the IRB of this study during the first 8 mo of study quarterly for the following 4 mo and semi annually thereafter Figure 2 shows study design for both arms with a median follow up of 41 41 42 wk during phase I for the continuous therapy single interruption arm and 42 30 51 wk for the repeated interruptions arm Follow up during phase II had a median duration of 27 wk in both arms continuous therapy single interruption arm 27 8 75 47 repeated interruptions arm 27 16 5 35 Following reinitiation of therapy after phase II patients suppressed viral replication to less than 50 copies ml by a median time of 10 6 12 wk in both arms excluding for two patients in the continuous therapy single interruption arm who elected to stay off ART indefinitely and one patient from the repeated interruptions arm who reported nonadherence following regimen reinitiation yet reached 52 copies ml before withdrawing from additional follow up Primary Outcome An intent to treat analysis of the time to viral rebound 5 000 copies ml in the open ended interruption showed no difference between groups continuous therapy single TI median 4 1 8 wk

in an as treated analysis did not alter conclusions single TI median 5 4 9 wk n 18 repeated TI median 6 4 8 wk n 16 p 0 05 Additional secondary analysis of the magnitude of viral load as shown in Figure 3 second panel showed similar viral replication as determined by mean AUC HIV RNA analysis at week 12 single TI median 124 621 23 326 262 348 AUC HIV RNA repeated TI median 100 400 47 221 365

No patient discontinuation in either group was due to study defined changes in CD4 cell count reviewed further below or due to study associated SAEs disease progression or acute retroviral syndrome However four non study related SAEs occurred two patients from the continuous therapy single interruption arm were hospitalized one for a cholecystectomy and one for acute rectal bleeding during the 40 wk ART period a patient from the repeated interruptions arm died of liver cancer during week 26 of the open ended interruption after previously reaching a viral load greater than 5 000 copies ml yet electing to stay off ART and a patient from the repeated interruptions arm developed a transient ileitis Immune reconstitution No significant difference was observed between groups in CD4 T cell counts at the start of phase II as illustrated in Figure 4 In addition no difference in the percentage of na ve CD4 cells or decrease of recall response to C albicans was observed confirming the absence of significant differences in the retention of baseline immune reconstitution correlates between arms However a significant decrease in the abundance of CD4 cells relative to other T cell types as summarized in CD4 but not in absolute CD4 count was present in the repeated TI arm corresponding to a significant increase in CD8 T cell count In spite of fluctuations in CD4 T cell count levels between the start and end of each monitored TI a recovery of CD4 count levels was achieved upon resuppression following each TI in conjunction with a retention of lymphoproliferative responses against C albicans before during and after each TI as illustrated in Figure 5 Viral resistance mutations and therapy failure An intent to treat analysis of the combined number of patients per arm with detected resistance mutations irrespective of therapy failure in phase I and during the final TI in phase II showed no significant difference between arms continuous therapy single TI 7 21 repeated TI 10 21 p 0 05 Study defined criteria for therapy failure of a previously suppressive regimen were met by 4 21 patients in the continuous therapy single interruption arm patients S37 S47 S52 and S59 in association with self reported nonadherence to therapy and detection of resistance mutations in phase I as listed in Table 2 One patient in the repeated interruptions arm 1 21 patient S56 failed therapy after 20 wk following the third TI by maintaining a viral load between 50 and 999 copies ml in the presence of previously undetected resistance mutations In patients who reached phase II in the absence of therapy failure a total of 12 patients were identified to have resistance mutations at the first viremic time point continuous therapy single TI 3 16 repeated TI 9 18 p 0 06 A greater number of resistance mutations was detected in the repeated interruption arm as summarized in Table 3 In ten out of these 12 patients a change in resistance patterns was observed when comparing the first viremic time point to the last All 11 of 12 patients in Table 3 who reinitiated therapy retained suppressive ability of their respective regimens as did all other patients who did not show resistance mutations in phase II In the repeated interruptions arm analysis of newly detected resistance mutations in phase II as defined by a lack of detection during viremic time points in phase I identified 3 18 patients patients S4 S22 and S43 with this pattern see notations in Table 3 Discussion Earlier reports on TI strategies in patients with chronic HIV infection include multiple pilot or single arm study designs centered on the effects on viral control by comparison with pre therapy periods detection of resistance mutations without parallel follow up of a continuously treated arm and inclusion of variable criteria regarding viral resuppression before proceeding with repeated TIs 11 12 14 16 In contrast our strategy mandated resuppression of viral replication to less than 50 copies ml before each TI and presents the first comparison of viral replication during a final open ended interruption of therapy between patients randomized to complete three sequential TIs or stay under continuous therapy Our data based on intent to treat analysis did not show that repeated TIs resulted in a clinically significant virological benefit as measured by the time to viral rebound to more than 5 000 copies ml see Figure 3 Secondary as treated analysis on viral replication magnitude also indicated a lack of difference between arms Consistent with the findings of SSITT 11 analysis of our data by the categorical classification of a responder as a patient with viral load less than 5 000 copies ml at week 12 off therapy showed no significant difference in this frequency between arms single TI 5 18 repeated TI 5 16 suggesting the presence of responders irrespective of previous protocol mandated TIs Based on secondary outcome measures the incidence of adverse events SAEs therapy failure and patient discontinuation or clinical disease progression as indicated by CD4 count on therapy or opportunistic infections was not observed to be different between arms Prospective safety outcomes in our study are in accordance with reports from a retrospective analysis of 1 290 patients who interrupted treatment at least once 3 mo without an increased risk of HIV associated morbidity or mortality with the exception of patients in Center for Disease Control and Prevention stage C during first interruption only 21 In regards to immunological outcomes a concern associated with interruption of suppressive therapy is the potential for irreversible viral mediated CD4 T cell loss leading to disease progression 6 22 We did not observe a decrease in CD4 cell numbers or lymphoproliferative responses against C albicans when measured between arms before the open ended TI see Figure 4 nor following resuppression after monitored TI reinitiation cycles in the repeated interruptions arm see Figure 5 The latter is consistent with observations by others and does not support an immediate immunological cost to short term TIs 12 14 15 16 23 However we do show that monitoring CD4 cell numbers by percentage could lead to misinterpreting a significant loss of CD4 cells as a result of a significant increase in CD8 count following TIs even though absolute CD4 count numbers remained unchanged see Figure 4 Interestingly the increase in CD8 T cell number also corresponded with an increase in HIV specific responses as measured by interferon gamma expression data not shown which in light of an absence of effect on viral load between arms further supports that TI strategies alone may not significantly alter the pre existing balance between viral replication and host antiviral responses 14 16 23 24 Importantly no evidence for an increase of viral resistance in association with therapy failure was present in the repeated interruptions arm See Table 2 We did not observe a greater clinical failure of NNRTI based regimens in the repeated interruption arm due to single drug periods as predicted by recently redefined drug half life estimates and the presence of viral replication during each interruption 25 26 27 However the percentage of patients with resistance mutations detected in this study in the repeated interruption arm 47 is higher than the 17 observed in the SSITT cohort 11 in which patients with prior treatment failures were excluded 28 We interpret this difference to mean that the resistance detected off drug in both our and their cohorts is likely associated with the greater number of drug experienced patients in our cohort 75 and the detection of prior archived resistance mutations as supported by Metzner et al 29 who documented in 14 25 56 SSITT patients the presence of minor populations of M184V occurring at least once off drug during interruption of therapy In spite of the lack of difference in the total number of patients with resistant mutations detected on therapy during phase I and off therapy in phase II 7 21 33 versus 10 21 47 respectively in both arms we do report in similarity to others a greater detection of resistance mutations in the TI arm when restricting analysis to the last off drug period only 29 30 as three of 16 18 had mutations detected off drug in the continuous therapy single interruption arm compared to nine of 18 50 in the repeated interruption arm However based on the lack of association between viral resistance detected off drug shortly after TI and resuppression by the same regimen in all patients it remains undetermined to what extent TIs favor the detection of archived mutations in chronically suppressed patients and to what extent these mutations are a signal for a future therapy failure The latter is best exemplified by the data we collected on patients on NNRTI based regimens in the repeated interruptions arm where two patients S19 and S43 showed K103N detection only during the off drug periods in the absence of therapy failure while maintaining the same regimen after each TI including post study follow up Table S1 On the other hand virological failure in the continued presence of an NNRTI based regimen in phase I was associated with detection of K103N as observed in one patient S56 in the repeated interruption arm and three patients S37 S52 and S59 in the continuous therapy arm with self reported non adherence Drug resistance that occurs during virological drug failure predicts virological responses to salvage treatment 31 32 33 In contrast the clinical implications of drug resistance mutations that appear shortly after TI in chronically suppressed patients are not clear Case reports in this cohort of patients have demonstrated that drug resistant variants that appeared during TIs may not persist in subsequent time points even after repeated use of the same antiretroviral regimen 19 34 We now observe that drug resistance appearing during TIs can be transient since 50 and 33 of patients listed in Table 3 showed complete and partial reversion to wild type respectively when comparing to resistance at the last available viremic time point in phase II See Table 3 Further we observed durable resuppression of plasma viral RNA level in many patients who had drug resistance mutations off therapy that would otherwise be expected to affect part of their treatment regimen when reinitiated see Table S1 Virus populations that expand shortly after TI may lack all of the adaptations required to achieve high levels of plasma viremia in the presence of drug during continuous treatment These adaptations may include the resistance associated mutations which were detected as well as secondary mutations that may increase the viral replication capacity 35 36 or envelope adaptations required to escape concurrent humoral immune responses 37 38 It is of interest to note that despite the large amount of research activity on TIs in patients with suppressed chronic infection and the hundreds of monitored interruptions studied to date only limited cases of development of clinical resistance as evidenced by a lack of viral resuppression following therapy reinitiation have emerged in contrast to the multiple reports of detection of viral sequences off ART associated with resistance as shown in this study and others 11 19 29 30 39 40 Taken together while our data show no clinically significant benefit for repeated TIs of less than 1 5 mo in patients with CD4 counts greater than 400 on therapy with regard to viral control as defined by time to rebound secondary outcomes document no significant difference in levels of retention of immune reconstitution between arms and no increased incidence of virological failure as a consequence of TIs While our data indicate that this TI strategy should not be pursued outside of a clinical trial setting we argue that it will be important to collect additional data on the potential benefits of drug sparing regimens such as reduced long term toxicity and reduced cost and to define long term outcomes in comparison with continuous therapy Supporting
