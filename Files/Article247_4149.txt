 Duff Rebuffed Yeltsin Struts Massa Honey but of course your role in life is to cheer me up And it has taken only four days to convince you Perhaps I should run for something Couldn t agree more that the four guys looking the strongest wouldn t be disasters well maybe three Not sure about Bush making his bones as the education president either As for ESPN transmitted directly to the brain if you think that s a good idea then you need reeducating As for considering Lasik the laser eye surgery I think it works only for one of the sighted difficulties near or far But it is effective However I love the way glasses look If glasses are your trademark you may want to think twice before ditching them I mean without them you might be just one more nondescript handsome guy Just before I push away from the Breakfast Table you should know that the latest online is that the old drunk I mean the Russian president reminded Clinton that Moscow has a nuclear potential Yeltsin is also cozying up to the Chinese head of state Jiang Zemin They and their wives met for a family dinner in Beijing Think the women had a lot to say to each other Think there was alcohol served Also on the wires if you can believe it is that Ms Duff was rebuffed shall we now call that being reduffed by a New York State Supreme Court judge in her bid to be awarded more than 100 000 A MONTH in child support from Ron Perelman It seems that their child Caleigh what kind of name is that anyway will not get her mother s requested 130 000 playroom The way I washed that taste out of my mouth was to follow some coverage of the thousands of mourners for the six Worcester firefighters It makes the world seem a more admirable place when you consider that there are good and selfless people with values and heart And I found it enormously touching that firefighters came from all over the country It is indeed a brotherhood of bravery Alas I do not know of your Charles Barkley Alben I do remember When it comes to sports I am shall we say not present Some might say non compos I have asked Sam Snead and Bob Cousy what they did for a living and at my first Blackhawks game it took me 40 minutes to realize they players were on skates Which is why our leader M Kinsley by name no doubt asked me to be the advice columnist for Slate as opposed to the sportswriter And it is to my more serious Dear Prudence persona that I now return I shall miss the opportunity to be flip about the day s happenings and I shall particularly miss being joined at the modem to you Massa Honey I ll be rooting for you in your yearlong quest for the perfect political story xxM
