 Background The genome of higher eukaryotes codes for most of its proteins through short coding sequences exons interrupted by non coding sequences introns These intervening sequences must be removed precisely after transcription of the gene a process called splicing Splicing is carried out by the spliceosome a large complex consisting of proteins and small nuclear RNAs snRNAs 1 2 3 RNA splicing is dependent upon the identity of nucleotide sequences at the exon intron boundaries The 5 boundary or donor site of introns in most eukaryotes contains the dinucleotide GU while the 3 boundary or acceptor site contains the dinucleotide AG These GU AG motifs are merely parts of longer consensus sequences that span the 5 and 3 splice sites With the exception of the conserved canonical GU and AG at the 5 and 3 splice sites splice site sequences may contain several deviations from the consensus The match of a splice site to this consensus reflects the strength of the site In addition a third conserved intronic sequence that is known to be functionally important in splicing is the branch point located 10 50 nucleotides upstream from the AG dinucleotide The branch point is characterised by a rather weak consensus sequence YURAY 4 In the first step of splicing the 2 hydroxyl of an adenosine of the branch point attacks the phosphate at the 5 splice site producing a free 5 exon and a lariat intermediate During the second step the 3 hydroxyl of the 5 exon attacks the phosphate at the 3 splice site yielding a ligated mRNA and a lariat intron Now that the total human genome has been sequenced the surprising outcome is that differences between humans and other organisms are not reflected by the genome complexity Alternative splicing might play a role in this apparent discrepancy Alternative splicing is an important mechanism to create protein diversity and to regulate gene expression in a tissue or developmental specific manner To understand the mechanism of alternative splice site selection the identification of all cis acting elements that contribute to the efficiency with which splice sites are recognised must be taken into account These include 1 the strength of the 3 and 5 splice sites which can be calculated using the consensus values that were determined by Shapiro and Senepathy 5 or by the Splice Site Prediction program by Neural Networks SSPNN http www fruitfly org seq_tools splice html which takes more known sequences into account 2 the branch point sequences and 3 certain sequences such as exonic splicing enhancers ESE that can activate the use of a weak 3 splice site or elements such as exonic splicing silencer elements ESS that inhibit splicing 1 In addition to these cis acting elements exon length 6 and secondary structure have also been mentioned to play a role in splicing 7 Neurofibromatosis type 1 NF1 is an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder affecting one in 3500 individuals 8 The gene spans 350 kb of genomic DNA and encodes approximately 13 kb mRNA containing 60 exons Three exons 9br 23a and 48a are known to be subjected to alternative splicing and these isoforms were also detected at the protein level with isoform specific antibodies 9 10 Four additional alternative transcripts were described ex29 ex30 ex29 30 and the N isoform but no further analysis at the protein level was reported 11 12 During mutation analysis in the NF1 gene we disclosed several additional splice variants in which specific exons were skipped and that were also present in fresh lymphocytes of non affected persons albeit typically at a low level 13 Several other studies also report the existence of lowly expressed splice NF1 variants Some of these variants are more abundant when RNA is analysed from aged blood or from blood that was kept at a non physiological temperature 13 14 15 16 Starting from this initial observation we were interested to determine the extent of aberrant and or alternative splicing in NF1 A RT PCR plasmid library was made to identify new NF1 splice variants We have made a survey of these variants and searched systematically for a number of factors involved in splice site selection aiming to explain the observed variants Results and discussion Identification of novel NF1splice variants in normal cells The entire NF1 coding region from two normal non affected individuals was amplified in 5 overlapping segments by RT PCR according to Heim 17 starting from fresh blood leukocytes As expression of specific NF1 transcripts can change due to environmental changes 13 14 15 16 18 we extracted the RNA immediately after blood drawing allowing to identify splice variants that are not induced by stress factors Plasmid libraries were created and 150 colonies per fragment were lysed and reamplified with the same primers in order to search for the presence of minor splice variants The PCR products were digested with a restriction enzyme and separated by electrophoresis on an agarose gel Fig 1 For the five fragments a total of 114 clones out of 750 colonies in total showed a different restriction pattern Sequence analysis of the inserts revealed that these represented NF1 transcripts with specific insertions deletions Some of these resulted from cryptic splice site usage others were found to have deletions precisely at the exon boundaries exon skipping very few resulted from intron retention All variants that were found are summarised in Fig 2 Transcripts containing more than one change per single transcript were also identified Some changes were in frame 14 variants green in Fig 2 others were out of frame 32 variants red in Fig 2 and hence would lead to a premature stop codon All together 46 different transcripts were detected The number of abnormal sized transcripts is not exhaustive as only 150 colonies per fragment were analysed 750 colonies in total The frequency of each clone captured is indicated between brackets in Fig 2 This frequency might indicate that some NF1 transcripts are more abundant in blood as compared to rarer NF1 transcript variants Some of these variants have been independently observed by other groups NF1ins4a 2 14 15 16 NF1 E4b 14 15 16 NF1 E7 15 19 NF1 E29 E30 11 NF1 E30 11 NF1 E33 16 NF1 E34 16 NF1 E37 15 16 NF1 E43 16 NF1 7605 7675 16 and NF1 E45 16 Some of these transcripts increased with time or cold shock 14 16 It has been shown that 30 of NF1 germline mutations result in splicing errors 13 20 The vast majority of them are due to alterations outside the canonical AG GT acceptor and donor splice sites Some of the splice variants identified in this study are identical to misspliced transcripts formed by the mutant allele carrying a specific mutation in NF1 patients 11 variants blue in Fig 2 For example the NF1 2618_2850 transcript was found in a NF1 patient carrying an IVS16 3del6 13 mutation In this patient mutation at the splice donor of exon 16 leads to the constitutively activation of the cryptic donor present in exon 16 at position 2618 that normally is used in only a minor proportion of the transcripts Role of splice site strength in splice site selection Intensive effort has already been made to understand the mechanisms involved in splice site selection Because we detected such a large group of variants in one single gene a detailed examination of the different parameters that play a role in alternative splice regulation could be performed and compared statistically Early splice site choice in mammals involves protein protein interactions across the exon as is proposed in the exon definition model of Berget 21 Exon definition is mediated in part by SR proteins bridging between the small nuclear ribonucloprotein snRNP U1 at a downstream 5 splice site and the U2AF heterodimer at the upstream 3 splice site First we calculated the strength of the 5 and 3 splice sites of all constitutive and alternative exons and of all deletions and insertions reported in this study Calculations were performed using the S plice S ite P rediction by N eural N etwork SSPNN http www fruitfly org seq_tools splice html program Table 1 In general sequences that show a better match to the consensus sequences indicated by a higher calculated score are considered to be strong as specificity of the splicing reaction is mediated in part by RNA RNA interactions between these sequences and snRNA molecules The calculated scores demonstrate that deletions or insertions sometimes occur at strong cryptic splice sites e g the NF1 2618_2850 variant whereas in a few cases no or only a weak consensus splice site was found score of 0 7 underscored in Table 1 e g NF1 5701_6946 The latter might result from aberrant splicing or PCR artefacts We wanted to examine whether an association exists between the observed splicing pattern and splice site strength To this end a comparison of the scores was made between those single exons that were spliced out in a fraction of the mRNA bold in Table 1 including the alternative exons 9br 23a and 48a and the mean values for all NF1 exons Table 2 Skipping of more than one exon probably involves other factors and mechanisms than those based on splice parameters alone The exon definition model is no more applicable as the distance would be too long to accommodate exon bridging interactions Therefore only exons that were spliced out individually were compared to the mean values The SSPNN program gave the exons that can become skipped a significantly lower score 0 63 p 0 03 at the acceptor site compared to the mean NF1 acceptor score for all NF1 exons 0 81 No such correlation could be found at the donor site Exon bridging interactions may occur less efficiently as a result of weak binding of splice factors at the acceptor site thus modulating the splicing efficiency This finding underlines the importance of the acceptor site in splice site selection This is in agreement with a recent study 22 in which it was shown that mutating the acceptor site to a stronger site was more effective for full intron splicing of an alternative intron than strengthening the donor site Likewise there was an inverse relationship found between the length of the polythimidine tract which influences the acceptor strength at the exon 9 acceptor site and the proportion of exon 9 deleted CFTR mRNA transcripts 23 Our results indicate that acceptor splice site strength is an important parameter in the regulation of NF1 splicing Role of branch point position and strength Some studies have pointed to the importance of the branch point in alternative splicing 24 25 The distance between the branch point and the 3 splice site and the base pairing of the branch point with the U2RNA is important for splicing The majority of branch points used in vertebrate splicing are between 10 and 50 nucleotides upstream from the acceptor splice site We have analysed 1 the position of the putative branch point sequence and 2 the match of the putative branch point sequence to the loosely defined consensus YURAY We developed a program to calculate the strength of a branch point The region between 50 and 10 upstream from the acceptor site was examined for a branch point signal and the corresponding branch point score was calculated Table 1 A relatively low score points to a suboptimal branch point or to a branch point situated outside the chosen window 50 10 Branch points located at long distances are also suboptimal However mean branch point strength Table 2 was not significantly lower p 0 411 for the exons associated with skipping Role of secondary structure in splice site selection Recently it was suggested that NF1 exon skipping events could be explained by structural alterations in possible higher free energy structures of the pre mRNA at the donor site 19 Here in it was hypothesised that when an alternative structure is too different from the lowest free energy structure ground state this sequence is not recognised by the splicing machinery and that as a consequence the corresponding exon becomes skipped We further elaborated this hypothesis by comparing the lowest free energy structures of the donor and acceptor sites of all exons that were prone to skipping bold in Table 1 to their first higher free energy structures using the mfold program 26 27 Some structures showed remarkable alterations between both energy states but many others did not at all A representative example is given in figure 3where a striking structural change was found between the energy states of the donor of exon 7 Fig 3A 3B On the other hand very similar structures were obtained for the donor of exon 4b Fig 3C 3D although this exon was shown to be skipped in a significant part of the mRNA in several tissues unpublished results using the highly accurate real time PCR technique 28 Moreover when the window is displaced over a few nucleotides as exemplified here for exon 8 the ground state alters considerably Fig 3E 3F demonstrating the difficulty of assigning significance to these in silico results These data indicate that one has to be extremely careful when correlating exon skipping events to secondary structure predictions Limitations of the mathematical model uncertainties in the thermodynamic parameters and influences of the secondary structure in vivo by specific interactions of RNA protein complexes limit the prediction capacities of secondary structure by these programs On the other hand comparison of the ground state of a mutant donor site as was done for G1185 1U and G1185 1A in 19 to the higher energy structure of the normal donor is superfluous to explain skipping It is well known that splice sites mutated at their highly conserved AG GT bases are not recognised anymore by the splicing machinery since recognition e g of the splice donor by the U1snRNP is mainly directed by RNA RNA base pairing 29 30 Conclusions The data presented in this study indicate that splicing in NF1 is extremely complex Although several alternative transcripts have been found previously for the NF1 gene 9 10 11 12 we identified multiple novel NF1 splice variants and made a survey of them This large catalogue of variants detected in one single gene allowed to perform a comparative analysis of the factors involved in splice regulation in order to explain the observed variants We performed an extensive analysis of different splicing parameters These include the strength of the 5 and 3 splice site the branch point strength and secondary structure predictions at the donor and acceptor site On the basis of the analysed features we can conclude that an interplay of various factors is involved in regulation of NF1 splicing Competition between the alternative splice sites depends on the relative quality of the different constitutive splice signals and we found that the acceptor strength probably plays a major role in this regulation The functional significance of the transcripts identified in this study still remains unclear What fraction of the splicing represents noise caused by the relaxation of the RNA splicing is currently unknown Although the RNA was extracted immediately after blood drawing excluding as far as possible influences due to stress factors some splice events occurred at non consensus splice sites and probably represent aberrant splicing However some of these novel identified transcripts could potentially encode proteins of different sizes and may have distinct roles Further research was started to analyse tissue specific expression of several transcripts Preliminary results show that some transcripts are highly expressed in specific tissues demonstrating that splicing in NF1 may be regulated in a tissue specific manner Further analysis of these transcripts is needed and it will remain a challenging task to elucidate the biological significance of all of them Materials and methods RNA isolation and cDNA

cycle sequencing kit Amersham Biosciences and analysed on an ALF express automated DNA sequencer Amersham Biosciences Nomenclature for the description of the different NF1transcripts In order to clearly describing the identity ID of the transcripts following nomenclature was used The ID of all transcript variants start with NF1 followed by Sequence changes are all described at the RNA level with 1 first base of methionine ATG at the start Numbering system for insertions are based on the NF1 genomic sequence Genbank Accession Nr AC004526 Deletions are designated with the symbol insertions

window of 50 10 with respect to the acceptor site A program was written in DELPHI to calculate the strength of a branch point Every 5 nucleotide sequence within the window was evaluated as a potential branch point The standard branch point sequence weight table 4 was used to assign a score at every 5 nucleotide sequence within the window The computed score reflects how closely it resembles known branch point sequences The sequence with the highest score was selected as the putative branch point Secondary structures The mfold computer program version 3 0 http bioinfo math rpi edu mfold rna form1 cgiwas used to predict the RNA secondary structure and to calculate the folding free energy 26 27 We have computed the minimum free energy structures from all the donor and acceptor sites of the 60 exons of NF1 within a window of 100 bp It has been proposed 31 that there is a window of about 100 nucleotides after transcription where the pre mRNA is free to fold The size of this window would be defined by the time taken for the protein complexes to bind as the nascent RNA emerges Statistical analysis The one way ANOVA test was used to assess significance in the comparison of mean values
