interesting question Why is the press so afraid of Steven Brill Short of cases of outright lying la Janet Cooke or Stephen Glass I cannot recall reporters so viciously going after one of their own One answer is that Brill has gone a long way toward turning off the golden spigot of leaks from Kenneth Starr s office The broader reason is that Brill has had the temerity to breach the inky wall of silence that largely protects reporters from being subject to the same rules of exposure they expect everyone else to live by Two of Saletan s points are especially absurd One is that it now apparently is not enough to disclose the sources of the information in a story Brill also should have disclosed h ow and with whose input he chose to focus his investigation on Starr s manipulation of the press rather than Clinton s If that is the new rule why didn t Saletan disclose in his article how and with whose input he chose to focus on Brill What are his hidden motives The other bit of nonsense is the complaint that Brill relied on authority from the D C Circuit Court of Appeals about the scope of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6 e but didn t cite supposed conflicting authority The problem for Kenneth Starr is that his grand jury is in the D C circuit and unless and until the Supreme Court takes up this issue it is that court s rulings that bind him regardless what the rulings may be in other circuits Brill who trained as a lawyer understands that Saletan does not Eric Summergrad Washington Slate s Fragile Egos Jacob Weisberg in Brill Mote and Beam and William Saletan in Brill s Con Game both display clear outrage at Brill s magazine piece Their outrage was also shared by the talking heads on all the Sunday shows What comes across to an objective viewer is that Weisberg Saletan and the press in general feel emotionally that they are collectively above criticism and that Brill has violated a taboo I am surprised I had thought better of Weisberg and Saletan That they feel their egos were punctured by even an intimation that the press was in the wrong in its Starr coverage tells something about them Ed O Connell Overkill on Brill Little hard on Brill here aren t we Two separate exhaustive shots posted simultaneously When it comes to accountability the establishment media have the biggest glass jaw in the world and its pre emptive atomic carpet bombing of Brill s Content only proves it Brill or Drudge tootles along and everyone in the McLean Russert West 57 th Street axis whines and moans about professionalism and standards Then comes the CNN Time sarin story to prove the professionals deserve all the scrutiny anyone else can muster Give the guy a shot I d leave the strangulation in cradle attempts to CBS News Slate is part of the revolution not the establishment If you join the Old Guard aboard the torpedo Content before anyone s even read the piece in question bandwagon it s less salutary for you On the other hand you did manage to use the great word rebarbative in the June 17 Culturebox so I m not altogether unhappy Tom Farmer Seattle Steve Brillos the Press Thou dost protest too much Brill s magazine has accomplished with its first issue what years of public criticism of the press could not Now someone has done unto you what you have been doing to others Unbiased press hogwash Gwendolyn M Johnson We re Not Boring Honest Next time you describe the Columbia Journalism Review in an article it would be better if your writer took a look at a few recent issues before typing We call this reporting The soporific thing Jacob Weisberg so offhandedly invents in Brill Mote and Beam bears no resemblance to CJR and we re surprised the false description got past your editors We invite Slate readers to come to their own conclusions Check out the contents page of our strong current July August issue or read some back issues including our own look at coverage of the Starr Lewinsky saga which ran four months ago via our Web site Mike Hoyt Senior editor Columbia Journalism Review Bugs in the House Permit me to congratulate you on your fine sense of humor In Getting Buggy Wit It Andrew Shuman wrote an excellent article on the joys of bug finding and bug squashing and on that same day you published the Slate table of contents with bugs Very droll I had to chuckle when I used Netscape 4 04 on a Solaris 2 5 1 Sparc 5

conclude that the Street values the offline stores at next to nothing There s an alternative explanation My wife and I have been regular customers of Amazon but we recently tried barnesandnoble com Without revisiting the multiple e mails and telephone calls that we had to exchange before finally obtaining a book the experience left us more determined to shop with Amazon More importantly my desire to walk into a physical Barnes Noble shop has diminished At least for us the online version of Barnes Noble has reduced the value of the offline version thereby rationalizing the Street s valuation Steve Philbrick Rumors for Breakfast Regarding the dialogue between Susan Estrich and David Brooks in The Breakfast Table June 22 Now I know that I can t have a beer with a friend in a public bar in Washington without being accused of impropriety by one of President Clinton s ever watchful partisans So be it I ll make some concessions to the need to avoid imagined appearances of impropriety But I ll have a beer with anyone I damned well please To put in perspective the conspiratorial inferences that Estrich strains to draw from seeing me with Starr deputy Jackie Bennett at the Jefferson Hotel bar a block or so from the Washington Post where I always go when I m looking for a secure locale in which to do furtive things perhaps Estrich should know that I also had some beers recently with a member of the Clinton defense team We were at his home where no peeping partisans intruded To be clear Jackie Bennett was not leaking to me he was not telling me what to write or say on television it was not a business appointment at all Bennett evidently troubled and hurt by my former employer Steven Brill s ugly portrayal of him had asked if we could get together for a private and personal conversation to help him understand why a man whose fairness I had mistakenly touted to Bennett would write a catalog of falsehoods and distortions about Bennett and Starr painting them both as criminals I had readily agreed because I like Bennett and I felt I owed him the best perspective I could give on Brill s article the extreme tendentiousness of which had surprised me I had asked Bennett whether we should find a spot where he would run no risk of catching flak by being seen with me Bennett had indicated that he was not going to let the risk of encountering malicious gossipmongers dictate which bars he could frequent Our conversation moved from Brill s article to other nonconfidential matters such as the legal rules curbing what Starr s office can say to reporters to matters like Bennett s sons my daughters mutual acquaintances and other matters that even so creative a mind as Brill s might have trouble painting as grand jury secrets After the arrival of Estrich Bennett and I also wondered idly whether she would seize the chance to misrepresent our conversation as something unseemly about which Bennett should be embarrassed This she has now done Bennett was not embarrassed I am not embarrassed It is Estrich who should be embarrassed for having concocted a fantasy to serve her partisan agenda Stuart Taylor Jr Address your e
