Arizona University in 1995 is seeking 1 million in punitive damages for an education he says makes him a fraud Other litigants are suing over degrees that were never awarded A student who had enrolled at Lorain County Community College in Ohio in 1993 but never graduated from the school s nursing program is suing for breach of contract and violation of consumer protection laws Community College Week reports According to that publication the student contended that the catalogue of course offerings and academic policies created a contract that obligated the college to provide him with a

the suit stating Ohio does not recognize educational malpractice claims for public policy reasons Cutting Off the Nose According to the Southern Illinois University Daily Egyptian SIU s medical school has changed its long standing policy of cutting the limbs off of cadavers to fit them into wardrobe boxes before shipping them off to be cremated An e mail message sent to local media and the Illinois Board of Higher Education had claimed that student workers were employed to remove the limbs and that the policy was designed to save money Both charges turned out to be false But the school of medicine has stated that in the future no student workers will work with cadavers or disintegrated anatomical remains Further we will no longer physically alter anatomical remains SIU says the new policy is more respectful of people who have donated their remains to the cause of science In other cadaver news a technique developed by a German anatomy professor named Gunther von Hagens which allows him to preserve and study the body in detail has occasioned protest Plastination as the preservation method is called involves the replacement of blood by a colored polymer which maintains its

really looked like Hildegard Hammerschmidt Hummel believes the closest likeness may be a death mask most other scholars think is a fake Hammerschmidt Hummel working with a team of scientists using advanced photographic techniques found close similarities between the mask and a famous bust of Shakespeare which she believes was copied from it In particular the bust bears traces of three small swellings on the nasal corner of the left eye swellings that are evident on the death mask as well The mask also shows a swelling in the upper left eyelid which according to Professor Walter Lerche head of the Horst Schmidt eye clinic in Wiesbaden Germany could be evidence of a rare form of cancer that may have killed the bard British Shakespeare scholars remain skeptical both of the death mask s authenticity and of the possibility of discovering Shakespeare s true face All Politics Is Local Another NYU video controversy NYU s Project on Media Ownership under the direction of journalism Professor Mark Crispin Miller recently completed a study of the effects of local television news on the civic life of Baltimore PROMO s report claimed that local TV news foments fear and hostility among city residents and suburbanites alike by devoting a disproportionate share of its broadcast time to crime Such inadvertent anti urban propaganda also hurts Baltimore s reputation and economy But the nonprofit research firm Public Agenda whose polls PROMO used for the report has publicly disavowed it In its own press release given to the Baltimore Sun and posted on the organization s Web site Public Agenda charged that PROMO s report while using data that are technically correct distorts Public Agenda s findings by presenting them in a biased context and tone In particular the pollsters charge that PROMO downplayed the extent to which respondents fear of crime was based on the experience of crime 53 percent of those polled had said that they or someone they loved had been the victim of a crime Miller stands by his conclusions and insists that anyone who reads my overview and their report will see that there is absolutely no disagreement Girls Girls Girls New York University has filed a lawsuit against the operators of a soft porn Web site The site purported to display footage picked up from an NY University Dorm Cam of young women dressed in skimpy clothing bearing the NYU insignia cavorting in a room decorated with NYU paraphernalia The site promises that the women will romp for your enjoyment in their own dorm room Visitors to the site have included journalistic bon vivant Anthony Haden Guest who noted in a recent Talk of the Town piece for The New Yorker that among the humdrum vulgarities that have become the bread and butter of the Internet one can cop a peek at some female NYU students who have wired up their dorm room But the university s suit refers to the rompers as alleged NYU co eds and assures all concerned that there is no NYU Dorm Cam installed in any NYU dorm room The Class System Students at less prestigious British universities will soon be able to take courses with such Oxford and Cambridge luminaries as physicist Steven Hawking literary critic Terry Eagleton and paleontologist Richard Dawkins through a national system of video linkups The plan has drawn criticism on a number of fronts Some say it slights the teaching abilities and intellectual talents of professors who don t happen to be world famous but who do a perfectly good job instructing their pupils at places such as Bristol or Newcastle Others point out that world class scholars don t always make the best teachers and worry that the videos will pacify the minds of students rather than stimulate them It would be like watching television a professor at Brunel University told the Sunday Times of London which published a story about the proposal You would lose that excitement of a live performance on a stage Doctor s Fees University of New Orleans historian and best selling author Stephen Ambrose is credited as a consultant on Stephen Spielberg s World War II epic Saving Private Ryan But Ambrose did his consulting after the film was completed According to a story in the New York Observer Spielberg s people approached Ambrose this past spring and arranged a screening for him Once he d seen the film which he loved Ambrose signed on for less than 100
