 Introduction Delirium is not a disease in itself but a syndrome of acute cerebral inefficiency affecting the brain in various ways It creates a deleterious effect on cognitive functions such as consciousness orientation perception attention short term memory judgment and abstract thinking 1 2 Delirium is a temporary condition which can occur suddenly or slowly over a period of hours or days A single episode lasts up to 1 week The symptoms may be so slight they go unnoticed or so serious they could be life threatening The clinical signs of delirium are changeable all day and are usually more serious during early morning or night Temporary changes in clinical signs are important characteristics of delirium While the patient may appear well and communicative during an observation changes in orientation could occur a few minutes later 1 3 Delirium is typically an indicator of a physical pathology and a worsening prognosis 1 4 5 6 It is commonly unrecognized or misdiagnosed by physicians treating critically ill patients The rate of misdiagnosis has been reported as 32 67 in various reviews 6 7 Clinical evaluation is the most important criterion and electroencephalography is the most useful test for diagnosis Although delirium can be experienced in all age groups it has an increased frequency at more advanced ages 2 3 Risk factors determined for the syndrome include age 7

ICUs 4 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 19 and psychosocial environment 1 3 5 20 Furthermore subclinical cerebral damage increased adenylate cyclase in the central nervous system and nutritional status identified by albumin level are predisposing factors for postoperative delirium 1 Interleukin 2 monoclonal antibodies and ifosfamide have also been suspected recently as factors 15 The aim of the present study was to confirm and or determine predisposing factors for delirium Materials and methods Between January 1996 and 1997 we screened prospectively for delirium 818 consecutive general surgery patients at the Dicle University Hospital All patients whether hospitalized for elective or emergency services or whether treated with medication or surgery were kept for a period of time in our ICU Ten nurses four physicians and four staff work daily in the ICU department The ICU has 24 beds with continuous non invasive monitoring and ventilators There are windows in the bed areas of the ICU Trained clinician researchers carried out daily structured interviewers with the patients from admission until hospital discharge Suspected cases of delirium were identified during the daily interview Patients with changes in their status of consciousness n 150 were consulted by an experienced consultation liaison psychiatrist S Delirium was defined as an organic mental disorder involving a confusional state with attention deficit disorganized thinking and a fluctuating course and acute development The diagnosis of delirium was based on the criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders revised third edition and established through a psychiatric interview Table 1 Patients who had history of severe dementia or had abused psychoactive drugs and alcohol were excluded from our study Delirium was diagnosed in 90 patients Patients were divided into two groups the DG n 90 and the NDG n 728 Analysis of whole blood count arterial blood gases biochemistry and urine culture antibiograms of blood urine or other secretions and radiological examinations such as chest X ray were performed on all delirious and non delirious patients All abnormal findings during delirium related to physical conditions laboratory features and additional diseases were evaluated as probable risk factors for delirium Findings for risk factors included respiratory disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cor pulmonale pneumothorax hemothorax etc symptomatic infection fever 38 C hypotension symptomatic or systolic blood pressure 80 mmHg anemia 25 htc hypertension 90 160

cardiac disease symptomatic coronary heart disease and arrhythmias heart failure etc emergency admission status age length of stay in the ICU LSICU length of stay in hospital LSH and gender Patients were grouped according to their diagnosis The groupings included hepatobiliopancreatic diseases HBP fistulas traumas acute abdominal diseases malignancies ileus and others The patients who had delirium were treated initially for etiological diseases but when the treatment was insufficient medication with diazepam or haloperidole was added Biostatistical evaluation was carried out on an IBM compatible personal computer using SPSS 10 1 software The Student t test for continuing variables and the chi square test for categoric variables were used To identify factors independently related to the development of delirium we also performed forward stepwise conditional logistic regression P 0 05 was considered statistically significant Results Of 818 patients 386 47 2 were male and 432 52 8

gender Discussion Delirium a syndrome associated with long hospital stays and high rates of morbidity and mortality 10 is a sign of deterioration in the homeostasis and physical status of the patient 17 Approximately 10 15 of patients on general surgical wards and 15 25 of patients on general medical wards experience delirium during their hospital stay Approximately 30 of patients in surgical ICUs and cardiac ICUs and 40 50 of patients who are recovering from hip fractures have an episode of delirium 1 22 The delirium rate is 10 40 in cancer patients 23 but increases to 85 in patients with advanced malignancies 15 Delirium is seen in 18 of the patients when the ICU facility has windows but rises to 40 of the cases when the ICU facility has no windows 11 It has been determined that preoperative risk factors for delirium were older age 24 25 26 prior cognitive impairment 24 25 pre existing cerebrovascular or other brain diseases history of prior delirium 25 preoperative abnormal sodium 24 vision or hearing impairment 24 26 and regular use of psychotropic drugs before admission 24 In this series 11 of our patients had delirium 34 4 n 31 of these were older than 60 years The youngest patient was 15 years old and the eldest was 91 years old All of our patients most of whom were younger than 60 years old were kept in an ICU with windows This may be responsible for the low frequency of delirium in this series Although the age of delirious patients were higher than that of the NDG t 6 4 P 0 000 age was not determined as a predicting factor for delirium P 0 05 in the logistic regression test in our study The rate of delirium has a predominance in males 10 27 We found that the number of delirious male patients was significantly higher than female patients 2 10 5 P 0 001 although gender was not a predictive factor for delirium P 0 05 in the logistic regression The prevalence of delirium in the Emergency Department was 9 6 28 In this series the rate of delirium was 18 5 in emergency admissions similar to Kishi s series 16 29 but emergency admission was not considered a factor for delirium The etiology of delirium is complex and usually consists of multiple factors In 80 95 of delirious patients the etiology is secondary to organic factors but it is difficult to interpret further details 5 6 7 Imbalances of electrolytes metabolic changes intoxication or absence of drugs trauma of head and postoperative state are the most common etiological factors Other less common factors are infections intracranial lesions coma fever cardiovasculary diseases poisons polymedication and deficiencies of vitamins 4 5 26 28 30 Anti cholinergic drugs are also commonly accused agents 5 Surgical stress and infectious fever are common factors in geriatric patients 14 Francis et al 12 reported that abnormal sodium levels fever hypothermia and azotemia were independent predictors for delirium in elderly patients Foreman 31 determined that hypernatremia hypokalemia hyperglycemia azotemia hypotension and polymedication were predictors for delirium in a prospective study Some predisposing factors determined in our study were respiratory disease 14 1 hypotension 17 anemia 16 4 hyponatremia 11 7 azotemia 10 8 and metabolic acidosis 7 6 The major neurotransmitter hypothesized as involved in delirium is acetylcholine and the major neuro anatomical area is the reticular formation 2 Electrolyte imbalance and azotemia may be responsible for the decrease in acetylcholine activity in the brain Symptomatic infection and fever were other independent predictors of delirium Delirium has been reported in infectious diseases such as diverticulitis 32 pneumonia 33 and typhoid fever 34 Certainly fever is concomitant with many infections and experimental data have supported a casual relation between fever and delirium Fever and infection correlated with delirium in our study as independent predictors in the multivariate logistic regression Cytokines and or bacterial toxins and cerebral metabolic changes may be causes of the mental changes associated with infection To perform specific treatment it is important to determine the etiological factor Arterial blood gases and current and past vital signs should be checked to establish whether cerebral hypoxemia or hypertensive encephalopathy is present The patient with hypoglycemic induced delirium virtually always has a history of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus Hypoglycemic delirium is also hyperadrenergic Hypotension can result from multiple etiologies such as decreased cardiac output from a myocardial infarction cardiac failure or arrhythmias and anemia All medical conditions that cause hypotension can lead to a decrease in brain oxygenation 1 In this study we predicted that respiratory diseases anemia and hypotension were effective in delirium by decreasing brain oxygenation Research into patients who developed hepatic failure suggests that the gamma aminobutyric acid system is important in the development of hepatic encephalopathy i e hypoactive delirium caused by liver dysfunction Specifically endogenous benzodiazepine like substances may play a role in delirium associated with hepatic failure 1 In our study delirium was seen in 12 9 of HBP The abnormalities such as elevated level of hepatic enzymes hyperbilirubinemia hypocalcemia and hyperamylasemia associated with HBP were strongly predictive factors for delirium This condition showed that early intervention was important in HBP cases The existence of hyperactive hypoactive or mixed clinical subtypes of delirium is widely accepted The hyperactive subtype was more frequent 46 5 than the unspecified 27 3 and hypoactive subtypes 26 2 35 In a series consisting of cancer patients it was observed that the hyperactive type which has a shorter duration is the most commonly seen subtype of delirium with a rate of 71 36 In our study 56 7 of delirious patients had hyperactive subtype There is no specific drug used for management of delirium The first step of treatment is trying to calm down the patient and to identify the underlying cause 1 3 13 The second step is treating the causative factors when determinable If causative factors are undeterminable then efforts should be directed to preventing permanent damage 1 3 Butyrophenones haloperidole thiothixene and droperidole and benzodiazepins diazepam oksazepam and lorazepam are the recommended drugs for sedation and preventing agitation 16 37 38 In this series we treated the etiological factors in all patients and gave diazepam to 31 1 of the patients and haloperidole to 13 3 of the patients Both surgeons and anesthesiologists could reduce the incidence of delirium in the patients who are at high risk by carefully ordering and monitoring the dosages of drugs and watching for signs of cardiac ischemia during the perioperative period 8 10 The practice of polymedication should not be given up 8 30 The goal in diagnosis is to discover reversible causes for delirium In this study series we determined that conditions such as disease or symptom variables respiratory diseases symptomatic infections fever anemia hypotension and laboratory variables hypocalcemia hyponatremia azotemia elevated liver enzymes hyperamylasemia hyperbilirubinemia and metabolic acidosis were predicting factors for delirium Clinicians must identify specific etiologies when possible and apply appropriate treatment Competing interests None declared Abbreviations CI confidence interval DG delirious group HBP
