 Missing Person Why like a regretful mother unchained ghost do I hover over old photos when I m home for Christmas or Thanksgiving as if I d all along been living behind this time lapse looking glass I like to think of as my past Like to But I was there that s me threading the hook with the worm me feeding cake off a knife to a groom so sweetly as if he were my own He was Numb as a new clone I stare she does stunned stunned she to see that I appear alone me to see her there without a clue to what s all wrong with the picture Glaring then gone by the album s final blank pages what was missing or too much there I seem to need to catch a spark of knowing in that eye opaque as a grape She thinks I will approve imagines me the anti climactic aging matron of her future a beaming wistful blur I am a blur At least I m not what any camera I know has caught In albums on walls on the fridges of friends you can easily see it I ve modeled myself like clothes that don t fit If you knew me you d want seconds twins quintuplets There must be records of my self most self Who knows The FBI may classify the files holding one of my rare true smiles If only I could blow up corners of snapshots taken by foreigners where I have candidly intruded say at sunset Nantucket pier blocking a darling Arsenio s ear Or side by side with a Yoshiko at Pagsanjan There I know the truth of who I am and was would coincide Me with my mother laughing beside some Sasha or other in Paris Me with a serious smile on a bench in Philadelphia while Wolfgang cavorts in the foreground with Helga photos to confirm glimpses of being that conform to the credible evolution of what s really become of me So what if all the negatives are lost I know they are out there fading somewhere my hairdo and dress outdating but not my earnest softened gaze as one of your hands touched my face and our two shadows between us fused darkly in the piazza at noon just beyond Dieter or Hans that June
