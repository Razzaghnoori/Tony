 Dickmorrisy On Halloween former Clinton political consultant Dick Morris dressed up as a populist visionary and went out on the Internet His new Web site vote com asked visitors to vote yes or no on questions such as Protect Gays from Hate Crimes and Increase the Minimum Wage Each time a user clicks a box taking one side or the other an e mail is sent to Congress or the White House conveying his e mail address and his position on the issue We ll send your vote to your congressional representative your Senators and the President Morris promises on the site s home page This he asserts is direct democracy Like his past careers as Bill Clinton s savior confessor accuser and pundit translator Morris latest incarnation is an act He s not building direct democracy He s building a rather different political system which might more aptly be called dickmorrisy How does dickmorrisy differ from democracy Let us count the ways 1 Morris picks the issues As Frame Game has previously the power to choose and craft questions is more profound than the power to choose and craft answers That s why other Web sites such as faqvoter com let users pose questions to politicians on any topic Morris knows that the first rule of politics is to dictate the agenda and at vote com he s the dictator So while vote com asks visitors Should Hillary Have Spoken Out when Mrs Arafat Made Controversial Comments About Israel a no win question about the woman Morris excoriates elsewhere on the site it asks no similarly rigged question about Mrs Clinton s opponent Rudy Giuliani 2 Morris frames the arguments On vote com you can get the pros and cons on various issues and cast your votes CNN s Bob Franken told viewers two weeks ago Well not quite What you get are the pros and cons Morris chooses to include Take the question Morris posted Wednesday Admit China into the World Trade Organization At vote com you can click to read a few paragraphs of the arguments on each side about economics and human rights but there s nothing about how engagement as one side sees it or appeasement as the other side sees it might affect nuclear proliferation a consideration that might have changed your mind Morris never links you to sites that offer more detailed arguments than his He wants you to stay on his site read his summaries and pull the trigger 3 Morris simplifies your views Morris says vote com is fully interactive and gives us a chance to speak out and to be heard When you vote we ll send an immediate e mail to significant decision makers telling them how you feel But while you can explain the nuances of your position on a bulletin board at vote com just as you can in Slate s Fray the only thing Morris lets you communicate to your government is yes or no On vouchers for example I checked the box marked Yes Use competition to improve schools because I favor pilot voucher programs and public school choice to shake up the education system My vote was translated into an e mail to Clinton and Congress stating On the question Vouchers for Schools I voted YES Since more than 80 percent of vote com users have voted yes on this question Republicans will no doubt cite these votes including mine as a mandate for nationwide private school vouchers Morris hasn t conveyed my opinion He has misrepresented it 4 Morris distorts your degree of interest Morris concedes that vote com doesn t represent the whole population since the average Internet user is wealthier and more educated than the average person for example but he argues that it faithfully simulates an election because it expresses the votes of those who care enough to speak out He says he built vote com to set up a way for voters to speak out because I trust the voters Of course voters already had a way to speak out They could and did write letters and e mails to the government but only when they cared enough to do so The labor and thought that went into those letters helped politicians understand how many voters really cared about an issue and exactly what those voters thought If Morris truly trusted the voters he would have left this system alone Instead by simplifying the voting process and flooding politicians with thousands of identical one line e mails he obliterates the distinction not just between my opinion on vouchers and Bill Bennett s but also between Bennett s intense interest in the issue and my faint interest in it 5 Morris defines where politicians stand Vote com will elevate the dialogue between members of Congress and their constituents to a new level writes Morris When your congressional representative votes on the issue we will e mail you to tell you how he or she voted Right before election day we ll send you a report card listing how they voted on all the topics you voted on Morris says the report card will show each voter what percentage of the time his congressman agreed with him Report cards aren t new they re used by the Christian Coalition and other interest groups to reduce complicated issues so that each politician can be labeled pro abortion or pro environment Report cards don t transfer power from politicians to voters They transfer power to the intermediary that gets to characterize how politicians have voted If vote com succeeds Morris will become that intermediary 6 Morris controls the special interests Morris says vote com will give us all a chance to be heard so our voice gets loud enough to drown out the special interests that run Congress Meanwhile he predicts that money won t work in politics anymore because you won t be able to reach people by buying television ads since the Internet is taking the place of television in politics So if you re a special interest where can you take your money to reach the voters To Morris of course He boasts that vote com is free because we get our money from advertisers And who s going to advertise on a site where people vote on political issues Why special interests naturally Morris already quotes leaders of groups such as the AFL CIO in the arguments he summarizes for voters The more influential these summaries become the more each interest group will be willing to pay to get its views and quotes into them 7 Morris represents the Internet Edmund Burke a British statesman called journalism the Fourth Estate during the French Revolution recalls Morris We think the Internet is replacing the media so we call it the Fifth Estate But rather than relinquish this catchy title to the whole Internet Morris claims it for the magazine translation column he writes on vote com He sees the power center of the future and he wants to dominate it When critics ignore or dismiss Morris he accuses them of ignoring or dismissing the Internet The White House citing technical reasons has capped the number of e mails it will accept from vote com each day Morris in turn has charged that the Internet administration is burning the bridge to the 21 st century and is discriminating simply because this is over the Internet Morris it seems has taken his philosophy less from Robespierre than from Louis XIV l Internet c est moi 8 Morris controls the voting process Morris constantly describes his visitors as voters who are engaged in referenda through vote com The site advises them when the polls will close on each referendum and assures them afterward that your vote really counted Meanwhile Morris warns the White House against censoring the views of those who vote through his site and he advises members of Congress who don t accept e mails that we ll have to tell their constituents who participate in vote com referenda that they won t take e mail even from those who elect them He also promises to crack the whip on wayward legislators by publishing the referenda results broken down by state and congressional district in the Hill a congressional newspaper By adopting the language of elections vote elect referenda and by encouraging voters and politicians to treat vote com as the vehicle through which the public delivers mandates to its leaders Morris is trying to make vote com in effect the place where people vote Vote com would become as Morris envisions it the nation s town meeting And Morris would run the meeting Morris of course insists that vote com poses no such threat It s a ballot box he says It has no point of view What a brilliantly innocuous metaphor devised by a master manipulator to obscure his manipulations This it turns out is the most important difference between democracy and dickmorrisy The only thing worse than a cacophony of special interests plastering their views all over the nation s airwaves and legislation is a single special interest that owns the ballot box and knows how to make itself invisible
