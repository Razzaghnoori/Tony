 Between Erotica and a Hard Place I recently heard that there are 10 000 pornography sites on the Web Sex is one of the few things people are consistently willing to pay for online sports and stocks are among the others and there are obvious reasons for this say privacy and convenience You may be able to find the same stuff as what s online at any decently stocked porn shop but to do so you have to go to that neighborhood physically enter that store and then worry about what the clerk thinks of your interest in dominant transvestites Browsing at home it s just you and your modem and using the mouse only takes one hand The recently launched literate smut Webzine Nerve might be Sex Site No 10 001 but don t call it porno In a letter to the readers the site s twentysomething editors declare Nerve intends to be more graphic forthright and topical than erotica but less blockheadedly masculine than pornography If pornography encompasses all those hot n hunky sites out there and erotica is that safe and boring territory of romance novels and scented candles then Nerve wants it both ways rough sex and soft lighting meaningful talk and meaningless orgasm You wonder why no one has ever tried this before Go to Yahoo and type in literature sex and you get sites such as Madeline s Sex Offerings which contains articles such as Some Philosophical Thoughts on Giving Head by Madeline herself And this is the high end More typical are sites such as Pussy Vision and Blow Job of the Day Search for erotica thousands of matches and get sites such as Yellow Silk the online version of the Berkeley based journal the Utne Reader called a tasteful celebration of the sensuality of every day life Or the Web site of Mary Anne Mohanraj whose most recent book Torn Shapes of Desire is touted as eminently literary well written and tasteful there s that word again The editors of Nerve feel no need to be tasteful God bless em What you find here are actual writers holding forth on subjects near and dear to their hearts and other organs writing that generally seems to know the difference between the precious and the precise And they do it without sacrificing lust and the promise of sexual possibility As Ruth Shalit says in her review of two books about predator women Candace Bushnel s Sex and the City and Anka Radakovich s Sexplorations When staging a literary revolution it never hurts to be sans culottes In its architecture Nerve is not especially revolutionary There are seven distinct sections within the site each with its de rigueur icon in the margin In Smut Cut the reviews section you will find pieces like Shalit s Roles features essays on sex gender and relationships Pedantry presents pieces by public figures such as former Surgeon General Dr Joycelyn Elders on favorite subjects take a guess Ex Libris comprises favorite erotic passages from our writers libraries Skin is photos of flesh Threads is occasionally interactive erotic fiction and The Bar is a yet to be launched chat area Nerve wants to provide something for everybody there s homeless sex prison sex there s even Norman Mailer who says in a 17 year old interview published here simply because it s Mailer that he draws the line at child porn Everyone has his limits Though the author of Advertisements for Myself has always liked his sex the way a schoolboy likes his pie any way he can get it he was never the hippest cat in the pack witness The White Negro his attempt to grapple with the Beats which proved the adage that those who had to ask what hip was weren t In the interview Mailer recalls reading a line from William S Burroughs in 1959 that flat out cleaned his clock I see God in my asshole in the flashbulb of orgasm I remember reading it and thinking I can t believe I just read those words recalls Mailer I can t tell you the number of taboos it violated First of all you weren t supposed to connect God with sex Second of all you never spoke of the asshole certainly not in relation to sex If you did you were the lowest form of pervert Third of all there was obvious homosexuality in the remark In those days nobody was accustomed to seeing that in print And fourth there was an ugly technological edge why d he have to bring in flashbulbs While Nerve hasn t violated many taboos yet the site does betray some expectations Skin the photography area is doubtless heavily trafficked The pictures are quick to download Nerve is very user friendly good navigation great design and an intelligent use of icons Some images like Richard Kern s New York Girls are as soft porn as a Playboy calendar But Greg Friedler s black and white photos from his book Naked New York are slightly disturbing New Yorkers who answered an ad in the Village Voice are photographed twice clothed and naked and the pictures juxtaposed side by side before and after fashion Their change of expression or lack thereof is itself a comment on the meaning of nakedness many appear more defensive unclothed as if to counteract any vulnerability and the effect is almost anti erotic Equally un arousing are Barbara Nitke s pictures from the sets of porno films where she worked as a still photographer There is a sad Felliniesque quality to these images bored and exhausted women lying on a king size bed surrounded by dildos of towering dimensions an actress being eaten out while the director casually talks to her about the scene Once I got focused on their underlying sadness says Nitke of her subjects it was all I would see for years So far Nerve has avoided most sentimental you gotta have heart reminders that people need more than just sex The attitude seems more carnivorous and unapologetic We need sex let s indulge and save talk about those other important things for Nightline True there are lapses Fiona Giles editor of a book called Dick for a Day What Would You Do If You Had One surprise most women would have sex with themselves has a moment of sadness when having gone dickless for months she finds herself walking down the street thinking I should ask someone for a hug Barbara Nitke also recalls a porn star saying all he wanted was a hug The moral Whether getting laid consistently or not people need hugs For the most part though Nerve is a hug free zone It will be interesting to see if Nerve can keep it up The editors seem to know good writing when they see it Novelist John Hawkes makes an unexpected appearance with a new introduction to The Passion Artist and Poppy Z Brite has a touching fantasy of John Lennon and Paul McCartney holding more than each other s hands Co editor of Nerve Genevieve Field was executive editor of MTV Books words that linked together look about as strange to my eyes as God and asshole did to Norman Mailer s Piss Christ creator Andres Serrano is to be featured in Skin soon so we know Jesse Helms will be bookmarking this page And if the editors are ever tempted to take themselves too seriously they can always refer to Lisa Carver s hilarious essay on the differences between sensualists and sexualists those who like talking about it and those who like doing it Sensualists have sex without orgasm on purpose she writes of all those candle loving body oil bearing himbos They call it tantric sex I d call it a bad date
