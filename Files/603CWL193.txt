 September 1 1995 Name Address City ST Zip Dear Name I am sure that you are aware of the uncertainty many arts organizations are currently facing in regard to future funding As a member of the Board of Trustees of the Indianapolis Civic Theatre I believe that the dilemma we re faced with is not how we can afford to continue our programming at its current level of excellence but rather how we can rally the community to support these efforts that only serve to enhance the cultural splendor of our city and provide educational outlets for our children The Indianapolis Civic Theatre has entertained her audiences with professionally produced plays and musicals for 82 years while providing an arena for our city s exceptional talent but that is certainly not the extent of it Youth oriented programs like Junior Civic Kid Connection and the Young Adults Summer Musical provide unequaled educational opportunities to children throughout Indiana who may not otherwise have exposure to the performing arts The impact of these programs on the children involved is immeasurable I ve enclosed a brochure which explains in more detail the many worthy efforts of the Indianapolis Civic Theatre as well as a pledge card and return envelope in hope that you will join me in supporting the Theatre s mission Furthermore I hope you ll agree with me in that your continued support of the arts is an investment in the cultural heritage of our city and state I ll look forward to hearing from you Sincerely yours Bubba Tarkington Trustee enclosures
