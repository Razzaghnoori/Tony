to call my dad And say I just can t handle this So the guy comes in he takes the other guy out and says I need to talk to you He takes him out there he says he asked I could hear I mean it s right outside the door He goes How do the people that normally rotate your tires do it How do they get the lugs off He says Sir that s not my job I don t watch them take the lugs out I don t know how they do it That s why I bring it to people like you who are professionals with your big machines and things Well I cannot do it I cannot get them off I cannot rotate your tires So the guy was like Fine leave them on He didn t want him to take them off and then not be able to get them back on So he goes Fine leave my tires on don t take them off So then he s getting his oil changed and he leaves And then this other lady comes in and I warn her I m like You might just want to back out now because you know this is major problems at this place And so she s watching them and they come about two or three times You re low on transmission fluid and something squeaking here and That s supposed to be part of an oil change Stephanie Yeah no kidding So she was like watching them like a hawk Anyways he comes in and I m like Oh God here he comes again you know He s like You re done I m like Thank God you know So I go over there and he s like Your total is 68 something or other I went because normally inspection s what like 10 dollars 20 See my dad well where I guess it s because it s our hometown but we normally pay 10 dollars I usually pay 20 And it was 20 I go How d on I said What did I just get charged for 60 some dollars He goes The inspection was 20 then you got to pay for the sticker three dollars your wiper blades 17 Did he not say six dollars a wiper blade Hmmm Seventeen for the wiper blades which he s already put on I can t do anything about it Twenty seven for the oil change When I called I had it written down in my damn little thing I pull this out I said So when I called the other day I said they told me 25 99 if you want the free tire rotation 18 99 if you don t you just get the oil change I said First of all I said I wasn t going to get a free oil free tire rotation to begin with so I shouldn t have been charged and not even 25 99 27 99 I said I shouldn t have even been charged that to begin with I said Then he didn t get my lug nut back on I said so I didn t get the tire rotation and I have a broken lug nut I said And then you re still going to charge me 26 99 I said No way I said What is going on here I don t you know I m not happy with what s going on You know I m getting mad He s like Fine we will change it to the other price He s like I guess they put it in wrong So he gives me the receipt and it s still not 18 99 it s 19 99 It s a dollar but it s still just annoying that they re dollaring me here dollaring me there So my total was 58 dollars total Oh my God And then I pull off and they didn t change my damn sticker for my next how many miles are you suppose to do Every three Three thousand I was worried about that I thought they put two less So I pull I thought it was four thousand so I pull off and I see that they didn t do it I was like Goddamn I get in the car and I say Can I get a sticker for my next oil change please And he goes Yeah sorry They should have done that I said Well they didn t So he puts it back on there and he goes oh he said um Come come back and talk to your dad and visit us and we ll do your fan belt I said Uh huh that s OK thank you Pulled off oh I called my dad I was like You will not believe what I just What did your dad say He was livid MH Is he going to call He was like I mean he ain t going to call but he was like first off he was mad about the inspection being 20 dollars He was like he said You shouldn t have yeah you shouldn t have done it But they didn t tell me prices and he was like that s why that s why he d rather do it they take advantage of little girls like us coming in these places They do Uh I was mad and then they don t even vacuum your car Don t most oil places oil change places vacuum your car out Anyways I m tired of talking about this it s just the worst experience of my life and I m not very happy
