 Nattering Nabob of Solipsism Tucker Hmmph And I feared the whole subject of children s books was a little lowbrow for the Breakfast Table Maybe better for the Book Club Today in Slate Bob Herbert and Susan Sarandon on whether the felonious monkeys in Caps for Sale should be put to death One final word on George and Martha courtesy of my wife James Marshall the author of the series lived for a while in far West Texas and he s buried in the tiny town of Marathon So we re not all bad Didja see Safire today Another one of his sommelier numbers in which he removes a candidate s cork and sniffs it in full view of the electorate Who died and made him the judge of a pol s worthiness For that matter Tucker who died and made us judge I don t mind his taking Bradley s foreign policy speech apart I appreciate his listening to it and analyzing it so I don t have to I would have had to find toothpicks to keep my eyes open but the whole oracle of wisdom aspect to his approach is beginning to tick me off When you read one of his columns these days or at least when I do you get the sense that it s more about him than it is about it or them the phrase nattering nabob of solipsism suddenly springs to mind There s a great story about his self importance circulating down here in Austin Do you remember a couple of weeks ago when Safire wrote in two consecutive columns about coming to see Bush As I understand it he called Karen Hughes Bush s communications director on like a Thursday and said I m coming Tuesday Not Can I come but I m coming Karen supposedly said Well the governor s going to be out of town to which Safire responded No you don t understand I m coming Tuesday P S Bush changed his schedule Can you imagine David Broder pulling that crap If the story s true it lends credence to a theory I have about Safire My daughter and I were watching The Wizard of Oz over the holidays which I m sure Team Carlson wasn t since it was on TV and it occurred to me that there s a bit of Oz in Safire He seems all powerful and scary someone you have to bow before to curry favor but when you pull the curtain back he s just a nebbishy guy who used to write speeches for Nixon If things had gone differently he could be the Reform Party frontrunner and Pat Buchanan could be doing a twice weekly column called what Heil Everybody If Safire were Oz what would he give the various Republican candidates before tonight s debate A brain for Bush Sorry Karen couldn t resist A heart for Alan Keyes A chill pill for McCain since he obviously doesn t need courage And how s about self awareness for Orrin Hatch who s at least pretending that he has a chance in hell of breaking the 1 percent threshold in a state other than Utah I thought actually we might spend some time today talking about the debate which I fear is going to be unnatural and unrevealing It s not like we re going to learn anything about these guys other than who prepped well and who s prone to flop sweat under the klieg lights I know I sound like Nick Lemann but it s about as accurate a measure of true intelligence as the SAT idiots make the Ivy League so why not the White House In a real crisis say a nuclear conflict with Russia no president will have spent four days debating a stand in for Yelstin Rather than test the candidates in such a formal setting we ought to catch them off guard Life is off guard right But then we re getting dangerously close to the realm of the pop quiz and we all know where that got us last time Before I go I want to revise and extend my remarks about Drudge This morning he has not one but two links to stories about the Clintons personal lives One says Hillary s going to use her maiden name in her Senate bid and the other says Hillary and Bill are going to divorce the minute he s out of office Drudge teases each by saying they come from a paper but when you click on the link you learn they come from a supermarket tab Star and National Enquirer respectively Next he ll be linking us to the Weekly World News The Hartford Courant was right Drudge is toast Regards Evan
