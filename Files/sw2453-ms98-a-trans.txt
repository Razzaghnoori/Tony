 well how do you think women s roles have changed well that kind of caught me by surprise it s kind i think i think that they have changed drastically i mean i think about people like my mother who you know gave up their careers and stayed home to raise kids and um you know played a really subservient role in the family and i just don t see that anymore at all uh huh uh huh uh huh even women who do stay home to raise families i think that they are still thought of as equals in in the role you know as far as the role in the family and society goes well i i uh just in my lifetime i know that the role of women has changed drastically also my mother when she began having her family she quit her job and stayed home until uh huh i m the youngest in my family until i was uh in junior high school old enough to care for myself when i got home from school um but i think that uh the changes in the next twenty years will probably be just as drastic you you ll see more women CEOs and more women holding public offices yeah definitely i think the biggest problem uh the biggest change that needs to be made is the way that women are paid oh i agree i mean you know it s just the statistics are just staggering that when they make like you know sixty cents on the dollar for what men make for the same jobs and that i mean i can get really angry about that yeah it it s probably all it it s the role of women is is in an evolutionary stage so we i m sure it will eventually evolve to where it is equal it just hasn t reached that point yet because women uh haven t yeah been in positions similar to men for that many years relative to how long men have had those types of positions well that s true but you know i m a single parent trying to raise a child and it really upsets me not to be paid you know the same for my job now i don t see that so much in my job but i know in other professions um i know that it s true i know you know friends of mine that are affected by that and uh just you know it s just not fair no it s not fair i don t know what to do about it well there s not much you can do except for yourself individually and and stand up for your salary i mean for what you want in your own job and if if it s not going to work out go find some place that will do what you want to do yeah yeah and then too i think that you know i think a lot of women who have been forced into the workplace unwittingly just because it you know to raise a family nowadays it takes two incomes they have to work and then i think the majority of the time they get still get stuck with most of the you know running the house type chores you know taking care of the kids and you know arranging their schedules and being responsible for those types of of things i know that i do know some men that that participate quite actively um you know in in things but i know a lot that don t so it s just a real shame you know i think when you look at the changing role of women you have to look at the changing role of men too because they re directly related uh huh well i think it during this in this evolutionary theory that i have here that men will eventually evolve around to where they participate more in the home because when it gets to the point to where that the house is dirty and the kids are dirty and and mom s not home she s at work men are going to gradually learn how to do those kinds of things yeah well they may yeah i think eventually but some men don t see some men just don t care well at i the the the generations that are being raised now by working mothers i i are are a little more in touch with yeah the household chores and duties and what has to be done so i think over a couple of generations time it will all change because it s really been uh my generation yeah i i agree with that grew up for the most part with mothers in the home but again my generation plan of women plans on working and not being at home uh huh yeah so it will be my children who really make big changes i think because that they will probably the majority of children now are at home without their mothers well or in some type of a day care or something because so many women work now right in day care yeah i agree i uh you know it s fun being single it s like i almost have to work right now i m at home because i am recovering from surgery but uh uh huh you know i really resent that in that i don t have that choice to be able to stay home with my child but uh i guess as long as you are single you have to support yourself nobody else is going to do it for you yeah yeah so well how do you feel about women in public office do you think that that s going to grow and how far do you think that s going to go in the next ten years or so well i think that that there s more you know there is definitely more women in public office uh i think it s going to be a long time before we see a woman president uh i don t think that s going to happen in the next ten years i don t uh huh think that s going to happen in the next twenty years but uh you know i think that there s progress and i m not very political so i don t really know you know any i don t know any statistics on you know how many women run for public office and how often they re defeated yeah i don t know any statistics either but it s it s probably going to be the same type of situation that that uh the black people have gone through it took them well black men long time to to get up to the pay scales of the white man and now i think it it s feasible for a black man to be president yeah yeah i think we will see a black a black man as president before we see a woman president uh huh and since since this evolution or this this progression of black male salaries and all that was all before women were heavy in the work place i women will probably go through the same type of deal uh huh same type of battle yeah type of deal it s just further down the road yeah uh i don t know i think a lot of um states are uh do you live in Texas you know because we now we have a woman governor and of course Dallas i do you live in Dallas yes uh huh no i live in San Antonio in San Antonio well we have a woman mayor do yeah yeah you do now and uh we have a woman mayor now too in Dallas and Houston has had a woman mayor for a long time because i used to live there too yeah yeah well Texas had a woman governor a hundred years ago or whatever Ma Ferguson oh did they oh i didn t know that yeah yeah i think it was Ma Ferguson i know Texas had a woman governor huh was she elected or was it something that i think she was i m not sure it was a hundred or so years ago so i i don t know i m not real up on past history or anything uh huh that s interesting i didn t i i i didn t know that but uh i i m thinking it might have been the kind of deal where her husband was governor and he died or something yeah that s right why i asked if she was elected or if it if it was something that was passed passed down to her through through the ways that the laws work i m not sure but uh i m surprised i really am surprised you know that major cities you know especially in a state like Texas would elect a woman governor yeah and uh like i said i really have no interest in politics it s just not my field but uh you know being a woman i don t know even that i would vote for a woman in the high offic e i wouldn t now because i don t know of one that s that s equipped to handle i certainly i wouldn t have voted for Ann Richards for governor and uh i can t say that i would vote for a woman president now no i why i didn t but uh we might see a woman vice president that wouldn t surprise me and then of course if something happened to be uh i m sorry yeah if something happened she would be president but it would not be something that she were elected to uh huh the the problem i m sorry go ahead i uh i just i don t think a woman president is anywhere in the near future if not just for the just for American prejudice uh huh the world several major countries in the world that we deal with all the time don t respect women as business people so a woman president would be is that right laughed at by other countries because they wouldn t respect her as a business person nope what about Margaret Thatcher wasn t she fairly she was i thought she was real well real well respected she was but i don t think that England deals as heavily with with like for instance the Arab countries i don t know all the details of it but i i know that for instance in Saudi Arabia women are just uh huh oh yeah and in uh my mother has done business in Germany and it was very difficult for her going over there because they just don t have very many business women uh huh and and the men basically see a business woman and ask them to go get coffee or something it s just it s very difficult to be well respected and and Margaret Margaret Thatcher had been in office it was probably very difficult for her at first but yeah well she comes from a a country where the model
