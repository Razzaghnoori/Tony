 Requiem for a Liberal This is my last Strange Bedfellow When I return from vacation I m going to take a break from politics and try my hand at a column about the arts To ease the transition I thought it might be fitting to pay tribute to someone whose career spans these two worlds He is Sidney R Yates the Democratic congressman who represents my birth district on the North Side of Chicago When Yates retires at the end of this congressional term at 89 he will have served in the House but for one two year interruption since 1948 Leaving with him I fear will be not only a chunk of postwar history but much of the enlightenment that remains in the lower chamber I m far from objective on this topic Yates gave me my first paid job as a congressional page many summers ago and the first writing I ever did about politics was answering constituent mail in his office But my real gratitude is for what Yates example teaches that politicians aren t required to preen and pander or to speak only for the parochial interests of their districts Yates has held the esteem and affection of the people he has represented for half a century by thinking about their good in a more elevated way He is a liberal one of the nearly extinct Roosevelt Truman Kennedy Johnson variety But in another way I think of Sidney Yates as one of the only true conservatives around He has found his mission in preserving what matters in our culture and in standing in the way of attempts to coarsen and reduce it Up on the Hill a few weeks ago I stopped by his office in the Rayburn Building for lunch As ever I was greeted by his chief aide Mary Bain who is an extraordinary story of liberal longevity in her own right Mary came to Washington to work on the New Deal National Youth Administration in 1935 and has been with Yates since 1965 She and the boss were busy sorting 50 years worth of files and packing them up for the Truman Library On the table were things they had found a note from Eleanor Roosevelt expressing outrage about some now obscure postal reorganization bill and a yellowed copy of the Chicago Sun Times from July 15 1965 the day after Adlai Stevenson died Sifting through these relics left Yates in a more wistful mood than usual Though he can usually be counted on for a bit of patter from Gilbert and Sullivan most of which he knows by heart he told me he felt it had been too long since he reread Edmond Rostand s Cyrano de Bergerac in the classic translation by Brian Hooker He began reciting it for me from memory I carry my adornments on my soul I do not dress up like a popinjay But inwardly I keep my daintiness The lines apply to no one so well as the congressman from the 9 th District of Chicago who must be the only politician left in the House who avoids publicity and whose style is to follow the dictates of his conscience without making a spectacle of himself doing so As Yates recounted over soup and sandwiches he didn t go into politics to save the world He did it because he was bored working for his father in law s law firm In 1939 he ran against the Chicago Democratic machine for a seat on the City Council and not surprisingly lost Recognizing that the only way in was with the blessing of the regular organization he got it in 1948 when he was allowed to run for Congress as a sacrificial lamb According to the elaborate ethnic spoils system of those days the North Side House seat belonged to the Germans But the German candidate who d been slated to run decided in the face of a looming Republican sweep that he d like to be postmaster so Yates who is Jewish got his chance He ran on a Democratic ticket with Harry Truman for president Stevenson for governor and Paul Douglas for senator I was the tail on the dog and we all won he said Almost as soon as he was elected Yates attempted self immolation by voting against the McCarran Act which placed McCarthyite restrictions on visitors to the United States Colleagues told him that if he voted against it he d be a one term congressman and they were nearly right His opponent in 1950 passed out pink leaflets asking if the 9 th District wanted a congressman who voted with the Communist Party But Yates wrote a thoughtful letter to his constituents the first of several hundred to come explaining why he thought the bill was unconstitutional and eked out a narrow re election After surviving another close call in 1952 he was regularly returned by lopsided margins In the House he continued to get excited about injustices that bothered hardly anyone else Around the same time he saved the career of Hyman Rickover the father of the nuclear fleet when Rickover was passed over for promotion to admiral in part because of anti Semitism in the Navy Though he had the endorsement of Mayor Richard J Daley Yates was never a machine man In 1962 he had become the leader of the Illinois delegation by virtue of seniority and Daley decided it was time for him to run for the Senate in a kamikaze challenge to the Republican incumbent Everett Dirksen Yates lost and a freshman named Daniel Rostenkowski assumed his place as head of the delegation After a stint working for Stevenson at the U S Mission to the United Nations Yates returned But with his seniority erased he began to narrow his focus to the issues that truly motivated him Israel the arts and the environment The year he returned to Congress 1965 the national endowments for the arts and humanities were voted into existence When Yates became chairman of the House Appropriations Committee s subcommittee on the Interior the national endowment budgets fell under his jurisdiction In the 1970s he was known as a tough minded supporter who could be counted on for a meticulous review of how the endowments were spending their money But after attempts to eliminate them began under President Reagan and intensified with the Mapplethorpe fiasco Yates career became preoccupied with keeping them alive He has managed to do so at times through sheer force of will Other representatives invite Hollywood celebrities to testify before their committees Yates invited Yo Yo Ma to play a Bach suite before his soothing the savage breast of the NEA s opponents After Democrats lost the House the NEA budget was cut in half This year Yates is battling to save it once more He now leaves that mission to two New Yorkers Louise Slaughter a Democrat and Amo Houghton a patrician Republican Whether his successors in this role succeed or not I suspect that Yates will one day be better remembered for another accomplishment the U S Holocaust Memorial Museum which he and his wife Addie worked for years to bring into existence As we finished lunch I asked whether I was right in assuming Yates thought term limits were a bad idea To the contrary Jacob he declared Twenty four terms is enough for anyone
