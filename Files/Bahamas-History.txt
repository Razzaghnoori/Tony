A Brief HistoryCenturies before the arrival of Columbus a peaceful Amerindian people who called themselves the Luccucairi had settled in the Bahamas Originally from South America they had traveled up through the Caribbean islands surviving by cultivating modest crops and from what they caught from sea and shore Nothing in the experience of these gentle people could have prepared them for the arrival of the Pinta the Nia and the Santa Maria at San Salvador on  October  Columbus believed that he had reached the East Indies and mistakenly called these people Indians We know them today as the Lucayans Columbus claimed the island and others in the Bahamas for his royal Spanish patrons but not finding the gold and other riches he was seeking he stayed for only two weeks before sailing towards CubaThe Spaniards never bothered to settle in the Bahamas but the number of shipwrecks attest that their galleons frequently passed through the archipelago en route to and from the Caribbean Florida Bermuda and their home ports On Eleuthera the explorers dug a freshwater wellat a spot now known as Spanish Wellswhich was used to replenish the supplies of water on their ships before they began the long journey back to Europe with their cargoes of South American gold As for the Lucayans within  years all of them perhaps some  people were removed from the Bahamas to workand diein Spanish gold mines and on farms and pearl fisheries on Hispaniola Haiti Cuba and elsewhere in the CaribbeanEnglish sea captains also came to know the beautiful but deserted Bahamian islands during the th century Englands first formal move was on  October  when Charles I granted the Bahamas and a chunk of the American south to his Attorney General Sir Robert Health But nothing came of that nor of a rival French move in  when Cardinal Richelieu the thcentury French statesman tried claiming the islands for FranceColonization and PiracyIn  a group of English Puritans from Bermuda led by William Sayle sailed to Bahamian waters and established the first permanent European settlement on the island they named Eleutheria now Eleuthera after the Greek word for freedom The  colonists called themselves the Eleutherian Adventurers but life was very difficult and the colony never flourished though Sayle was long honored for the effort In  a smaller island called Sayles island with a fine harbor was settled by Bermudians and renamed New Providence It was later to become known as Nassau capital of the BahamasIn  six Lords Proprietors of Carolina were granted the Bahama islands by Charles II but for nearly  years their weak governors on New Providence either couldnt or wouldnt suppress the piracy raging through the archipelago Then in  to avenge countless raids against their ships the Spanish dispatched a powerful squadron from Cuba to attack Nassau This sent the majority of the English settlers fleeing to Jamaica or Massachusetts but didnt have much effect on the piratesMost feared of the  or more swashbucklers operating from the New Providence lair was Edward Teach better known as Blackbeard Today you can visit a tower east of Nassau named after him Another two infamous pirates were women Anne Bonney and Mary Read had exceptionally bloodthirsty reputations and are still celebrated in the Bahamas The pirates raided anything on the sea living totally lawlessand often not very lengthylives Moreover there was not always a clear distinction between pirates and privateers the latter officially authorized by their governments to plunder enemy ships during time of war Anarchy and confusion reigned throughout the areaIn  shortly after the Bahamas became a crown colony Captain Woodes Rogers a renowned exprivateer was named the first royal governor Arriving in Nassau with a powerful force and promising amnesty for surrender he became a legend by cleaning out many of the pirates and establishing some order This incident inspired the national motto Expulsis PiratisRestituta Commercia Pirates ExpelledCommerce Restored which was retained until A few years later Rogers quit the islands only to return for a second time in  after a period of bankruptcy and debtors prison in England Before he died in Nassau in  he had summoned the Bahamas first official Assembly composed of  elected members for New Providence and four each for Harbour Island and Eleuthera At this time in all the Bahamas there were only about  settlersNew Providence knew some spells of prosperity in the midth century as privateering resumed with England at war with Spain The town of Nassau expanded and improvements were made between  and  by another revered governor William Shirley from MassachusettsThe American Revolutionary WarWhen the  American colonies enraged by the Stamp Tax got into the war that eventually brought independence the Bahamas somewhat reluctantly found itself on Englands side But reluctance dissolved as profits from privateering once again flowed into Nassau This time the plundered vessels were American but not all the victories were won by the privateers On  March  a rebel squadron under Commodore Esek Hopkins arrived and occupied Nassau for two weeks a bloodless undertaking that emptied the islands forts of arms and other military supplies A smaller and equally nonviolent American operation against the town in January  lasted less than three daysAs the colonies war effort picked up steam both France and Spain weighed in against the British In May  New Providence surrendered to a large SpanishAmerican invasion fleet from Cuba and for the next year a Spanish governor ruled the BahamasNews traveled slowly in those days The Treaty of Versailles in  formally restored the Bahamas to the British but actual liberation came through a famous escapade that would never have happened in the age of the telegraph LieutenantColonel Andrew Deveaux a loyalist from South Carolina sailed from Florida with six ships picked up men and fishing boats at Harbour Island and Eleuthera and invaded Nassau Though vastly outnumbered and outgunned Deveaux employed elaborate ruses with his little boats to convince the Spanish defenders that his force was overpowering The humiliating Spanish surrender is proudly recalled in Bahamian history even though it was all unnecessary the peace treaty had been signed the previous weekDeveaux was the first of some  loyalists who with slaves and the promise of land grants came to the Bahamas from the southern American colonies in the wake of the English defeat in the Revolutionary War This influx profoundly affected the islands A number of prominent Bahamians today are the descendants of loyalists or their slaves As a reward for his efforts Deveaux was given acreage on both New Providence and Cat Island Other loyalists set up cotton plantations on various islands and slaves soon became the majority of the populationEmancipation and DeclineIn the s well over  cotton plantations were founded and flourished around the Bahamas Prosperity from the land finally seemed a possibility But by the end of the century cotton had fallen victim to a devastating plague of chenille bugs and exhaustion of the weak soil Most of the planters left the islands and depression returned only partly relieved by wrecking the freelance business of salvaging cargo from the ships forever running aground in the dangerous Bahamian waters Some ships were deliberately misguided by lights on shore Nassau harbor did not have a proper lighthouse until Nassau became a free port in  sparking a surge in trading activity Loyalists built a number of the attractive colonialstyle homes and public buildings still standing today and during the War of  privateers enjoyed another profitable spell against American vesselsSlavery in the Bahamas was not as widespread or as vicious as on many sugar islands in the Caribbean Some slaves were voluntarily freed or sold their liberty by loyalist owners After  no slaves were imported into the Bahamas By  the first registration counted  slaves on the  inhabited islands or island clusters After Parliament in London abolished slavery in  there was a transitional apprenticeship period of  years before all slaves in the colony became fully free on  August  This included a few thousand slaves from ships captured by the Royal Navy They were housed in specially founded settlements on New Providence and the Out IslandsCivil War Blockade RunningOver the centuries trouble on the nearby American continent has often meant good news for the Bahamas When Lincoln ordered a blockade of the southern states in  after the outbreak of the Civil War the Bahamas quickly boomed Nassau harbor was busy with ships unloading Confederate cotton and tobacco and taking aboard arms medicine and manufactured goods mainly from Europe to be run back through the northern blockade As the war went on speedy and camouflaged contraband vessels were built to slip past the everincreasing Federal patrols Profits from blockade running were incredible and Nassau went wild But the extravagant parties and carefree spending stopped abruptly with the Norths victory in  Late the following year an immense hurricane sent a tidal wave over Hog Island today Paradise Island smashing Nassaus flimsy buildings and ruining crops Other islands were also devastated As the Bahamas sank back into economic doldrums citizens turned to agriculture fishing or salt raking The spread of lighthouses and decent navigational charts had crippled the old standby the wrecking tradeFor a time a new fiber called sisal seemed promising But Bahamian soil was too poor and Mexico grew a better plant Neville Chamberlain future British Prime Minister took over his familys sisal operation on Andros in the s It failed the natives said because of that islands evil elves called chickcharnies who cast a spell on the family for disturbing the land Hopes were raised and also fizzled over Bahamian citrus and pineapple Sponging another vitally important industry at the end of the th century also had setbacks A hurricane in  drowned some  sponge fishermen in the mud off Andros and a devastating fungus some  years later killed almost all the spongesThe th CenturyDesperate for work perhaps  percent of the Bahamian population left to take construction jobs in Florida between the turn of the century and World War I During that war hundreds of Bahamians saw active service with British forces The islands suffered food shortages and a serious bank failure but nothing more threatening militarily than rumors of German submarines offshoreProhibition brought gloom to millions of Americans but for the Bahamas it brought the biggest bonanza in history At the end of  Congress passed the Volstead Act outlawing the manufacture sale or transport of intoxicating beverages The Bahamian islands where the temperance crusade never had much chance were perfectly placed to help thirsty Americans For  years until the controversial law was finally repealed bootlegging changed Nassau West End on Grand Bahama and Bimini beyond recognition With just as much gusto as theyd shown in the past for wrecking privateering and blockade running Bahamians took to the seas with illegal liquor Trying to outwit the US Coast Guard was risky but enormously profitable Fortunes were made by respected Bahamian families turned liquor merchants rumrunning boat captains notorious criminals shady ladies and the Bahamas government which collected duty on temporarily imported drinkLiquor money bought Nassau better houses churches lighting water roads sewers docks and hotels The citys first gambling casino opened in  the first daily air service from Miami began in  the yacht set decided Nassau was fashionable and many wealthy Americans as well as Prohibition millionaires built homes on the islandsWhen the boom suddenly came to an end with the worldwide depression and the repeal of Prohibition in  unemployment rose again despite the first significant tourism the Bahamas had knownIn some respects World War II put the Bahamas on the international map The colony was chosen to have two of the sites Britain leased to the United States under Franklin D Roosevelts destroyers for bases deal in  Allied forces operated submarinehunting and airsea rescue stations on the islands Royal Air Force pilots and Royal Navy frogmen were trained here and much transAtlantic air traffic passed through the BahamasThen to the astonishment of the local populace the Duke of Windsor having given up his throne for an American divorce was named governor of the little colony in  He and the Duchess remained until In  the Duke intervened in the investigation of the murder of Canadian multimillionaire Sir Harry Oakes a longtime benefactor of the Bahamas who gave his name to Nassaus first airfield The sensational case never solved made world headlines for the Bahamas and is still discussed todayAfter the construction of the first wartime American air bases on New Providence was completed thousands of Bahamians left to work on farms and in factories in the United States a migration that continued well into the postwar era But employment opportunities began to grow at home From  a promotion campaign under Sir Stafford Sands was hugely successful in attracting tourists to the Bahamas Denied the sun sand and sin of Cuba by Fidel Castros takeover in  hundreds of thousands of American vacationers set their sights on the Bahamas The influx was spurred by gambling airport and harbor improvement on the major islands and the creation of the modern city of Freeport which had been set in motion by the socalled Hawksbill Creek Agreement of  Resort hotels began to appear and the advent of airconditioning improved the often stifling humidity of summerUnder a new constitution in  the colony was given selfgovernment with a ministerialparliamentary system In  elections the Progressive Liberal Party was victorious its leader Lynden O Pindling becoming premier Following a constitutional conference in London the Bahamas became fully independent on July   and is now a member of the United Nations and the British Commonwealth In August  the Progressive Liberal Party still headed by Lynden O Pindling was toppled by the Free National Movement after  years in power Todays prime minister is Hubert IngrahamSince independence the Bahamas has kept British systems of judiciary and government yet has moved closer economically to its near neighbor the US The Bahamian Government has deliberately pursued tourism as the major industry of the Bahamian commonwealth and is happy to welcome many millions of visitors to its shores The growth in cruise traffic has been particularly strong The other islands called the Family Islands by the government but generally referred to as the Out Islands by the tourist trade have not shared this huge growth in numbers of visitors Together they offer tourists almost any form of vacation experience from the bustle of the busy city to the silence of the desert islandIn the s the Bahamian Government began working on ways to expand the countrys economic base While tourism remains a top prioritythe opening of the vast Atlantis resort on Paradise Island leaves little doubt about thata number of measures have also been taken to make the countrys laws and tax codes more attractive to offshore investors As a result money has been making its way into financial institutions on the Bahamas from around the world and a large number of foreign banks have opened brandnew airconditioned offices surrounded by carefully manicured gardensOne of the major questions still facing the Bahamas is how to accommodate the increasing numbers of tourists while still preserving the special architectural and social heritage of the Out Islands as well as of the major towns like Nassau Will it be possible to enjoy the natural splendors of places like Inagua without upsetting the delicate balance of nature At the moment the thinking is that its perhaps best to leave these smaller less developed islands in peace
