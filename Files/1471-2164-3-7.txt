 Background Knowing the differences in gene expression levels among different tissues is of paramount interest in various areas of biomedical research These include but are by no means limited to i comparisons of healthy and diseased tissue in order to understand malfunctions in regulation and identify genes essential for control thus identifying target molecules for the development of novel therapeutics and ii the observation of changes in expression over time after addition of a drug to elucidate the mechanism of action of pharmaceuticals and predict their toxicology Experiments in that realm furthermore help to understand the molecular basis of diseases provide means for early diagnostics and facilitate monitoring of therapy Examples for analog techniques representing mRNA expression patterns are subtractive cDNA libraries 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and the Differential Display method and its derivatives 9 10 11 12 Macro and microarrays 13 are rapidly becoming the analog method of choice mainly due to their high throughput in data production which allows complex biological questions to be addressed Digital methods for counting differences in gene expression levels provide specific advantages With the expressed sequence tag EST approach 14 15 expression patterns are analyzed by sequencing many clones from cDNA libraries Even limited sequence information on the cDNA 3 end tag sequences permits unambiguous identification of the cDNA and the corresponding gene The different frequencies of cDNAs in libraries derived from different sources give evidence of possible changes in gene expression This approach provides accurate quantitative information and has a flexible degree of sensitivity which depends solely on the number of analyzed clones However this is very labor intensive In order to analyze the expression of low abundant cDNAs that represent mRNA in the range of one copy per mammalian cell more than 100 000 colonies have to be analyzed per library Improvements in sequencing automation and analysis such as capillary electrophoresis have speeded up the process considerably and recent developments such as a sequencing method based on real time pyrophosphate 16 sequencing on microchips 17 and massive parallel signature sequencing on microbead arrays 18 also contribute to the speed and depth of EST gene expression analysis Oligonucleotide fingerprinting 19 characterizes expressed genes via the hybridization of hundreds of synthetic oligonucleotides to cDNA that produces unique fingerprints of matching and non matching oligonucleotides Another approach to increase throughput is the serial analysis of gene expression SAGE Short defined cDNA sequences are initially prepared from mRNA which are then dimerized multimerized cloned and sequenced 20 SAGE accelerated the process of gene expression analysis more than an order of magnitude compared to the conventional EST analysis and still is compatible with most of the improvements of DNA sequencing mentioned above However after the identification of differentially expressed cDNA the full length gene has to be cloned starting from minor sequence information 12 bp tag which hampers further functional analysis of the corresponding protein a complex task that requires the complete coding sequence Each of these methods clearly has its specific advantages and often different subsets of differentially expressed genes are identified employing a certain method For example cDNAs that are not easily amplified by means of PCR are inadequately represented in PCR based methods DADA was designed in order to overcome specific shortcomings of established differential expression analysis technologies used today e g the need to sequence all of the examined genes or the involvement of PCR steps In addition further cloning of the complete coding sequence of the identified genes of interest is facilitated by ending up with rather long e g in comparison to the SAGE method and multiple corresponding cDNAs comprising at least part of the coding sequence DADA is a digital method which identifies and counts the abundance of genes by means of restriction fragment fingerprinting Results and Discussion 1 principle of the method DADA distinguishes and identifies genes by their specific patterns of cDNA fragments derived from digests with 6 different restriction enzymes recognizing sequences of 4 specific nucleotides In order to avoid detection of other fragments than the desired cDNA fragments spanning from the 3 poly A end towards the nearest upstream restriction site a special cloning vector has been devised It harbors a particular combination of cleavage sites that permits cloning of a nucleic acid in defined orientation and controlled labeling of only the desired fragments with fluorescent dyes Figs 1 2 3 Double stranded cDNA was synthesized by a reverse transcription reaction using isolated mRNA and an anchored oligo dT primer see material and methods The resulting cDNA pool containing a defined poly A stretch of 16 nucleotides was cloned uni directionally in the vector a cDNA library was constructed in E coli and plasmid DNA was isolated from the resulting colonies The part of the vector containing the cDNA fragment was labelled by means of a simultaneous restriction ligation reaction 21 with double stranded fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides using the Bgl I site Fig 1 Step 1 located adjacent to the cloning site of the cDNA representing the 3 poly A end of the corresponding mRNA The labelled oligonucleotide was only ligated to the cDNA end of the BglI restriction site due to the non palindrome nature of the overhang see Fig 2 In addition the other BglI site located within the vector backbone Bgl I Fig 2 and virtually all Bgl I sites with the exception of sites with CCT overhang occasionally found in the inserted cDNA sequences were not labelled as the overhangs created by the restriction digest were not compatible with the overhang of the used oligonucleotides In comparison the labelling of the Bgl I was less affected by artifacts resulting from labelling of internal restriction sites within the cDNA as compared to labeling of a NotI site in a different vector construct although Bgl I sites are more often found in cDNAs compared to Not I sites data not shown In a second step the plasmids were digested with restriction enzymes recognizing 4 bp sequences Alu I Bfa I Dde I Dpn I Hinf I or Rsa I in six separate reactions Fig 1 step 2 This created labelled cDNA fragments comprising the most 3 located site of each restriction enzyme respectively towards a defined stretch of the poly A tail of the cDNA a defined part of the cloning vector and the labelled oligonucleotide The resulting fragments were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ABI377 DNA analyzer and the length of the labelled fragments were analyzed by comparison to a specially designed internal size marker Fig 1 step 3 see material and methods for details The pattern of restriction fragment sizes generated by the procedure was characteristic for each individual gene transcript and represented an unique fingerprint of the corresponding gene Partial cDNA inserts and empty vectors represent a substantial part of cDNA libraries that would hamper the analysis of restriction fingerprints in standard cloning vectors e g the empty cloning vector itself would generate a characteristic restriction fingerprint that would overlay and disturb every analysis To distinguish fragments derived from restriction digests within the cDNA inserts from fragments derived from restriction digests within the vector resulting in mixed cDNA vector or vector only sequences the DADA cloning vector contains an engineered segment that is free from the recognition sites used in the fragment analysis Fig 1 and that is longer than the detection window of 45 to approximately 900 bp Figs 3and 4 This extended the restriction fingerprint of the empty vector to fragments over 900 bp which were not detectable in the analysis In addition the restriction site free segment of the vector guaranteed that all detected fragments within the detection window stemmed from restriction sites within the cDNAs If a specific restriction site is not contained within 900 bp of the 3 end of a cDNA no detectable fragment was generated There are 2 variations of the experimental procedure for a given cDNA library see Fig 1and the detailed description in Material and Methods In i a single clone analysis SCA the procedure was applied to only one clone at a time and yielded accurate fingerprints for certain genes experimentally This did not speed up the process of expression analysis compared to sequencing of clones from cDNA libraries EST approach but generated the fingerprints used for the mixed analysis In ii the mixed analyses MA the procedure was applied to pools of 96 cDNA clones multiplexing the plasmid preparation labelling and analysis thereby speeded up the process by nearly two orders of magnitude In spite of the multiplexing already established fingerprints of genes could be unambiguously identified in the restriction fragment mixture derived from the pools Fig 1and 4 If the characteristic fingerprint of a certain gene was identified in the fragment mixture at least one of the 96 colonies of the pool included a vector with the corresponding cDNA Therefore the frequency of occurrence of a fingerprint enabled us to count the abundance of genes and to calculate expression levels from cDNA libraries derived from different statuses at a high throughput The high throughput only applied to the analysis of the abundance of fingerprints as in contrast to the SCA no new fingerprints could be generated by the mixed analysis 2 obtaining patterns from a single clone analysis We randomly picked single clones of 96 colonies from a murine wounded skin library and compared the analyzed restriction fingerprints with the corresponding experimentally determined cDNA sequence of the vectors Vectors containing no cDNA inserts produced no signals in the detection window of 45 to 900 base pairs and incomplete or short cDNA inserts yielded only signals of fragments derived from restrictions within the cDNA sequence This demonstrated that the restriction free region next to the cDNA cloning site fulfills its function in repressing misleading fragments and the corresponding signals A thorough comparison of the analyzed fragment lengths with the corresponding sequences of the clones resulted in a good agreement of theoretical and experimental fragment length for the 6 restriction enzymes In general only those fragments were detected that were derived from the nearest restriction site of the corresponding enzyme as judged by sequencing However in several cases the first Alu I site was not recognized by the enzyme despite the use of an at least 4 fold excess of enzyme units compared to the amount of cDNA indicating site preferences of this restriction enzyme that may depend on the context of the recognition sequence 22 This did not affect the analysis of fingerprints in mixed clone analyses reported below as the same site preference was also observed under these conditions Another inherent discrepancy is the integer character of the predicted values versus the non integer values stemming from the comparison to the size marker The average of the difference of the experimentally analyzed length to the calculated length was 0 258 bp median 0 115 bp which means that the analyzed values were generally a little longer than the predicted ones About 95 of the analyzed lengths differed less than 1 bp and about 50 differed less than 0 5 bp from the predicted lengths which by far exceeded the experimental deviations in repeated experiments standard deviation of less than 0 2 bp see below and is in accordance to results from other authors 23 24 These data demonstrated that there is a reproducible but not yet predictable shift of the fragments within the polyacrylamide gel run Together with the above mentioned site preference of AluI and additional problems like the not well defined polyadenylation site in public database entries this hinders the construction of fingerprints solely based on sequence data Attempts to predict these shifts based on the sequence composition of the fragments were not successful in the first trials Experimentally determined fingerprints from single clone analysis could be used for the analysis without any of the above mentioned hindrances The fragment lengths from single clone analyses that by chance contained cDNAs from the same gene reproduced very accurately The standard deviation from the average value was below 0 2 bp for fragments below 500 bp and increased with larger fragment size The range in which a band was accepted as being the same as the search value was determined empirically Colonies of specific genes were mixed into different pools of defined clone compositions and the detection width was adjusted to be the best compromise between not missing any real hits and counting false ones As assumed from the increasing peak width of the analyzed fragments and the internal size marker the detection width varied with the length of the fragments see material and methods The detection range was increased above the determined 0 2 bp standard deviation especially for the longer fragments The broader detection width that could in principle lead to false positive identification of a fingerprint was counterbalanced by the fact that the peak density is much lower towards the longer fragments Fig 4 3 proof of concept The differences in gene expression following treatment of a tissue with an active compound was monitored using two libraries of wound tissue derived from control phosphate buffer saline PBS normally healing and dexamethasone DEX badly healing treated mice Steroid treatment is widely used as a model for impaired wound healing 25 From each library about 37 000 colonies were analyzed in pools of 96 colonies each The complete analysis of 74 000 colonies required only 16 runs on an ABI377 DNA analyzer 96 lanes with 96 colonies each 2 gels of 3 enzymes each for the analysis of 6 different enzymes All calculated fragment sizes were analyzed and stored in a relational database representing nearly 500 000 data points from this analysis alone Applying the restriction fingerprints of the above mentioned single clone analysis we found several genes that were up regulated in wounds of dexamethasone treated animals Two genes are shown that were confirmed with quantitative Real Time RT PCR and represent intriguing examples Table 1 MCP 2 and Cystatin C cDNAs contain all six restriction sites within 500 bp from the poly A tail experimental fragment lengths including poly A tail and labelling oligonucleotides MCP 2 Cystatin C Dde I 196 23 276 11 bp Alu I 67 51 118 08 bp Hinf I 349 88 274 51 bp Bfa I 531 02 270 83 bp Dpn I 245 02 265 17 bp Rsa I 254 23 89 18 bp respectively These fingerprints are unambiguously related to their cDNA as a search in the complete GenBank database see material and methods showed only the corresponding murine cDNA hits even though the search parameters were loosened to account for the above mentioned differences in experimentally derived fragment lengths to the real sequence Finally these two fingerprints were used for a digital analysis of the DEX and PBS libraries The fingerprints of all six enzymes were used for the search of the database from the 74 000 colonies Each of the 768 subsets of the data representing a pool of 96 colonies was analyzed by a computer program for the concurrent appearance of the 6 fragments of a specific fingerprint The search for the appearance of the fingerprints from MCP 2 and Cystatin C resulted in 3 and 4 counts respectively Interestingly the fingerprints were only found in datasets pools from the cDNA library derived from DEX treated animals and not in the library from control animals The concluded induction of both transcripts in wounds from badly healing animals compared well to quantitative RT PCR data Table 1 In order to explore the limitation of the method we also computed all possible restricted fingerprints of MCP 2 and Cystatin C containing only 5 different restriction enzymes Here we obtained the same results when we used the five shortest fragments of the fingerprints but misleading results if we left out for example the restriction enzyme that produced the shortest fragment This observation can be easily explained as partial cDNA sequences derived from oligo dT synthesis can lack the most 5 restriction site and include the most 3 restriction site but never vice versa If the numbers of fragments were reduced to the 4 shortest ones the results were perturbed by unspecific fingerprints that were not derived from the specific cDNAs but were erratically composed of fragments derived from different cDNAs within the pool of 96 colonies More of those comparisons started to reveal significance limits such as the number of fragments that should be contained in a fingerprint From the limited amount of comparisons it would seem that having 6 different fragments in a pattern and finding all of them works reliably even with low abundant genes like MCP 2 and Cystatin C that were induced to medium abundance by the treatment 3 to 4 transcripts within the 72 000 analyzed transcripts or about 0 05 Finding only 3 to 4 fragments is sufficient only for high abundant genes with a significant differential expression E g serum albumin and SPR1a with abundances of about 0 5 in liver and skin libraries respectively 26 27 could be identified and quantified by using only 3 restriction enzymes in the corresponding cDNA libraries 28 The clones of MCP 2 and Cystatin C were examined more closely regarding their length They contained the complete cDNA sequence This is not the case for all other genes but the clones often contain substantial parts of the coding regions and they almost always prolong the public database cDNA entries toward the 3 end This supports the notion that DADA will also facilitate a rapid full length cloning effort after identification of interesting genes Conclusion In conclusion DADA is a digital method for analyzing expression levels based on the counting of restriction fingerprints of cDNA clones It is built around a specifically designed cloning vector that suppresses misleading fingerprints derived from partial cDNAs or empty vectors The method yields quantitative data and absolute figures that do not depend on amplification by polymerase chain reaction Compared to the sequencing of cDNA libraries conventional EST approach 14 it is substantially faster and more economical In comparison to the SAGE method 20 it results in physical cDNA clones of substantial length which speed up further analysis Within the limited number of examples there is a good correlation between the clear results from DADA and other gene expression analysis methods such as quantitative real time RT PCR RNase Protection Assays and various hybridization procedures data not shown A number of additional genes with differential regulation discovered by DADA and confirmed by independent methods are now under investigations for the use as therapeutical targets unpublished observations Some of the genes identified by DADA including MCP 2 and Cystatin C were neither discovered by means of subtractive hybridization 3 nor by differential display 9 although these methods were successfully used in comparable settings in our laboratory and lead to a high number of differentially expressed genes Vice versa DADA could not detect certain differentially expressed genes that were discovered by standard methods As an example the injury induced differential expression of S100A9 could be detected by subtractive hybridization 33 The DADA fingerprint of S100A9 was detected in both analyzed cDNA libraries However as it occurs only once in each library no statistical significant differential expression could be identified by the DADA method Only a subset of genes was identified by all methods In general the different approaches can be seen as complementary rather than competitive The specific findings will certainly vary with changes in the completeness and individual execution of the respective screens Additionally DADA offers advantages with regard to absolute and quantitative data at the level of screening As of yet we can only perform digital analyses with patterns experimentally analyzed from single clone analysis These fragment lengths reproduce accurately enough to search and count them in mixed analyses applying rigid queries The usage of restriction fingerprints computationally derived from sequence database entries is hampered by the lack of predictability of gel positions from sequences and the integer versus non integer issue The experimental fingerprints due to the narrower search space allowed for the identification of fingerprints in mixtures of 96 colonies as demonstrated here The broader search space of sequence based predictions allow only for the identification of fingerprints in mixtures of about 10 colonies data not shown The one order of magnitude lower throughput in the case of predicted fingerprints would render the method non superior to others The generation of experimental fingerprints is the bottleneck of the procedure as described here Once the fingerprints are generated for a certain species they can be rapidly applied in all possible settings Therefore we are developing improvements of this step In addition the use of a now available fifth fluorescent dye as a size marker in sequencing lanes should allow for a fast correlation between restriction fragment sizes derived from the sequence and gel run behaviors of DNA fragments relative to the size marker The latter improvement could not only lead to a faster generation of experimental fingerprints but could also supply a large dataset to improve the prediction of gel run behaviors of fragments based on the sequence composition Another improvement could result from alternative DNA separation and detection methods such as capillary electrophoresis or mass spectrometry This could further improve the reproducibility of the fragment analysis and lead to a reduction of the search space for every fragment As discussed above this parameter is directly linked to the throughput of the method In addition DADA would profit from the higher throughput of capillary electrophoresis compared to the gel electrophoresis used in this study On the other hand values created by mass spectrometry are precisely predictable from the sequence of DNA fragments 29 This would allow for the generation of fingerprints from sequence data in silico and speed up this limiting step of the procedure Materials and Methods Cloning vectors The vector pUC19 Yanisch Perron et al 1985

program was designed that analyzed the datasets from the mixed analysis for the frequency of occurrence of the stored fingerprints Each dataset derived from a pool of 96 colonies 6 complex fragment mixtures in 2 corresponding lanes on two corresponding gels was queried for the concurrent occurrence of the peaks fragments of each fingerprint respectively see Fig 4 As an example for a certain cDNA fingerprint the the peak from SCA for restriction enzyme DdeI was determined at 326 5 bp In one lane in a MA there are multiple peaks stemming from DdeI digestion 50 3 67 4 98 5 326 7 500 1 The computer program checked if the peak for Dde I was contained in the complex peak mixture derived from the Dde I digest considering a certain bandwidth In the example above 326 7 bp in the MA would be considered as a hit The computer program did the same for the other 5 restriction enzymes When all peaks are simultaneously present in one dataset from a pool of colonies the counter for this fingerprint gene goes up by one It is possible to adjust the program to query the data with only a subset of the 6 restriction enzymes of the fingerprints The empirical determined allowed bandwidth for a peak to be counted was set to the following parameters fragments from 40 to 100 bp bandwidth 0 5 bp 100 300 bp 0 3 300 500 bp 0 7 500 700 bp 2 0 700 900 bp 5 0 Pattern search in Database
