 Dawn of an Icon Dear Tim You re right There is not A Dawn for All Seasons If novels were furniture I would not try to sell her to people who insist on Mission or Shaker To some her work will feel too busy and gewgawed up A smart reader I know snarled Her stuff feels so dated I didn t even bother to rush to the defense By the way that was one of my favorite letters the one where Powell complains about the challenge of working with timely material When I started that book the hero could get a telephone call for a nickel I would read over a chapter and think of my vast teenage reading public saying What s a nickel mommy Part of me I admit doesn t want to share her It s like having a newspaper broadcast the address of your favorite quiet little restaurant Hard not to wince at the notion of belonging to a Dawn cult The novelist Tom Mallon who has written a book on diaries and is working on a book about letters e mailed me I like Dawn Powell though she s now one of those writers in the curious position of being known more for her life than her work I ve read or browsed more of the letters and diaries and biography than I have her books As Paul Bowles is supposed to have said about his rediscovery as an old man It s too much too late The Bowles analogy is an interesting one He was hipper than the hippies who embraced him and the charm is that he got there first Similarly Powell seems to have understood things about the culture about ambition about sexual politics ahead of her time I have mixed feelings about a writer s becoming iconographic in this way My first reaction is to fear it s the death of a writer once he s in a position to do his own Gap ads what product does John Irving model Rolexes On the other hand maybe it s a good thing if it eventually leads people to the work You lure college coeds in black with nose rings to Plath through The Bell Jar and the hullabaloo over her marriage to Hughes and sooner or later they re going to actually confront the ferocious complex poems And by the way Plath too is often funny Almost typed hysterically funny the etymology of that word reminds us about the problems of being a witty woman Generally I m not very interested in what writers are really like I know a slew of em and can attest that there s no irony in a writer s being better or at least different on the page than in person All of us are That s what motivates us to write after all the rifts between our actual lives and the much richer imagined possibilities So I don t generally enjoy writers biographies Like Powell who admitted that she probably knew John Dos Passos too intimately to evaluate his work it often sours things for me to have insider information about a writer s inspirations or source material Just as an example I almost wish I didn t know that the inscription Emma Bovary put on the walking stick she gave to her lover Rodolphe was stolen verbatim from a gift that Gustave Flaubert got himself from his lover Louise Colet Gus was a boor and a hick and probably deserved his horrible syphilitic death Nevertheless Madame Bovary is a great book My anti biography bias confessed I d also say that Powell s life and art seem unusually seamless You meet the same cleareyed jaunty generous doleful complicated people in many of her characters that she offers in person Or at least as close to in person as letters and diaries can get us It s hard to say this without embarrassment so Girl Scout y does it sound but she s as close as I ve found to a Role Model Must be a common sentiment among her minions Gerald Howard called his excellent piece about her in Salon How Dawn Powell Can Save Your Life I ve really enjoyed talking to you I would ask you to fax me through a sample of Dawn s handwriting so I could do some amateur graphology But maybe that s too hagiographic too Elvis or Princess Diana adoring even for this fan Anyhow I know you re on the road with the St Louis Symphony Orchestra How a music guy became this involved with a novelist is a very intriguing question that we never got to here But I trust that your outsider status would have pleased her enormously Warmly Lisa
