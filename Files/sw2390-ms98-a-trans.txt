 okay um do you have a credit card oh who doesn t have credit cards i know i ve got one um i i did have two and the i found that um it just made me spend a little more so when i paid one of them off i got rid of it now i have two only have one yeah um i don t know i always used to be the person that would put something on and pay the bill right out yeah and now i ve after every Christmas it seems the last few Christmases i used it for Christmas and i m still paying it off oh i know it s it s Christmas is the worst time for i just have to leave them at home uh because the impulse buying is just terrible i don t know i consider myself pretty good but sometimes i can go out and i can i can over overspend my budget i guess i can afford it but it is it s a pain paying it off oh yeah uh huh i i don t i don t know um i had uh i have seven hundred dollars in mine now and i ve put saved up enough money where i m going to bring it down to two hundred and hopefully i can keep it around there oh yeah oh that s good that s really good yeah i know a lot of people have i mean fifteen hundred dollars two thousand dollars oh i know i know but um i don t know i never i never liked loans a lot so i m not a heavy credit card user i have a girl friend that she probably has two thousand dollars on couple credit cards so no oh i i i know i know people that are just uh uh uh uh are addicted to their credit cards and they ve just gotten themselves so much in trouble financially with with them it s it it s just unreal i guess i guess i know it s easy to do especially if you if you have a job where you have to buy nice clothes and things oh yeah it it i think that is the biggest problem when you really not you don t don t really need the stuff but the nicer looking clothes are the more expensive nicely tailored clothes oh of course even though you could probably get away with a cotton dress you got to go out and buy the rayon dress or something you know you got to be they say you have to dress for success yeah plus uh uh when you get uh uh credit card companies send you things in the mail all the time you know uh get please get get get and you re already preapproved and all this other kind of stuff yeah you know they just try to uh to to get you to get uh have their credit card and um um uh uh six half a dozen isn t enough how many credit cards do you have oh i have one we uh we have one one Master Card that s pretty good yeah my oh my husband won t even put his name on it i don t believe in those and it s like but the time we went to Florida and needed to rent a car you know he believed in it yeah because you ve got to have a credit card to rent a car yes you do uh huh yes you do yes you do and that that uh down here you have to have a credit uh you just can t live without it because down here they don t take a check unless you got credit card and driver s license identification yep that s right up here at some stores if it s if you re not in your home town you have to show them a credit card yeah uh it s it s just a another form of identification you know just to well actually if your check bounces i guess they could legally take it off your credit card if that s why they re taking it i mean i don t know how fair that is uh oh yeah they can yeah but i don t know um yeah i guess that percentage rates are like eighteen percent well uh uh ours is ours is through our our credit union and it s thirteen so it s yeah thirteen that s not bad that s not that s really good compared to eighteen and twenty one which some of them are uh uh some of them are really extreme high yeah it s it s uh and yeah then you have to pay your fee and American Express you re really it s not a credit card because you have to pay it off at the end of the month but the fee for that it s really expensive isn t it yeah is it i i don t know we don t uh we don t i ve never had one my husband has one for to for uh for business it s a company card but he s never had to use it so we don t get any get any get anything uh for it oh that s good i mean we would if we used it we would get it and then uh the company would reimburse any company expenses on it but so far he s never had to use it so we don t know anything about the billing yeah if he they they they have you pay it right out every month do they uh uh ooh yeah because it s uh that could get you in awful lot of trouble i know especially if your uh your reimbursement didn t come through yeah from your company because i know they i don t know why but you can use American Express and they give you an itemized bill and yeah you can use that i don t know why you can t use other credit cards for business that way i i don t i don t know i think it s uh just a lot of companies prefer American American Express yeah i i don t know if it s easy for them to get or or or what but um uh but i guess it s it s run so much different from the other ones yep this is this is it actually kind a boring subject in credit cards hum you really you just know some people abuse them but not a joke about the person who pays their Master Card off with their Visa yeah i bet you there i bet you there are people that do that oh i i i m sure there are i mean uh you go get a cash advance on one credit card to pay the other you take oh gee oh gee oh gee they i think they charge more for cash advances so do they um it s it s some cards you you can do that and some cards you can t down here i think it just depends on what the banks will take plus well it yeah you can t get cash advances oh so on on uh on some cards oh uh huh well i saying through my bank they they since they have their own card they don t like to give advances through other for other cards oh well no uh it i think that s a really bad plan in your budgeting if you have to pay one card off with another oh eventually eventually that that doesn t solve anything no it doesn t that just be solid for a couple of weeks then you get both bills back yeah because it s still there it s just some place else now i know i don t credit cards almost seem unfair to a person who s who s got a victim of impulse buying oh yeah store credit cards like unfair advertising or something store credit cards are even higher interest rate than say Master Card or Visa because i had a Neiman Marcus card for a while and i used it once and then i cut up because the interest rate was like almost twenty three percent oh wow so i i cut i cut that thing up so also when you give give someone a credit card like a normal credit card like a Visa or something uh huh that that um business person loses four percent because i used to work in a business and we always and we used to lose four percent on the credit card orders oh really ooh yeah it s it s the thing if if a business is taking a credit card they re really they sacrificing something too it seems the credit card company makes money all the way around yeah i also was going to say they get it from both ends because it is a four percent that they take uh i didn t know three or four percent i don t know which put you in better rating yep because when i used to go to the bank wow i used to take it off the deposit oh how awful yeah you do have to take it off your deposit yeah so it is a a service that they re offering yeah oh boy those people are making money hand over fist i i know should own stock there instead of these uh uh banks going that are folding but but everybody s really trying to you know it s become a real national problem credit card debt and and i we ve really cut i wonder how much is numbers how many billions of dollars it s got to be billions of dollars oh it it is it is it they uh uh you hear a lot about how much uh uh shaky the economy is just because of personal debt and what they re talking about is credit cards yeah that s uh probably true i mean you have the principal debt the car loan and your house loan yeah and then there s all the merchandise you buy on your credit cards uh huh i don t know if they count uh mortgages as personal debt that s personal maybe they don t i don t i m not sure that they do i think uh what they re talking about like is uh credit cards and other junk and loan car loans things like that yeah because uh boy i know people who kids people right out of college the credit card people like to get you because because they uh they spend they use the credit cards real easily and real freely and then they get in real trouble i know i had a girl friend she just got married out of college and the husband had taken confiscate her credit cards yeah i mean i don t know it s probably they re always saying the women are doing are the spending ones but i haven t heard one uh a single woman taking their credit card away from the man well i don t know i i definitely want to get mine up mine paid off month to month like i used to yeah and just as soon as i get it paid off i ll probably get laid off terrible can t afford my credit card anymore oh i know it you become a slave to your plastic
