                 okay um do you have a credit card   oh  who doesnt have credit cards     i know ive got one um i i did have two and the i found that um it just made me spend a little more so when i paid one of them off i got rid of it now i have two only have one   yeah   um i dont know i always used to be the person that would put something on and pay the bill right out   yeah   and now ive after every Christmas it seems the last few Christmases i used it for Christmas and im still paying it off   oh i know its its Christmas is the worst time for i just have to leave them at home uh because the impulse buying is just terrible   i dont know i consider myself pretty good but sometimes i can go out and i can i can over overspend my budget i guess i can afford it but it is its a pain paying it off   oh yeah uhhuh   i i dont i dont know um       i had uh i have seven hundred dollars in mine now and ive put saved up enough money where im going to bring it down to two hundred and hopefully i can keep it around there   oh yeah oh thats good thats really good   yeah i know a lot of people have i mean fifteen hundred dollars two thousand dollars   oh i know i know   but um i dont know i never i never liked loans a lot so im not a heavy credit card user i have a girl friend that she probably has two thousand dollars on couple credit cards so   no oh i i i know i know people that are just uh uh uh uh are addicted to their credit cards and theyve just gotten themselves so much in trouble financially with with them its it its just unreal i guess i guess   i know its easy to do especially if you if you have a job where you have to buy nice clothes and things   oh yeah   it it i think that is the biggest problem when you really not you dont dont really need the stuff but the nicer looking clothes are the more expensive nicely tailored clothes   oh of course   even though you could probably get away with a cotton dress you got to go out and buy the rayon dress or something you know       you got to be they say you have to dress for success   yeah plus uh uh when you get uh uh credit card companies send you things in the mail all the time you know uh get please get get get and youre already preapproved and all this other kind of stuff   yeah   you know they just try to uh to to get you to get uh have their credit card and um um uh uh six half a dozen isnt enough   how many credit cards do you have   oh i have one we uh we have one one Master Card   thats pretty good yeah my oh my husband wont even put his name on it i dont believe in those   and     its like but the time we went to Florida and needed to rent a car you know he believed in it   yeah   because youve got to have a credit card to rent a car   yes you do uhhuh yes you do yes you do and that that uh down here you have to have a credit uh you just cant live without it because down here they dont take a check unless you got credit card and drivers license identification   yep thats right up here at some stores if its if youre not in your home town you have to show them a credit card   yeah uh its its just a another form of identification you know just to   well actually if your check bounces i guess they could legally take it off your credit card if thats why theyre taking it i mean i dont know how fair that is   uh oh yeah they can yeah   but i dont know um yeah i guess that percentage rates are like eighteen percent   well uh uh ours is ours is through our our credit union and its thirteen so its   yeah thirteen thats not bad   thats not thats really good compared to eighteen and twenty one which some of them are uh uh some of them are really extreme high   yeah   its its uh   and yeah then you have to pay your fee and American Express youre really its not a credit card because you have to pay it off at the end of the month but the fee for that its really expensive isnt it   yeah is it i i dont know we dont uh we dont   ive never had one   my husband has one for to for uh for business its a company card but hes never had to use it so we dont get any get any get anything uh for it   oh   thats good   i mean we would if we used it we would get it and then uh the company would reimburse any company expenses on it but so far hes never had to use it so we dont know anything about the billing   yeah if he they they they have you pay it right out every month   do they uh uh ooh   yeah because its uh   that could get you in awful lot of trouble   i know especially if your uh your reimbursement didnt come through   yeah   from your company because i know they i dont know why but you can use American Express and they give you an itemized bill and   yeah   you can use that i dont know why you cant use other credit cards for business that way   i i dont i dont know i think its uh just a lot of companies prefer American   American Express   yeah i i dont know if its easy for them to get or or or what but um uh but i guess its its run so much different from the other ones   yep this is this is it actually kind a boring subject in credit cards   hum     you really you just know some people abuse them but not a joke about the person who pays their Master Card off with their Visa   yeah   i bet you there i bet you there are people that do that   oh i i im sure there are i mean uh   you go get a cash advance on one credit card to pay the other   you take oh gee oh gee oh gee   they i think they charge more for cash advances so   do they um its its some cards you you can do that and some cards you cant down here i think it just depends on what the banks will take plus   well it yeah you cant get cash advances   oh so on on uh on some cards   oh   uhhuh well i saying through my bank they they since they have their own card they dont like to give advances through other for other cards   oh well no uh it  i think thats a really bad plan in your budgeting if you have to pay one card off with another oh eventually eventually     that that doesnt solve anything   no it doesnt   that just   be solid for a couple of weeks then you get both bills back   yeah because its still there its just some place else  now   i know i dont credit cards almost seem unfair to a person whos whos got a victim of impulse buying   oh yeah store credit cards   like unfair advertising or something   store credit cards are even higher interest rate than say Master Card or Visa because i had a Neiman Marcus card for a while       and i used it once and then i cut up because the interest rate was like almost twenty three percent   oh wow   so i i cut i cut that thing up   so also when you give give someone a credit card like a normal credit card like a Visa or something   uhhuh   that that um business person loses four percent because i used to work in a business and we always and we used to lose four percent on the credit card orders   oh really ooh   yeah its its the thing if if a business is taking a credit card theyre really they sacrificing something too it seems the credit card company makes money all the way around   yeah i also was going to say they get it from both ends   because it is a four percent that they take   uh i didnt know   three or four percent i dont know which put you in better rating yep because when i used to go to the bank   wow   i used to take it off the deposit   oh how awful   yeah you do have to take it off your deposit       yeah so it is a a service that theyre offering   yeah oh boy those people are making money hand over fist   i i know should own stock         there instead of these uh uh banks going that are folding but   but everybodys really trying to you know its become a real national problem credit card debt and and i weve really cut   i wonder how much is numbers how many billions of dollars its got to be billions of dollars   oh it it is it is it they uh uh you hear a lot about how much uh uh shaky the economy is just because of personal debt and what theyre talking about is credit cards   yeah thats uh probably true i mean you have the principal debt the car loan and your house loan   yeah   and then theres all the merchandise you buy on your credit cards   uhhuh       i dont know if they count uh mortgages as personal debt   thats personal maybe they dont   i dont im not sure that they do i think uh what theyre talking about like is uh credit cards and other junk and loan car loans things like that   yeah   because uh boy i know people who kids people right out of college the credit card people like to get you because because they uh they spend they use the credit cards real easily and real freely and then they get in real  trouble   i know i had a girl friend she just got married out of college and the husband had taken confiscate her credit cards   yeah   i mean i dont know its probably theyre always saying the women are doing are the spending ones but i havent heard one uh a single woman taking their credit card away from the man       well i dont know i i definitely want to get mine up mine paid off month to month like i used to   yeah   and just as soon as i get it paid off ill probably get laid off       terrible cant afford my credit card anymore   oh i know it you become a slave to your plastic
