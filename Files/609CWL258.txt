 Date Name Address City ST Zip Dear My love affair with the IRT is a long one I joined the company of the IRT in 1974 with my first show Harvey and I can t believe it but I just completed my 45th production at the Indiana Repertory Theatre in Pygmalion I am very proud of my association with such a dynamic regional theatre Our growth has not stopped And it s all due to you Now as an associate artist with the theatre I see daily the impact that the IRT has on our community We employ more professional actors from the community ones whom we have helped train than ever in our history We now have grown to 10 900 subscribers from 5 154 in the IRT s first season But what I m proudest of is that our education program has become a national leader among fully professional not for profit regional theatres You are responsible for helping us introduce the amazing magical experience of live theatre to our state s children programs that are not only an arts experience but help teach history literature and social studies In 1974 you could buy an individual ticket anywhere from 4 5 and a subscription for 16 Ticket prices have risen but they still only account for 53 of our budget And of that 53 education program ticket revenue is a mere fraction of that so our contributions from corporations foundations and individuals like you enable us to continue these critically needed services I am writing to ask for your direct assistance in our education programs and artistic product What began as a touring group of actors in 1973 that played to students in cities like Gary Elkhart and Terre Haute the IRT education program today now provides Artist in the Classroom programs where community artists teach creative dramatics and theatre to students who can t attend the IRT because of location or unfortunately because of finances The Discovery Series which produces theatre for youth began in 1989 where around 24 000 students see a live production Discounted student matinee Mainstage performances where 4 000 students saw Pygmalion and 11 400 are scheduled to see A Christmas Carol What a delight it is for us to introduce the magic of live theatre to such eager faces each morning In all nearly 50 000 students from 65 of 92 Indiana counties are reached by an IRT education program each year and what s more every play has a direct tie in to classroom curriculum As an actress my primary joy is the communication that occurs between an actor and an audience Now I m communicating to you as a friend and fellow donor who loves the IRT You wouldn t have been able to experience the joys of plays I have been in and those I haven t without donations other than ticket purchases Your last gift to the IRT was As you consider your charitable aiding as 1999 ends I ask you to consider increasing that gift by 25 or more Every dollar counts I look forward to hearing from you and seeing you at the theatre Best wishes Priscilla Lindsay Associate Artist
