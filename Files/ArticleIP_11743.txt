 The Rise of the Front Man It is universally agreed that the resignation of Rep Bob Livingston as speaker designate and his replacement by Rep Denny Hastert is a Bad Thing For starters the annunciation of Hastert a politician who doesn t cast a shadow exposes the anorexia in the top ranks of the House Republican Caucus The Republicans are so strapped for talent that they had to recruit a politician no one outside Capitol Hill had even heard of five minutes ago Incidentally the House GOP s top four leaders are now ex wrestling coach Hastert ex college professor Dick Armey ex exterminator Tom DeLay and ex football player J C Watts Who says American politics is dominated by lawyers And as pundits are fretting Hastert s emergence also reinforces the crisis over the politics of personal destruction to use the day s catch phrase The sexual puritanism of the GOP s own right wing undid Livingston and Hastert cakewalked into the speakership only because he is fingers crossed above reproach It s uncertain whether sexual litmus testing will endure but for the moment Washington is anxious Many pols and ex pols are predicting that smart charismatic folks such as Livingston will now shun public office There is another less talked about reason why the ascension of Hastert is alarming Call it the Front Man Syndrome Most people would agree that in a well run democracy political power ought to be transparent By this I mean that those who hold nominally powerful jobs ought to exercise correspondingly real power Title and authority should be directly related The president should be the most powerful person in the executive branch the chief justice of the Supreme Court the most powerful in the judicial branch the speaker of the House the most powerful in the House etc This transparency serves democracy because it enables voters to hold the responsible officials accountable for their actions You cannot hide American politics has not always been transparent In the golden age of political machines for example bosses often occupied ostensibly unimportant jobs and left the glorious titles to their marionettes But transparency may be a casualty of last week If Democrats or Republicans fear that their leaders will be subject to personal attack and they do then there is a huge incentive for the parties to vest nominal power in squeaky clean nonentities and hide real power behind the scenes H astert may be Exhibit 1 Coach as he s fondly known has a history of modest service to his party and his district delivering pork opposing Democratic health care bills etc Mostly he has been a faithful deputy whip to DeLay helping The Hammer count votes in the service of the conservative cause DeLay mobilized his whip organization to ensure his deputy s election as speaker and Democratic members are already wondering if Coach will be The Hammer s tool It may be that Hastert will be thoroughly independent of DeLay Hastert s allies assure doubters that he is his own man but what if he s not House Republicans will have placed a clean good natured speaker at the front of their parade a bland and acceptable public face for the party Hastert won t cripple the party with a too big mouth and too big ideas as Newt Gingrich did and he won t cripple it with an embarrassing history as Livingston did Meanwhile DeLay will retain the only true power base in the House Republican Caucus a 60 odd member whip organization the best access to corporate campaign contributions and a fearsome personality The whip who knows he lacks the charm and cooperative instincts required for speakership will be able to run his operation quietly behind closed doors DeLay s job will be secure and he himself will remain mostly sheltered from strict public scrutiny This is of course pessimistic speculation It is far too early to know whether Hastert will be DeLay s puppet And even if Hastert is DeLay s puppet that won t necessarily mean that Congress has entered an era of puppetry A sample size of one does not an era make Still it s yet one more reason as if we need another to worry about what happened last week
