 hello hello this is Jim in Dallas uh how you doing fine i m Callie in Garland oh you re right here okay yeah i m i m actually working tonight i just uh called and came in yes oh are you so do you work at TI yeah you yeah i just got a little booklet uh this not what we re supposed to talk about just got a little booklet in the mail with the gifts and i thought oh i better make some calls i know i know aren t they yeah well i haven t get a chance i haven t got a chance to look at them yet i love it in the it was a lot nicer than i expected my daughter uh got a few calls at home she talked to some student in i guess they give them to computer students too and uh Virginia or something like that she s talked to two students i ve talked to i don t think they were students one i think worked at a university university um and the furthest away i ve talked to someone has been New York yeah oh yeah great uh we re supposed to talk about the elderly now i guess uh so yes we are do you have anybody that you uh have are close to that decision on or anything or i ve thought about it for myself and all and my wife my wife s mother is uh in a retirement home she s not in a nursing home uh oh well that s not did you push the button yeah did i did we push did you let me i ll hit it again just in case okay just in case i did it right as she said yeah but uh she s she s down in San Antonio it s it s a uh now what s oh it s a brand new one it s a Catholic uh retirement home for nuns it s at uh Trinity no let me see Trinity i keep calling it Trinity it s not Trinity i ll think of oh Incarnate Word and they have a retirement home for the nuns and they take some lay people well isn t that neat isn t that neat yeah and that one s really super now i i know what they re talking about on regular retirement yeah there s not too many they do have a wing where the people who are really sick you know have nurses uh huh oh that s good and then they have other wings that we visited uh that are very nice i mean it s just super that s neat just supervised more or less than anything and security i guess for them oh yeah they they they have uh like uh a guard with locks we ve been there once at night at Christmas she just went in last year oh she drives and everything she she s perfectly healthy uh right what made you all decide to put her or had what made her decide to go well her husband died they were in the military together and she just did not want to take care of the house right by herself and she visited the place and then fell in love with it and decided to just shun all responsibilities of any kind so to speak and so ah well that s good she s happy as as heck uh and they serve meals of course that s great and they have clubs and a swimming pool so that s nice now i i know the ones where you re really ill we visited a long time ago when she had a grandmother that was in one um hum and they were all more or less hospitalized type you know really really sick it s a tough question right shut ins and yeah it really is i worked at one as a teenager i volunteered at at oh you got experience more experience than i do then on it well it was really it was really sad heartbreaking i guess yeah yeah and uh i just oh i just felt for those people that especially the ones that never got visited oh that would be awful i never thought about that you know that just bothered me that just bothered me so much especially you know at my age i was probably about fourteen um hum and that really made a bad impression on me so i ve always thought not not really bad of them i mean because they are most of them i i believe are probably pretty good for the people but i don t know it s just a that would be a tough tough decision yeah i think that uh hopefully we as a country are learning a little more about it and they re getting nicer right i ve seen on TV where they take animals and young children in fact my daughter is one my wife took my daughters one year when they were getting some points for school took them to an elderly home and boy that really pumps them up that uh helps yeah is very nice to see young people i think that s one of the sad things is when you re in an older home um hum um hum if you just have people your own age you never get a chance to see kids or anything or animals or anything you know you can t take care of them right right obvious obvious you can t take care of children or animals in a nursing home but it s nice to have them visit and everything right yeah and get that youth back yeah you know sometimes that even helps them you know just being around young people the because some of them are so um you know just stationary i mean they ll get in a wheelchair or they ll just sit in a chair and and till you come along and really try and pump them up they re just right stationary and i feel like gosh that s all they do all day long so um so i do love to see young kids go and and men take the pets and everything i think that s a real real neat idea yeah i think you do get more by stimulation stimulation my in fact my mother in law just visited she s just about seventy five again perfectly fine yeah but one and and she visit us here in in Dallas when she went back every time she goes back to uh San Antonio my wife has two sisters there too she said she s much better she s much more alive and and uh active when she s been on a visit with somebody else you know and that s yeah and our routine has come obviously hectic with teenagers and everything and she s much and so the stimulation part is really important i think like any animal anything you just lay around uh that s the fastest way to die i think you know right right stagnant yeah that s exactly right i think they re really neat um of course i ve seen those reports on TV the horrible ones and that scares me oh yeah i m afraid i m a TV flipper anything bad i like i like to flip i flip it off but it is sad it s sad yeah it really is it it s sad to think that we would do that to people and you know i ve seen them on TV with uh bed sores and oh yeah uh they just stay in the same clothes or the same sheets and not do laundry and i just think how can you do that these these people have given so much of their lives you know to to America you know or whatever and here is here is how we treat them we just put them in a home and leave them yeah right when i was uh younger we i lived in the east i m from the east really and it seemed like there several people that i knew that had their uh parents i guess they would be but well in their seventy living with them um hum and one of them was even a woman who was fairly old and i guess she she had her own separate room and i think whether it s more a custom up there or maybe because i was younger and it s just not a custom anymore right to have uh you know the grandparents live with you anymore i guess that uh well we are getting away from that which is not right i think it s right i think it s neat i think uh you learn a lot from them you oh yeah from all their experiences and and that s one of my favorite things to do sit around and listen to their stories oh right right i think that s neat because they really have a lot of good ideas insights that my father my husband s father is really old he he had him late in life and he s he ll be eighty this year yeah oh and i just uh he lives with different you know people in the family he ll switch from time to time i just well that s nice in a lot of ways yeah i just couldn t imagine locking not locking him up but putting him in a home and just but that you were implying you said that by mistake yeah right lock him up that s what i think about it for me i think well my kids better not do that to me i don t want that you know so i i think of it well how would i want to be treated rather than oh i know i know right right right exactly you know it s easy to say well yeah let s let s put these old folks in a home but when i think i don t want to do that you know i don t want to be have my little home i always threaten my daughters i say well um hum that s right i m going to build a little house behind yours and then and i ll take care of your lawn he says but i m not going to one of those places right yeah oh you re not going to put me away that s what my mother she always you re going to lock me up one day aren t you i can tell i can tell you re going to lock me up that s what we that s the way we call it which is really wrong but my wife s mother and the one she s in San Antonio it s you know it s everything but the opposite of what you ve seen i mean it s it s a little hotel hotel you might say i know it right that s great again a swimming pool and grounds and she has enough room she has two bedrooms and a and a separate living area gosh they don t have kitchens or anything but they have little it s like uh right on each floor they have a little kitchen area where you can go down and have a make a meal you know yes prepare your well that s great can now can she leave um on a day by herself oh yeah it s it s it s nothing like that it s like living in the hotel i mean she s totally on her own oh man that s neat uh and she still drives which we do does scare us some because she has dented a few things you know yeah and we keep thinking about that you know because she they get less alert and they don t care and i ve seen some of these elderly people on TV you know the ones from Florida that just run into people and they don t even understand what happened you know right right i know bless their hearts you hate to hurt them by doing that that s like their one last thing that they can still do and you take away that driving ability and that would really be hard we ve i know i i know go ahead i m sorry uh well we ve thought about doing that for for my husband s father because he s oh he still drives yeah that s great well it s wonderful in one one respect but i don t know if you can afford the insurance yeah well luckily he drives a big old tank yeah so he i mean i don t think he he could get hurt i just hope to God he doesn t ever hurt anyone but he he hasn t had any accidents luckily right that s good i mean people are all different yeah yeah i i wonder if they should give them a test or at least maybe uh not take their license maybe give them a refresher driving course and just to just to see how well they are every five years right i saw that on Twenty Twenty that are they doing it they um you know they re testing that they re you know thinking of doing that and i think that d be a great idea because you i think they do come become less aware and they just i don t know they and they don t hear as well for one thing and that doesn t help yeah well everybody needs retraining it doesn t hurt uh no that s you know the best football players and all the opera singers still have coaches and i don t know why you couldn t after sixty five every five years have a refresher course and then take another driving it would it would sure the insurance companies would would probably help pay for some of that you know right right at least that way the burden s not on the family of taking their license or their car away right there you go there s a good point very good point it s on the state very good point but i think they need should do that and then the families will have said
