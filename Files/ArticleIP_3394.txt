 Brave Sparrow By Michael Collier posted Wednesday Oct 1 To hear the poet read Brave Sparrow click whose home is in the strawand bailing twine threadedin the slots of a roof vent who guards a tiny ledgeagainst the starlingsthat cruise the neighborhood whose heart is smallerthan a heart should be whose feathers stiffen like an arrow fret to quickenthe hydraulics of its wings stay there on the metal ledge widen your alarmingbeak but do not flee as others haveto the black walnut vaulting overhead Do not move outsidethe world you ve madefrom bailing twine and straw The isolated starling fearsthe crows the crows gang upto rout a hawk The hawk is cold And cold is whata larger heart maintains The owl at dusk and dawn far off unseen but audible repeats its syncopated intervals a song that s not a cry but a whisper rising from concentricrings of water spreading out acrossthe surface of a catchment pond It asks Who are you Whoare you but no one knows Stay where you are nervous jittery Move your small head a hundredways a hundred times keeppaying attention to the terrifying world And if you see the Robinsin their dirty orange vestspatrolling the yard like thugs forget about the worm Starveyourself or from the air inhalethe water you may need digest the dust And what the promiscuouscat and jaybirds do let themdo it let them dart and snipe let them sound like others They sleep when the owl sendsout its encircling question Stay where you are you lit fuse you dull spark of saltpeter and sulfur
