                    Background        Epistatic interactions between mutations in different        genes or different sites within the same gene can        substantially influence the dynamics of evolving        populations Although adaptation by natural selection        depends on occasional beneficial mutations in fact most        mutations are neutral or deleterious Therefore if        mutations are randomly added to an organisms genome as        opposed to incorporated by natural selection then fitness        tends to decline with mutation number Mutations whose        effects are independent of one another are termed         multiplicative  If mutations        interact so that their combined effect on fitness is        greater than expected from their individual effects then        epistasis is said to be         synergistic  For deleterious        mutations synergistic epistasis means that the decline in        average fitness accelerates as more random mutations are        added such epistasis is termed         negative by Phillips et al            By contrast if deleterious mutations interact so that        their combined effect is smaller than expected under the        multiplicative model then epistasis is called         antagonistic or         positive in the terminology of        Phillips et al Antagonistic epistasis therefore implies        unexpected robustness to the effects of multiple        deleterious mutations            The predicted effects of these various types of        mutational interactions on population dynamics are well        studied for reviews see       but in most models        the types of interactions are ad hoc because it is not        known how well the assumed interactions reflect reality In        particular the question of what kinds of interactions are        typical and under what conditions is addressed only        rarely        Recent work has shown that epistatic interactions can be        interpreted as curvature in the fitness surface            which implies that geometry imposes limitations on the        types of epistasis that can be observed for any given        genotype Closely related to this geometric approach is the        realization that epistasis must be studied with respect to        a particular reference sequence         and that        the forms of epistatic interactions change when the        reference is changed Wilke and Adami    proposed that        inhomogeneities in the distribution of genotypes give rise        to directional epistasis directional epistasis is the net        epistasis averaged over many pairs of mutations among        deleterious mutations and that the sign of directional        epistasis provides information about the density gradient        of highfitness sequences within a cluster Hence        evolutionary hypotheses that depend crucially on the sign        of epistasis including certain theories on the evolution        of recombination       and on the speed of        mutation accumulation in asexual populations              will also depend on the density distribution of fit        genotypes and on the topology of those regions of genotype        space into which populations move under the pressures of        mutation and selection        The argument relating directional epistasis to the        distribution of highfitness sequences within a cluster of        fit sequences goes as follows Figure  Consider a        sequence that lies near the         center of a dense cluster of        highfitness sequences Such a sequence is surrounded by        many other highfitness genotypes and the average harm        done by a single mutation is therefore relatively low But        as more random mutations are added highfitness genotypes        become less common and the average harm of multiple        mutations is stronger than what the effect of single        mutations indicated This increasingly harmful effect of        mutations at greater distances away from the original        sequence corresponds to         synergistic epistasis By contrast        if a sequence is located at the periphery of a highfitness        cluster or in a region of low density of highfitness        sequences then this synergistic tendency is lessened and        we might even observe antagonistic epistasis for this        sequence One prediction of this hypothesis of density        inhomogeneities is that the average fitness effect of        single mutations must be correlated with the strength and        direction of epistatic interactions at larger mutational        distances This prediction was confirmed in RNA secondary        structure folding and in digital organisms     A        similar effect was observed for quantitative trait loci in        mice            While the hypothesis of Wilke and Adami    explains        some of the variation within the observed range of        epistatic interactions it fails to predict whether we        should always expect an excess of synergistic epistasis or        whether antagonistic interactions might dominate in certain        situations Recent experiments indicate that synergistic        and antagonistic interactions are both common when pairs of        mutations are considered but that overall the two types        of interactions either roughly cancel each other out or        perhaps even produce an excess of antagonistic interactions                     Only one study of this        type reported an excess of synergistic interactions            Moreover two simple systems with computational        landscapes selfreplicating computer programs    and        RNA secondary structure folding     both exhibited a        clear excess of antagonistic interactions        What factors may explain a tendency toward antagonism        Here are four possible explanations and there may be        others         Biased recovery In some experimental systems it is        difficult to isolate genotypes with very low fitness        including nonviable ones By allowing random mutations to        accumulate only in surviving lineages a researcher may        inadvertently bound mean fitness away from zero and        thereby bias the shape of the fitness function versus        mutation number from synergy toward antagonism         Multiple hits To the extent that multiple mutations        hit the same gene or pathway subsequent mutations will        more likely be neutral than initial ones because the same        function cannot be destroyed twice In effect one mutation        may convert one or more genes into pseudogenes or junk        DNA in which subsequent mutations have no further harmful        effect         Intrinsic or evolved form of interaction The        dynamics of metabolic pathways and gene regulation might be        inherently structured to produce more antagonistic than        synergistic interactions Even if there is no necessary        biochemical tendency in this direction it is possible that        pathways and their regulation have evolved to promote such        interactions While this explanation is vague a failure to        identify any other explanation for observed patterns of        mutational interaction would suggest a closer examination        of models of metabolic pathways and gene regulation with        this issue in mind         Compensatory mutation Consider a genotype that is on        a peak or plateau in a fitness landscape such that all        mutations are either deleterious or neutral As one moves        away from this genotype by adding mutations imagine that        the ratio of deleterious to neutral mutations stays        constant as does the average effect of a deleterious        mutation But as the distance away from this peak        increases a portion of the mutant distribution may move        into the vicinity of one or more other fitness peaks        separated from the original one by a valley of deleterious        mutations Mutations that lead out of the valley onto a new        fitness peak are of course beneficial mutations If a        mutation is beneficial because it restores some previously        existing structure or function then we can call it a        compensatory mutation If the frequency of compensatory        mutations increases as one moves out from the original        peak this effect will slow down the decay of mean fitness        with increasing mutational distance even without         selection for compensatory        mutations        In this paper we focus on a fairly simple system RNA        secondary structure folding which avoids the first        explanation above because of complete information and        avoids the second and third explanations because there is        only a single gene with dichotomous fitness  or  in the        system Thus we can focus on whether and to what extent        compensatory mutations that precisely restore the        previously existing folding structure contribute to an        excess of antagonistic interactions        In order to analyze the topology and structure of        fitness landscapes and assess their effect on epistasis        we need a system where each sequence in a welldefined        space is assigned a unique fitness that is independent of        the frequency of other genotypes in the population RNA        secondary structure folding is a wellstudied model system        In this system the secondary structure of an RNA molecule        is taken as a predictor of the fitness of the underlying        sequence          RNA folding has the        advantage that all genotypes can be separated naturally        into only two classes the viable ones those that fold        into a particular target structure with fitness  and the        nonviable ones those that fail to fold into that exact        structure which are assigned fitness  Such a        classification permits a precise mathematical analysis        while at the same time many important properties of        highdimensional fitness landscapes are retained            The set of all viable sequences can be decomposed into        smaller sets called neutral networks      Two viable        sequences belong to the same neutral network if one        sequence can be transformed into the other through a series        of single point mutations without passing through a        sequence with lower fitness along the way If no such        series of mutations exists then the two viable sequences        belong to different neutral networks        As discussed in previous publications       the        average fitness         w          d  at a Hamming distance         d from a particular reference        sequence can be used for studying directional epistasis in        a large number of genotypes The value of         w          d  is obtained by averaging over the        individual fitnesses of all sequences that can be obtained        from the reference sequence by introducing         d mutations By definition         w  is the fitness of the reference        sequence and we have always         w    The value of         w  is given by  minus the mean        effect of single mutations and in general the value of         w          d  is given by  minus the mean        effect of         d mutations Moreover since we        assume in this study that all individual fitnesses are        either  or          w          d  corresponds also to the fraction        of viable sequences at distance         d from the reference sequence We        will make use of this property repeatedly throughout this        paper        We expect that         w          d  decreases roughly exponentially        as         d increases for the following        reason If the sequences are sufficiently long that any        back mutations can be neglected then genotype space can be        visualized as a tree Fig  If the number of neutral        neighbors the neutrality  of all viable sequences is        approximately the same and the fraction of neutral        mutations of a viable sequence is on average much larger        than the probability that a completely random sequence is        viable then         w          d   can be approximated by          L          L          w          d  where         L is sequence length and  denotes        the number of different bases that can occur    for        RNA Thus we can write         w          d   exp         d  with              L          L  The condition that the fraction        of neutral mutants          L          L  is much larger than the total        fraction of viable mutants among all possible sequences is        crucial for the exponential decay of         w          d  Consider by contrast the Russian        Roulette model by Gavrilets and Gravner     in which        all sequences are randomly assigned a fitness value of        either  or  The total fraction         p of viable sequences in this model        is equal to the expected fraction of neutral mutants of any        sequence with fitness  and         w          d           p for         d   in this model        In the general case  is not constant If  changes        systematically with increasing         d  then         w          d  will decay slightly faster or        slower than a perfect exponential We incorporate this by        writing                   w          d   expd          The parameter  represents the         deviation from the exponential        expectation Because an exact exponential decay means that        the average effect of a new mutation is independent of how        many mutations have accumulated previously  is a measure        of the net effect of epistatic interactions In the        following we refer to this net effect as directional        epistasis and to  as the epistasis parameter           corresponds to synergistic epistasis whereas           corresponds to antagonistic interactions        Consider the fitness landscape depicted in Figure  in        which circles represent viable sequences while crosses are        nonviable ones This particular landscape contains two        separate neutral networks of which one indicated by bold        solid lines is connected to the reference sequence at        distance         d   At         d   in the upper branch a        compensatory mutation leads onto a second neutral network        shown as bold dashed lines For such fitness trees        anchored at particular reference sequences we can measure        both the decline in average fitness with mutational        distance         w          d  as well as the change in the        average neutrality as we increase         d  The average neutrality at        distance         d simply reflects the connectedness        of the neutral network at that distance Average neutrality        at mutational distance         d is defined as the average number of        neutral neighbors of a sequence that is separated by         d mutations from the reference        sequence and that is part of the neutral network under        investigation As per the arguments by Wilke and Adami            we expect the connectedness to decrease with         d as we move away from a reference        sequence in the center of a highfitness cluster By        contrast we expect connectedness to increase or at least        decrease more slowly if the reference sequence is on the        fringe of such a cluster Figure shows         w          d  and average neutrality for        examples of fringe and center reference sequences The        fringe sequence Fig a has strongly antagonistic net        epistasis and neutrality increases with distance By        contrast the center sequence Fig b shows a slightly        synergistic tendency and declining neutrality with        distance This association agrees with our expectation that        more antagonistic curves         w          d  are caused by an increase in the        density of neutral sequences with         d  whereas more synergistic curves        result from a corresponding decline                    Results        For  randomly chosen RNA sequences of length         L   we measured both the fraction        of neutral mutants         w          d  as well as the average neutrality        of neighbors of neutral mutants as a function of the        distance         d  We determined  and  from        fitting exp         d  to         w          d  Moreover we performed a linear        regression on the average neutrality to quantify the change        in neutrality with distance from the reference sequence        for each of the random sequences serving as a reference        Among the  reference sequences that we studied the        change in neutrality was sufficiently linear to make the        slope         m an excellent indicator of the        general trend increasing or decreasing neutrality with        distance         d  even if the true relationship        was not always precisely linear        Figure shows this measured slope         m versus the fitted epistasis        parameter  for each of the  reference sequences The        two quantities are very strongly correlated correlation        coefficient         r           p   However the        distributions of         m and  differ in an important        respect The values of         m are distributed roughly        symmetrically around zero meaning that the average        neutrality increases as often as it decreases with distance        from the reference sequence The epistasis parameter  on        the other hand lies almost entirely below unity Even when        the average neutrality decays quickly as one moves away        from the reference sequence the corresponding value of         indicates at most a very slight tendency toward synergistic        epistasis This is precisely the pattern of excess        antagonistic epistasis that demands an explanation        If compensatory mutations were responsible for the shift        of  to values below one then by adjusting the function         w          d  to         remove their contribution we should        find a distribution of  symmetrical around one As        described in the Methods section it is possible to        separate the contribution to         w          d  of neutral mutations that lie on        the same network         w         neut          d  from the contribution         w         comp          d  that reflects compensatory        mutations from neighboring neutral networks onto the        reference network Figure shows         w          d          w         neut          d  and         w         comp          d  estimated using method M for a        typical example The contribution of         w         neut          d  to         w          d  dwindles as the mutational        distance         d increases while         w         comp          d  becomes increasingly dominant In        other words at large distances         d  most of the viable sequences        arise through compensatory mutations        After partitioning the contributions of         w         neut          d  and         w         comp          d  for all  functions         w          d  we determined  and  for the        functions         w         neut          d  in the same way as was done for         w          d  The functions         w         neut          d  can be thought of as the decay        functions without contamination by compensatory        mutations Thus the differences in  and  for         w          d  and         w         neut          d  must be ascribed to compensatory        mutations Figure shows  versus  for both         w          d  shown as triangles and         w         neut          d  calculated by method M shown        as circles The removal of compensatory mutations causes a        pronounced upward shift of  toward more synergistic        epistasis The average decay parameter  is largely        unaffected For         w          d  average             standard error of the mean while for         w         neut          d  the average             by M or    by M Figure shows that the        removal of compensatory mutations yields a distribution of         that is approximately symmetric around one in contrast        to the pronounced excess of antagonistic epistasis           when compensatory mutations are included                    Discussion        The correlation between average mutational effects         and directional epistasis  described by Wilke and Adami           implies that whether a reference sequence shows        synergistic or antagonistic epistasis depends on whether it        lies near the center of a dense cluster of highfitness        sequences in genetic space or on the fringes of such a        cluster Hansen and Wagner    independently suggested        that the relative frequency of synergistic and antagonistic        interactions depends on the distance of the genotype in        question from the optimum and thus from the center of the        cluster        In this study we demonstrated a very strong correlation        between  which governs the net direction of epistasis        and the mean change in neutrality per added mutation away        from the reference sequence         m Fig  This correlation is fully        consistent with the hypothesis that directional epistasis        depends on the location of the reference sequence relative        to other highfitness genotypes Yet this correlation does        not explain the overall preponderance of antagonistic        epistasis observed in two computational systems             nor the absence of overall synergistic epistasis in most        biological systems that have been carefully studied in this        regard Although we found wide variation in the epistasis        parameter for RNA secondary structure folding Fig          of  reference sequences showed an excess of antagonistic        epistasis    and only  exhibited more synergism           We demonstrated that this overall excess of        antagonistic interactions results from compensatory        mutations Figs    which are evidently important        for the shape of the fitness function whether or not a        sequence is in the middle of a dense cluster        The trajectory for mean fitness as random mutations        accumulate is generally one of decay because many more        mutations are deleterious than are beneficial The decay        function is therefore sometimes loosely discussed as if it        depended only on deleterious mutations or only deleterious        and neutral mutations This focus on declining fitness        tends to ignore compensatory mutations because they are        beneficial albeit conditionally But compensatory        mutations cannot be ignored if their frequency varies        systematically in genetic space In particular if        compensatory mutations are an increasing fraction of all        viable mutations as the distribution moves away from a        local fitness peak then they will affect the shape of the        decay function Fig  and the resulting epistasis        parameter Figs          In the present paper we have used the term        compensatory mutation for all mutations that are not on        the main neutral network irrespective of their distance to        this network This is a broad definition of compensatory        mutations because it encompasses not only those mutations        that directly counteract a particular deleterious mutation        but also mutations that establish a new neutral network far        away from the main network The latter type of mutations        could also be called advantageous mutations Here we have        lumped both types together because in this way the        presentation of our results is less cluttered and the        mathematics of separating         w          d  into the various contributions is        easier to follow than if we were distinguishing three        different types of mutations An additional argument for        calling all these mutations compensatory is that they can        produce a fitness gain only in association with one or more        mutations that would otherwise be deleterious that is        none of the mutations that could be termed advantageous is        accessible directly from the main neutral network On the        other hand our definition excludes mutations that restore        a genotype to the main neutral network even mutations that        are not reversions in the strict sense Again we chose        this definition for mathematical precision and clarity The        definition is not as important as the substantive        conclusion The fact that it is possible to restore a        previously existing structure by many nontrivial        mutational pathways is sufficient to cause pronounced        antagonistic directional epistasis        A high abundance of compensatory mutations implies        considerable flexibility in the genotypephenotype map        such that fit phenotypes can be found widely distributed in        genotype space For the case of RNA secondary structure        folding this property of the genotypephenotype map has        been demonstrated analytically using graph theory            and it has been verified in extensive numerical simulations             Random graph theory predicts that RNA secondary        structures can be classified into common structures which        can be found almost anywhere in sequence space and rare        structures Only a very small number of sequences fold into        any given rare structure The common structures satisfy the        shapecovering theorem which states that within any sphere        of a certain radius         r  at least one sequence can be        found that folds into a given common structure Since we        have chosen the reference sequences randomly in our        analysis we can safely assume that the majority of the        sequences that we have studied fold into a common        structure and that therefore the shapecovering theorem        applies For sequences of length         L   we have         r   Table  in Ref            That means that any common structure can be found at least        once within a distance of approximately  mutations        from any arbitrarily chosen sequence In other words even        in the empty regions of sequence space at least one out of          sequences will be viable A second prediction from        random graph theory is that the common structures should        percolate through sequence space Percolation means that it        is possible to find two sequences with almost no sequence        identity which fold into the same structure and which are        connected by a path of mutant sequences that also fold into        the same structure However this percolation property        holds only if the exchange of both bases of a pair in        paired regions of the secondary structure is considered as        a singlemutation event which runs counter to the standard        biological meaning of mutation Most of these double        mutations will be classified as compensatory mutations        according to our definition because each individual        mutation of such pairs will most likely destroy the        secondary structure and therefore a single neutral path        according to random graph theory will appear as several        independent paths linked together by compensatory mutations        in our analysis This fact combined with the        shapecovering theorem which we discussed previously is        probably the source of the large number of compensatory        mutations that we observe        A major difference between the fitness landscapes we        have studied here and more natural fitness landscapes is        that we restricted fitness values to either one or zero        whereas in nature fitness is certainly not a binary        variable Two sequences that fold into the same structure        may bind to a receptor with different efficiencies and a        sequence that folds into a slightly different structure may        also bind to the receptor albeit less efficiently We        chose here binary fitness values for mathematical        simplicity and clarity in our analysis With a continuous        fitness scale apart from neutral and inviable sequences        we would have to keep track of slightly and strongly        deleterious as well as advantageous sequences and would        consequently need a much more elaborate mathematical        procedure to account for the contributions from these        different fitness classes Nevertheless it would certainly        be desirable to address in a future study the effect of        compensatory mutations on epistatic interactions in a        system with a continuous fitness scale for example with a        fitness measure similar to the one used by Ancel and        Fontana    or alternatively using digital organisms                   The present study does not exclude the possibility that        antagonistic epistasis in some systems could be caused by        effects other than compensatory mutations However our        findings do indicate that compensatory mutations can play a        major role in producing antagonistic epistasis and thus        slowing the decay in mean fitness under random mutation        accumulation Moreover in the present study only        mutations that recreated exactly the same RNA folding as        the wildtype were deemed compensatory while in nature        even a modified secondary structure may have a tertiary        structure that is sufficiently close to the wildtype that        no fitness loss is incurred     which means that        compensatory mutations in natural RNA structures may be        even more frequent that in our computational model        Compensatory mutations have been reported for rRNA            tRNA     and mRNA    structures and it is        certainly not surprising that we should find a high        frequency of compensatory mutations in the present study        What is important and novel in this study is that we have        explained the overall excess of antagonistic epistasis by        these compensatory mutations This connection suggests that        evidence for one of these phenomena may provide evidence        for the other in more complicated systems        In the remaining paragraphs we discuss to what extent        our results can be applied to systems other than RNA        secondary structure folding We begin with proteins        Several studies of protein folding         in silico indicate that widespread        neutral networks exist comparable to the situation for RNA        sequences       Moreover decay functions similar        to the function         w          d  studied here have been measured         in vitro     by making fitness        a binary variable eg a protein binds to a receptor or        not and then screening libraries of sequences with varying        average numbers of mutations for the relevant property        These experiments found that average fitness initially        decayed exponentially with increasing mutations but the        rate of decay tended to decelerate at higher mutation        numbers This deceleration may be attributed to suppressor        mutations that stabilize parts of the protein against        further mutations     which in essence is a form of        compensation For example the MT mutation in        lactamase compensates for locally destabilizing mutations        in a loop near the active site      Unfortunately        no study has yet investigated explicitly the decay function        of proteins that carry such a suppressor mutation        Therefore it is unclear whether the decelerating decay        rates seen by Suzuki et al    and by Daugherty et al           are a consequence of compensatory suppressor        mutations or alternatively indicate that the reference        sequences happened to be located outside a dense cluster of        fit sequences        Using whole bacteria and viruses several studies have        sought to measure the mutational decay function for fitness        and the overall direction of epistatic interactions                Only one of these studies found net        synergistic interactions     Several other studies        with bacteria and viruses have documented widespread        compensatory mutations       although these        studies all used selection to find compensatory mutations        rather than directly estimating their frequency Taken        together these two types of studies are largely consistent        with the main conclusions of the present paper that        synergistic interactions do not generally dominate the        fitness function and compensatory mutations are common        Moreover in two of the studies on compensation it was        shown that the compensatory mutations had occurred outside        the gene that was debilitated      Therefore the        observed patterns of epistasis and compensation do not        merely reflect the robustness of individual RNA and protein        molecules to multiple mutations as described above but        must indicate more general features of their genomes        Of course it is possible that more complex patterns of        gene regulation in eukaryotes    might predispose them        to synergistic effects between mutations In fact studies        on fruitflies     and a unicellular alga    but        see     reported net synergistic epistasis which        might reflect fitness landscapes in which peaks are few and        far between But other studies with eukaryotes including        nematodes    and fungi      found no tendency        toward synergistic epistasis Hence the overall direction        of epistasis for fitness and the possible role of        compensatory mutations in pushing toward net antagonistic        epistasis among random mutations will require more study        in higher organisms Finally Zuckerkandl    recently        proposed that complex regulatory networks may often evolve        via a process of drift decay followed by selection for        compensatory mutations Such an interplay would complicate        the overall pattern of directional epistasis relative to        regulatory complexity                    Methods        We predicted RNA secondary structure using the Vienna        RNA package version  with the default setup            We used  randomly chosen RNA sequences of length         L   as reference sequences by        randomly drawing bases A G C and U from a uniform        distribution in which each base has a probability  of        being drawn at any position For each reference sequence        we determined its secondary structure and measured the        fraction of mutant sequences at Hamming distances         d   that folded into the        same structure by calculating the secondary structure of        up to  mutant sequences at each Hamming distance We        used the fraction of neutral mutants at Hamming distance         d as the function         w          d  for the particular reference        sequence The fraction of neutral mutants at distance         d is equivalent to         w          d  under the assumption that mutant        sequences which fold into the same structure as the        reference sequence have fitness  and all other mutants        have fitness  In addition to distinguish neutral from        compensatory mutations we recorded at each Hamming        distance         d  for all viable sequences as well        as a random sample of up to  nonviable sequences the        average number of viable sequences after an         additional onestep mutation In the        following analyses we denote the average fraction of        viable sequences that are one mutation away from a viable        sequence at distance         d as         x         neut          d  Similarly we denote as         x         comp          d  the average fraction of viable        sequences that are one mutation away from a         nonviable sequence at distance         d         As in Ref     we fitted functions expd  to        the measured         w          d  in order to obtain a        twoparameter description of the average effect of single        mutations  and the directional epistasis  We also        fitted functions         md          n to the average neutrality as a        function of         d  in order to identify whether        neutrality was increasing or decreasing with mutational        distance         d         We used two methods to separate         w          d  into contributions from viable        sequences that lie on the same neutral network as the        reference sequence at         d            w         neut          d  and from viable sequences that        lie on other neutral networks          w         comp          d         The first method M uses the information contained in        both         x         neut          d  and         x         comp          d  As explained below this method        tends to overestimate the contribution of         w         comp          d  Let           d           w         neut          d           w         neut          d           w         comp          d  which is the fraction of viable        sequences belonging to the reference neutral network at        distance         d  Then         w         neut          d  is simply given by                w         neut          d             d          w          d          x         neut          d          Estimating         w         comp          d  is more complicated First we        must take into account sequences contributing to         w          d  that are not part of the neutral        network of the reference sequence This contribution is        given by             d          w          d          x         neut          d  We must then obtain the        contribution of additional compensatory mutations at        distance         d   These are given by           w          d  the number of nonviable        sequences at distance         d  multiplied by the probability        with which these nonviables turn into viable sequences        after a single mutation         x         comp          d  Hence we arrive at                w         comp          d                d          w          d          x         neut          d             w          d          x         comp          d          With relations  and  we can recursively calculate                w         neut          d  and         w         comp          d  for all         d for which         w          d          x         neut          d  and         x         comp          d  are known        In general we expect         w          d           w         neut          d           w         comp          d  However method M has the        problem that some of the mutations counted in         x         comp          d  may actually lead back onto the        network of the reference sequence rather than onto a        separate neutral network While this can be seen as a sort        of compensatory mutation it is not the kind investigated        here Such sequences would then be counted twice so that        in reality         w          d           w         neut          d           w         comp          d         To avoid this doublecounting method M uses instead of         the expression                w         comp          d            w          d            w         neut          d           In this case the quantity         x         comp          d  drops out which insures that         w         neut          d           w         comp          d  is always identical to         w          d  M does not suffer from double        counting viable sequences but it uses less information        than M and depends on an additional assumption In        particular M assumes that the viable sequences at        distance         d that belong to the neutral network        of the reference sequence have the same neutrality as those        that do not belong to that network Given these        considerations it seems prudent to use both M and M        rather than rely entirely on either one        Both methods M and M are based on the assumption that        the fitness landscape can be represented as a tree and        that back mutations can be neglected With a sequence        length of         L   only one out of  possible        mutations is a back mutation and therefore the neglect of        back mutations is justified The representation of the        fitness landscape as a tree is potentially more        problematic because there may exist several paths from the        reference sequence to a particular sequence at mutational        distance         d  whereas the tree approximation        assumes that there is only one such path For example        consider the wild type aa with neutral mutants aA Aa and        AA Then at mutational distance one there are two neutral        mutants aA and Aa and at distance two there is only one        AA The tree approximation counts the mutant at distance        two twice once as a mutant of aA and once as a mutant of        Aa This double counting means that our methods have the        tendency to overestimate         w         neut          d  This overestimation however is        not problematic in the context of the present paper        because  as we emphasized in the results  our main        conclusions are based on the large contribution of         w         comp          d  to         w          d  A correction for the        overestimation of         w         neut          d  would increase the contribution        of         w         comp          d  and would therefore make our        conclusions even stronger                    Authors contributions
