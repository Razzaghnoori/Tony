 have you been having any uh good weather lately well today was really nice the past few days have been rather chilly uh we had a lot of rain recently i m in Texas where are you oh i m in Texas Plano uh huh oh you are do you work for TI oh i see yes i do yeah so then we ve been having just about the same weather yeah it was pretty nice today but i stayed inside i came up with a cold couple days ago so i m taking care of that but uh yeah it s nice and sunny out yeah have you been doing anything outside in this great weather uh not lately but uh yeah there was a little bit of rain couple days ago and they had tornados up in uh Oklahoma and i guess in Wichita Falls too no yeah i know we had a tornado watch watch a couple of days ago but nothing really happened uh huh are you originally from uh Texas no i m from Wisconsin originally uh i don t know what the weather s been like up there but uh typically in March it s still uh kind uh kind of like winter uh very cold the um hum well i lived in New York for a long time so Texas is Texas weather is quite uh different for me well we had a real mild winter here though yeah we did we uh they re always mild to me compared to New York winters have you have you ever been to New York in the winter okay i can believe that uh huh no i ve well Wisconsin gets pretty bad sometimes too but uh probably not near as bad as New York uh i m sure uh huh i think it depends on what part of the state right but this winter here i think we only had one instance of ice one weekend right and uh other than that uh it was uh maybe just uh three real cold spells i don t have too much uh shrubbery damage from that but uh still some didn t manage to survive yeah the only thing i don t like about uh Dallas weather is that it gets a little bit too hot sometimes in the summer yeah it gets it gets uh hot but uh it s not very humid and there s always a nice uh breeze blowing yeah yeah like New York was really humid you know you but you could you could walk around outside in New York you could just stay outside in in it you know because it was i guess the average summer temperature is about eighty uh you know in the eighties yeah and it was pretty pleasant except for the humidity you know i ve been here about thirteen years and i ve gotten quite quite acclimated to the weather i the summers don t bother me anymore at all i don t mind when it gets over a hundred degrees uh huh well at least you can plan you can say well uh i m going to go to the beach next Wednesday and you ll know that it s going to be hot enough to go yeah but in in New York you really never know you can plan to you know to go up to the beach on the Fourth of July and then you know it might be seventy degrees or something sure uh huh i don t know what kind of a summer we re expecting this year i imagine it s going to be hot again yeah yeah i m sure it will in Dallas Texas well that s pretty typical though uh i don t uh i don t guess it s going to be any much different uh than than it has been in the past so i expect uh July and August we ll see our or uh share of hundred degree days right have you ever been to Canada no i never have um i ve been close uh was in Detroit one time just right across the river from Windsor uh huh uh that s supposed to be really cold weather in the winter that s why New York gets so cold because it s so close to Canada yeah i believe that i was in Wisconsin over uh the Christmas holidays and it was about uh twenty below zero when i got up there uh huh goodness they uh they had a high of i think eighteen degrees during the week that i was there uh huh so it s stayed cold for the entire week was it snowing snowing um we got one day of snow and one day of ice other than that it was pretty good just cold um you know uh Christmas really doesn t seem like Christmas to me unless i do see the snow and the ice we don t get too much snow here it uh it s just really pretty with the snow and the ice and all of the lights not necessarily not the ice i should keep leave the ice out of it but the snow is real pretty well i can live without ice yeah the snow is nice doesn t usually last too long here uh huh i remember i know one Christmas when i was in Dallas it snowed it snowed and and there was a white Christmas but i don t i guess it s been about five or six years ago yeah i remember maybe uh maybe three winters where we had a white Christmas here um hum other than that it s uh the snow usually doesn t last more than a day or two yeah i just think it s really really pretty we i remember one Christmas here it was sixty degrees that was so strange to me having lived in New York you know uh huh yeah well that s not uncommon what s really bad here in winter is when we get uh ice on the roads and the temperature doesn t get above freezing there is no uh ice removal equipment yeah yeah and people drive like the street street is dry yeah that is if if the businesses are all open uh lot of them close down yeah i don t think TI s closed down in a couple of years for bad weather that s right we didn t close at all this past winter oh i look forward to one of those days yeah well we usually have to make them up though so not now that s true did you say you work in Plano uh well i work at the main set in Dallas yeah uh huh oh you do i do too i well did uh did you get much rain two days ago did i get what much rain two days ago yeah Thursday uh i know it sprinkled some i didn t get much rain here in Plano but i guess it really poured in Richardson uh huh i believe it it it uh it rained at night or something because i saw puddles of water outside but i didn t yeah i don t think we got uh i don t think we got it near as bad as uh Oklahoma and i guess Fort Worth had high high winds in fact uh the wind was responsible for knocking down a light pole at the Water Gardens that killed two people uh huh uh huh um hum so they usually get uh worse weather than we do yeah in winter too well March is the the month for high winds yeah and it s been rather windy here too and we get a lot of tornados too this is the time of the year uh huh have you heard the forecast for the week coming up no i sure haven t it s i think it s supposed to be nice though yeah i haven t either yeah it s probably going to start getting summer hot seventies eighties i guess yeah well that s nice i ve been checking on my plants seeing the the roses bud out already oh you plant oh yeah somewhat uh have to kind of watch watch the weather make sure everything is going the way it s supposed to uh huh waiting for the waiting waiting for the weather to get nice out so i can go ahead and uh replace some of the some of the dead shrubs from winter uh huh but uh like i said i stayed in today because i picked up a cold the other day so didn t feel like going outside and doing much yeah well it probably they ll probably do okay now i have a friend that s planted some uh planted a garden some things like collard greens and cabbage uh huh and uh they re coming up really pretty you just need a just need a good rain yeah we we really haven t didn t get enough rain the other day to uh do much good for uh things growing just a lot of weeds right now and they ll come up whether we get nice weather or not um hum yeah yeah well i live in an apartment so the only thing i grow are plants inside and i don t do very very well with those i think the temperature in here uh huh well you ve got a lot more control over the inside temperature than you do than you do outside yeah but i guess i just don t know what i m doing okay sometimes i i d sit the plants outside on the patio and and i d forget about them and it gets too hot out there and and they you know burn up and so forth that s happened to quite a few of my plants yeah i don t do well with potted plants outside i tend to neglect neglect them and they sit in the sun too long and dry up or uh if i don t put them in the sun they don t grow yeah um hum i don t know but uh yeah i guess next week s supposed to be real nice outside i hope it is anyway because uh softball season starts and we re ready to to go outside and do some outdoor activities uh uh huh well good i hope hope it s nice too okay well uh i haven t heard the forecast for the next for uh coming up for this weekend or next week so i m not sure what to expect i can only guess that it s supposed to be nice yeah i hope it s as nice as it was today uh huh seems like it was extra cold last night though i m not sure what the overnight low was but i know it was cold i had turn on the heat and get quilts yeah oh yeah guess i ll have to turn on the weather on the news tonight see what we re supposed to expect yeah anyway i guess everything s been pretty typical for March uh huh have to see what uh April or May have to offer you know the summer really starts in Dallas that i remember one one year seems like it started about the end of February yeah hot sometimes it does uh sometimes it ll get in the eighties uh as early as uh January February um hum yeah but it up in New York it s cold till about June well they still have snow on the ground through March and probably part of April sometimes um yeah one thing about the snow in March it at at least it ll melt it melts quickly up there well it leaves a mess then when it does melt everything thaws out that s true lot of mud
