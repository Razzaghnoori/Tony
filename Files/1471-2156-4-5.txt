 Background Mutations in MYOC have been shown to be causative for primary open angle glaucoma POAG 1 2 3 Glucocorticoids have been implicated in ocular hypertension and glaucoma due to increased plasma cortisol levels 4 5 and altered cortisol metabolism 6 7 in POAG patients and from the increased risk of developing POAG in steroid responsive patients 8 9 Myocilin has been shown to be upregulated in glucocorticoid treated human trabecular meshwork TM cells 10 11 and there is variable evidence for increased MYOC expression in glaucomatous individuals 12 13 14 In addition glaucoma patients have a higher chance of responding to steroids than non glaucomatous individuals However an extensive study of mutations in the proximal promoter and coding region of MYOC found no sequence polymorphisms associated with steroid responsiveness 15 Myocilin has been shown to be secreted both in human TM cell cultures and in vivo in aqueous humor AH 12 Glaucomatous mutations however alter myocilin Triton solubility 16 and prevent myocilin from being secreted 12 The glycosylation status of myocilin is somewhat controversial Several groups have shown that myocilin is glycosylated 10 16 17 18 19 20 21 whereas one group suggests that myocilin is not glycosylated 22 In our hands both an N linked glycosylated 57 kDa and unglycosylated 55 kDa form of myocilin is detected in TM cell culture media 17 and aqueous humor 12 The basis for both secretion and N linked glycosylation of myocilin is part of the focus of this paper Rabbits have been successfully used as a model of glucocorticoid induced ocular hypertension 23 24 25 26 27 In order to study the association of MYOC gene expression with steroid induced ocular hypertension it will be helpful to know the sequence of rabbit myocilin We report here the cloning sequence comparison and expression analysis of rabbit MYOC We show that an N terminal signal peptide is necessary for myocilin secretion and we identify the N linked glycosylation site found in human but not rabbit myocilin Results Characterization of Rabbit MYOC We have cloned a 2 kb cDNA for rabbit MYOC that encodes a 490 amino acid 55 kDa protein with a calculated pI of 5 25 Fig 1 Rabbit myocilin amino acid sequence is 84 identical to human myocilin 28 and highly homologous across species Table 2 with an overall 64 homology Rabbit myocilin is 14 amino acids shorter at the N terminus than human myocilin and the same length as monkey 15 mouse 29 30 and bovine 31 myocilin Fig 2 As in all myocilin orthologs cloned to date rabbit myocilin contains a leucine zipper motif aa 103 to 152 Fig 2 A potential peroxisomal targeting signal is encoded on the C terminus SKI aa 488 490 Unlike human monkey and mouse myoclin rabbit myocilin does not contain a consensus N linked glycosylation site N X S T human aa 57 59 monkey aa 43 45 mouse aa 43 45 Fig 2 The nucleotide sequence for rabbit MYOC reported in this manuscript has been submitted to GenBank AY191317 Secretion of Rabbit MYOC Rabbit monkey mouse and bovine myocilin open reading frames begin at amino acid 15 relative to human myocilin The function if any of the extra N terminal 14 aa encoded by human myocilin is not presently known Rat myocilin also contains an extra 13 aa N terminal sequence 32 To determine if rabbit myocilin is secreted despite the absence of the additional human like N terminal 14 aa we examined rabbit aqueous humor We were able to detect myocilin in rabbit aqueous humor Fig 3A This suggests that the human N terminal 14 aa is dispensible for secretion and that the rabbit myocilin sequence is sufficient to direct secretion Next we created a human myocilin expression construct where the N terminal 14aa were deleted pcDNA3 hMYOC N14 forcing translation to begin at the second methionine codon Fig 2 GTM66 cells were chosen for this study based on their ability to grow and transfect well and are a glaucomatous TM cell line derived from a 92 year old female donor 11 17 Transfection of GTM66 cells with the N terminal deletion mutant resulted in a distribution pattern similar to wild type human myocilin Fig 3B The fact that we see no discernable difference in the relative mobility between transfected human wild type myocilin and 14 amino acid amino terminal deleted myocilin Fig 3B and human vs monkey myocilin in AH Fig 3A may be due to the use of small format gels or possibly to the usage of the second N terminal methionine by the cell for synthesizing human myocilin making human and monkey molecular weights comparable Nonetheless an N terminal signal peptide is likely necessary for directing synthesis of myocilin via the ER Golgi pathway for secretion outside the cell To determine what actually constitutes the signal sequence for myocilin we conducted an analysis of signal peptide cleavage sites using the Center for Biological Sequence Analysis SignalP v1 1 Database http www cbs dtu dk services SignalP A signal peptide cleavage site was predicted to exist between rabbit aa 18 and 19 human aa 32 and 33 33 We directly tested the importance of the signal peptide in myocilin secretion by replacing the first 32 aa of human myocilin with a single methionine pcDNA3 hMYOC N32 Transfection of GTM66 cells with pcDNA3 hMYOC N32 resulted in intracellular but not extracellular myocilin distribution Fig 3B This is the result expected if the signal peptide were necessary for secretion This suggests that the first 18 aa of rabbit myocilin may function as a signal peptide and are necessary for myocilin secretion Myocilin Glycosylation Human myocilin has been shown to migrate as a 55 57 kDa doublet by SDS PAGE immunoblot analysis 10 11 12 16 17 The modification accounting for this molecular weight difference is hypothesized to be due to differential glycosylation N linked glycosylation sites were predicted using the Center for Biological Sequence Analysis NetNGlyc 1 0 Prediction Server http www cbs dtu dk services NetNGlyc Human monkey and mouse myocilin contain a consensus asparagine N linked glycosylation site NES near the N terminus whereas rabbit rat and bovine code for SES at this position Fig 2 Having a serine present at this position would eliminate N linked glycosylation and would be predicted to result in a difference in relative gel mobility between human monkey and rabbit myocilin To test this hypothesis we analyzed human monkey and rabbit AH myocilin side by side in SDS PAGE immunoblots The anti human myocilin antibody 129 used in these studies generated to human amino acids 156 171 12 17 cross reacts with rabbit and monkey myocilin With human and monkey myocilin we see a clear doublet whereas rabbit myocilin migrates as a single band with the same relative mobility as the lower band of human and monkey myocilin Fig 3A suggesting that the asparagine vs serine amino acid difference is responsible for the differential glycosylation To directly test this theory we mutated human myocilin amino acid 57 from Asn to Ser as found in rabbit myocilin Media and cell lysate from transfected GTM66 cells contained a single immunoreactive myocilin band that migrated with the same relative mobility as the lower wt myocilin band Fig 3B This suggests that the 55 57 kDa human myocilin doublet is due to differential glycosylation and that the site of N linked glycosylation on human myocilin is Asn 57 To determine the effects of deglycosylation on myocilin we treated human monkey and rabbit AH with a cocktail of glycosidases N and O linked Our results show that the upper band of human and monkey myocilin is eliminated whereas the lower band remains unaltered Fig 3A This indicates that the upper human and monkey myocilin band is glycosylated In addition the single rabbit myocilin band shifted downward slightly with deglycosylation This may be due to removal of O linked glycosylation Discussion We report the cloning and characterization of rabbit myocilin Rabbit myocilin is highly similar to the other myocilin orthologs Table 2 and contains a leucine zipper motif encoded by exon 1 Fig 2 This conservation likely reflects the importance of the leucine zipper motif in directing protein protein interactions 34 35 Many amino acid mutations encoded in the olfactomedin homology domain of exon 3 that are known to cause glaucoma in humans are also conserved in rabbit myocilin In fact all 31 amino acids 34 missense nonsense mutations total for human myocilin documented in the Human Gene Mutation Database http uwcmml1s uwcm ac uk uwcm mg search 5584221 htmlto cause glaucoma are conserved in rabbit myocilin Fig 2 Myocilin has been shown to be secreted in vitro and in vivo by several investigators 10 11 12 20 21 34 36 37 38 Secreted proteins typically contain a 16 30 aa signal sequence on their N terminus which directs the completion of protein synthesis across the ER membrane A signal peptidase cleaves the signal sequence and the trimmed protein is shuttled through the Golgi for secretion We demonstrate the functionality of the N terminal signal peptide in directing myocilin secretion Deletion of the predicted N terminal signal peptide results in loss of secretion but not intracellular appearance Fig 3B There are conflicting reports on whether myocilin is glycosylated Differential glycosylation of myocilin has been shown in this report and by others 17 20 21 to account for the appearance of a 55 57 kDa doublet by Western immunoblot analysis In contrast Huang et al 22 report that myocilin is not glycosylated This discrepancy may be due to technical reasons Huang et al did not resolve the 55 57 kDa doublet using their SDS PAGE system and only detected a 57 kDa human myocilin band so any deglycosylation PNGase F NANase II and O Glycosidase occurring would be difficult to resolve A positive control was not reported in their deglycosylation experiment so their conclusion that myocilin is not glycosylated may simply be due to inactive glycosidase The lack of glycosylation seen in the in vitro canine pancreatic microsomal membrane translation experiment may again be due to poor 55 57 kDa myocilin doublet resolution or the inability of this artificial system to faithfully glycosylate myocilin However Caballero et al was able to detect deglycosylation affects using similar methodology 20 Nguyen et al 10 identified a 66 kDa band as the glycosylated and major extracellular form of human myocilin and not the upper band in the 55 57 kDa doublet These authors claim that the lower band of the unglycosylated 55 57 kDa doublet is due to cleavage of the N terminal 32 amino acid signal peptide In our hands we do not see a 66 kDa band on our anti myocilin Western blots even using human aqueous humor as a source of myocilin We provide evidence that the upper band of the 55 57 kDa doublet is the glycosylated form of myocilin Fig 3A Another group has also reported the 66 kDa band using an anti myocilin antibody different from the Nguyen et al antibody 14 The reason for the appearance of this 66 kDa is unclear but may be due to cross reaction of the primary or secondary antibody with another protein such as albumin which has a molecular weight of 65 kDa GenPept accession NP_000468 To date protein sequence data identifying the 66 kDa band as myocilin has not been reported Human myocilin Asn57 is part of an N linked glycosylation consensus NES and is the only residue on myocilin predicted to be N glycosylated We provide both site directed mutagenesis Fig 3B and deglycosylation Fig 3A evidence that the upper band of the 55 57 kDa human and monkey myocilin doublet is the glycosylated form The increase in mobility of rabbit myocilin with deglycosylation Fig 3A is likely due to removal of O linked glycosylation Analysis of O linked glycosylation by the CBS NetOGlyc 2 0 Prediction Server http www cbs dtu dk services NetOGlyc identified two unique rabbit Thr93 and Thr267 and three common rabbit Thr66 Thr263 and Ser45 O linked glycosylation sites in rabbit vs human monkey myocilin The additional O linked glycosylation sites in rabbit may be responsible for the mobility shift seen in the deglycosylation experiment and the relative diffusiveness of the rabbit myocilin band A naturally occuring Asn57Asp polymorphism may be associated with JOAG 39 which if truly disease associated would suggest the functional importance of N linked glycosylation N linked glycosylation is known to confer stability on many extracellular proteins 40 Myocilin is similar to fibronectin an extracellular matrix protein in that both a glycosylated and unglycosylated form is secreted from the cell The unglycosylated form of fibronectin is more susceptible to proteolytic degradation than the glycosylated form 41 It will be interesting to determine why two forms of myocilin are secreted in humans and what functionality if any N linked glycosylation imparts on human vs rabbit myocilin It is still unknown how myocilin functions normally and pathophysiologically However recent evidence suggests that disease causing myocilin mutations are gain of function Disease causing myocilin mutants are less soluble in Triton 16 and are retained by the cell 12 Other studies have shown that a truncated form of myocilin does not get secreted 20 21 and that mouse MYOC knockouts are without discernable phenotype 42 Furthermore a human hemizygous individual containing an interstitial deletion of chromosome 1 which encodes MYOC was without evidence of glaucoma 43 and another patient homozygous for a severly truncated form of myocilin had no evidence of glaucoma 44 or other discernable phenotypes This suggests that MYOC haploinsufficiency is not causative for glaucoma and that myocilin may even be dispensable or redundant in normal human development or only important when ocular stress occurs Conclusions Rabbit MYOC encodes a protein highly similar to human MYOC Rabbit myocilin is secreted and is detected in rabbit aqueous humor Secretion of myocilin is dependent on an 18 amino acid N terminal signal peptide Unlike human and monkey AH myocilin rabbit myocilin does not undergo canonical N linked glycosylation due to the substitution of a serine in the analogous human N linked glycosylation site N57 Rabbits may provide an in vivo system for modeling some aspects of glaucoma such as steroid induced ocular hypertension 23 24 25 26 27 and the gain of function hypothesis in POAG 42 Methods Cloning of rabbit MYOC Total RNA was extracted from rabbit eye and heart
