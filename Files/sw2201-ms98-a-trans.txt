 okay lead on um drug testing doesn t bother me doesn t bother you no uh i ve been drug tested twice at TI and it doesn t bother me uh well we differ there it bothers me why why does it bother you i just feel like it s an invasion invasion of my privacy you know i you know there s a lot alcohol for example i can go out and drink on the weekends and come in hung over and do a lot worse job than if i go out on Friday and i don t know say take take a hit of Ecstasy and dance all night not saying that i do but i m just i know i understand uh i think alcohol s a a whole lot worse drug and it s more widely accepted well that s true i i agree that there should be something done about people that drink alcohol because i m sure that there s people that drink and come to work especially on a second shift or third shift so uh i agree with you there but it just uh and it and it probably is an invasion of privacy i i feel like it s okay if there s if there s cause somebody s performance is you know indicates indicates that they re they re obviously not all there they re do yeah okay you know you got reason to suspect they may be doing drugs and he says sure you know take them down there and test them but i think a lot of people are going to go out and you know substitute something else for maybe what they would have done a lot of people i don t i personally don t smoke pot but a lot of people do and they do it in their own time at their at their at their own place and they re going to find they re going to go out and drink instead because they know that it s their job on the line that s true and uh you know i ve been i ve come to work hung in the morning and i know i m worthless feel bad yeah i don t drink anymore but i can remember but i can remember the you know there s nothing worse than a hangover i have to agree there nothing worse than a i can remember staying in bed a whole day from a hangover and not going to work but i that was years ago and i didn t work for TI so but you you know really and truly there s there s nothing worse than a hangover and you re right and you cannot perform well and the same is true of the drug hangover you know if you that s true but there s i think there s a there s a big difference between use and abuse and i do do agree that drug abuse should be punished but if somebody s going to in their own home on their own time in such a way that doesn t interfere interfere with their responsibilities you know do it do some drugs then that should be their business course through this i think that they ve helped a lot of people also uh a lot of people have ended up going uh to treatment you know which is offered i think at most government places i know it is at TI do you work for TI yeah yeah i do okay well you know a lot of people have used that treatment and i center and that s probably been a good thing especially for cocaine abusers and stuff i think i think that s true and i think that the key thing is the difference between use and abuse and a lot of people don t they they don t know how to use drugs for recreational purposes without it becoming you know a dominant force in their life the drug can use you i mean yeah it s it s you know it s easy for me to say i m going to go out on Friday night and maybe you know i don t have to work till Monday and if i want to go out and and drink a little beer or do something and just dance a lot or whatever that s fine as long as i realize Saturday that in order to you know i m going to feel like crap that s just the way it is same thing if you drink but the thing is you don t get up and drink another beer to get over it yeah and and unfortunately and i think cocaine s a a good example it s it s just so much easier to just do some more do some more and then before you know it you know you re you re always doing it yeah i don t know that s true that s true yep well i mean i i work for TI so i don t do drugs you know you can t i mean it and you just run the risk of right it s too big a risk yeah of of getting caught and of course the first time you get caught it s not that big a deal you have to go to treatment and that but you re without a paycheck during that time and i don t at least that s my understanding is even you know the first time you go for counseling and it s six weeks before you re back to work oh i didn t know they took you off the job i was that i was told that uh somebody had uh some woman had had a cold or something and had some cough medicine prescribed and her husband or maybe the other way around one of them anyway had uh come down with the same thing and used some of the medicine and was tested the next day and failed and was out of a job until he went through counseling and it s like you know i can t afford that kind of loss of income you know wow who can afford that my God i can t afford to miss a day let alone six i mean i ve always been yeah the first time so what i ll go explain myself and and now i would have thought if he d have brought in the prescription wife prescription and explained the situation that they might have let him off of that that s what you would think but i kind of i that s i you know i heard it through the grapevine so i don t i don t know firsthand but that s what i heard was that it was just they didn t okay yeah you know there there were no now see that i wouldn t agree with see see i think you got to be able to bend the rules a little bit here and there too without you know if if it s a case like that because look how many people take their husband s or their wife s medication you know but that s a really good example oh yeah you know you ve got the same exact thing yeah yeah yeah and so i would think that either the doctor could get him off with that or or that they should listen i mean because i i just can t see that they would do some make somebody go to a rehab or whatever they go through because he took his wife s medicine that just doesn t sound right does it so it seems like they should be able to bend the rules oops excuse me a little bit on that but you but i don t know because i don t know anybody that s had to go through treatment or anything so i really don t know well i think i don t know anybody personally either you know i do know a lot of people that you know do use drugs recrela recreationally and there s such a big difference yeah i i don t know it s it s kind of i ve also been you know known managers at TI i know one i guess i shouldn t make that a plural but uh who drank on the job had whiskey in his desk drawer and you tell me what s worse ooh you know oh that could have been his whole career down the tubes yeah but everybody covers up you know it s the good old boy thing i don t know so does alcohol show up in these tests i don t think so they don t test for it i mean so so it wouldn t show up yeah well it s not that s true see there s the there it is right there it s not illegal it s not illegal and drugs are illegal so i guess if they made drugs legal or marijuana legal then we the we wouldn t be going through this you know they wouldn t be testing which doesn t make any sense either because they say you know it has no place on the job and you can t work safely under the influence of drugs and stuff like that well that s true and so if it was made legal that doesn t make it any safer on the job no no i agree i think i believe in test for cause if if somebody s performance and i guess that there s the other argument is that well do you wait until they screw up you know and someone gets hurt get hurt yeah yeah but at the same time you know you re telling me that on some given day i m going to walk in they re going to tell me go down and you know and go down to the health center and you know pee in a jar or whatever it is no i haven t and so have you had to do it yet oh gosh i was one of the first ones to go i think the with the January that they started it up i got called so i was one of the first ones but but you did you get tested when you got hired no see i was i ve been working for TI for almost eight years okay so you were well i i got tested before i got hired too so but hum i have to i have to honestly say that i drink more now than i did because you know it s what i can get away with and if i m going to go on the weekends spend my money and you know i if you don t drink you know you used to drink okay you go out and you want to party and that s that s something you do when you re young and dumb i guess you know i m not young anymore i m not as young as i used to be but i m still i quit i quit drinking at oh a long time ago quit drinking i didn t smoke i don t smoke i gave everything up so i guess i don t know what just old age i guess is why i no i don t smoke i quit doing that and i ve tried to quit drinking but it s the only thing left you know i quit doing drugs when TI said quit and it was no big deal you know it s like i wasn t a regular drug user but uh oh i have a lot of friends that just are uh smoke just you know occasional joint at a party or something you know and and i m even afraid to be around it i i understand because i m afraid what if it gets you know because you can inhale it if if you re if a room full of it i understand i was around somebody today outdoors and they re smoking and it s like you know i smell it and i m like well is this going into my bloodstream you know is this is there going to be enough there to get me into my bloodstream yeah and with my luck there d be the notice Monday you know go take your test and that would scare me get me in trouble so see it didn t use to bother me when i thought that you know if i come in there and they say okay you tested positive now explain yourself and i could say yeah well i was around some people that were smoking pot but i wasn t but you know it s the idea that how can you prove it you can t but at least you ve got a chance whereas if they say for six weeks you don t have a job because you tested positive that you know that s that s devastating how you know i can t live without my income for six weeks there s no way no not many people could i go paycheck to paycheck barely exactly so so i don t know well this has been interesting yeah opposing viewpoints there but huh i said opposing viewpoints sort well sort of i mean i i agree with a lot of what you said for the most part
