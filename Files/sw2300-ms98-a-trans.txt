 okay so do you all keep a budget no we don t you don t no i i make so much money here at TI that that we just spend it well and we never have a problem meeting it from paycheck to paycheck it s pretty neat being that independently wealthy and working for a major semiconductor firm you can just spend it well are you being smart or are you serious i m being facetious i m being very comical uh we have a budget um that works well i kind of look at it for more of a we have a financial uh analyst a finance administrator i guess that that uh uh huh i guess the financial planners the training now we ve had it for about four years here got our businesses and and and our life in line how to manage credit cards how to put away say for you know money markets and this kind of thing uh huh yeah and there s some freebies out there are you should put ten to fifteen percent of your monthly bring home in some sort of savings account that being money market uh bonds coda mat savings uh um hum yeah or a listed liquid account which which we do um you should always have three months of your salary in a savings account in case there s a major need for that um hum um hum okay you should always have an umbrella permit that bridges your uh life insurance and your medical and your um um car insurance in case you run into a lawyer and you break his arm he s going to sue the pants off of you these kind of things are about a hundred dollars a year so you you know these are all equivalent to the monthly budget things some of them are there to pacify situations and some of them are there to prevent things from happening um hum um hum but uh i guess we kind of got away from about the last sixteen months as far as saying two hundred dollars for food and three hundred dollars for this and two hundred for that because we had a a child which is about a year old and then uh um hum we ve just been kind of working on i ve been developing it but it s kind of hard diaper prices are going up you know and formula and stuff you know um hum that s funny yeah we have a we re twenty eight and he s been working at TI for five years and that was pretty much his first really really major job of any you know professional because he d worked you know part time during school and what not and uh he was a little late graduating so we re you know uh and we have a nine and a half year old son and it s because you know we were eighteen when we had him so we re we re kind of looking at this from the other aspect of we you know we have a lot for to be our age and you know just everything and having the responsibilities we ve had on us for at such a young age you know we have a like a nice house people you know are really shocked at how nice everything is in our house but we don t you know live in a brand new house either maybe an eighty ninety hundred thousand dollar house we live in a thirty year old house that would probably sell for forty five thousand um hum um hum so you know we have trade offs so we re more we have a monthly budget with this this this this but we have no savings which isn t real wise but we just we don t have the income at this time really to have any because we have three debts that we re trying to pay off from both of our student loans we re still paying trying to pay those off and we have one car payment that we don t i think we have about thirteen months left on it um hum and after that we either what we want to do is begin doubling up our car payment um they ll pay our car payment is equivalent to both of our student loans so what we want to do is next year keep driving the same cars and um pay on the student loans split that car payment in half and pay you know double up payments on both our loans and it ll work out perfect do you have your uh loans through the Texas Credit Union no we don t okay thing about the credit union is it s the way it s set up is if you have two thousand dollars left let s say on on the loan if you go up there and write them a two thousand dollar check it doesn t all go towards principal um hum um hum they take out for the for the finances the finance charge which is kind of you know it s like one of these lose or swim type of credit one of those loans is not really the best in the world but um um hum but you know they re they re uh since your husband is is is um a TIer but doesn t have the loans with the credit union they re offering something that might be worth taking a gander at i don t know what your percent is on your on your car payments really um hum but they are they ll take any TI non credit union loan like if you have a fourteen percent loan for a new car they ll take it um hum um hum and refinance it and put it with Texas Credit Union at i think it s a ten and a quarter percent oh really which is not a bad deal one of the secretaries we have down here is paying twelve percent through GMAC or something um hum um hum and she s doing it i mean it s not like it s like does she have to pay to have it refinanced i think they even cover that because they want you as a they want the TIer to be part of the credit union um hum TIer to see we got ripped off buying our new car we both come out of uh drugs and stuff and we became Christians about five years ago right when he got hired for TI right before he got hired for TI he had uh gotten saved and stuff and so i mean when you get come out of drugs and stuff you have nothing i mean you know you don t have anything you have the clothes on your back and you might have a car and that kind of thing and so when he when he started working at TI we uh you know we really felt like God told us to buy a new car because he had an older car that was going to need to be fixed and high gas but we got ripped off on it because we wanted it financed at four years and we were young and we d look about nineteen people still think we re about they ask us where we go to high school when we get our hair cut and stuff both of us and so it s just kind of strange you know so five years ago we probably looked like real ding dongs you know yeah so we went in and the financed the car for five and we didn t know that we got kind of taken just a little bit so we re kind of upset that we re having to you know pay this fifth year on the car because it was just not a wise thing but we learned a good lesson so well five years is not that uh you know five years is not that bad of a problem only because you re paying more interest but your um payments your payments are lower you know yeah but they they would have only been about twenty dollars a month higher oh really and he want yeah he just told me this last week that he he said don t you remember i asked them to finance it at four years and they came back and they said that they had it figured for five and we d already signed the papers and i maybe i might have been there i don t remember hearing that but i also wasn t the one in charge of it so i wasn t paying as close of attention sure but anyway instead of putting our foot down about it we just went okay whatever you know so anyway so next time we ll do that different we want to next time pay cash for our car too we want to pay cash for everything we can possibly do when we buy a house we attended a Bill Guathier financial seminar and he has a lot of wisdom on that just on Biblical you know principles to finance he runs a big the largest real estate company in Fort Worth debt free um hum and we really believe in debt free living and debt free car buying and debt free house buying and if we do take out a loan on a house in the future what we ll do is pay twice a twice a month on it and because you save a lot in interest just doing that yes and then you save a lot right if if if if and you need to be very careful if the loan is set up to have bimonthly they call it a yuppie loan if it s set up for bimonthly payments if you because you ll sa ve seventeen fifteen to seventeen years off the end of the loan seven i m sorry seven to nine years off the end of the loan right right right and there are there is a local firm that ll actually if if like in my situation i don t have that because the loan was not available um hum i can have this firm will pick up my loan for a six hundred fifty dollar fee so i can cut that much off the end of but i m not interested because we re moving out of the house next year oh really yeah but uh those are all great the the interesting thing we re getting ready to have a house built uh huh uh huh is it s not a lot of the firms that offer mortgage mortgage loan firms aren t offering um that loan um hum i mean you can ask and you can wheel and deal but it s not as open as it it should be it s a great idea hell i d love to cut ours in half but uh man yeah um hum and if you figure get with a financial person and you can figure up exactly when like the eighteenth month of a loan if you make like a four hundred dollar payment yeah over and above your house payment it ll make uh it has a magic with numbers it i it ll shave almost you know X number of dollars off um hum right yeah we real we ve become aware of that we have a there s a loan officer through our church too that i think could help us better you know he does that full time with the bank you know um hum and so we re going to use people that we re in a relationship with that we know that you know we know are people of integrity so sure you know that is another thing that you know we feel like our long term goal is going to be benefitted by next time we buy a car we re not just going to go to Toyota of Irving you know we re going to go to somebody that we know we re going to take someone with us older and we didn t do any of those things somebody you trust you know there are so many rip off artists here in this town it s it s uh it s really a sin it really is yeah i got taken on some firewood on firewood really i mean uh uh the guy shorted us a half a cord of firewood and my wife didn t know and i stopped payment on the check and he d already been paid by a cashing firm and and they re suing us they re suing me on this and it s for a hundred and thirty four dollars oh my absolutely pathetic i stopped payment on a check oh that s funny oh this last week we bought a sewing machine at Zak s and then i found that you could get the same machine better for less locally not much less but it was enough less and i found they locally serviced it and we just stopped payment on the check so i hope they don t sue us over it but we never received any merchandise either so i don t think it would hold any oh okay well something probably something like that did you call them and tell them you just you just anyway no we didn t even call them we just did it maybe my husband should call today might be a good idea because because you re going to get what a a check uh
