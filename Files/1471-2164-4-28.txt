 Background Gene expression profiles generally present signatures for cells at specific states homeostatic or stressed providing fingerprints critical in identifying regulatory pathways DNA microarray technologies are designed to reveal gene expression profiles by simultaneously detecting the expression levels on a genomic scale 1 2 They are now used to profile gene expression in a variety of model systems such as antioxidant response 3 and tumor staging 4 However the hybridization based approach suffers from limitations including low sensitivity for genes with small changes of expression level limited accuracy with potential for high experimental error 5 and necessity for a large amount of biological starting material The Amplified Differential Gene Expression ADGE technique was designed to quadratically magnify the ratios of gene expression 6 Briefly the control and tester cDNA s are digested with Taq I restriction enzyme then ligated with the CT and TT adapters respectively The adapter linked control and tester DNA are reassociated through mixing at a ratio of 1 1 denaturing and annealing The DNA reassociation results in the quadratic magnification of expression ratios for the up and down regulated genes in control and tester samples The ADGE magnification is theoretically governed by the algebra formula a b a b aa bb a b ab where aa represents the control DNA bb represents the tester DNA and a b and ab represent hybrid DNA s For example for a gene up regulated 2 fold in tester over control the formula is a 2b a 2b aa 4bb 2a b 2ab After DNA reassociation the ratio of bb aa increases from 2 to 4 If expression of another gene is down regulated 3 times in the tester the formula is 3a b 3a b 9aa bb 3a b 3ab Therefore the ratio of aa bb increases from 3 to 9 after reassociation For a gene with a ratio of 1 1 the ratio is kept unchanged after reassociation The reassociated DNA is amplified by using PCR with the CT primer complementary to the CT adapter or the TT primer complementary to the TT adapter The CT primer amplifies the control DNA aa exponentially and hybrid DNA a b and ab linearly while the TT primer amplifies the tester DNA bb exponentially and hybrid DNA linearly since hybrid DNA has two different adapters at the ends The PCR not only exponentially amplifies the control and tester DNA but also separates them from each other The expression patterns for over expressed repressed and unchanged genes were profiled with the ADGE technique 6 However the throughput of ADGE is low since it displays an average of 4 genes at a time with agarose gels Our present paper combines the ADGE technique with DNA microarray hereafter called ADGE microarray in order to integrate the high throughput of DNA microarray with the ratio magnification and the PCR amplification of ADGE The combination of ADGE and DNA microarray was used to analyze differential gene expression in a selected drug resistant cell line The prodrug TLK286 glutamyl amino 2 ethyl N N N N tetrakis 2 chloroethyl phosphorodiamidate sulfonyl propionyl R phenylglycine is activated by glutathione S transferase GST P1 1 and to a lesser degree A1 1 and generates tetrakis chloroethyl alkylating moieties that can react with cellular nucleophiles Cellular response to chronic TLK286 exposure included a two fold decrease in GSTP1 1 protein levels confirming a GSTP1 1 mediated mechanism of activation 7 Mouse embryo fibroblast cells from GSTP1 1 deficient animals elevated the expression of signal regulated kinases ERK1 ERK2 and reduced the doubling time of cell proliferation 8 That paper also found that a clone of HL60 cells resistant to TLK199 an inhibitor of GSTP1 1 has been shown to have elevated activities of c Jun NH 2 terminal kinase JNK and ERK1 ERK2 In addition GSTP1 1 acts as a negative regulator of JNK primarily through direct protein protein interactions 9 10 These data suggest that GSTP1 1 has a role in regulation of kinase activities and cell proliferation 8 11 12 13 Because of this available background information the HL60 wild type and TLK286 resistant cell lines were chosen as model systems for analysis by ADGE microarray The results show that ADGE microarray improves the sensitivity and fidelity of detection and reduces the requirement for starting material while maintaining the high throughput of regular microarray The gene expression profile for the resistant cells revealed with ADGE microarray reflected changes in the expression of GSTP1 1 and genes related to kinase and proliferation pathways Results ADGE microarray magnified ratios The ratios detected with ADGE microarray were greater than the corresponding input ratios The input ratios of 2 3 4 were detected as averages of 3 6 5 3 and 9 1 respectively after normalization with the ratio of 1 In contrast these samples were detected as 1 5 2 0 and 2 7 with regular microarray values that were less than their corresponding input ratios Fig 1 The power regression best fits the data trend of ADGE microarray with the largest R 2of 0 97 among linear logarithmic polynomial power and exponential The relationship between the detected ratio y and the input ratio x for ADGE microarray is y 1 05x 1 55 Fig 2A This relationship is close to the theoretical one of quadratic magnification y x 2 Therefore the ratios were magnified in power function within this low range However the linear regression best fits the data trend of regular microarray with the largest R 2of 0 96 The relationship for regular microarray is y 0 56x 0 39 which suggests that the ratio detected with regular microarray represents about half the input ratio within this range The magnification of power function continued until the 6 fold input ratio After that the magnitude of ADGE magnification leveled off Fig 2B The overall relationship between detected ratios and input ratios had a logarithmic trend y 15 99ln x 6 14 with R 2 0 84 ADGE microarray improved detection sensitivity The ratio magnification was also observed when the ADGE microarray method was applied to the whole microarray chip The MA plot of ADGE microarray has wider upward and downward distribution from the central area than that of regular microarray particularly for the spots with high intensity Fig 3Aand 3B 578 of 10 000 genes were detected at 2 4 fold up regulated and 460 genes at 2 4 fold down regulated with ADGE microarray Fig 3D 107 and 38 genes detected at 4 fold up and down regulated respectively In contrast with regular microarray 227 and 244 of 10 000 genes were detected at 2 4 fold up and down regulated respectively 10 and 30 genes at 4 fold up and down regulated respectively Most outliers in regular microarray were the results of spontaneous experimental error with low spot intensities When only these genes with 99 confidence level of t test are considered one and three genes were detected at 2 4 fold up and down regulated respectively with regular microarray one gene detected at 4 fold down regulated Fig 3D However with ADGE microarray there were 63 genes 4 fold up regulated 220 genes 2 4 fold up regulated 92 genes 2 4 fold down regulated and 14 genes 4 down regulated The ADGE magnification raised small changes in gene expression to a level beyond the inherent limit of DNA microarray and improved detection sensitivity ADGE microarray improved detection fidelity Multiple steps were integrated to improve the fidelity of detection in ADGE microarray The ADGE magnification increased the magnitude of the expression ratios beyond the detection error of standard microarray PCR amplification of DNA templates dramatically increased the amount of probe The CT and TT adapters at the DNA fragment ends facilitated efficient labeling of Cy3 and Cy5 thus enhancing signal intensity Variances of Cy3 and Cy5 intensities were less in ADGE microarray than in regular microarray Fig 4Aand 4B 6888 and 6663 of 10 000 genes in ADGE microarray had variances of 0 5 in Cy3 and Cy5 channels respectively while in regular microarray there are only 717 and 741 such genes suggesting that the results among replicates were more consistent with less variation in ADGE microarray The confidence levels of t tests reflect the magnitude of consistent differences between HL60 and HL60 TLK286 among replicates 836 of 10 000 genes were identified at 99 confidence level 2013 genes at 95 98 753 genes at 90 94 with ADGE microarray In contrast for regular microarray 85 genes were detected at 99 367 genes at 95 98 and 409 genes at 90 94 Fig 4C Among the genes with 99 confidence levels and 4 fold changes five genes were found duplicated on the chip The results of the duplicated spots were similar Table 1 For example bmi 1 was detected at 7 96 and 7 29 in both spots ADGE microarray revealed genes associated with drug resistance ADGE microarray was used to compare expression patterns for the TLK286 resistant cell line and its wild type counterpart by screening the expression pattern of 20 000 genes Ninety three genes were selected with the threshold average ratio 4 0 and confidence level 99 Among the 93 genes 12 had functions related to cell proliferation and kinase pathways Table 2 In addition expression of GSTP1 1 was reduced in the HL60 TLK286 cell line which was consistent with a previous study 7 Quantitative RT PCR confirmed the results of ADGE microarray for eleven of thirteen genes The other two genes were detected unchanged with RT PCR The gene expression profile revealed with ADGE microarray supported the principle of GSTP1 1 mediated regulation of cell proliferation and kinase pathways Discussion The ADGE technique is a method designed to magnify the ratios of gene expression before detection The ratio magnification was reported with a gel system 6 and was observed in this study with DNA microarray Fig 1and 2 The magnification of a power function was found up to a 6 fold input ratio or 30 fold detected ratio The magnitude of magnification leveled off after that Since different dilutions different cycles of PCR and dye reverse were used ADGE magnification can be applied for up and down regulated genes with different abundance One reason for the level off might be the capacity of DNA microarray to detect large ratios For instance the maximum value of spot intensity is 65 000 in an Affymetrix scanner If an abundant gene has an intensity of 1000 in another scanning channel the largest detectable ratio will be 65 Another explanation might be the saturation of PCR for abundant genes The regression equations of the detected values with input values not only demonstrate the magnitude of magnification with ADGE technology but also provide a guideline to interpret the results of ADGE microarray The quantitative relationship between input values x and detected values y was y 0 56x 0 39 for regular microarray Thus regular microarray may under estimate differences of gene expression between two samples ADGE methodology not only magnifies the differential expression ratios but also amplifies the amount of templates with PCR Exponential amplification by PCR dramatically increases the amount of probes and reduces the requirement for starting material Based on the current working protocol 10 g of total RNA from control and tester samples was used to generate 160 l of reassociated DNA 2 l of the reassociated DNA was needed to make probe for one slide hybridization Thus 125 ng of total RNA can be used for one slide hybridization Therefore ADGE microarray could provide a platform for using 160 200 fold less total RNA than regular microarray which generally requires 20 g of total RNA It is also comparable to other RNA amplification methods such as antisense RNA amplification where 0 25 3 0 g of total RNA is required 14 and Amine modified random primer where 1 0 g of total RNA is required 15 20 30 PCR cycles are recommended since too few cycles will reduce the difference between the exponentially amplified tester or control DNA and the linearly amplified hybrid DNA and too many cycles will saturate abundant genes The adapters at the DNA fragment ends facilitate efficient incorporation of Cy3 and Cy5 into DNA templates and enhance signal intensity Both methods of direct and indirect labeling were used in this study With direct labeling Cy3 dCTP is incorporated into control and Cy5 dCTP into tester DNA during the PCR amplification of the hybridized DNA templates The use of Cy dyes can be reversed if required With indirect labeling aminoallyl dUTP is incorporated into control and tester DNA with PCR of 3 cycles after the reassociated DNA templates are amplified The aminoallyl dUTP labeled DNA templates are in turn coupled with Cy dyes The use of aminoallyl dUTP in PCR amplification of the hybridized DNA template is not recommended It is also possible to adapt other methods of signal enhancement to the labeling procedure For example the 3DNA fluorescent dendrimer probes Genisphere Montvale NJ can be attached on the CT and TT primers which then are used to amplify the control and tester DNA s Since both strands of the probe DNA are labeled with direct labeling or indirect labeling the specific intensity is enhanced The ratio of signal to background was improved in ADGE microarray For example on slides of 10 000 genes 1301 genes were detected at ratios 18 and 7988 genes at ratios 9 with ADGE microarray In contrast 578 genes were detected at ratios 18 and 8678 genes at ratios 9 with regular microarray The reason that overall spot intensities in Fig 3Aare lower than in Fig 3Bis that smaller gain values were used for ADGE microarray when scanning microarray chips The integration of these features in ADGE microarray improves detection sensitivity and fidelity ADGE magnification raised small changes in gene expression to a level beyond the inherent limit of DNA microarray Thus genes with small expression changes could be identified more accurately and false negatives could be minimized with ADGE microarray 77 genes with 99 confidence level and 4 fold changes were identified with ADGE microarray compared to only one such gene with regular microarray Fig 3D Therefore a more informative gene profile was revealed with ADGE microarray than with regular microarray The probability that the ADGE magnification introduces false positives is low The HL60 vs HL60 self hybridization showed that the relationship of Cy3 y and Cy5 x is y 1 02x 0 21 with R 2 0 92 none of the 10 000 genes was detected at 4 fold change with confidence level 99 Fig 3C Eleven of thirteen genes have consistent results between ADGE microarray and quantitative RT PCR The other two genes were detected unchanged with RT PCR Table 2 Experimental artifacts in microarray data are intensity dependent and tend to occur primarily for weak spots 16 The nucleporin 88 kD AA488609 with the largest standard deviation in the Table 2had weak signal Exponential amplification of DNA templates and double strand labeling in ADGE microarray dramatically enhances the signal intensity of spots Combined with magnified ratios the enhanced signal intensities improve the data quality and detection fidelity in ADGE microarray More genes have low variances in both Cy3 and Cy5 channels and high confidence levels in ADGE microarray than in regular microarray Fig 4 The similarity and reproducibility of results between duplicate spots also suggests the improvement of detection fidelity Table 1 The sensitive and accurate method of ADGE microarray provides a novel tool to reveal informative gene profiles 12 of the 93 differential genes were clustered in cell proliferation and kinase pathways Expression changes of genes related to regulation of cell proliferation may be directly pertinent to the resistant phenotype or may be a consequence of cell growth under drug stressed conditions Adaptive changes in kinase expression have been characterized in a variety of drug resistant cells For example the stress kinase JNK1 was activated during TLK286 induced apoptosis 17 and JNK is known to be activated during apoptosis induced by a variety of stress stimuli 18 However in HL60 TLK286 resistant cells we observed an overexpression of two phosphatases PP2 AA599092 and MKP5 AA056608 involved in JNK dephosphorylation and inactivation Table 2 PP2 is a serine threonine phosphatase which dephosphorylates JNK during inflammatory cell signaling 19 while MKP5 is a member of the dual specificity phosphatase family which selectively dephosphorylates stress activated MAP kinases including JNK 20 The overexpression of these two phosphatases might contribute in part to the resistance of HL60 TLK286 by impairing the activity of JNK Kinase pathways particularly those involving ERK and JNK are suggested to have prominent roles in regulation of proliferation pathways in a variety of cell lines 11 12 13 Reduced expression of GSTP1 1 in the resistant cells provides a plausible link with the JNK and ERK regulation pathways in the resistant cells Although the interaction among GSTP1 1 and genes of proliferation and kinase pathways needs to be verified and the roles of other differential genes in the TLK286 resistant cell line need further investigation the expression pattern generated with ADGE microarray provides a blueprint for designing further experiments Conclusions ADGE microarray is the combination of ADGE technique and DNA microarray It magnified the ratios of differential gene expression in power function improved detection sensitivity and fidelity and reduced the requirement for starting material while maintaining high throughput ADGE microarray generated a more informative expression pattern than regular microarray Methods Cell lines The HL60 TLK286 cell line is resistant to the prodrug TLK286 and derived from the wild type HL60 by stepwise selection Both HL60 TLK286 and HL60 cell lines were cultured

ratio magnification for ADGE and to build a relationship between input and detected ratios a contiguous area of twelve spots 3 4 on the microarray chip was selected The corresponding clones were amplified by using PCR with the primers having a Taq I site at the end The PCR products were then purified and cut with Taq I at 65 C for 2 hr The same amount of Taq I fragments for each clone was ligated to the CT and TT adapters at 16 C overnight The CT and TT adapter linked DNA fragments were mixed in ratios of 1 1 for the three clones of the first column 1 2 and 1 6 for the clones of the second column 1 3 and 1 10 for the clones of the third column 1 4 and 1 20 for the clones of the fourth column see clone arrangement in Fig 1 Reverse ratios were also made for all except 1 1 A fraction of each mixture was reassociated by denaturing at 95 C for 5 min and annealing at 68 C for 20 hr Due to high concentration of templates and possibility of effects of template abundance the
