El Abuelo GrandfatherAn oldman figure called el abuelo the grandfather played the role of a bogeyman in Hispano folklore In literature it is sometimes spelled aguelo and some scholars speculate that it may be a borrowed word from the language of the Pueblo Indians In Spanish it means grandfather and has become synonymous with coco cucui and bogeyman This folk character is more known in northern New Mexico than in other parts of the Southwest He appeared at Christmastime to test and discipline children who did not know their catechism or prayers He was a scary figure dressed to terrify children with a black cape and a mask with large horns and always carrying a whip Children were terribly frightened because of his horrid appearance Instead of a mask he sometimes had a tortilla plastered on his face wore buffalo horns and a horsetail and of course carried the whip A few days before Christmas hed knock on the door of a home give a bloodcurdling cry crack his whip and yell at the children Han sido buenos muchachos estos Have these children been good The children would cringe and hide while the parents defended them Then el abuelo would say Pues que recn y se acuestn Well let them pray and go to bed Sometimes he made the children dance Las Palomitas loosely translated as the little doves Espinosa describes this experience After making them pray he makes them form a circle and taking each others hands they dance around the room with him singingBaila paloma de Juan turuntn or durundn sicTurun tn tnTurun tun tnDance dove of Juan confused or disorientedConfused

llamo el abuelo If you dont behave Ill call the bogeymanEl abuelo is also a prominent figure in the dance of Los Matachines and plays a comical role in which he makes jokes and shouts out instructions to the rest of the dancers In some performances there is a female character la abuela who acts as el abuelos accomplice and plays a similar role Although he is not heard of often in contemporary times references to el abuelo can be found in the folktales and literature of New MexicoSee also El Coco El Cucui El Kookoee Los MatachinesReferences Brown  Cobos  Espinosa  Steele La Adelita Mexican Revolution Woman SoldierA feminist symbol of the Mexican Revolution La Adelita was the name of a woman soldier a soldadera who followed the troops helped to set up camp and cooked for the soldiers Some soldaderas were employed to cook and fulfil the needs of a particular soldier whereas others were relatives or lovers The legend states that Adelita was a woman who fought in the Revolution but it is not known if she actually existed as an individual she came to epitomize all soldaderas and courageous women of that period In popular culture literature and the cinema soldaderas have been portrayed as selfsacrificing women usually mestizas mixedrace women from the lower classes but La Adelita is often seen as a gera lightskinned sweetheart of the troops a woman who is valiant pretty and a wonderful helpmate to the soldier Salas  Several corridos ballads have been written about her and she is a powerful symbol for Mexican and Chicana women representing bravery selfdiscipline and romantic love In fact it is primarily through the corridos that Adelita is known today Historically all soldaderas became known as Adelitas In performances by ballet folklrico groups the dances and music of the Revolution are often called Las AdelitasLa Adelita is more than a romantic image to modernday Chicanas She continues to symbolize feminine independence integrity the fight for justice and a proud heritage Because the major influx of Mexican immigration into the United States was during the Mexican Revolution many Chicanos and Chicanas grew up hearing stories about soldaderas and La Adelita from relatives parents and grandparents In the late s Chicanas who joined the Brown Berets de Aztln a political pseudomilitary youth group often dressed as Adelitas wearing rebozos shawls and bandoliers crisscrossed over their chestsOne play about La Adelita titled Soldadera written by Josephine Niggli was produced and performed in the United States in  and is still performed today Niggli was  years old when the play was written She went on to write Mexican Village a novel that incorporated many of the Mexican peoples folk customs and traditions Born in Monterrey Mexico she lived in Mexico City and was taught at home by her mother Later she moved to San Antonio Texas where she attended high school She went to the University of North Carolina for playwriting sometimes acting in her own plays Soldadera is a play about the women in the Revolution women who left homes to follow their men cooking for them tending their wounds guarding their ammunition fighting when necessary as Niggli put it The Adelita character dies in the play and Niggli idealizes her braveryOne variant of the corrido La Adelita followsEn lo alto de una abrupta cerraniaacampado se encontraba un regimientoy una moza que valiente lo seguialocamente enamorada del sargentoPopular entre la tropa era Adelitala mujer que el sargento idolatrabaporque a mas de ser valiente era bonitay hasta el mismo coronel la respetabaY se oa que deca aquel que tanto la queraY si Adelita fuera mi noviay si Adelita fuera mi mujerle comprara un vestido de sedapara llevarla a bailar al cuartelY si Adelita se fuera

she crazily lovesPopular among the troops was AdelitaThe woman that the sergeant idolizedBecause besides being brave she was prettyAnd even the colonel respected herAnd one could hear him that loved

in war ship andIf by land on a military trainReferences Arrizn  HerreraSobek  Niggli  Salas Adivinanzas RiddlesAdivinanzas are riddles Many Chicano children remember being entertained with riddles narrated by parents and grandparents A riddle is an intellectual brainteaser in Spanish called a quebracabeza facts are framed in the form of a question in such a way that the respondent cannot possibly know the answer An example in Spanish is Qu camina de cuatro patas por la maana dos patas en el medio da y tres patas en la noche What walks on four legs in the morning two legs in the afternoon and three legs at night The answer is man who as a child in the morning of life crawls on four legs as an adult walks on two legs and as an old man uses a cane for support thus walking on three legs Another example is a true riddle which is a comparison of something to the unknown answer and that something is described in the question For example Tengo ojos y no miro boca pero no hablo qu soy I have eyes and cannot see a mouth but cannot speak What am I The answer is a photograph Another type of riddle is the conundrum where the answer is contained in the riddle itself such as Agua pasa por mi casa cate de mi corazon Water passes by my house pain of my heart The answer is aguacate avocado Or Lana sube lana baja Wool goes up and wool goes down The answer is la navaja lanabaja the knife Conundrums contain wordplay and in Chicano culture are sometimes bilingual playing with words in both the Spanish and the English language Another type of riddle is the riddling question such as Qu le dijo la luna al sol What did the moon say to the sun The answer is Eres tan grande y no te dejan salir de noche You are so big and yet are not allowed to go out at nightMany Spanish riddles collected in the Southwest reflect in some way the characteristics of the Southwest both linguistically and environmentally Since the problem presented in a riddle is linguistically and culturally based on both the tellers and the audiences culture they must all be members of the same community or group to comprehend the puzzle Bilingual riddles those narrated in both English and Spanish are clearly a Chicano invention growing out of the bicultural experience Riddles are fun and educational as well It is usually children who enjoy telling and listening to riddles Like other folklore genres riddles serve a function helping children learn to interpret facts and form an opinion They use language humor and a verbal fun activity to challenge a childs intellectReferences Brown  Campa

sometimes just called mudstraw and are slowly dried by the heat of the sun Various structures homes buildings and churches are built of adobe bricks and then plastered with more adobe mud Buildings made of adobe have lasted for centuries when sufficient and constant care is provided to prevent erosion of the mud Contemporary adobe architecture as found in what is called the Southwest style is a fusion of native New Mexican Indian and Spanish forms The basic structure adobe walls supporting a flat roof is an Indian tradition thousands of years old When the Spanish moved into New Mexico and the Southwest they adopted this basic structure but incorporated their technique of forming the mud into bricks Most of the Catholic missions were built out of adobe Adobe homes and buildings provide a sense of security and protection from outside noise with their twotofourfoot thick walls Often the literature about adobe also mentions the sense of continuity with the earth one feels when living in an adobe homeMaking adobe bricks and adobe hornos outdoor ovens is still a tradition in New Mexico Native American and Hispanic women have a long tradition in the construction of adobe structures The Spaniards noted that it was the Pueblo women who built the adobe walls Within the Hispanic community it has been the role of women known as enjarradoras to plaster the walls of the structures a task that is done with the bare hands A saying in Spanish describes this as El hombre las levanta la mujer las enjarra The man builds the walls and woman plasters them Romero and Larkin   In contemporary times the Museum of International Folk Art in Santa Fe sponsors demonstrations of adobe brick making and horno construction performed by women who are wellknown master adoberas makers of adobe and master enjaradorasIn southern Texas and northern Mexico small huts called jacales were also constructed of mudstraw Even though this mud was of almost the same composition it was not called adobe The mud was not formed into bricks and the structures were considered temporary even though many have existed for decadesReferences Boyd  Brown  Bunting   De Leon  Graham  Romero and Larkin

during the seventeenth century Legends of the appearance of the Blue Lady circulated in New Mexico and Texas during the mids There are stories that narrate how she especially liked to help women in need and poor children although it appears her goal was also to Christianize the Indians of the Southwest whom she visited often She was able to speak various Indian languages and would speak to the members of each tribe in their own tongue Fray Damian Manzanet while visiting Texas in  reported that the chief of the Tejas Indians spoke of being visited by a beautiful woman dressed in blue garments The chief was requesting blue fabric that his people wanted to use in the burying of their dead There is much written evidence of her appearances in Texas where she was referred to as The Mysterious Woman in Blue The Jumano Indians of Texas were reportedly visited by her approximately  times between  and The first reference to her is in the memoirs of Fray Alonso de Benavides in  Every report we have of her appearances indicates that the Blue Lady was actually Mara de Jesus Coronel de Agreda She was born in Spain in  and died May   She never physically visited the Southwest but she stated that she made flights to New Mexico to help the Indians Mara de Agredo lived in a convent and wrote several books including one with the title The Mystic City of GodAdina de Zavala cites a San Antonio legend about a mystifying woman in blue who appears once in a generation out of the hidden underground passages of the Alamo bearing a distinctive gift that she bestows on a woman The woman is always a native Texan she may be young old or middleaged but she is always a special woman pure and good well bred intelligent spiritual and patriotic The gift that is bestowed on her is the ability to see to the heart of things and the woman is instructed to use the gift for the good of the people of San Antonio and of TexasReferences Bullock  Castaeda  Colahan  DeBaca  Dobie  Hallenbeck and

word used interchangeably is agavachado meaning too much like a gavacho an Anglo In a bicultural environment or even in tightly knit Mexican communities when individuals become thoroughly acculturated to American society and values the individual may be criticized by close friends and relatives and be called an agringado Agringado is a particularly strong term in comparison to americanizado because the word gringo connotes a strong negative image of a North American All Chicanos are americanizados to a certain extent by learning English and attending public schools But the behavior of an agringado might involve the changing of ones given name so that Carlos becomes Charlie Guillermo becomes Will or Consuelo becomes Connie or changing a surname so that Rivera becomes Rivers or Puentes becomes Bridges In the verbal folklore repertoire of Chicanos jokes abound about Mexicans who become Anglos and adopt the values mannerisms food clothing styles and verbal expressions of the dominant society Besides becoming gringolike a Chicano agringado may overtly reject Mexican American culture the music the values and even the Spanish language by pretending not to speak it Such a person sees the Mexican way of life as inferior to the Anglo and the agringado may marry an Anglo and completely turn hisher back on Chicano culture An agringado will not selfidentify because this kind of behavior is perceived as negative or disloyal to hisher cultural group Rather identifying or pointing out agringado behavior tends to be done by family or peer group members who use teasing joking and narrating exemplary anecdotes characteristic of folkloric behavior This type of behavior is an outcome of living in a bicultural and bilingual environment and serves to strengthen the ingroups sense of cultural identityThe agringado figure has become a stock character in Chicano culture and is frequently encountered in folklore literature and popular culture The film Mi Familia directed and released in  by Gregory Nava includes a comical scene depicting the agringado son a UCLA student bringing his Anglo girlfriend home to meet his Mexican familyReferences Limn a Madsen  Pea bAguinaldos

children These can be small bags or baskets filled with candy nuts fruits or toys It is a gift given as a sharing a memento a remembrance rather than as a Christmas present Mention of the custom of aguinaldos is found in Cabeza de Bacas book The Good Life Amrico Paredes describes a slightly different tradition of aguinaldos that he learned in song form from his mother in South Texas During the days between Christmas and Da de los Reyes the Day of the Kings or Epiphany January  young boys went from house to house singing carols called aguinaldos and asking for food and gifts Homes were opened to them and they were offered good things to eat and drink In this context aguinaldos are Christmas songsThis expression has also been used when describing a childrens custom in the Southwest On Christmas Day children went knocking on doors and visiting homes asking for and receiving candy or small toys Sometimes they would sing a song that sounded more like a prayer or a chant called

alabados start with the words alabado sea praised be Alabados are usually sung with religious fervor and many are extremely long with an indefinite number of verses The Penitentes of New Mexico were known to sing alabados during Lenten rituals Holy Week processions and other religious ceremonies The songs are mystic in nature many narrate the story of Christs life his anguish betrayal his crucifixion and resurrection and others praise the virtues of suffering and penance Alabados were sung as ritual prayers in homes at dawn noon and at nightfall and they were almost always sung at funeral processions Their melodies are fusions of indigenous music and medieval chants Stories of Mexican California narrate the singing of alabados first thing in the morning by a family each member in hisher own room but all together at the same time Like the dcima tenline poetic song and the romance fourline song alabados were introduced into the New World by the Franciscan padres who taught them to the Indian people as they were teaching them the Bible and converting them to Christianity In recent times alabados have come to mean any religious hymn sung at wakes or religious ceremonies Many are very old and the authors unknown although a few collected in southern Colorado were written by a local singer in the s Folklorists of the s and s were still able to collect some of these ancient hymns from elderly people who learned them from their parents in the nineteenth century Juan Rael published one of the first essays on the alabado in  and a recent researcher William Gonzalez

the fence is the wire fence along the MexicanUS border the term is interchangeable with mojado wetback which refers to a person who enters the United States illegally by crossing the Rio Grande in Texas Alambrista is not as common an expression as wetback but it is used frequently by the media The Mexican cinema has produced many films about illegal entry into the United States with many characters playing roles as alambristas An American film with the title Alambrista The Illegal written and directed by Robert Young in  deals with the issue of undocumented immigration by portraying the experiences of one mans journey into the United States and back to Mexico It is considered a landmark film because of the authentic portrayal of a life of fear and alienation experienced by the main characterLike the term wetback this is an expression many Chicanos can identify with since many have family members who have entered the United States through nonlegal means It is part of the folklore repertoire of Chicano culture since the MexicanUS border is politically and culturally a constant element in everyday lifeReferences Barrera  MadridBarela All Souls Day See Da de los MuertosAltarsAn altar is a religious shrine depending on its size sometimes called an altarcito a little altar established in the home for the personal worship by the family Home altars are common in many Mexican and Chicano homes The word altar is derived from the Latin word altare a combination of altus high and ara altar referring to a raised structure for worship one that goes upward toward the sky or heaven It provides a space where religious people can communicate with God the saints or other spiritual beings Home altars vary in size from a small shelf with one votive candle and one saint or statue to a large table altar with many religious images La Virgen de Guadalupe flowers pictures of saints candles a structure that can fill up half a room Permanent altars can be in a small nicho niche in the bedroom the living room or even the dining room Daily devout prayer such as reciting the rosary or praying to a patron or favorite saint is a normal occurrence in many families with the prayers often led by the mother or grandmother A personal home altar may evolve over a period of years rather than being constructed suddenly in one day When the creation is such a gradual process it can reflect and almost chronicle the happy and tragic events that take place in the family As family members are born or die their picture or a favorite personal item of theirs may be placed on the altar along with their patron saint a votive candle or flowers Eventually the altar can become so much a meaningful representation of the family that it will be maintained for years and even generationsThe religious observation of All Souls Day or Da de los Muertos on November  is an occasion for many families to erect altars specifically for a parent or other family member who has recently died These altars will traditionally have a picture or pictures of the departed with offerings and gifts Family and friends are invited to visit and add items to the altar which becomes almost a shrine and is called an ofrenda In many US cities Da de los Muertos ritual celebrations have become community affairs that include more than the Chicano community and may entail a procession through the streets ending at a local school or community center In the last thirty or so years the creation and construction of altars have become major art programs for museums schools and community centers in the United States The altars are wonderful artistic creations a form of folk art with local artists participating and involving children in the making of calaveras skeletons papel picado cut tissue paper paper flowers and other decorationsIn Chicano and Mexican culture it is usually women who develop home altars as expressions of devotion to pay homage to past family members and to find a space for daily prayer It is thought that home altars were created as a result of community isolation from a centralized place of worship After Mexico gained its independence from Spain the Spanish friars left Mexico and the Southwest and for many years there werent enough priests to visit all of Mexicos small villages and rural areas Isolated communities and individual families created their own places of worship The wealthy or upper classes were able to build small chapels on their ranches while the poorer classes built small nichos and altars in their homes in kitchens or other

northern Mexico in customs language and folklore After the USMexican War of  and the signing of the Gadsden Treaty in  Arizona experienced the same cultural changes as Texas New Mexico and California although more gradually since the region was not immediately overwhelmed by an Anglo American invasion as the other areas were Arizonas oldest and most important Mexican community has been Tucson founded by Spanish settlers in  Tucson was the frontier fortification of the Mexican state of Sonora until the Gadsden Purchase transferred it to the United States It functioned as a cavalry outpost established in response to the many Indian raids of the times Mexicans were a majority through most of the nineteenth century and Tucson had a bicultural spirit that was unique in the Southwest A Mexican middle class ran some of the largest businesses held political offices became artists or intellectuals funded private and public education and created a prosperous Mexican society envied by other communities of the Southwest with elegant theaters like the Teatro Carmen and Spanishlanguage newspapers Tucsons proximity to Mexico especially Sonora permitted Tucsonenses to remain close to their Mexican heritage According to Thomas Sheridan This Mexican elite represented a local florescence of Latin American civilization in Arizona its society and culture linking Tucson with the finest traditions of both Mexico and Spain  Although there was a strong Mexican middle class many Chicanos were working class such as butchers barbers and later railroad workers The railroad arrived in southern Arizona on March   and this changed society in Tucson foreverThere has always been a substantial Chicano and Mexican population in Tucson The folklore of the region was recognized to be important and Margarite Collier an elementary school teacher organized a Mexican Folklore Club at Carrillo School in Tucson in  An article in the Arizona Daily Star of December   states that the club was to help the children sustain pride and interest in the traditions customs and folklore of Mexico and to perpetuate these customs among Spanishspeaking people of Tucson Miss Collier taught the children music art and folk dances of Mexico Every year the school organized a Las Posadas procession through the streets of Tucson The same article in the Arizona Daily Star describes this celebration with the subtitle of the article stating Ancient Mexican Custom to be Encouraged in Ceremonial Here The children of Carrillo School carried out this tradition until the late s and the Mexican Folklore Club continued until well after Miss Collier retired from teaching Miss Collier worked at collecting songs games and other folklore from the children of the school The Margarite

Aztecas came known as the place of emergence in some codices identified as the sevencave place The Mexica Aztecs traveled south under the guidance of the god Huitzilopochtli who advised them to look for an eagle perched on a prickly pear cactus devouring a serpent This would be their new home they were told which they were to call TenochtitlnIn the late s Chicanos starting calling the southwestern United States or that portion of Mexico lost to the United States during the USMexican War of  Aztln in reference to the legend of the wandering Mexica The concept of a homeland for Chicanos called Aztln was presented at the First National Chicano Youth Liberation Conference held in Denver Colorado in  It was articulated in the manifesto El Plan Espiritual de Aztln a document that outlined an ideology meant to unite all Chicanos of the Southwest The document is accredited to Alurista a poet who was already presenting Aztln in a Chicano studies class he taught in  at San Diego State University The manifesto stressed the concept of ethnic nationalism and selfdetermination and of the need for Chicanos to control their own communities schools and political structures The document proclaims We are a Bronze People with a Bronze Culture Before the world before all of North America before all our brothers in the bronze continent we are a nation we are a union of free pueblos we are Aztln Por La Raza todo Fuera de La Raza nada El Plan Espiritual de Aztln was published in the journal El Grito del Norte Volume   In  a journal was started at the University of California Los Angeles titled Aztln Chicano Journal of the Social Sciences and the Arts which is still published todayThe eminent professor Luis Leal states that Aztln has two meanings for Chicanos the geographic region of the southwestern United States and the spiritual union of the Chicanos something that is carried within the heart no matter where they may live or where they may find themselves Leal  Aztln takes a prominent place in murals folk art and folklore and it continues to appear in Chicano literature today as it has for over thirty years in poetry short stories novels and essay anthologies The title of one of Rudolfo Anayas novels is Heart of Aztln published in  Miguel Mendez wrote Pilgrims in Aztln first in Spanish in  later translated to English in  and Alurista has a poetry collection titled Floricanto en Aztln published in Aztln is the Chicano homeland especially for those coming of age during the s and s who wanted to create a cultural space that they could call their own For Chicanos born in the United States Mexico is not home but neither is the United States so Aztln is looked upon as the mythical homeland The affiliation with Aztln also reaffirms the Chicanos identity as mestizos people of mixed ancestry as members of the indigenous population of the New World Chicano writers explore the various meanings of Aztln in an anthology edited by Rudolfo
