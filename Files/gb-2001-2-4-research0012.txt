                    Background        Standard graphical representations of complex systems        have been developed for many disciplines in order to        communicate archive and analyze systems knowledge        Electronic circuit diagrams and architectural plans for        instance can be created read and analyzed by        knowledgeable persons yet there is no such common        graphical language for describing functional systems in        biology A variety of representations are used in print or        online to archive knowledge in particular domains such as        metabolic pathways    gene networks   signaling        networks    and molecular interactions    yet        are not sufficiently standardized to represent        crossdisciplinary systems  the interactions of gene        expression and metabolism at the inter and intramolecular        levels for instance To describe such multidisciplinary        biological problems at multiple levels of abstraction for        example from intramolecular to disease phenotype        biologists customarily resort to informal cartoon diagrams        which although expressive are often ambiguous and must be        annotated to be interpreted properly        Here we suggest that a standardized visual biological        description language would provide more readable and less        ambiguous communication and with computational        implementation provide a basis for distributed searchable        archives of functional as opposed to structural        knowledge and serve as a computeraided design CAD        language for simulating and analyzing biological systems        To explore these possibilities we are developing a        prototype biological description language BioD as a        platform to test its conceptual basis explore its utility        and identify key issues surrounding its implementation                    Results and discussion                  Functional properties a basis for a biological          description language          If the goal were simply to standardize the graphics of          cartoon diagrams one could collect and standardize sets          of icons and arrows for use as clip art in          generalpurpose graphics software or as templates in          diagramming software such as Visio Microsoft for          Windows or TopDown Kaetron Software for MacOS and          Windows To build a sophisticated software editor for a          visual language and especially to design the language          to support computer archiving and analysis one must          however establish deeper foundations for creating          organizing and using graphic elements          As a starting point consider the common metaphor of          biological systems as circuits Indeed viewing          metabolic pathways as electrical circuits is particularly          apt as in each case a limited set of entity classes          metabolites versus resistors capacitors and inductors          are represented by icons that are linked by lines or          arrows representing interactions between iconified          entities The benefit of such pathway and circuit          diagrams is of course that they help us infer and track          how a change in a state property for example          metabolite concentration versus electrical voltage of          one icon acts via an action property metabolic flux          rate versus electrical current on the state properties          of linked icons The problem for biologists is that          metabolite concentrations and flux rates while          absolutely fundamental to many biological systems are          not the only functional properties that need to be          considered          Just as architectural plans must display and          distinguish several interacting circuit systems with          different properties such as power water drainage          ventilation telephone security and digital cable          diagrams of multidisciplinary biological systems must          distinguish multiple functions metabolic pathways          enzyme kinetics ion fluxes fluid flow characterized by          different properties concentration catalytic activity          voltage pressure respectively Thus the key challenge          for describing archiving and analyzing complex          biological systems is not simply to collect expressive          icons and arrows but to establish a system of expressive          icons and arrows that consistently and unambiguously          represents the functional entities and their specific          functional properties Does an arrow increase or          decrease the concentration or the catalytic activity of          an enzyme icon Can we consistently represent the          separate effects of transmembrane ion flow on both ion          concentration and transmembrane voltage          Whereas state and action properties are generally          implicit in most diagrams computer implementation of a          visual language requires that language elements be          formalized as computational objects in order to edit          archive and analyze models To this end we began          designing BioD by creating buildingblock icons Figure           that represent primitive functional entities such as          atoms molecules compartments and so on where each icon          is understood implicitly as in metabolic pathway and          electrical circuit diagrams but specifically to          possess one or more state properties For instance          atom and molecule icons each have a concentration          property A compartment icon has volume and surface          area properties A membranebound compartment icon          derived from a simple compartment is used to represent          cells and organelles and inherits the compartments          volume and area properties while including a          transmembrane voltage property In this manner an          extensible hierarchical lexicon of buildingblock icons          can be built by deriving new icons from existing icons          Furthermore additional state properties such as          temperature ionic charge isotopy pressure can be          created and appended to new or existing icons as needed          to create new functional entities an ion icon is an          atom icon with an ionic charge property for          instance          In addition to creating new icons by derivation          compound icons representing complex structures can be          built by aggregating icons according to commonsense          structural rules for example a molecular site but          not a cell can be part of a molecule In the examples          below a simple model of the cellcycle kinase Cdk          begins as a molecule icon to which is appended a kinase          site a square with a K a phosphorylation site a          circle with a P and a binding site a small circle          with a dot Figure a As another example the          membranebound compartment representing a cell could          contain other compartments representing internal          organelles or even compartments defined solely by          diffusionlimitations for example a submembrane          compartment          Functional interactions between buildingblock icons          whether aggregated as compound icons or not are          represented by action arrows Figure  upper right          panel that are designed to minimize the functional          ambiguity of informal cartoon diagrams It is required          for instance that arrows consistently distinguish which          if there is more than one of an icons functional          properties are affected either by context as in          cartoons or by appearance for example doubleweight          arrows change concentration properties by chemical          reactions or transport whereas singleweight arrows          activate or inhibit activity properties and how the          property is affected for example filled heads mean          increase open heads mean decrease As for the          lexicon of icons the lexicon of action arrows in Figure          could be extended to include other forms to represent          say thermal fluxes which change temperature properties          and fluid flows which change compartmental volume and          pressure properties          In the Cdk kinase model of Figure we use          singleweight arrows to represent how the activity of the          kinase site is inhibited by occupancy of the p binding          site and is activated by occupancy of the phosphorylation          site A doubleweight solidheaded phosphorylate arrow          represents the transfer of phosphate groups by the kinase          site of Cdk to increase occupancy of the retinoblastoma          protein RB phosphorylation site A phosphatase          molecular site a square with openstyle P represents          how an unspecified phosphatase activity reduces the          occupancy of the RB phosphorylation site A dashed          doubleweight occupy arrow represents the binding to          and increased occupancy of p to its binding site on          Cdk In this manner the diagram can represent both          intra and intermolecular sitesite interactions while          distinguishing activationinhibition as by          conformational changes from chemical reactions between          species          Consistent coding of qualitative effects as increase          or decrease arrows allows qualitative what if          experiments where an initiating event  an increase or          decrease of a functional property of one icon say  can          be tracked through a model or a network of models see          below as a chain of events Such events chains can be          displayed in event diagrams to represent some events          but not necessarily all events as chains of event          icons each representing a change of a specific          functional property linked by cause arrows For          instance the event diagram in Figure bdisplays the          consequences as events icons of increasing the          concentration of p in the model in Figure a In          complex systems such consistent qualitative          representations can reveal previously unappreciated          causal links  redundant parallel pathways or feedback          loops  in models built solely from pairwise interactions          of many functional parts          As we will discuss below formalizing a functional          descriptive language for biology can offer additional          benefits for exploring and understanding the function of          complex biological systems if the functional structures          and processes can be adequately and unambiguously          described                          Extending BioD to other domains          A major criterion for the utility of any technical          language is whether it can fully express concepts within          a domain of knowledge that is is the language          complete For a domain such as biology which is almost          limitless in terms of physical not to mention psychic          social and evolutionary phenomena it is unlikely that          any single language will suffice for all purposes  nor          could such a language be proved complete by some          inductive process Rather in our approach to designing          and developing BioD we have begun with basic          cellbiological models as test beds for BioDs conceptual          framework that is of functional properties icons and          arrows its lexicon and its iconarrow linking rules          tantamount to a graphical grammar We have          iteratively tested and modified the language to describe          an expanding array of biological functions that now          includes online models of the cellcycle GS checkpoint          machinery as it may be controlled by ion channel          activation   and the metabolic signaling and          neuronal pathways by which the ketogenic diet may affect          seizure susceptibility   In this early phase of          design we expect modifications in basic as well as          superficial features as for any software design          process but we also expect that the basic precepts of          the functionalproperty approach can be extended to other          phenomenological domains such as fluid flow heat          exchange neural circuitry and so forth To demonstrate          the progress of language development within the          cellbiological domain we will describe and discuss the          GS checkpoint control model                          Extending the lexicon to describe GS checkpoint          machinery          With a few additional icons and arrows the complex          molecular signaling network that includes Cdk and          controls the GS transition can be described compactly          Figure  First a simple rectangle is used to          represent a process that may be but need not be          specified by a separate model see below Second we use          an arrow with a starred circle as a tail to mean          produces to correspond to commonly used shorthand for          saying that a commodity is produced where the specific          mechanism of production is either unknown or not germane          to the model Figure can then represent a very complex          network of intramolecular and intermolecular actions          controlling the GS cellcycle transition                 including Cdk cyclins A and E the          inhibitor proteins p and p and inputs from          transforming growth factor TGF stimulation and DNA          damage processes                          Extensions for compartmental transport gene          expression and membrane biophysics          BioDs iconography can be extended to accommodate          additional cellbiological phenomena For instance the          model of Figure introduces membranebound compartments          in order to model the dependence of the nuclear          concentration of cyclin D on the complex kinetics of its          synthesis degradation and cytoplasmicnuclear transport          The figure also introduces two derivatives of the          molecule icon a dimer icon adapted from Kohn            to represent dimers such as cyclin DCdk and a          biomolecule icon as a shorthand to represent          catalytically active molecules with both concentration          and activity properties for example the kinases in the          mitogentoERK and Akt kinase cascades The          dimerization action arrow dashed doubleweight is          derived from the bind occupy arrow to link to species          participating in the dimerization reaction          To describe the possible effects of membrane potential          and ion fluxes on cellular activity in Figure  we have          introduced an electrical voltage property represented          by the depol depolarization process icon of          membranebound compartments and an ionic charge          property used to derive ion icons from atom icons Ion          channel function is modeled as a transporterderivative          ion channel that is used to represent the K and Ca          ion transport pathways as parts of ATPsensitive          potassium channels KATP and calcium channels          respectively A depol process icon is appended to the          cytoplasmic compartments membrane to represent how          depolarization is decreased by K efflux increased by Ca          influx and further activates voltagedependent Ca          channels With these additions we can represent the          hypothetical action of Kchannel blockers that bind to          and inhibit ATPsensitive potassium channels so that          increased intracellular Ca activates intranuclear          calmodulin          The lexicon and example models presented so far have          focused primarily on cell signaling and transduction          pathways where intramolecular sitesite interactions for          example conformational regulation of kinase activity are          prominent However intermolecular steric interactions          figure just as prominently in generegulatory systems as          exemplified in the classic problem of the lysislysogeny          genetic switch of lambda phage   This system is          modeled in Figure to illustrate how activation and          inhibition arrows can be adapted to represent both steric          hindrance and mutual cooperativity of binding For          instance steric hindrance between the binding of the          transcription factor Cro to its operator Cro           OR  and RNA polymerase RNAP to          the promoter           PR RNAP           PR  is represented by a          doubleheaded inhibition arrow linking the respective          bindingreaction arrows The positive cooperativity of          the binding reactions CI           OR RNAP           PRM and CIRNAP is represented by          three pairs of doubletailed activation arrows that          each link two binding reactions to a third reaction that          is enhanced by the two previous binding events The          cooperativity being mutual the three sets of          doubleheaded arrows are superimposed to form a triangle          of arrows linking the three binding arrows Similar          cooperativity in the formation of CICI and CI           OR bonds with the CI           OR bond further stabilizes the          association of RNAP with           PRM see Figure legend for further          discussion          The example models in Figures    demonstrate          that a functional description language can be extended by          defining new functional properties associating the          properties with existing or new icons and using the new          icons to represent a wide variety of biological          phenomena In creating the BioD lexicon and drawing          conventions we have opted for simple icons and arrows          more elaborate and expressive graphics can readily be          imagined so that diagrams can be easily drawn by hand or          with a variety of general purpose computer graphics          applications Creating and editing models is greatly          facilitated however by applications such as TopDown          as used here or Visio that provide templates of          reuseable icons and arrows and that also maintain          iconicon arrow links as icons are moved about in the          field of the diagram Even at this stage of development          BioD diagrams created by these general graphic and          diagramming tools can be readily imported to available          web page design tools to create edit link and post          models on the internet see sample BioD model sites                                      Design considerations for a BioD editor          To fully realize the advantages of a standardized          visual language however custom editors will be required          for creating new icon and arrow objects for maintaining          icon and arrow lexicons and for creating and editing          models The key first step in developing editors as well          as archiving and analysis software see below is to          develop standardized platformindependent computer          representations of core BioD language elements          functional properties icons arrows and models in          objectoriented programming OOP terms so that editors          and browsers can be developed on a number of          platforms          In OOP parlance for instance BioD icons and arrow          objects would know how to draw themselves inherit          functional and graphical properties from parent icons          and arrows and know how to link to each other The tasks          of a BioD editor as we envisage would be to create          icons and arrows organize them into lexicons and          palettes and allow users to draw and link them into          models A particularly attractive but considerably more          sophisticated feature would allow models to be built and          formatted automatically according to pairwise functional          interactions as available in metabolic pathway gene          network and protein interaction databases                          Modelmodel links for archiving and searching          system models          A standardized biological description language that is          formalized in terms of computational and not just          graphical objects offers two very attractive benefits          First it would be possible to build models of very large          systems by linking individual submodels into distributed          model networks on the internet Second it would be          possible to treat such model networks as searchable          archives of functional knowledge that can be queried for          specific functional relationships          The first possibility can be illustrated by linking          models see Figures    into networks using only two          kinds of modelmodel links action and identity          links Action links allow a functional property of an          icon in one model to act on a functional property of an          icon or action in another model as if in a single model          For instance an action link iconified as a wall plug          allows the calciumdependent activation of calmodulin in          Figure to inhibit the export of cyclin D from the          nucleus in Figure  Identity links on the other hand          allow models to share a common icon and its properties          For instance an identity link iconified as an  sign          establishes that the cyclin D concentration in Figure          represents the same cyclin D concentration as in the          nucleus in Figure  Additional examples of modelmodel          links can be seen in a network of models created to          explain how the ketogenic diet might affect seizure          activity            The second possibility is to establish online models          as searchable archives of functional as opposed to          structural relationships Just as modern bioinformatics          provides immense databases and search tools for molecular          structures and polymer sequences   we envisage that          with suitable computational implementation distributed          online models may be queried not only for local pairwise          interactions such as sitesite interactions but also          for longdistance chains of events for example Find          models where a potassium channel blocker affects          cellcycle progression a capability not available in          any other approach to biological systems Implementing          this capability would depend first on encoding and          storing BioD language elements and models as objects in          XML Extensible Markup Language   This is a          standard language for describing and exchanging          information on the internet and is rapidly beginning to          fulfill its promise   as a means of representing          biological knowledge such as polymer sequences            cellular and anatomical structures   and mathematical          models of biological systems   Second to link model          elements into distributed networks on the internet          XMLencoded BioD objects and models can be linked using          XLink XML Linking Language   and queried for          patterns of functional interactions using query languages          such as Lore Lightweight Object Repository   that          have been developed for distributed semistructured          data                          Beyond description model simulation and          analysis          Visual languages in other fields    have been          implemented as formal computer languages so that the          diagrams are not only comprehensible to humans but can be          analyzed by computers This includes CAD systems for          electronic circuit design and visual languages for          computer programming for example ProLog as well as          mathematical modeling software that translates diagrams          into mathematical equations for quantitative analysis          Indeed visual languages suitable for mathematical          modeling in biology for example Stella   SAAM II             and KineCyte    have contributed to          the establishment of quantitative modeling as a gold          standard and critical element of biological          analysis          Despite the successes and value of quantitative          analytical methods it must be recognized that progress          in the knowledge of biological systems proceeds largely          on qualitative information and reasoning A binds to B          If C increases then D decreases rather than          quantitative analysis This is due in large part to the          huge range of experimental conditions and phenomena that          are encountered and must be considered and the great          time effort and expense required to generate consistent          sets of quantitative system properties concentrations          reaction rates and binding constants for instance many          of which are experimentally inaccessible In the face of          such difficulties biology perhaps more than other          disciplines consists of a vast amount of qualitative          information that forms the basis for speculation          reasoning and decisionmaking at all levels from the          basic science laboratory to the clinic To exploit this          reservoir of qualitative biological knowledge a variety          of qualitative and hybrid qualitativequantitative          simulation and analysis tools that have been developed in          the artificial intelligence community               have been adapted to the analysis of biological problems                        The advantage of hybrid qualitativequantitative          methods with BioD is that they allow simulation and          analysis of the behavior of complex systems at the          prevailing level of systems knowledge BioD models may be          brainstormed in descriptive terms early in the discovery          process and then upgraded in stages as qualitative          information and then quantitative data become available          Model development and testing can therefore become an          integral part of early discovery and hypothesis testing          all within the context of a single graphical description          rather than developing models simply as validations of          well understood phenomena In effect BioD models would          fill the descriptive and analytical gap between informal          cartoons and fully quantitative mathematical models          To accomplish this BioD object data structures would          have to be extended to first represent functional          properties and then provide action arrows with logical          rules or mathematical functions that determine how the          states of linked icons affect each other Within a BioD          editor such rules and functions would be selectable in          preprogrammed form from contextsensitive menus of          appropriate and specific action arrows a feature in          KineCyte simulation software RainTown   Encoding          BioD data structures in XML according to the Systems          Biology Markup Language SBML a recently proposed open          standard for exchanging mathematical models of          biological systems   would allow BioD models to be          exported and quantitatively simulated in a variety of          analytical software platforms          Dissociating the specification of functional          properties and values from the graphical description of          the model means that models can be created on a purely          speculative basis and then as system knowledge matures          qualitative values and action rules can be selected or          specified to support qualitative reasoning and          hypothesis testing As quantitative values and functions          are warranted they can then used to constrain the          qualitative predictions of the model                            Discussion        We propose a conceptual basis for an extensible        biological description language that is designed to be        implemented as visual computer language for describing        archiving and analyzing complex multidisciplinary        biological systems We view this suggestion not as radical        but as a natural perhaps inevitable extension to        biomedicine of the visual computer language paradigm            that has been successfully applied in other        technical disciplines The major challenge is that biology        offers perhaps some of the most complex and functionally        diverse systems known        With example models here and online we have shown that        a limited but extensible lexicon of icons and arrows is        capable of describing complex systems that involve a range        of cellbiological disciplines from gene regulation to the        biophysics of ion transport The value of such        standardization is increased conciseness readability and        clarity for communication of knowledge about complex        systems Beyond simple graphic standardization computer        implementation of a graphic language for biology is not        only feasible with currently available computer and        internet technology but could yield substantial benefits        to biomedical education investigation and industry For        instance development of a common language to build        accessible common models are critical elements in the        blackboard approach    for multidisciplinary        collaborations on complex problems We suggest that a        standard language for building and posting        crossdisciplinary functional models on the internet will        be a necessary stage in the evolution of bioinformatics as        there is a growing need to express and understand        wholesystems behavior and the complex systems that        underlie disease We further suggest that additional        extensions to a standard graphical language can serve as a        user interface for a variety of qualitative and        quantitative simulation and analysis methods used in other        disciplines        The prototype language we present here is designed        primarily for describing cellbiological systems as        discrete networks of interacting functional objects at        multiple conceptual levels As such it may prove        cumbersome for describing massively parallel systems such        as the coupled expression of thousands of genes or        continuum systems such as the wave propagation of        cytoplasmic calcium Even in these modeling domains        however a standardized visual computational interface        would allow modelers to describe discrete parts finite        elements of systems andor to embed the systems in larger        BioD models that both control and depend on the massive or        continuum systems models        How might BioD evolve and be extended from a core set of        elements as described above to more general biological        description language In our approach we have followed the        model of recent developments of internet protocols        operating systems and computer languages by envisioning        that if a core computational framework can be established        it can be extended and implemented for a variety of        methods languages and operating systems Thus we envision        that given the development of one or more editor        applications users could invent BioD language elements        functional properties icons arrows and models as needed        to describe specific domains As domain lexicons and        modelmodel networks expand with inevitable conflicts and        duplications we would suggest more global standardization        be negotiated according to opensource mechanisms of        distributed cooperative development   used for        developing the Linux operating system and now being applied        to SBML development          By whatever mechanism language development raises other        key issues How can one maintain the delicate balance of        expressiveness and readability  can the language concisely        describe all systems of interest while still being        understandable without extensive training When does the        ability to derive more expressive icons begin to diminish        readability as viewers are required to recognize and        interpret subtle differences between similar icons Even if        successfully developed for selected domains and purposes        inevitably there will be edges to any language for        describing all domains and for all analytical purposes         hence the continued appearance of new computer languages        such as Java                    Conclusions        We have proposed that a generalized biological        descriptive language akin to schematic diagramming        languages in other disciplines is a necessary step in the        evolution of functional bioinformatics Toward this we        have developed a prototype language BioD that we have        used to test the value of this approach and to explore the        feasibility of computational implementation using        objectoriented programming methods in the context of        Internetbased communications We suggest that a        sufficiently formalized descriptive language built on the        BioD concept of functional properties can anchor a        computational framework capable of supporting the archiving        of extended weblinked model networks and model analysis        using hybrid qualitative reasoning and quantitative        simulations
