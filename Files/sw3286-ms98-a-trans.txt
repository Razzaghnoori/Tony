        so what do you think about it   well i found it interesting that they started off with a problems of immigration in America and then went back and said well if there is a problem what should we do about it   right yeah i guess thats so   do you feel theres a problem with immigration in America   um uh i think there are some problems but theyre not really big ones i think that um in general the whole immigration policy isnt quite as open as it should be that its really pretty hard for people from other countries to get in here like even if theyre educated and will be a good asset to America its often hard for them to get in and get on the track towards citizenship unless they marry a citizen or something like that   okay thats interesting i was i was wondering what your response would be im a first generation American   okay uh where did you come from   so im from immigrant parents  or an immigrant mother anyway   okay okay so where did your parents come from   uh Poland   okay   and that was you know prior to World War Two   and umhum   but its interesting that you know with the topic  i think i agree with you there needs to be more of an open policy   yeah umhum   and you know we have to remember the Chinese came here and were our labor you know for the railroad Transatlantic Railroad and   yep   our Irish came and you know built the towns and did labor   umhum   but what do you think are you from Texas or   im from Pennsylvania   Pennsylvania okay well thatll be interesting   yeah right and um a lot of   because we have just had a naturalization act where the Mexicans that were residents in Texas im from Texas   umhum   and have become citizens now   yeah   what do you think about that   um i think thats all right i um at least on the surface it sounds like a good thing do you have an opinion about it   well i agree with it wholeheartedly the only thing is ive got to share with you and my background is from New Jersey   uhhuh uhhuh   so when you were giving your answer i was thinking is this a Texan im talking to  because Texan philosophy is a little different   no okay right       well a lot of the experience that i have with this problem has to do with my brotherinlaw whos Chinese and immigrated from China and um you know he um got a green card is and is in good standing in America and in China but only because he was always pretty nice to the Chinese government   umhum   and all that and he was always on pretty good terms with them   yeah well we   but um their my sister just had a baby and theyre trying to get permission for his mother to come to America to like help care for the kid and that sort of thing and its turned out to be sort of a horrible problem its just very difficult to get a a woman who doesnt have a lot of assets or whatever out of China even temporarily to visit here   oh well then you have first in the experience on immigration   yeah   well that is interesting   umhum   yeah well i well i wonder you know even with those that were involved with Tiananmen Square you know did we really protect them   right yeah thats and i think thats pretty crazy because   yeah   i mean those students who were in America when that was happening are almost certainly going to be in trouble if they go back and besides that theyre the best and brightest of China so its certainly in our best selfish interest to keep them here if we can   that is true that is true   yep   well what do you think about we have in Texas a large Vietnamese population   umhum   that has been brought in   yeah   what do you think about that   um   and these are not the brightest i mean we   see these are refugees you mean okay   were talking boat people   right okay   we have a lot of boat people in Texas   right well um i dont have any problem with that um   youre a true liberal hearttoheart good for you  i was ready for a fight on this one   yeah i guess so  uhhuh right umhum   no i agree because um interesting my when my daughter was in high school one of the custodians was Vietnamese   yeah   and with his limited English they found out through you know that  she was in student council and they found out that he was a medical doctor
