 Wild and Woolly Sects Sometimes I think I will go to China to make my fortune I am not alone of course Hardly a week goes by without a reminder that China is the business opportunity of the century But the siren song that beckons me is not just the ring of a thousand cash registers opening It is also the call of my Chinese ancestors Come back they cry like spirits from an Amy Tan novel It is your destiny All right destiny is a bit melodramatic and I don t really hear those voices Yet as a Mandarin speaking Chinese American I am made to feel about not doing business in China they way Ken Griffey Jr might have felt if he had never gone into baseball like someone who squandered an inheritance who failed to capitalize on a rare alignment of circumstance and skill Why such regret I have after all no particular knack for business I have no million dollar idea to test on a billion plus consumers That I should feel this way testifies I think to the magnetic pull of Chineseness whatever that might mean and to the growing allure of diasporan identity Consider the question of the overseas Chinese which is how people in China and Taiwan refer to the 30 million or so ethnic Chinese who live elsewhere The idea is simple There is China which is filled with Chinese and there is the rest of the world which to varying degrees is sprinkled with Chinese The ethnocentrism is manifest as is the essentialism You can take a Chinese out of China but you can t take the China out of a Chinese In Southeast Asia such willful distinctiveness has made the ethnic Chinese the so called Jews of the East a middleman minority par excellence In the United States though something quite different has unfolded I am not an overseas Chinese And the presumption that Chinese Americans are merely Chinese people who happen to be in America who could just as easily be in Indonesia or Malaysia strikes me as fallacious even dangerous The same presumption flavors the coverage of Clinton s Asian money scandals as Robert Wright recently argued in Slate Yet I suspect that if I were ever to do business in China I might change my tune I might want to have it both ways to impress my Chinese partners with an insider s knowledge of America and to impress my American partners with an insider s knowledge of China The second insider claim is much less true than the first It is perhaps even false Still the possibility of having my identity and eating it too helps keep the China bound entrepreneur in me astir This ambivalence of self and this flirtation with intellectual dishonesty is at the very heart of a contemporary trend that I call Diaspora Chic Everywhere we turn today it seems fashionable to conceive of American minorities as communities in exile sojourners who owe greater fealty to their racial kinfolk wherever they might live than to their own neighbors whoever they might be This attitude is associated with left wing multicultural academics but multinational businesspeople hold it too In their shared view the locus of cultural and economic sovereignty is now the diaspora the unit of human agency the race Thus Joel Kotkin and others cheerily predict that a handful of tribes the Chinese the Indians the Jews and others will make the global economy hum and whir In geopolitics the dour Samuel Huntington also sees tribes but predicts a tectonic clash of civilizations On the airwaves networks like Telemundo and Univision alchemize a Hispanic identity that transcends both region and country And on our campuses kente cloths ancient tea ceremonies and native dance performances signify not only a resistance to whiteness but also a yearning among even the most assimilated to be abroad at home To be sure there is something to be said for the emergence of diasporan identities To the extent they reveal cultural connections across borders they are illuminating To the extent they are driven by the ever easier migration of people and capital they are inevitable But in the end Diaspora Chic can only disappoint First it s based on a contradiction Diasporan identity holds that the motherland is worthy of sustained loyalty Yet in almost any diaspora whether black yellow brown or white the dispersed are far better off at least materially than those back home For most hyphenated Americans a trip to the ancestral lands is enough to reinforce the point assuming that is that there are ancestral lands to speak of Where after all does one locate the home base for the Asian diaspora or the African diaspora When people speak of such pan ethnic continental clans they are merely regurgitating American definitions of race For it is in America not Asia that a connection is presumed among people of Chinese Thai Filipino and Pakistani descent It is in America not Africa that an Ethiopian is interchangeable with a Ugandan Besides once you remove the mystic overtones of blood ties and kinship diasporan identity reduces to a piece of circular reasoning What binds together the millions of Chinese outside of China Why it s their Chineseness of course And what is Chineseness That which binds together Chinese Entire conferences and whole scholarly volumes have been devoted to this catechism with roughly the same results Granted there exists in the form of a rich language and history what Huntington would call a core Sinic civilization That culture and those values however are not intrinsic to people of Chinese descent they are transmitted or not And whether they are in fact transmitted to overseas Chinese depends on choice on consent rather than descent Which means that in the diaspora Chineseness is not a more authentic way of being it is just a decision to act Chinese And the diaspora itself is not a foreordained grouping it is to borrow Benedict Anderson s description of the nation an imagined community Perhaps there is nothing wrong with that We move after all in many imagined and invented communities religious ethnic ideological But self styled diasporan idealists must also face the paradox that diasporas matter only in a world of states The romantic dream of a world with no borders and only itinerant tribes is a luxury indeed a folly that only the citizens of a liberal state could indulge Those who have a tribe but not a liberal state say the Kurds know well that a diaspora can do little to defend anyone s rights Finally Diaspora Chic suffers from this irony Though it is partly a protest against white dominance it surrenders American identity to the white folks So long as minorities strike a pose of diasporan dispossession they give tacit approval to a notion of prior Americanness that excludes them After all if everyone else is an expatriate only native whites are real Americans And that is a tragic concession It is tragic because it is so fundamentally at odds with the transformative character of this nation Diaspora Chic ultimately fails not because it promotes national self destruction a little less Anglo conformity won t doom us but because it promotes national self deception The diasporan ideal depends on the delusion that Americans can reverse the cross contamination of our cultures our bloodlines and our psyches that if we dream hard enough we might return to a prelapsarian state of pure identity I suppose we will always be tempted to reconfigure our affiliations to reinvent our identities We would hardly be American if we did not But the inconvenient fact remains Americans have far more in common with one another than with our diasporan brethren around the globe
