 hi hi um okay what now uh what particularly particularly what kind of music do you like well i mostly listen to popular music i uh listen to it all the time in in my car so i i tend to be one of those people who switches stations a lot because i don t like commercials but uh i find myself listening to popular music and yeah uh quite honestly i i have some little children and i ve unfortunately found myself listening to a lot of uh nursery rhyme music here lately but that s not by my choice how about you oh really well um i don t have that i don t have that uh experience to share uh i i i do i do listen to a lot of you know i do i switch the stations stations a lot because i don t have a cassette player in my car um lucky you um hum uh however i do i do i do like a a lot of different forms of music so i switch quite often um i i think i like uh i i m really particular about the type of music that i listen to but the uh there s there s such a wide selection i think i like a lot um hum or i like a little bit of a lot of different types of music you know i i it i i like music that is that that i feel if it s performed correctly or if it s done right or if the version is done right i like it but if it if it s not then i won t i i really don t yeah how do you feel about rap music it seems to be so popular these days rap yeah well i i don t really have anything against rap music i do the one thing i do object to about rap music is is it um hum when it becomes militant or if it s uh violence oriented i i m i i really i have i have strong objections to that um um hum right actually i listened to one time i remember it s this is back when rap even uh i would say about ten or fifteen years ago i when it was really just starting yeah yeah right when it was just starting i heard what was called talking blues which actually is rap and uh it was about the the piece of music the piece of music was about i think about forty or fifty years old and it was incredible i mean the parallels you know between it and rap uh huh uh huh right and um you you listen a lot if you listen if you listen hear a lot of old gospel um uh especially well the black gospel you know you will you know you can really pick it up i mean it you yeah you really it seems to be influenced by a lot of different music a lot of times you ll hear songs that you know they re not original but have been put to a rap kind of a rhythm yeah and uh sounds the sounds so much different and yet i i have a a much younger sister who listens to a a lot of rap music and yeah uh she thinks it s pretty funny how often i know all of the words to songs that she s listening to and yet she thought they were brand new original pieces yeah yeah they they do copy versions they do cover versions of of you know like standards i guess you could call it yeah so i think it s kind of absurd you know the fact that you know they don t really they don t really that s right give you know the original artist or the original composer the credit that s really due to them no yeah i guess there was even a a bit of a ruckus caused by the MC Hammer who s really you know seems to be the hot one of of today he used um yeah Wild Thing do you remember that that song he used i can t remember who the artist was on that yeah um hum yeah it Jimi Hendrix was the original Jimi Hendrix was the original he wrote who was it well maybe maybe it wasn t that one then because it s a living it was a living person that i m that i m thinking of that um that said you know hey okay that s those are my words and uh i guess that they re they because he hadn t originally gotten um permission from him to use it and he he since then has has amended that and um hum paid them his royalties every time the the song goes on but yeah i don t know it may ve it may ve been somebody else because i think i think that even Jimi Hendrix did a i think that was a cover i you know come to think of it i think that was a cover version of like a John Lee Hooker song or something i mean it was like it was really old maybe so i i can t think i mean i i it it a lot there re a lot so many different songs i mean like the whole thing about cover versions a lot of times i mean i ve heard some songs that that i just thought were horrendous cover versions and i m like you know i i don t wanna listen to this because you know you think of the original it s like you know oh that was really great that was a you know yeah really good piece of work and then you when you hear the cover it s like you know God you know what what are they doing to this oh i think i think a good one was um there was a Peter Frampton song well right they destroyed it oh yeah yeah and then the cover version i think i mean i thought was absolutely it was pitiful i i remember seeing the video of it on MTV and i thought it was hideous it was oh i didn t like that either yeah there s yeah but you know whatever became of Peter Frampton i mean there was nothing he was a phenomenon i mean there was no reason for him to really come into you know great stardom or anything i remember i saw him in a concert when i was yeah yeah i i think i think that probably yeah i think that probably what did it for him was the fact that he was a good stage performer i was in high school um hum he was very good i remember i saw him in a huge stadium in um Philadelphia it was in JFK Stadium it was i don t remember yeah oh man hundreds of thousands of people is what it seemed like yeah i ve i i graduated back in seventy nine so but but i really i i loved i mean i was um hum i was really into the album oriented music even then so i was really familiar with a lot of with a lot of the AOR type music um the the album oriented like the uh James Taylor and um hum oh yeah the uh the Beatles and you know i mean a lot of people they go you know they re better than the Beatles and i m like you know you you don t know what you re talking about hm no oh oh i mean you know comparison the comparison made between New Kids on the Block with The Beatles i mean it was just you can only laugh yeah you just sort of you know well i guess i can just humor them you know at this point but right well they i guess we our our age is showing when we when we think that yeah but well well you know i mean i i ve i liked a lot of the new music i think um um when i saw some promise you know with with a lot of the new wave when it when it came out um back in the um hum yeah in the mid and early eighties and then um i don t know music is kind of in a weird it it it s in a very weird position right now i think that i mean i like you know things like to hear you know like what they call world music which is you know using all these natural forms of music and yeah yeah Paul Simon well you know really that s not world music but what what Paul Simon s doing i think is is is is great because he s like Paul Simon yeah uh you know i think i think that you know using a i guess what they call it is eclectic you know using drawing from a lot of different sources and making you know a a synthesis of a new type of music um yeah what do you mean by world music well world music is um a lot of the a lot of where they where they make music that they adapt to a to another kind of to another type of listener uh for example let s say you re taking like an original Brazilian form of music um hum a with a certain style and then you try to make it a little bit more listenable for let s say another audience let s say a North American and then when they hear it it it it s a really it s another form of music and you know it s sort of um trying to draw out the best sources the the best of every type of music uh huh huh right because i mean there are some i mean i like there are some you know types of heavy metal that i really like but but i wouldn t i wouldn t say that i i completely like heavy metal i i think you know it and it s the same way with world you know world music takes no the forms that have really been um i guess i you know the best example or you know the cream of the crop i guess you could say and then and then taking those those qualities and then applying in the styles that are really um that extremely enjoyable and then taking so then it becomes a kind of music of of it s own so to speak or hm yeah yeah it becomes a kind of music of it s own i mean when you listen to it it s um uh i think that they don t use electronic electronic some of it it s it s they use electronic and acoustic interchangeably uh huh so you know well a lot of the stuff you hear coming from South Africa now and from West Africa that s considered world music because it s not particularly using certain types of folk styles right but they re they re trying to make it somewhat more modern i i a a good example another good example was i heard Miles Davis and Miles Davis worked with Ravi Shankar if you can believe it i mean you know he s this jazz performer and then he s playing with Ravi Shankar who s a very good uh huh uh huh he s a very good arranger uh arrangement to but uh were going to get off i don t know but no yeah okay but yeah i mean when i heard his album when i heard it and it s just incredible they are they trying to stop putting in a little interference okay we ve talked our five minutes though oh i ve been listening to that a lot lately yeah i i listened and i heard you know you hear this sitar and then you hear this the muted trumpet and i mean you never think would think that they that they can actually play together but go together yeah
