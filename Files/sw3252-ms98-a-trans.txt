        sure i have a Springer Spaniel and her name is Thumper shes about seven or eight years old   okay do you have any hm   i got her for Christmas from my family and uh back when we lived in Nebraska i like to hunt and uh so i thought that if i had a good hunting dog like Thumper that boy i could just go out and get all kinds of game  yeah except we live in Plano Texas now so   did it work no right i um i had a for many years i had a dog that was part Springer Spaniel i just love them her name was Molly but she isnt alive anymore  we had her for hm fifteen years i think my family did and just loved her she was the greatest greatest um went through two generations of children in my family and was always very gentle   do you have a pet now   yeah i have a cat now he just turned seven also  and hes i um got him in Arizona  and when i used to live there and he is huge he is eighteen pounds   oh what kind of cat is it   just um i got him he was um he was born in the wild like in a in a shed   uhhuh   and had never been in a building when i got him so he and hes he he must be part cross part with some kind of desert animal because hes very long and lanky but hes a very tame spoiled house cat you know now that ive had him for seven years   being born outside you didnt have any problems house training them   no no  hes yeah hes great and uh hes uh hes really spoiled though  so but hes   thats good     really big so lots of times he it he seems to get in fights and when he was younger i think he started them and now i think he barely makes it i think he gets beat up even though hes big because hes   sure   pretty much overweight and comes home with a few scratches now and then yeah   and older well we went to a uh cat show at the Plano Center here in town and uh we thought that we have a cat now but we thought well if we ever get another cat you know wed want something kind of unique so we kind of looked around and they had everything from hairless cats to Siamese cats and Persian cats and we sort of fell in love with the uh Maine Coon cats   oh ive seen them i   theyre huge   yeah  i have seen them they um werent they they were actually i cant remember they were used to be used on ships and in for  for mousers you know so theyre very nautical too   oh ill be darned i didnt know that   yeah i just uh i think im i think im being accurate in the in the area of folklore but im not sure   well thats interesting we kind of like well my family didnt necessarily like like them as much as i did but the Manx is that the one that doesnt have a tail it sort of has a bob tail i kind of like that too but   yeah yeah yeah id love to go to a cat show im real like a real cat lover id have a lot more cats if my boyfriend would let us let me  he doesnt really like mine let alone another one so     well ill tell you an interesting story about how i got my dog and then i suppose our five minutes will be up huh i uh   yeah okay   work for a university and i went to uh Omaha Nebraska to recruit students and i had some time off in the afternoon so i went to a a pet shop and i saw these little Springer Spaniels and so i decided well you know this would really be a nice dog to have so when i got back home to Carney Nebraska   hm   i told my wife about it and i said you know this is just a i i i can just hear the dog crying for me now  and and Christmas is coming up hint hint and so   i know what you mean   i had to go back the next week as well as a bunch of other people from the university and one of the people uh that we went with uh they were friends of ours and so we uh got to Omaha and i decided id take my friend over and show him the dog and so i got over there and she said oh thats too bad the dog has already been sold and i didnt realize it but this guy had somehow worked it out so that he got there a little bit earlier bought the dog and she was in the back room and uh so that night we had a reception for some of the uh potential high school students or college students and and uh he had the dog the whole time in his room and and i had no idea and so we headed back to Carney that night and the dog rode in the car and we stopped along the way and had a bite to eat and they left the dog in the car and i guess while we were inside eating Thumper just tore the heck out of the inside  of the car and uh finally we made it back to uh to Carney and
