 The Fat Man Sings It s a pity that eating disorders have been pasted over with banal notions such as body image and self esteem and unappetizing medical terms such as morbidly obese because obsession with food is by no means a dull subject How much could be said that has nothing to do with olestra or the bad example set by supermodels about a person absorbed in strange hostile negotiations with her own body There is no end to the mental or at least non nutritive uses to which food can be put and no end to the rituals surrounding that perverse form of group auto eroticism known as a meal Richard Klein s EAT FAT tries to reclaim one aspect of eating getting fat and feeling bad about it from the boring debates about health and fashion in which it s usually stuck EAT FAT is a postmodern diet book as Klein puts it employing a rather eccentric definition of postmodern which seems roughly to amount to counterintuitive an encomium to corpulence and an excoriation of all the industries that encourage you to be skinny Klein s goal is to transform an uncontrolled and miserable hatred of fat his and yours into a flabophilic delight that by robbing fat of its malevolent power will lead to becoming thin His idea is that you can dissipate an obsession by aestheticizing its object and embracing your urge to indulge in it Klein a professor of French and literary critic of the deconstructive variety has done this kind of thing before A couple of years ago he wrote a book his first Cigarettes Are Sublime in praise of smoking in order to stop It worked then and so Klein who as we discover is on the chubby side is doing it again But while the Klein who wrote Cigarettes had succeeded in mastering his obsession by the time he d finished the book he d quit smoking FAT Klein is still in the process of recovering from the throes of diet Consequently he has written an extremely strange book In reading it you are subjected to changes in personality as abrupt and jarring as nasty little electric shocks administered to the base of your spine You ll be floating contentedly along in Klein s pleasant foamy prose the gorgeous display of her colossal adiposity her thundering moonfaced creviced posterior evokes a vastly delicious sub lunar landscape in which an explorer could lose himself in pleasure forever O blessed fat when all of a sudden Dzzzzz Science and authority come together to serve each other to make money and murder fat The writing gets bubbly for a bit the profusion of their d collet flesh billowing up and cascading down over and out of their dresses and then Dzzzzz Evil doctors foist new drugs on desperate people Thousands die of starvation and the rest sooner or later get fat There are you are forced to conclude not one but two Richard Kleins lurking in this book Richard Klein No 1 is an urbane critic who delights in a clever lyrical celebration of creamy fleshiness His evil twin Richard Klein No 2 is hurt and angry at the system for making him feel bad about himself all his life and perpetuating evil unattainable images of thinness to get him addicted to its demonic diet drugs and make him sick and miserable plus it s not just him but men and especially women all over America who are falling victim to the greedy maw of the medical industrial conspiracy Richard Klein No 1 has written an elegant seductive book that sets you to musing how nice it might be to put on 80 or 90 pounds to feel that sensual private fatty softness all over Klein No 1 can tell any number of amusing fat related anecdotes Did you know that Socrates used to dance every morning to keep his weight down That the 19 th century French writer Th ophile Gautier declared he could not in his youth have accepted as a lyric poet anyone weighing more than 99 pounds Best of all fat Hamlet Citing an essay by one Laura Keyes Klein quotes lines from the play e g Queen Gertrude about her son He is fat and scant of breath that suggest that Hamlet s indecision may be due more to the lymphatic temperament of a pudgy little porker Ham let get it than to heroic paralysis The interpretation certainly makes the play funnier Is not this line of Hamlet s for example lent a certain zing when read as a diet fantasy Oh that this too too solid flesh would melt Thaw and resolve itself into a dew But Richard Klein No 2 delivers snoozy tirades against the Beauty Myth designed to oppress and exploit us all invented manufactured sustained and promoted by a vast industrial ideological system in order to obscure the reality of our bodies Why is it one wonders that the Beauty Myth is oppressive while the Superbly Rendered Sonata Myth or the Brilliant But Also Commercially Successful Book Myth is not Klein No 2 throws around the silly word vast in order to convey a sense of imminent diet apocalypse as in vast unknown consequences administration of these drugs on a vast scale And he displays a certain na vet about scientific standards asking for instance about a diet drug What perfect assurance can the FDA give that the dex effect won t be the same on human brains Why take chances on a massive scale with human neurons until proof of dex s safety can be unambiguously established How does Klein propose to establish a drug s safety with perfect assurance Surely safety is the product of an ad hoc cost benefit analysis rather than some kind of empirical property that a drug does or doesn t have In short Richard Klein No 2 quenches our pleasure in Richard Klein No 1 in much the same way that the health and beauty industries are supposedly determined to quench our pleasure in fat Klein being a post structuralist is fascinated by the materiality of signs that is in this case by the way words look and sound as opposed to what they mean This fascination crops up in the book in a number of ways which will seem thought provoking or irritating depending on taste The book is liberally seasoned with wordplay and typographical experiments the words eat fat are always in capitals with FAT printed directly under EAT so you can see how similar the two words are and rhymes why this should be so at this moment in history is a mystery A mystery of history The book s first sentence is SKIP THIS PREFACE The most pervasive sign of Klein s brand of French post structuralism though are his narrow ideas about pleasure and control For Klein control is always bad whether it s the evil health and fashion industry dictating our ideas about beauty or the beleaguered dieter struggling to curb his cravings in a spirit of misguided self hatred Klein has a horror of what he rather predictably perceives to be a New Puritan movement in America attempting to eliminate bad for you indulgences such as fat or cigarettes Pleasure for Klein is the opposite of control It s all about gratification and excess But there are two kinds of pleasure the pleasure of doing and the pleasure of not doing the pleasure of indulging and the pleasure of abstinence Control can be fun And it is a rather uninteresting one sided kind of hedonism that fails to take this into account If only Klein weren t so categorically averse to American health culture he might allow that a little self imposed Puritanism now and then a little punishing exercise here a little culinary deprivation there can be a sensual pleasure too albeit of a different sort In Cigarettes Klein s mascot was the Baudelairean dandy that rare figure for whom the cultivation of personal elegance is more important than health and who is therefore a model for the unrepentant smoker So Klein of all people should appreciate the stricter kinds of pleasures Because while the dandy stands for beauty and elegance he also stands for the restraint and self discipline required to appear refined at all times As Baudelaire put it in his essay The Painter of Modern Life All the complicated material conditions to which dandies submit from an impeccable toilette at every hour to the most perilous feats of the sporting field are no more than a system of gymnastics designed to discipline the soul The strictest monastic rule was no more despotic You would think that cultivating a taste for such ascetic modes of enjoyment would be at least as effective a diet strategy as glorifying blubber but Klein fails to entertain this possibility Alas all he writes about all he thinks about all he wants to do is give in to fat
