 Background Phosphatidylinositol 3 4 5 trisphosphate PIP3 is one of the major intracellular second messengers regulating growth metabolism and vesicular trafficking for reviews see refs 1 2 3 The level of PIP3 in the cell is determined by the balance of kinase and phosphatase activity PI 3Kinase activity is acutely regulated and a number of isoforms have been cloned that are activated in response to various stimuli 4 The major phosphatidylinositol 3 phosphate phosphatase in cells is the tumor suppressor PTEN 5 6 This protein has a tonic inhibitory effect on PI 3Kinase signaling by reversing the 3 phosphorylation PTEN is altered or deleted in many human cancers 7 8 9 10 In vitro cells that are deficient in PTEN show elevated PI 3Kinase signaling 11 Reintroduction of PTEN in a variety of cancer cells including glioma breast bladder and ovarian cancer cells causes G1 arrest inhibits tumorigenesis and promotes anoikis 12 13 14 Mechanistically Akt activity is decreased cell motility is decreased expression of two cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors p27 and p21 is increased cyclin D1 is down regulated Rb phosphorylation is inhibited and signaling via Grb2 SOS is suppressed 11 15 The link between PTEN and cell growth is underscored by genetic experiments in mice PTEN knockout mice die in utero due to extensive overgrowth of the cephalic and caudal regions 12 16 PTEN heterozygous mice have a predisposition to tumors in multiple tissues often with loss of the second allele 17 18 In vitro PTEN embryonic stem cells and fibroblasts display increased proliferation and decreased sensitivity to apoptosis The PI 3Kinase dependent activation of Akt is thought to play a central role in the cell survival pathway in many cells 7 19 20 Elevated Akt activity and protein is found in many PTEN deficient cancer cells Akt directly phosphorylates and inactivates the pro apoptotic proteins ASK1 BAD caspase 9 21 22 23 24 Akt also induces the expression of the anti apoptotic Bcl 2 and c FLIP proteins and suppresses the cell cycle inhibitor p27 KIP 25 26 27 28 This later effect is via the phosphorylation and inactivation of the forkhead family of transcription factors AFX FKHR and FKHR L1 Although it is often assumed that elevated Akt activity is responsible for the increased survival of cancer cells Akt activity is not the only pathway that is essential for cell survival The MAPK pathway can also protect cells from apoptosis as can constitutive activation of Stat3 signaling 29 30 The IGF I Receptor is a member of the large family of tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors Signaling by the IGF IR has been studied in many different cell types and is important for proliferation survival motility adhesion transformation tumor formation and metastasis for reviews see refs 31 32 The receptor can directly phosphorylate the insulin receptor substrate 1 IRS 1 and Shc proteins in the intact cell causing activation of PI 3Kinase and ras signaling 33 More recently it has been shown that the IGF IR signals via the G subunits of the heterotrimeric Gi complex to stimulate PI 3Kinase and ras and also activates the JAK Stat pathway to cause phosphorylation of Stat3 34 35 What is the evidence for the involvement of IGF IR signaling in proliferation and cancer Elegant studies in knockout mice have delineated the contribution of IGF I IGF II and the IGF I receptor to fetal growth for review see ref 36 Embryonic fibroblasts derived from IGF IR knockout embryos R cells do not grow in serum free medium despite supplementation with a wide variety of other growth factors and grow more slowly in media containing serum than wild type cells for reviews see refs 37 38 Additionally all phases of the cell cycle are prolonged in the null cells suggesting that the IGF IR is required throughout the cell cycle A functional IGF I receptor is required for successful cell transformation IGF IR cells are not transformed by overexpression of SV40 T antigen activated ras or EGF or PDGF receptors Transformation appears to involve autocrine stimulation as IGF I production and secretion is increased in normal cells following transformation by SV40 T antigen but the null cells cannot respond to the IGF I so do not transform Interfering with the IGF signaling system can inhibit the growth of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo Treatment with antagonistic peptide analogs of IGF I antisense oligos or an adenovirus expressing IGF IR antisense cRNA prevents proliferation of cells in monolayers transformation and growth in athymic nude mice This includes multiple human tumor cell lines including glioblastoma melanoma ovarian carcinoma prostatic carcinoma and breast carcinomas for reviews see refs 31 39 40 41 The IGF IR appears to function in transformation both by preventing apoptosis through activation of Akt and by stimulating proliferation through the ras MAPK cascade IGF I can prevent c myc induced apoptosis in rat l fibroblasts and neuronal apoptosis due to serum starvation IGF IR cells can proliferate in monolayers in the presence of serum but undergo apoptosis when put in suspension and are more sensitive to chemotherapeutic reagents There is also evidence implicating the IGF IR in metastasis IGF I produces a chemotactic response in human melanoma cells and antisense to the IGF IR mRNA prevents metastasis in the murine carcinoma cell H 59 In this study we wanted to determine if disruption of IGF I signaling could prevent growth of a tumor cell lacking PTEN Elevated PI 3Kinase can be normalized by reintroduction of PTEN to reduce PIP3 levels but it has not been shown that this effect can also be achieved by disruption of an upstream signal that stimulates PI 3Kinase activity We have previously demonstrated the overexpression and hormone independent activation of the IGF IR in primary breast cancers 42 Similar overexpression of the IGF IR and the ligands IGF I and IGF II have been seen in human gliomas and astrocytomas 43 44 45 46 Because of the important role for the IGF IR in cell survival we investigated whether a dominant negative IGF IR could inhibit growth of the U87 glioma This glioma is deficient in PTEN and shows constitutive activation of Akt which can be inactivated by re introduction of PTEN 47 Materials and Methods Materials and Cell Culture Antiphosphotyrosine antibodies pY20

Production of pseudo typed retrovirus The wild type IGF IR cDNA or a mutant cDNA which contained a methionine substitution for lysine 1003 in the ATP binding site of the kinase domain were cloned into the retroviral vector pLPONL 57 The pseudo typed viruses were generated and purified by the UCSD Viral Vector Core The plasmids were co transfected into 293 cells with an expression vector for the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus G protein This coat protein allows the virus to be concentrated and confers greater tropism Cell culture supernatants and cells were harvested and the virus concentrated

Agar Cells were trypsinized and 10 4cells plated in 35 mm petri dishes in complete medium containing 0 35 agarose over a layer of 0 7 agarose in complete medium Cells were allowed to grow for 14 21

basis to check for tumor growth Tumors were measured with calipers in three dimensions and tumor volume calculated assuming the tumors were ellipsoid At the end of the study the tumors were excised measured weighed and then fixed in 10 formalin Tumors were embedded in paraffin sectioned and stained with hematoxylin eosin or for apoptosis using the TUNEL assay Roche Indianapolis IN Results and Discussion Inhibition of the IGF I receptor by expression of a kinase inactive mutant inhibits proliferation of Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells Before embarking on studies in human tumor cells we verified that our dominant negative approach would work in a model system To inhibit the IGF IR we took advantage of the fact that the IGF I receptor is a hetero tetramer Activation of the native receptor requires the trans phosphorylation of two kinase domains 48 Hence expression of an excess of kinase defective IGF I receptors causes the formation of hybrid molecules containing one half an endogenous wild type receptor and the other half a kinase defective transfected receptor These hybrids should be kinase inactive and signaling incompetent Similar approaches have been used successfully in other studies 49 50 51 52 Initially we tested Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells that had been stably transfected with expression vectors for kinase inactive or wild type IGF I receptors 53 The parental CHO cell line expresses 50 000 endogenous IGF IRs the transfected wild type CHO WT cell line expresses 250 000 IGF IRs and the kinase defective CHO MK cell line expresses 250 000 mutant IGF IRs Thus the transfected cells express the human IGF IR at approximately five fold higher levels than the endogenous receptor The mutant receptor contains a lysine to methionine MK point mutation at position 1003 in the ATP binding site of the kinase domain and has no measurable kinase activity Two clonal lines expressing the MK receptor were used with identical results We assessed the ability of the IGF IRs of each cell line to undergo autophosphorylation in response to increasing concentrations of IGF I Cells were stimulated with increasing concentrations of IGF I and whole cell lysates immunoblotted for tyrosine phosphorylated proteins As expected autophosphorylation of the IGF IRs was observed in the CHO and CHO WT cells but very little was seen in two different clones of CHO MK cells indicating that the kinase defective receptors inhibited the endogenous wild type hamster receptors Figure 1A The inhibition was not complete however as phosphorylation of IRS1 the major endogenous substrate in these cells is still preserved at the higher dose of IGFI but inhibited at the lower dose This is likely due to the level of receptor expression The transfected receptors are expressed at four fold the level of the endogenous receptors Assuming stochastic assembly of tetramers 4 of receptors should be homodimers of signaling competent receptors that can phosphorylate IRS1 To confirm that the kinase defective receptors were functioning in a dominant negative fashion we studied the ability of CHO and CHO MK cells to incorporate 3H thymidine into DNA in response to IGF I stimulation Serum starved cells were stimulated with increasing concentrations if IGF I and then pulsed with 3H thymidine The ability of the CHO MK cells to incorporate thymidine in response to IGF I is markedly diminished as compared to the parental cell line Figure 1B We then tested colony formation in soft agar as an indicator of cellular transformation Cells were trypsinized counted and equivalent numbers of cells plated in soft agar in complete medium Cells were cultured for 14 21 days and then the number of colonies counted Overexpression of the wild type IGF IRs increased the number of colonies and overexpressing the kinase defective receptors reduced the number of colonies by 60 Figure 1C Not only did we observe a difference of the number of colonies but CHO MK colonies were smaller than either the parental CHO or CHO WT colonies data not shown We next studied the ability of each of these cell lines to form tumors in athymic nude mice Ten million 10 7 cells from each cell line were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of five athymic nude mice Tumor size was measured biweekly The mice were euthanized at the end of three weeks and the tumors excised and weighed Figure 1D 1E At this high level of innoculum there was no difference in tumor incidence data not shown However expression of the wild type IGF IR accelerated tumor growth and tumors were larger at sacrifice The kinase defective IGF IR on the other hand delayed the appearance of tumors and smaller tumors were found at sacrifice The tumors were imbedded in paraffin and sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin Figure 2 left panels The sections were also stained for the presence of apoptosis using the TUNEL method Apoptotic cells image as fluorescent green Figure 2 right panels The typical histology of CHO tumors is shown in panel A Cells transfected with the wild type IGF IR have a more streaming morphology characteristic of human ovarian tumors Panel B Cells transfected with the kinase defective IGF IR showed a more benign morphology with no invasion of the capsule Panel C and data not shown Very few apoptotic cells are seen in the CHO parental and CHO WT cells whereas apoptotic cells are seen throughout the tumor from the kinase defective CHO MK cells These results confirm that the kinase defective IGF IR is able to inhibit tumor growth in a model system An inhibitory antibody to the IGF IR inhibits growth of U87 tumors Adenoviral expression of wild type PTEN can inhibit U87 tumor growth indicating that elevated PI 3Kinase signaling is responsible for the increased proliferation and survival of these cells 47 54 Our subsequent studies were designed to test whether interruption of an upstream growth factor signal would have the same growth inhibitory effect as reintroduction of PTEN To test initially whether the PTEN deficient U87 glioma cells might be susceptible to inhibition of the IGF IR we measured colony formation and tumor growth in the presence of an inhibitory antibody to the human IGF IR IR3 This antibody prevents binding of IGF I or IGF II to the extracellular domain of the IGF IR and has been shown to prevent the formation of MDA231 tumors in nude mice 55 U87 cells were plated in soft agar in the presence of IR3 or a control antibody Cells were cultured for 14 days and the number of colonies counted The presence of the inhibitory antibody reduced the number of colonies growing in soft agar but the control antibody had no effect Table 1 U87 cells were then injected into nude mice as before Mice received biweekly intraperitoneal injections of 100 g of IR3 or control antibody starting 3 days after injection of the cells The IR3 injections reduced the number of tumors by 60 Table 1 The tumors were excised fixed and stained for apoptosis Tumors from mice treated with the IR3 antibody showed extensive apoptosis unlike control tumors Figure 3 These results confirm that inhibition of IGF I signaling by an inhibitory antibody can suppress growth of a PTEN deficient glioma cell line Retroviral expression of the kinase inactive IGF I Receptor inhibits growth of U87 glioblastoma cells in vivo To make expression of kinase defective IGF I receptors in different cell lines more tractable we generated pseudotyped retroviruses expressing either the kinase defective MK or wild type WT IGF I receptors We also obtained a virus expressing the beta galactosidase LacZ protein to measure infection efficiency and serve as a virus control U87 cells were infected with the MK WT or LacZ viruses and selected with G418 Pools of cells containing stably integrated retroviruses were then used in transformation and tumor growth experiments Binding studies showed that the U87 LacZ cells express 10 5endogenous IGF IRs per cell while the U87 WT and U87 MK cells express 3 10 6and 2 10 6receptors per cells respectively Thus the retrovirus allows 20 to 30 fold overexpression of the transfected receptor To test the function of the virally encoded receptors we measured IGF I stimulated autophosphorylation of the IGF IR and phosphorylation of IRS 1 Phosphorylation IRS 1 was evident in the LacZ infected cells but little IGF IR phosphorylation was seen as the cells express few receptors Figure 4 Infection with the WT virus leads to a large increase in IGF IR and IRS 1 tyrosine phosphorylation Infection with the MK virus eliminated the IGF I stimulated phosphorylation of IRS 1 confirming that the expressed receptor was acting as a dominant negative to inhibit the endogenous receptors The dominant negative effect is much greater in these cells than the CHO cells Figure 1 as the virus expresses the transfected receptors at a much higher level The three infected U87 glioma cells were then injected into nude mice Eight to twelve mice were studied for each cell line and each mouse received two injections In two different experiments mice were inoculated with 10 6or 5 10 5cells Tumors were excised after 6 or 10 weeks and weighed Table 2 The WT infected cells had the highest frequency of tumor formation and the MK infected cells the lowest in both cases WT infected cells gave the largest tumors in both experiments demonstrating that overexpression of the IGF IR in a malignant cell can enhance tumor formation as we observed for the CHO cells The MK infected cells gave fewer tumors in both experiments but more importantly those tumors that did form were much smaller The results obtained with the dominant negative IGF IR are identical to published results reintroducing PTEN hence inhibition of upstream PI 3Kinase signaling might be a useful approach for PTEN deficient tumors The tumors were imbedded in paraffin and sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin Figure 5 The U87 LacZ tumors are very cellular with small regular nuclei left panel and show some invasion of the capsule by tumor cells right panel The tumors from U87 cells infected with the IGF IR virus are also very cellular but the cells have larger nuclei left panel and have completely invaded the capsule right panel The tumors from U87 cells infected with the kinase inactive IGF IR are less cellular with larger areas of stroma left panel Numerous irregular nuclei are apparent There is no invasion of the capsule by tumor cells right panel The irregular nuclei and intact capsule are consistent with data from other cells showing that inhibition of IGF IR expression causes apoptosis and prevents metastasis The idea that the IGF IR might be a valuable target for the treatment of brain tumors is supported by a recent pilot study in twelve patients with malignant astrocytomas 56 All patients had grade 3 or 4 astrocytomas and had failed on standard therapy The PTEN status of their primary tumors was not known After surgery autologous glioma cells were collected and treated ex vivo with IGF IR antisense oligos and re implanted in diffusion chambers for 24 h Clinical and radiological improvements were seen in eight of the twelve patients Five patients showed a lymphocytic infiltration after antisense treatment indicating that knocking out the IGF IR induced an immune response It would be interesting to determine whether response to this treatment correlated with loss of PTEN in the primary tumors Conclusions Loss of PTEN is a very common occurrence in human tumors Restoring PTEN protein or function to reduce PI 3Kinase signaling prevents tumor growth in animal models However it may not be possible to restore PTEN in human tumors Direct inhibition of PI 3Kinase activity may not be feasible either as it is likely to have severe side effects Our results suggest that a therapeutic strategy to inhibit the upstream stimulus for PI 3Kinase through blockade of growth factor receptors may provide a workable alternative Abbreviations PIP3 Phosphatidyl 3 4 5 triphosphate DMEM Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s Medium PI 3Kinase phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase MAPK
