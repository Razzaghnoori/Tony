 Where to Go To the surprise of many first time visitors Cuba is no speck in the Caribbean Nicol s Guill n the nation s finest poet described the island as a long green alligator Long it certainly is at 1 250 km 776 miles from snout to tail Nearly the size of England Cuba is divided into 14 provinces and incorporates some 1 500 offshore islands known as cayos cays or keys Given its size you would need at least a month to explore Cuba fully Most people begin their journeys in the capital Havana before heading to the prized tobacco lands farther west and doubling back across the plains of sugar cane and some of the country s finest colonial towns in central Cuba The eastern region known as Oriente has soaring mountains and Cuba s second and most musical city Santiago de Cuba Resort hotels hug quintessential Caribbean beaches around the whole island and though many package tourists still stick close to the coasts every region has charming engaging towns Sand and sun Cuba certainly has but most visitors who dare to step away from the beach will find it simply too beguiling to spend a whole holiday lying idly in front of their hotels Havana La Habana The island s capital with almost 3 million inhabitants is one of the most intoxicating cities in the world Ever since its early maritime days and through the 1950s when gangsters who ran prostitution and gambling rackets made Havana synonymous with decadence it has always held a slightly seedy languorous allure That nostalgic appeal is still evident Today Havana is a one of a kind fascinating study in decay Unrestrained ocean waves and salty sea spray have wrecked huge chunks of the Malec n the sumptuous promenade and roadway that traces the edge of the sea Throughout the city crumbling houses three and four stories tall somehow still standing line backstreets where children play stickball and their parents and grandparents hover around doorstoops In Old Havana magnificently restored colonial palaces and stately baroque churches and convents crowd pulsating squares Once the finest colonial city in the Americas Havana s grandeur has not been destroyed even by decades of crisis and neglect No less defiant than Castro himself beneath the rubble this city is a living breathing vital and sensual creature Havana sprawls over more than 700 square km 270 square miles and is divided into five districts Those of greatest interest are Habana Vieja Old Havana Centro Habana Central Havana Vedado and to a lesser extent Miramar The latter two districts are newer residential and shopping barrios that extend west and south of the old city While most areas within a neighborhood can be covered comfortably on foot passing from one to the other usually requires a taxi or bicitaxi the latter is Cuba s bicycle taxi a type of pedicab Old Havana La Habana Vieja The oldest section of Havana is the city s most spectacular even if restoration work and gleaming coats of pastel colonial colors plus a stern police presence on every corner are leaving parts of it with a slightly more sanitized feel than the weathered working class neighborhoods that extend along the water and inland As the location of the city s greatest historical sites Old Havana is where you ll want to spend most of your time if it is limited Havana was founded along a vast natural harbor in 1519 During the 16th century a fleet of galleons laden with treasures used the port as a pit stop on the way back to Spain from the New World By the 17th century pirate attacks prompted the building of extensive city defenses colossal forts a chain across the harbor mouth and prominent city walls making Havana the Bulwark of the West Indies The wealthiest residents lived with their slaves in grand mansions constructed in mud jar style a Christian Muslim architectural tradition dating from medieval Spain Hidden courtyards bathed in penumbral light lurked behind massive doors slatted blinds carved iron window bars rejas and half moon stained glass windows mediopuntos The presence of such architectural wonders no matter how dilapidated led UNESCO to declare Old Havana a World Heritage Site in 1982 In the central tourist quarter an expanding number of buildings are being spruced up with the assistance of UNESCO and foreign foundations but many others are propped up by wooden columns lean tos that appear to be merely forestalling the inevitable Their arcades fluted pillars and mosaic tiles are teetering on last legs praying for restoration miracles At night the deep darkness of the streets is punctuated only by the neon glow of TV sets from tiny front rooms and the occasional headlights of a small colony of gas guzzling vintage Chevrolets and Plymouths Havana s distant era lives on Legendary places plucked from the pages of popular novels and the lives of fiction writers need little input from visitors to evoke their storied past Graham Greene s Hotel Sevilla where Our Man in Havana went to meet his secret service contact and Hemingway s favorite watering holes El Floridita and La Bodeguita del Medio and the Hotel Ambos Mundos where he penned much of For Whom the Bell Tolls Old Havana is best experienced on foot although you can also pick up a bicitaxi pedicab to get to the Malec n or the museums at the district s edge Plaza de la Catedral Havana s delicious Cathedral Square the focus of Habana Vieja life could be a stage set Most days a colorful crafts market spreads across the cobbled square and tourists linger at El Patio s outdoor caf sipping mojitos and tapping their toes to a sampling of Cuban son The all hours hubbub here is infectious The glorious baroque fa ade and asymmetrical belltowers of the late 18th century cathedral are only marginally the square s top attraction Yet the church begun by Jesuits in 1748 is a thing of beauty one half expects its bells to erupt in triumphant song Its clean interior is surprisingly plain but it once held the remains of Christopher Columbus Just south of the cathedral are superb colonial mansions with bright shutters and mediopuntos and an attractive little cul de sac Callej n de Chorro with a graphic arts workshop Of particular interest in the Cathedral Square is the Museo de Arte Colonial housed in a handsome palace dating to 1720 Its yellow courtyard and little altered architectural features are complemented by a large collection of 17th and 18th century furniture Just round the corner on Calle Empedrado at no 207 you ll find the atmospheric bar restaurant La Bodeguita del Medio see page 41 which according to Hemingway served Havana s finest mojito management apparently believes the notoriety is worth an extra two dollars per drink Like pilgrims to Ernest s drinking shrine all tourists seem required to pay their respects here Art exhibitions are held down the street at the Centro Cultural Wilfredo Lam at the corner of San Ignacio named for Cuba s top modern artist Books manuscripts and photographs of the country s best known novelist are housed inside the Centro de Promoci n Cultural Alejo Carpentier Empedrado 215 Plaza de Armas Plaza de Armas which surrounds a statue of the patriot C spedes and is ringed by shaded marble benches and second hand booksellers is Havana s oldest square It dates to the city s founding in 1519 On the square s eastern side a small neoclassical temple El Templete marks the spot where the first Catholic mass was celebrated in 1519 Next door is one of the city s most luxurious hotels Hotel Santa Isabel The squat but angular and moated Castillo de la Real Fuerza Fort of the Royal Forces to the north is one of the oldest forts in the Americas begun in 1558 The battlements afford good views over the harbor and there are craft shops upstairs The bronze La Giraldilla weather vane on one of the fort s towers depicting a woman scanning the seas for her lost husband an early Cuban governor has been adopted as the symbol of the city and of Havana Club rum In 1791 the seat of government and the governor s or captain general s residence were transferred from the fort to the newly built baroque Palacio de los Capitanes Generales Palace of the Captain Generals on the square s western flank A magnificent structure that was the presidential palace and then the municipal palace until Castro seized power it now houses the Museo de la Ciudad de la Habana the Museum of the City of Havana Beyond the serene courtyard and its statue of Columbus lie a succession of splendid marbled and chandeliered rooms some housing old cannonballs and coaches others decked out in gilded furnishings The most hallowed room commemorates Cuba s 19th century independence wars with the very first Cuban flag and venerated personal objects from generals of the day Calle Obispo Running all the way from Plaza de Armas to Parque Central the pedestrian only Calle Obispo is Old Havana s most important thoroughfare Here you can peer into apothecaries unchanged since the 19th century as well as some of Havana s oldest homes Equally fascinating are the two parallel partly residential streets O Reilly and Obrap a where grand neoclassical and colonial buildings intermingle with decrepit tenements Much of restored Old Havana is concentrated in only a few blocks at the eastern end of these streets On the corner of Mercaderes and Obispo is the recently renovated 1920s era Hotel Ambos Mundos Hemingway lived on and off in room 511 for a couple of years during the 1930s The room contains original artifacts from Hemingway s many years in Cuba including the typewriter he used to write most of For Whom the Bell Tolls those not staying in the hotel can visit the room for US 2 Nearby are several museums worth visiting as much for the glorious colonial mansions that house them as for their contents On Calle Obrap a between Mercaderes and San Ignacio is the striking lemon yellow Casa de la Obra P a This 17th century architectural wonder features baroque additions around a flower drenched courtyard and a full set of beautifully furnished domestic rooms The owner a member of one of Cuba s most important families rescued orphan girls and took them into his home his obra p a work of piety that lends its name to both the house and its street The massive mansion opposite nearly as impressive houses the Casa de frica with pelts drums costumes carved figures and furniture from some 26 African countries as well as a tantalizing collection of objects related to santer a the syncretic Afro Cuban religion see page 26 Casa de frica will likely be closed for renovations until the end of 2000 The Museo Numism tico Calle Oficios 8 has a comprehensive set of Cuban coins and banknotes A little farther on lies the Casa de los rabes Calle Oficios 12 a Moorish style 17th century building that now comprises a bazaar piled high with carpets robes and pottery Havana s only place of worship for Muslims and a lovely restaurant tucked away in the courtyard The streets of Havana are a living museum of chrome finned wondercars imported during Detroit s heyday but several that once belonged to pivotal Cuban figures among them a 1918 Ford truck used by Fidel s father and Che s 1960 Chevrolet Bel Air are lined up in the Museo de Autos Antiguos Calle Oficios 13 Continuing west along Calle Oficios you ll come to a splendidly restored square Plaza de San Francisco with upscale shops restaurants and the imposing 18th century Iglesia y Convento de San Francisco de As s The convent contains a museum with Spanish treasures and you can climb the belltower for spectacular views of Old Havana Concerts are frequently held here Nearby you ll find several impeccable colonial era houses with brilliantly colored fa ades Plaza Vieja Follow charming Calle Mercaderes to the fascinating and aptly named Plaza Vieja Old Square which began life in 1584 housing wealthy merchants It is slowly receiving a massive facelift with assistance from UNESCO but most of its mansions remain in terrible disrepair Laundry adorns disintegrating balconies while in the center of the plaza an incongruous neoclassical gleaming marble fountain has been installed it s an unmitigated disaster in this atmospheric corner of Old Havana On the southwest corner of the square a fine 18th century palace has been converted into an arts center Just east is the Art Nouveau style fabulously decayed Hotel Palacio Vienna a ghost building if ever there was one The old backstreets here are full of character but seldom visited by tourists Down Calle Cuba between Sol and Luz stands the 17th century Convento de Santa Clara an expansive complex that takes up several blocks Inside is a tranquil courtyard garden full of exotic trees A convent until 1919 it is now an architectural conservation center It is also a hostel Residencia Acad mica Santa Clara which provides peaceful simple rooms see page 128 a lot of visitors have long term stays on their minds By the train station between Calles Picota and Egido is the modest Casa Natal de Jos Mart at Calle Leonor P rez 314 the birthplace of poet and statesman Jos Mart The numerous personal effects on display leave no doubt about Mart s importance in the pantheon of Cuban heroes he is Cuba s founding father The train station itself is fascinating with hundreds of people waiting in line and a parking lot full of bicycle driven pedicabs and vintage taxis The Prado West of the oldest sections and intimate streets of Old Havana is an area of wide boulevards and grand palaces The loveliest avenue the Prado formally known as Paseo de Mart runs from Parque Central to the sea Grand but run down buildings with fading flamingo pink and lime green fa ades and ornate columns flank a raised promenade of laurels gas lamps and marble benches In the 19th century this was the city s most fashionable strolling ground Now it serves as a minipark for habaneros as Havana s citizens are called from coupling lovers and children playing on homemade skateboards to parading prostitutes The streets Brasil and Obrap a lead directly west to the monumental Capitolio a replica of the American capitol in Washington D C Completed in 1929 it reflects the period when Cuba was in the thrall of the United States Its vast bronze doors pictorially chart the island s history and the immense main gallery inside has a diamond in the floor beneath the dome symbolizing that now distant era when Cuba was rich Directly behind the Capitolio is the large Partag s Tobacco Factory the biggest export factory in the country with more than 200 rollers churning out 5 million cigars a year and one of Havana s top tourist draws This factory which has been rolling out puros since the mid 19th century is the best and with an admission fee of US 10 the most expensive to visit on the island it also has an excellent tobacco shop and smoking lounge for aficionados and wannabes There are two tours daily see page 81 If the cigars inside strike you as too expensive you ll have plenty of opportunity to purchase fake or stolen stogies outside the factory as every third person whispers You want cigar as you pass Just east of the Capitolio on Parque Central near the classic Hotel Inglaterra stands the magnificent Gran Teatro built in 1837 The home of the Cuban National Ballet and Opera drips with ornate balustrades shutters and sculpted columns The cavernous interior is hardly less awesome but can only be visited during performances Those with the Hemingway bug shouldn t miss a visit to El Floridita see page 41 at the intersection of Calles Obispo and Montserrate one block east of Parque Central The writer immortalized the swanky bar in Islands in the Stream Hemingway photos adorn the walls his seat is on the extreme left of the elegant mahogany bar and his favorite daiquiri is now referred to as the Papa Hemingway with double rum and no sugar everyone knows he was an alcoholic the barmen claim he was also diabetic If you don t mind sipping a 6 daiquiri the monthly wage of the doorman the place is eminently capable of evoking the kind of hedonistic refuge expat writers adore Housed in the grand presidential palace used by presidents and dictators between 1920 and 1959 the fascinating and didactic Museo de la Revoluci n is the country s largest and most interesting museum You ll find an exhaustive exhibit of the trajectory of the 1959 Cuban Revolution so allow a couple of hours to view it The most absorbing sections chart the struggle to power with a variety of illustrations countless maps evocative photos of both torture victims and triumphal scenes and assorted personal memorabilia from passports to bloodstained clothes In the square outside is the ordinary looking Granma the boat that carried Castro s 81 rebels to shore in 1956 it is now enclosed in glass and guarded by military police On the seafront at C rcel 1 the Museo Nacional de la M sica National Music Museum is of interest mainly for its extensive informative collection of African drums and the many stringed instruments used in Cuban traditional music Havana s Forts Cuba s most impressive forts sit brooding over the capital s commercial harbor Take a taxi through the road tunnel underneath the water to reach them The older one constructed at the end of the 16th century is the Castillo de los Tres Santos Reyes Magos del Morro better known as El Morro From its position at the harbor mouth the views of Havana over the defiant cannons are magical The vast Fortaleza de San Carlos de la Caba a known as La Caba a running beside the harbor was constructed after the English capture of Havana in 1763 The largest fort ever built in the Americas it is impressively well preserved and the gardens and ramparts are romantically lit in the evening A ceremony at 9pm re enacts the firing of a cannon that marked the closing of the city gates New Havana The walls surrounding Old Havana were razed during the 19th century to allow the city to expand westward The long curvaceous and crumbling Malec n breakwater a six lane highway alongside the city s north shore links the districts of Central Havana and Vedado The victim of harmful salt spray the seafront drive is now more a seafront dive At its eastern end primary colored buildings a showcase of tragic splendor seem to fall apart before your eyes Havana s youth congregate along the Malec n on fine evenings flying kites necking swimming off the rocks and setting out to sea in giant inner tubes to fish Although most visitors will want to concentrate on historic and museum like Old Havana the newer districts provide a fascinating view of the areas where most people live and work The most interesting districts of New Havana are Central Havana and Vedado The former is a congested lower middle class barrio with few attractions for visitors although a walk along its dusty streets and crumbling fa ades can be an eye opening experience Vedado is the city s principal commercial and residential zone the epicenter of middle class Havana with parks monuments hotels restaurants theaters and the University of Havana Once the stomping grounds of the elite in the 1950s the suburb of Miramar today is home to the offices of rich foreign companies investing in Cuba and the diplomatic missions of foreign governments Central Havana Centro Habana Central Havana is a ramshackle residential and commercial area The city s main shopping street Calle San Rafael traverses it from the Parque Central westward This might be Havana at its least guarded While having a fascinating stroll here you can stop to have your nails painted or get a shave and a haircut all right on the pavement One of the country s new private markets has overrun Havana s small Chinatown at Calles Zanja and Rayo Amazingly even downtrodden Central Havana is being transformed by the presence of glittering dollar stores The neighborhood known as Cayo Hueso just behind the Malec n is a rough and tumble barrio once populated by cigar factory workers Today the main reason to visit is to check out Calle Hamel where the artist Salvador Gonz lez has dedicated himself to preserving the area s Afro Cuban culture The small alleyway the scene of a good many photo shoots is entirely done over in street art and graffiti Gonz lez has his studio here and on Sundays at around 1pm there are performances of Afro Cuban ritual and rumba Vedado Vedado had its heyday in the 1940s and 1950s when such gangsters as Meyer Lansky held sway in the Nacional Riviera and Capri hotels Such stars as Frank Sinatra and Ginger Rogers performed and American tourists emptied their wallets in glittering casinos The revolution put the lid on the nightlife by banning gambling and deporting the Mafiosi Save for the stately elegant Hotel Nacional see page 129 overlooking the Malec n the hotels here have now seen better days Vedado is Havana s most respectable business district as well as a leafy residential area spacious and orderly in comparison with Old and Central Havana Business is centered on La Rampa the name for Calle 23 from Calle L to the sea Opposite the tower block Hotel Habana Libre the Havana Hilton in pre revolutionary days is the Coppelia ice cream park At this institution locals queue for hours for the prized ice cream eating several scoops in one sitting or ladling them into saucepans to take home Hard hearted foreigners paying in dollars down their scoops in a cordoned off area Coppelia was instrumental in the award winning Cuban film Fresa y Chocolate Strawberry and Chocolate a daring film about freedoms and revolutionary fervor in contemporary Havana its title is a wry reference to the lack of choices of ice cream flavors indeed of all things in Cuba A short walk up the hill brings you to the University of Havana founded in the early 18th century a quiet attractive campus of neoclassical buildings English speaking students eager to meet foreigners are numerous here Directly east on Calle San Miguel between Calles Ronda and Maz n is the fine and surprising Museo Napole nico The mansion boasts not only Empire furniture but also a remarkable collection of Napoleonic memorabilia busts portraits and even his pistol hat and death mask from St Helena The house and contents were acquired by the state from a rich owner in 1960 In the same year the government acquired the Museo de Artes Decorativas at Calle 17 between Calles D and E Each room in this grand 19th century villa is furnished in a particular style English Chippendale Chinese baroque or Art Deco in the fabulous bathroom Vedado s top sight though is the Cementerio de Crist bal Col n Columbus Cemetery Massive marble mausoleums line the principal avenues of the cemetery a vast city of the dead established in the late 1800s Cubans come to pray and place flowers at the tomb of La Milagrosa The Miracle Worker who helps people in need It is said that she was buried with her infant at her feet but when their bodies were exhumed the child was found cradled in her arms Plaza de la Revoluci n The barren district known as Plaza de la Revoluci n is worth visiting only for a brief glimpse of the square of the same name a vast concourse where political rallies are held Hideous high rise ministry buildings erected in the 1950s by Batista and a giant tapering concrete obelisk looking like a rocket launch pad with a pensive Jos Mart at its foot provide the scenery The Ministry of the Interior building adorned by a giant iron sculpture mural of Che is where Fidel Castro supposedly punches the clock Miramar More attractive is the exclusive suburb of Miramar to the west The villas of the pre revolutionary rich expropriated by the state have now been divided into apartments or turned into offices But embassies along Avenida 5 still imbue the area with a leisurely privileged feel At the corner of Calle 14 the Museo del Ministerio del Interior has some intriguing exhibits relating to CIA espionage including code boxes concealed in briefcases decoding equipment and a transmitter hidden in a fake rock Don t miss the towering Russian Embassy between Calles 62 and 66 looking for all the world like a giant concrete robot Growing as an attraction literally is the Maqueta de Habana Calle 28 113 e Avenida 1 y 3 a scale model of the entire city in astounding 1 1 000 detail Havana is so expansive that a visit to the Maqueta can help organize the city s neighborhoods in your mind Havana s Outskirts Havana s suburbs are sprawling and grimy but they contain a couple of places associated with Ernest Hemingway that are magnets for those seeking to trace the Nobel Prize winner s life in Cuba From 1939 to 1960 he lived on and off in the Finca Vig a now the Casa Museo de Ernest Hemingway The sight is 11 km 7 miles southeast of Havana in San Francisco de Paula so you will have to take a taxi Visitors may not enter the graceful bungalow villa but by peering through windows and doors you can see all the rooms furnished as the writer had them covered in bullfighting posters and filled with more than 9 000 books including such titles as The Guide to Hunting and Fishing in Cuba You can roam the lush gardens searching out his motorboat the Pilar Hemingway kept the Pilar 10 km 6 miles to the east of Havana at Coj mar the probable model for the settlement in The Old Man and the Sea Next to a diminutive fort in the little town s old corner is a Hemingway bust looking out over the bay The writer frequented La Terraza restaurant nearby see page 138 worth visiting for its many photographs of Hemingway in action Still kicking after all these years is 98 year old Gregorio Fuentes Hemingway s fishing companion and the inspiration for Santiago the Old Man He s likely to be hanging out at La Terraza and for a few bucks or a few drinks will tell tales of his times with Papa Farther east approximately 18 km 11 miles from Havana the Playas del Este Eastern Beaches are less charming but a big draw for Cubans unable to afford much in the way of beach vacations These beaches are acceptable for a short break from city life but you are unlikely to want to spend your holiday here The long sandy beaches are excellent but often buffeted by winds Pinar del R o Province Due west of Havana is Pinar del R o province Cuba s westernmost region a finger of land with the Gulf of Mexico to the north and the Caribbean to the south It contains some of Cuba s most beautiful countryside among the lush Guaniguanico mountains and surrounding patchwork of lushly verdant fields vegas where the world s finest tobacco is cultivated In the beautiful Vi ales valley tobacco fields and ancient limestone formations produce spectacular scenery more reminiscent of Southeast Asia than the Caribbean In this resolutely agricultural region oxen tilling red earth fields and cowboy peasants guajiros on horseback are much more common than cars Residents of Havana might think of it as a poor backwater but the easy almost somnolent pace breathtaking countryside and welcoming residents of Pinar del R o make it one of Cuba s certain highlights There are beaches and excellent diving farther west near Playa Mar a la Gorda but for most visitors the star attractions are the irresistible town of Vi ales and its beautiful valley Many visitors take organized daytrips of the region from Havana hotels but an overnight stay in Vi ales overlooking the valley is highly recommended Start your explorations by driving west on the autopista highway linking Havana with the province s capital city of Pinar del R o About 63 km 39 miles along the highway a turnoff leaves the level palm dotted plains for Soroa where a richly endowed botanical garden nestles in the mountain foothills near a tired little tourist complex A guided tour reveals an orchid garden lychee and mango trees coffee plants and splendid specimens of jag ey and ceiba trees A restaurant in the villa of Castillo de las Nubes on a nearby mountain has stunning views At the end of the highway 175 km 109 miles west of Havana the small city of Pinar del R o is a bustling commercial center Along the main street Calle Jos Mart low rise neoclassical buildings in blues yellows greens and orange have a stately but dilapidated quality In backstreet houses men make homemade cigars you ll find a small interesting tobacco factory Francisco Donatien F brica de Tobacos housed in an old jail below the Plaza de la Independencia Visitors are welcome here and at the less picturesque Casa Garay Rum Factory on Avenida Isabel Rubio where they make a local rum liqueur called guayabita del Pinar The road southwest from the city to San Juan y Mart nez leads deep into tobacco s heartland the Vuelta Abajo where the world s greatest tobacco is grown Amid fields of big green leaves ripening in the sun and plantations covered in canvas sheets stand wooden tobacco barns Here leaves are hung on poles with a needle and thread and then dried turning from green to brown Some 27 km 17 miles to the north of Pinar del R o lies the most picturesque corner of Cuba The deeply green Vi ales valley is spattered with mogotes sheer sided limestone masses covered in thick vegetation Remnants of an underwater plateau that collapsed in the Jurassic period they are part of a geological formation at least 150 million years old Tobacco of slightly lesser quality than in the Vuelta Abajo grows here in a patchwork of fields and dries in boh os constructed with shaggy thatch Cigar chomping guajiros in enormous straw hats urge on their oxen while vultures swoop overhead At any time of day you can wander into the fields and meet the modest farmers who might smother you with hospitality cigars coffee and so forth and pose for photos At Casa del Veguero Carretera a Vi ales km 25 you ll find the grizzled farmer El Ni o whom the government has unofficially appointed the face of tobacco Cuba s Marlboro man Next to his farm on the road into Vi ales is a state owned tobacco and souvenir shop The best valley views can be had from either of its lovely and economical hotels Los Jazmines and La Ermita The sight at dusk is especially alluring The town of Vi ales is surprisingly spruce with a fetching arcaded main street and lovely rustic scenes down the back lanes Next to the paladar a restaurant in a private home and across from the Cupet gas station is a delightful botanical garden overseen by two elderly women whose father began planting the hundreds of species of plants Nearby a couple of local tourist sights on all the package excursions have curiosity value but little else One limestone mogote just west of town was painted by workmen dangling on ropes in the 1960s with a Mural de la Prehistoria Mural of Prehistory commissioned by Castro himself that is 120 meters 370 feet high and 180 meters 550 feet long The garish painting an exercise in bad judgment and sloppy execution depicts evolution from an ammonite to a dinosaur to advanced and presumably socialist Homo sapiens Just to the north of town the extensive Cueva del Indio Indian Cave was used as a hideout by Indians after the conquest A tour through the cave includes a brief ride on an underground river in a boat which would be emigrants once stole for an unsuccessful escape attempt to Florida Both mural and cave have decent tourist restaurants About 4 km 2 5 miles north of Vi ales the Cueva del Vi ales is a curious bar and disco carved out of a cave amazingly it s open 24 hours Cayo Largo and the Isle of Youth The two main islands in the Archipi lago de los Canarreos south of western Cuba could not be more different Cayo Largo is a tourist enclave where visitors are never more than a few yards from sugar white sands Yet it s an antiseptic place devoid of any Cubans except those who work there By contrast the Isle of Youth sees virtually no tourists except those at the rather isolated Hotel El Colony on the small island s southwestern tip who come exclusively for the superb diving at a nearby beach Cayo Largo an island 25 km 15 5 miles long and the most easterly of the Archipi lago de los Canarreos might be your Caribbean paradise if all you re looking for is a dazzling white beach and clear blue seas Other than the miles of beaches there s not much else of consequence here except mangrove scrub and half a dozen comfortable hotels with a full program of entertainment and watersports Turtles nest in the sand at one end of the island At the other you can go sailing diving or deep sea fishing or take a boat trip to Playa Sirena an incomparable strip of sand a 10 minute boat ride away where lobster lunches are available Cayo Largo with its captive tourist audience is considerably more expensive than the mainland Some package tourists spend the whole of their holiday on Cayo Largo Those with low boredom thresholds might consider coming for only a daytrip or for overnight trips on half hour flights from Havana and Varadero The Isla de la Juventud Isle of Youth is Cuba s largest offshore island some 50 km 31 miles in diameter but not its prettiest It is said to have been the location for Robert Louis Stevenson s Treasure Island pirates once buried their booty here The island received its jaunty name in the 1970s when as many as 22 000 foreign students mainly from politically sympathetic African countries studied here in no fewer than 60 schools The island fails to live up to its colorful past The number of foreign students has dropped to fewer than 5 000 and derelict boarding schools dot the monotonous countryside However there are plenty of virgin beaches to be discovered and in a slightly dingy cave at Punta del Este you can examine enigmatic symbols painted centuries ago by Siboney Indians For more accessible entertainment Nueva Gerona the island s little capital is moderately attractive with striped awnings along its smart pillared main street Just east of town the Presidio Modelo Model Prison is fascinating The dictator Machado built this copy of an American penitentiary in 1931 Castro and 26 of his rebels were sent here after the storming of the Moncada Barracks their ward and the cell in which Castro was kept in solitary confinement have been reconstructed Matanzas Province The province east of Havana largely flat sugar cane country was in the 19th century Cuba s most important cane producing region For today s visitors however the focus is on the big time beach resort of Varadero Cuba s biggest draw with opportunities for side trips to atmospheric time warped towns and to the swamplands of the south coast Varadero Varadero has enthusiastic proponents and equally passionate detractors among its visitors A long peninsula with many dozens of hotels and restaurants bars fast food caf s and grocery shops and more of each on the way Varadero doesn t feel much like Cuba at all The easy spending gringos here stick out like a sore thumb in this land of hardship and their isolation increases year after year Varadero is a package destination and plenty of visitors fly into it and never leave If you want to see and learn what makes Cuba a fascinating place though you ll need to escape for at least a couple of daytrips In towns around Cuba you ll meet tourists who like jailbird escapees rejoice at having gotten out of Varadero Still there are plenty of delighted folks for whom this is heaven a 20 km 12 mile long virtually uninterrupted white sand beach with shallow clean waters that are described immodestly by the authorities as the most beautiful in the world Varadero isn t a recent development by a government desperate for hard currency though officials are determined to see it become a faceless cash cow not unlike Canc n It was in the 1920s that Varadero first attracted millionaires who built palatial holiday villas Tourism proper began after World War II with the construction of casinos and such establishments as the Hotel Internacional Even the beach Varadero s best feature can be problematic Northern winds kick up with considerable frequency and lifeguards put out the red flags to warn of the dangerous undertow There is often a strong smell from the oil pumps on the resort s outskirts Prostitution and hassling are constant and blatant and other pests namely mosquitoes are a real annoyance Moreover the resort is spread out over 17 km 11 miles with no real center so you need transport to get around On the other hand Varadero has many very comfortable hotels most of them the results of international joint ventures open bars and an excellent range of watersports And unlike other parts of Cuba topless sunbathing is allowed here If you tire of the beach there are organized excursions to every conceivable point of interest on the island including Havana an hour and a half away Varadero occupies a long thin insular spit of sand with water on both sides and a bridge to the mainland Between Calles 25 and 54 there s something of a local community of Cubans with ancient Cadillacs parked outside rickety wooden bungalows The liveliest area is around Calles 54 to 64 with a shopping mall a host of restaurants and bars and the Retiro Josone a pretty park set around a palm fringed boating lake Spreading several miles farther east are the newest hotel complexes and also the restaurant Las Am ricas an opulent beachside mansion completed by the French millionaire Iren e Du Pont in 1930 Matanzas and C rdenas Though just spitting distance away these quintessentially Cuban towns are a world apart from Varadero Their poorly stocked shops dusty backstreets and primitive transport provide Varadero s package tourists with a convenient insight into everyday Cuban life before they re whisked back to their hotels Matanzas 42 km 26 miles west of Varadero is busy and grimy Lying alongside a deep bay it came into its own during the 19th century as the country s sugar capital On the leafy main square Parque Libertad the Museo Farmac utico is a wonderfully preserved chemist s shop founded in 1882 On a street running east toward the bay the Catedral de San Carlos is notable for its many murals some restored some badly in need of attention A little farther to the east impressive buildings on Plaza de la Vig a include the Palacio de Junco which houses a second rate provincial museum and the Teatro Sauto Constructed in 1863 the lovely theater has tiers of wrought iron boxes and a mural ceiling there are performances most weekends Las Cuevas de Bellamar a short distance to the south are Cuba s oldest tourist site The caves were discovered by chance in 1861 by a Chinese slave Tours in English take you down into a vast chamber for views of the many stalactites and stalagmites Fortunes have changed and not for the better for the town of C rdenas 15 km 9 miles east of Varadero Once the island s most important port for sugar exportation it s now a ramshackle place with long shopping lines and dozens of horses and carts streaming up and down its main street With its statue of Columbus the main square is elegant and the Museo Oscar Mar a de Rojas at Avenida 4 and Calle 12 houses a quirky varied collection of items from slaves manacles to a 19th century funeral coach and two fleas all dressed up to dance Zapata Peninsula The Zapata Peninsula is the largest wetlands area in the Caribbean flat as a pancake and covered in mangrove swamps and grassland plains Its protected wildlife includes crocodiles manatees and numerous species of birds Frankly though you are unlikely to see any interesting wildlife unless you take a guided bird watching trip from Playa Larga You can see penned reptiles at the crocodile farm at La Boca a popular tourist site where you can pose with a baby croc and taste crocodile steak A more appealing prospect is picturesque Guam a half hour boat ride from La Boca along an artificial channel and then across the vast Laguna del Tesoro Treasure Lake Legend has it that the Indians dumped their jewels into the water rather than surrender them to Spanish conquistadores Guam is a group of tiny islands connected by wooden bridges A few visitors stay in the thatched caba as see page 131 but most just come to wander along the boardwalk greet the ducks and egrets and have a meal The peninsula is best known however for its bloody role in clandestine political warfare South of La Boca you soon come to Playa Gir n site of the 1961 US led Bay of Pigs invasion see page 19 At irregular intervals along the often crab infested road are concrete memorials to those who died during the invasion There are two simple isolated bungalow hotel complexes on the bay one at quiet Playa Larga the other at Playa Gir n where the already scruffy beach is further spoiled by a concrete breakwater One major attraction however is the excellent Museo Playa Gir n which serves as an emotional memorial to the three day Bay of Pigs debacle Central Cuba Tourists usually eager to get to one end of the country or the other usually whiz through central Cuba The only tourist beacons are on or near the coasts in the south around Cienfuegos s bay and at Trinidad a gorgeous colonial gem and in the north at the small resorts of Cayo Coco and Guillermo and Playa Santa Luc a Elsewhere those who pause to explore can feel like goldfish in a bowl foreigners are still a novelty here Central Cuba comprises five provinces from west to east these are Cienfuegos Villa Clara Sancti Spiritus Ciego de Avila and Camag ey Each focuses on a provincial city of the same or similar name typically of some interest yet not likely to detain you for longer than a day The west has the best scenery found in the lush Sierra del Escambray mountains To the east of Sancti Spiritus towns are plunked down on unremittingly flat plains Here sugar cane as high as three men grows in abundance trucks trundle around with monster bundles of the stuff and chimneys of sugar cane factories poke skyward like cathedral towers In Camag ey the cattle ranch province rusty watermills punctuate the skyline and vaqueros cowboys slouch on horses with machetes and lassos at the ready Cienfuegos The best feature of the port city of Cienfuegos 250 km 155 miles southeast of Havana is its position set at the back of a large bay Despite the industry on its periphery the center is quite attractive with pastel colored neoclassical buildings Many travelers now stop off here on their way to Trinidad The focal point in town is Parque Jos Mart one of the grandest squares in the country Here you will find the monumental red domed government offices an early 19th century cathedral with a startling gold painted interior and a music hall casa de la trova see page 82 with whimsical flourishes Take a guided tour of the town s finest colonial building the Teatro Tom s Terry on the north side of the square Built in 1890 it was named after a rich sugar plantation owner from Venezuela The interior largely original has a lovely frescoed ceiling and a semicircle of tiered boxes and wooden seats Enrico Caruso and Sara Bernhardt once performed here and on weekends you may be able to catch a performance by one of Cuba s top ballet companies The Catedral de la Pur sima Concepci n built in 1870 is on the east side of the square It has an attractive interior with French stained glass windows depicting the twelve apostles The Prado is the town s principal thoroughfare a palm lined boulevard that takes you down to the spit of land protruding into the bay past smart waterside villas At the edge of Punta Gorda near the end of the Malec n Calle 37 is the Palacio del Valle This ornate palace now a restaurant was finished in 1917 its ceilings and walls are covered in patterned stonework At the mouth of the bay on the western side the Castillo de Jagua was constructed by the Spanish in 1732 long before the city s founding in 1819 to ward off pirates You reach the castle on a tiny ferry from the Hotel Pasacaballo on the eastern side of the bay Close to the hotel is the best beach in the area Playa Rancho Luna The Jard n Bot nico Soledad 18 km 11 miles outside Cienfuegos on the road to Trinidad is the oldest botanical garden in Cuba it dates to 1899 and one of the finest tropical gardens in the world Ask at the tourist office in Cienfuegos about guided tours of the gardens Trinidad The scenic undulating 80 km 50 mile road east from Cienfuegos to Trinidad skirts the foothills of the Sierra del Escambray Cuba s second highest mountain range The beguiling town of Trinidad the third of Diego Vel zquez s original seven settlements subsequently became rich through the smuggling slave and sugar trades Its sizable old town is endowed with marvelous Spanish colonial architecture and has been named by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site Cuba could package it as a time capsule it is the island s prettiest town and one of the finest preserved colonial cities in all the Americas Within easy striking distance of Trinidad are enough attractions to make a longer stay especially rewarding including the fine beach of Playa Anc n the lush Valley of the Sugar Mills and waterfalls and treks in the Escambray mountains Carefully restored mansions of the well to do have been turned into museums while art galleries craft shops and restaurants occupy additional lovely old buildings No traffic not even bicycles can cope well with Trinidad s wildly uneven cobbled street surfaces so peace reigns especially before and after the tour bus hordes arrive Few telltale signs of the 20th century have as yet encroached on this wonderfully somnolent outpost At night the old town is coffin quiet For the tranquillity alone it is worth staying one night or more in Trinidad The old town clusters around the Plaza Mayor an incomparably pretty square of painted railings fanciful urns greyhound statues and bright colonial buildings To the left of the comparatively plain church Iglesia de la Sant sima Trinidad the Museo Rom ntico is closed for restoration at least through 2001 The square s two other little museums both have attractive courtyards and cool interiors The Museo de Arqueolog a exhibits bones of Indians and slaves along with a few stuffed animals while the Museo de Arquitectura Colonial has examples of woodwork ironwork stained glass and other items culled from colonial houses in town A block north of the Plaza Mayor is the Museo Nacional de la Lucha Contra Bandidos National Museum of the Struggle against the Bandits housed in a former convent The bandits in question were counter revolutionary rebels who hid in the Escambray mountains during the 1960s The stupendous 360 degree view from the yellow belltower a landmark is the big draw A block south of Plaza Mayor on Calle Sim n Bolivar stands the grand Palacio Cantero built in 1830 Painted pillars scrolls shells pediments and drapes embellish the interior eclipsing the historical artifacts and old furniture that now form the Museo Municipal de Historia It has its own fine tower though climbing its rickety narrow steps can be a trial if a group has arrived there first The tiny Piro Guinart cigar factory on Maceo at the corner of Col n has only about 30 hand rollers and allows visitors to take a peek inside A block south of the Plaza Mayor are two streets completely given over to sellers of handmade lace and other crafts Aimless wandering is especially fruitful in Trinidad and since dozens of street names have changed and neither maps nor residents seem sure of what to call many of them roaming without a plan is the only practical solution Virtually every street is its own colonial treasure and feast for the eyes Near the bus station you might stumble across the musical septet Los Pinos jamming in the street just out of reach of kids playing stickball Farther afield southeast along Calle J M M rquez you ll find Ermita de Santa Ana a bricked up church overlooking the town on a hill where boys fly homemade kites Around Trinidad Trinidad s prosperity in the 19th century came from the fruits of 50 sugar mills nearby in the scenic Valle de los Ingenios Valley of the Sugar Mills like Trinidad a UNESCO World Heritage Site A mirador lookout with spectacular views is just 5 km 3 miles out of town Just 10 km 6 miles farther east is the Manacas Iznaga where you can explore a lovely colonial hacienda house and its startling rocket shaped Torre de Manacas Iznaga From the top of the tower the Iznaga family would keep watch over their slaves toiling in the fields If you don t have a car you can hire a private taxi for about US 12 roundtrip A special 18th century steam train used in the sugar trade traverses the whole valley for tourists if it is functioning it is a must The train leaves from Estaci n Dragones 1 km 5 8 mile from the city center at 10am and returns at noon Beach worshippers should head to Playa Anc n about 16 km 10 miles from Trinidad an excellent strip of white sand and clear waters Here you ll find diving at an offshore coral reef a good choice of watersports and two hotels popular with package tourists Again you can hire a taxi or pick up a bicycle rental give it a test ride first as many are so primitive that they would be scoffed at by any self respecting commuter from Hanoi or Beijing Another good beach and fishing excursion offered by Rumbos Tours is the daytrip to the tiny island of Cayo Blanco from Playa Anc n Sierra del Escambray More compact than the eastern and western ranges on the island the Sierra del Escambray Escambray mountains coated in luxuriant vegetation are arguably Cuba s most beautiful range and easily accessible Blessed with their own microclimate the mountains are a blessedly cool refuge from Trinidad To get to the Topes de Collantes national park take the road west of Trinidad for the steep 15 km 9 mile climb through dense forests of palms eucalyptus and pines You ll pass a health resort a Stalinesque complex that boasts decent facilities but lacks life Like rewards at the end of excellent day hikes there are two beautiful waterfalls Salto de Caburn at 62 m 203 ft and Salto Vega Grande Wear sturdy shoes as each is a steep trek of 4 km 2 5 miles along a narrow and often muddy trail You can swim in the chilly natural pools underneath the falls For Caburn park at the graffiti infested Casa de Gallo and hit the trail nearby Jeep excursions can be hired US 25 per person at the Rumbos tourism office in Trinidad Calle Sim n Bol var 430 There s a US 4 admission fee just beyond the Kurhotel health resort Sancti Spiritus Few tourists make it to this provincial capital and it isn t likely to detain you for more than a couple of hours Approximately 80 km 50 miles east of Trinidad is Sancti Spiritus one of Vel zquez s seven original townships However it s only likely to entertain you for an hour or two From the town s pleasant Plaza S nchez wander two blocks south to the main sight Iglesia Parroquial Mayor de Esp ritu Santo This venerable towered church has foundations from 1522 making it the country s oldest though the present stone church in fact was built in 1680 Nearby is the Puente Yayabo an early 19th century bridge that recalls Romanesque bridges in Europe From the river take the lovely twisting street Calle Llano a cobblestoned affair festooned with graceful colonial houses in soft pastels and iron grilles The nearby Museo de Arte Colonial Calle Pl cido Sur 74 is an 18th century palace with two peaceful courtyards and a succession of grandly furnished rooms suffused with a gentle light entering through stained glass windows Cayo Coco and Cayo Guillermo These offshore cays budding starlets of Cuban joint tourism initiatives with foreign companies are reached by a road carving through pineapple orchards and the town of Mor n which is not as idiotically named as you might think The road becomes a causeway across the Bah a de Perros it s so long 28 km 17 miles that you can t see the land at the far end as you set off Cayo Coco is named not for coconuts but for a bird the ibis as revealed in Hemingway s Islands in the Stream The author patrolled these shores in World War II on the lookout for Nazis Ibises and other wading birds often pink flamingoes can be seen balancing in the brackish waters around the principal causeway and a smaller causeway connecting the cay to Cayo Guillermo It s the superb impossibly white sandy beaches the intensely blue waters and the excellent fishing that draw travelers and there s not much else to distract you Both cays are covered in forest or thick undergrowth and there are no settlements whatsoever the only Cubans who visit are workers Plans are afoot to build hotels all along the 22 km 14 miles of shell shaped beaches on Cayo Coco but accommodations are currently limited A wide range of non motorized watersports are available to hotel guests diving and safaris are popular Cayo Guillermo s single hotel offers a similar gamut of watersports alongside the shallowest of waters If you hire a moped or Jeep from either hotel there are virgin beaches to discover Camag ey About 550 km 342 miles southeast of Havana Camag ey is a bustling but attractive and comfortable colonial city its population of 300 000 is Cuba s third largest Restrained old fa ades hide picturesque courtyards and there are some half dozen squares each boasting a crumbling and still functioning old church The cattle grazed plains of the province of Camag ey hold little water so long ago the citizens fashioned enormous earthenware pots to catch and store rainwater Called tinajones these still adorn many squares and courtyard patios The city s most famous son a general from the Ten Years War was born in 1841 at the Casa Natal de Ignacio Agramonte a handsome early 19th century mansion in the city center on Plaza de los Trabajadores The patriot is remembered through personal effects he met his death in battle in 1873 Visit La Merced church opposite to see peeling frescoes and the venerated objects stored in the crypt A dashing equine statue of Agramonte forms the centerpiece of Parque Agramonte just to the south The cathedral occupies one side of the park and the Casa de la Trova see page 82 around a floral patio features musical performances afternoon and evening A ten minute walk west down Calle Cristo brings you to a dignified 18th century church Santo Cristo del Buen Viaje Christ of Good Travels perfectly named for out of town visitors Behind the church is a great sea of crosses and marble saints in a picturesque cemetery church officials claim it is wholly unrelated to travels that didn t go so well A few blocks north the Convento de Nuestra Se ora del Carmen from the early 19th century was in a disastrous state in early 2000 though workers were busily rebuilding it Just enough of the structure remains to make plain that it would be stunning if carefully restored Camag ey s finest feature and marvelously restored is Plaza San Juan de Dios an angular old cobblestoned square surrounded by brightly hued single story buildings dating from the 18th century plus a lovely yellow church alongside a restored former hospital It s one of Cuba s most beautiful plazas A few blocks south near the river is an impressive agricultural market open every day and stocked with a surprising surfeit of meat and produce Playa Santa Luc a An hour and a half drive 110 km 68 miles from Camag ey on the north coast remote Playa Santa Luc a beckons sun worshippers with resort hotels strung along a particularly fine peninsular strip of sand Each hotel backs directly onto the beach A superb coral reef lies offshore and diving here is excellent Aside from a couple of roadside bars however nightlife is limited to hotel entertainment The only other drawback is the mosquitoes as voracious as anywhere on the island To counter the isolation of Playa Santa Luc a the tourist authorities offer a wide range of excursions including a rodeo at Rancho King deep sea fishing and boat and helicopter trips for days on the beach at such unspoiled cays as Cayo Sabinal and Cayo Saet a A bus service visits Playa Los Cocos some 5 km 3 miles away with sheltered aquamarine waters it s a strong contender for the title of Cuba s most beautiful beach Adjacent is La Boca a very small community of waterside shacks with fish restaurants Oriente The East Prior to the revolution the east of Cuba was a single province known simply as Oriente East and most Cubans still refer to the region with this name Oriente incorporates the post revolutionary provinces of Holgu n Granma Santiago de Cuba and Guant namo which are scenically and historically more interesting than most of central Cuba The stunning landscapes vary from the north coast s exuberant banana and coconut groves clustered round thatched huts little changed from Indian boh os to the towering peaks of the Sierra Maestra mountains and lush rainforest on the east coast Some of Cuba s best beaches lie on the north coast of Oriente within sight of the mountains The wars of independence began in Oriente in the 1860s and nearly a century later Castro concentrated his power base in the inaccessible Sierra Maestra There are stirring monuments and museums recalling these periods in Santiago de Cuba the latter dubbed Hero City for its many historic patriots The farther east you travel in Cuba the more Caribbean it feels Santiago de Cuba is renowned for its contributions to Cuban musical culture many of the greats of traditional sounds Tr o Matamoros La Vieja Trova Santiaguera and Eliades Ochoa among others all got their starts here It continues to be the one place in Cuba where infectious music is inescapable Holgu n Province Holgu n province begins bleakly around the busy capital but improves considerably as you travel north where the countryside is lusher Guardalavaca 60 km 37 miles from Holgu n is perhaps Cuba s prettiest resort ringed by banana plantations and facing a gorgeous beach backed by a forest of sea grape trees Watersports are excellent here and at the equally picturesque but isolated beach of Estero Ciego 2 km 1 2 miles west The resort s reputation is growing fast and the Cuban government envisions it one day competing with Varadero It is still in the early stages of development and thankfully extremely relaxed There are plenty of possibilities for excursions in the vicinity of Guardalavaca To the west is Bah a de Bariay which has a monument claiming Columbus s landing a fact contested chiefly by Baracoa farther east Beyond the bay is Gibara 27 km 17 miles north of Holgu n a captivating if sleepy little port town You can take a boat trip into the middle of Bah a de Naranjo to a simple aquarium where you can swim with the dolphins About 6 km 4 miles south of Guardalavaca on a hill amid a forest of lofty palms and thatched homesteads is Chorro de Ma ta the Caribbean s most important excavated Indian burial ground Of the 61 skeletons on display dating from 1490 to 1540 more than 200 were disinterred those in pre conquest graves lie in a fetal position while post con quest skeletons lie in a Christian pose outstretched with arms folded Thick banana groves coat the hillsides along the scenic 30 km 19 mile route south to Banes a tumbledown town of clapboard houses with corrugated roofs Fidel Castro was married at the church here in 1948 and the town s Museo Indo Cubano has fascinating finds from Chorro de Ma ta Santiago de Cuba Many visitors prefer Cuba s second city population 420 000 to the capital Santiago de Cuba 880 km 546 miles southeast of Havana is unpolished has few grand palaces and cannot compare with the colonial treasures found in Havana and Trinidad But it is unfailingly vibrant and seductive exuding a feel all its own Enclosed by the Sierra Maestra mountains Santiago can also be wickedly hot Santiagueros negotiate their hilly streets by keeping to the shady sides and they relax with little urgency on overhanging balconies Santiago is Cuba s melting pot with a friendly population of predominantly mulatto people descendants of Spanish French from Haiti Jamaicans and huge numbers of African slaves Afro Cuban traditions remain strong reflected in music walk down any street and a cacophony of sounds emanates from unseen sources and particularly in carnaval now a pale shadow of its former self due to lack of resources but still Cuba s best Founded in 1514 Santiago was the island s capital until 1553 It is regarded as a hero s city and locals are proud of the city s rebellious past Seminal events brought it center stage again during the 1950s when it assumed a major role in the revolutionary struggle The attack on Batista s forces at the Moncada Barracks in 1953 thrust Fidel Castro into the national limelight and it was in Santiago s main square that he first declared victory on 1 January 1959 An industrial city Santiago was hit especially hard when Cuba lost its Soviet support and Eastern bloc trade partners during the Special Period Perhaps for this reason hustlers and prostitutes work overtime here to zero in on tourists generosity Old Santiago The most atmospheric part of the city is Old Santiago Castro delivered his victory speech in the heart of the old town from the balcony of city hall on Parque C spedes More a plaza than a park the attractive square is a genteel place with tall trees gas lanterns and iron benches Old Santiago s grid of streets unfolds here a few blocks inland from the heavily industrialized harbor Parque C spedes is dominated by its twin towered cathedral A basilica was built on this spot in 1528 but what you see was rebuilt in the early 19th century after a series of earthquakes and fires On the west side of the plaza is the seriously handsome Casa Diego Vel zquez built in 1516 as the residence of the founder of Cuba s original seven villas The oldest house in Cuba and considered one of the oldest in the Americas it is in remarkable condition Housing the Museo Colonial its rooms overflow with fine period furniture and carved woodwork and encircle two lovely courtyards Guides touch everything in the house practically imploring you to sit on the furniture Try to disregard the poorly realized reproductions of original wall murals around the courtyard Across the square is the elegant Hotel Casa Granda which opened in 1914 Its terrace bar on the fifth floor affords excellent views of the cathedral towers and the city beyond East from the square Calle Heredia is the epicenter of Santiago culture and tourism The city s famous Casa de la Trova music hall which has hosted nearly all legendary Cuban musicians is the centerpiece of both Starting in midmorning a succession of groups perform every style of Cuban music from son and guarachas to boleros and salsa Evenings in the intimate open air space inside are the place to be Calle Heredia is lined day and night with artisans and souvenir sellers Down the street is the Museo del Carnaval a museum containing instruments photos and artifacts from Santiago s carnival It also usually has Afro Cuban music on weekends as does the Artex store up the street Also on Calle Heredia is the Casa Natal de Jos Mar a Heredia a cultural center and the birthplace of the Cuban poet who gave his name to this much trafficked street Nearby on Calle P o Rosado the Museo Emilio Bacard has wide ranging art archaeological and more recent historical collections including a small grotesque collection of mummies The museum in a shockingly grandiose neoclassic building on a beguiling little street is named for its benefactor and the town s former mayor whose family founded the Bacard rum empire which moved its headquarters and production to Puerto Rico after the revolution One of Santiago s most delightful people watching spots is Plaza Dolores a shady plaza lined with colonial era homes several of which are now curiously empty tourist restaurants Avenida Jos A Saco more commonly called Enramada is Santiago s main shopping thoroughfare whose faded 1950s neon signs and ostentatious buildings recall more prosperous and capitalist times Cobbled Calle Bartolom Mas also known as San Basilio just behind Heredia and the cathedral is a delightful street that leads to the picturesque Tivol neighborhood In Tivol you ll find the famous Padre Pico steps named for a Santiaguero priest who aided the city s poor Castro once roared fire and brimstone down on the Batista government here but today you ll find more pacific chess and domino players who have set up all hours tables on the steps Take the steps up to the Museo de la Lucha Clandestina the Museum of the Clandestine Struggle This excellent museum in one of the city s finest colonial houses focuses on the activities of the resistance movement under local martyr Frank Pa s Residents of Santiago were instrumental in supporting the revolution as were peasants in the Sierra Maestra From the museum s balcony there are tremendous views of Santiago and the bay and unfortunately of plumes of pollution rising up from ill placed industrial plants Not far from the museum is one of Santiago s best places to get sweaty in the evening The Casa de las Tradiciones a cultural center in a sweet little pink house Calle General Lacret 651 has live music and as much dancing as its tiny space will allow It s great fun and the locals usually outnumber the tourists Just west of the Padre Pico steps south of the train station is the one room C sar Escalante cigar factory unimpressive by comparison with other Cuban cigar factories but still an enjoyable place to visit and the Ron Caney rum factory The oldest rum distillery in the country it was established in 1838 by Don Facundo Bacard whose descendants fled the country in 1959 and nationalized the following year The rum produced here now goes under the name Havana Club You can visit only a small museum and bar Around Santiago A good place to get your bearings on the suburbs of the city is from the rooftop bar of the lavish hotel Cubanac n Santiago 3 km almost 2 miles east of the city s center In the near distance you can make out the yellow Moncada Barracks which Castro along with some 135 rebels attacked on 26 July 1953 The date is now a rallying cry and public holiday and the barracks have been converted into a school and museum The museum tells the story of the road to revolution using dozens of memorable photographs Also on display are various bloodstained rebel uniforms some of Fidel s personal effects from his time in the mountains and 26 Julio armbands sporting the name of the resistance movement that developed after the Moncada attack The bullet holes over the entrance are just for show North of Moncada beyond the bus station is the Plaza de la Revoluci n a frighteningly polluted open square at the corner of Av las Am ricas and Av de los Libertadores Massive spears thrust toward the sky in this monument to Antonio Maceo a hero of the war of independence who is seen riding triumphantly The fine Cementerio Santa Ifigenia just north of the harbor Av Crombel and Reparto Juan G mez is the resting place of many Cuban heroes Pride of place goes to the Cuban founding father Jos Mart in a vast octagonal mausoleum designed so that the tomb catches the sun throughout the day Look also for the tombs of C spedes and Frank Pa s Frank s as santiagueros refer to him is marked like many others with the Cuban flag and the flag of the 26 July movement In an impressive setting 7 km 4 miles from the city is the 17th century El Morro Castle surveying the harbor mouth from a commanding clifftop position Moated thickly walled and full of cannons drawbridges and passageways it is in excellent condition One room houses displays on pirates through the ages A guide will point out a torture room with a trap door in the floor through which uncooperative prisoners and slaves were reportedly dropped to the sea below That s not a terribly appetizing thought but the restaurant just beyond the castle also called El Morro has gorgeous views of the sea and some of Santiago s finest food it s a great place to get out of the intense sun The easiest way to get to El Morro is to hire a taxi which costs about US 15 roundtrip the driver will wait for up to a couple hours while you explore the castle and even eat lunch A place of great import and considerable beauty to all Cubans is the triple domed Bas lica del Cobre named after the nearby copper mines that rise out of the forested foothills 18 km 11 miles west of Santiago Cuban faithful make annual pilgrimages to the church to pay tribute to its statue of a black virgin the Virgen de la Caridad Virgin of Charity According to legend Cuba s patron saint was rescued bobbing in the sea in the 17th century by three young fishermen about to capsize in a storm With the wooden statue in their grasp they miraculously made it to shore Pilgrims often making the last of the trek on their knees pray to her image and place mementos and offerings of thanks for her miracles among them are small boats and prayers for those who have tried to escape Cuba on rafts The Virgen is on the second floor encased in glass and cloaked in a glittering gold robe You can take a taxi to El Cobre for around US 15 roundtrip although more adventurous sorts can hop a m quina vintage American automobile taxi or colectivo bus or truck out to the town and walk the mile or so to the church If you d like to stay overnight in this spectacular and deathly peaceful area there is a hostal Hospeder a de la Caridad behind the church where foreigners who abide by the strict rules can stay for a mere five pesos a night see page 133 East of Santiago is Parque Baconao a biosphere reserve spread over 40 km 25 miles The local dark sand beaches can be scrubby and the hotels themselves are isolated but there s lots to explore in the park and the Sierra de La Gran Piedra rise majestically above the coast A tortuous side road 12 km 7 miles east along the coast ascends the mountains to La Gran Piedra Big Stone where you can climb on foot for a bird s eye view of eastern Cuba About 2 km about a mile beyond a passable dirt track leads to Museo La Isabelica a 19th century coffee plantation finca country house with a workshop original furniture and a concrete garden where coffee beans were once laid out to dry Guant namo Province You can reach Cuba s remote mountainous far eastern region by continuing along the coast road from Parque Baconao on a memorable but good dirt track and paved road alternatively you can backtrack to Santiago The province has only one true tourist draw but it s a super one the magical little town of Baracoa The only reason to stop over in the unappealing city of Guant namo would be to visit the lookout point that is trained on the American naval base The dry cactus strewn landscape of the south coast begins to change as you follow the winding spectacular 30 km 18 8 mile road La Farola across the mountains to Baracoa 150 km 93 miles from Santiago a picturesque little village known for its local chocolate and coconut factories The tropical seaside town is surrounded by green hillsides covered with cocoa and coconut groves and all around are palm backed beaches and delightful sinewy rivers Named a UNESCO biosphere Baracoa has no fewer than ten rivers It s smack in the middle of the wettest region in Cuba the reason adventure travelers have their scopes trained on the town s rivers ripe for whitewater rafting That Baracoa was the first settlement to be established by Diego Vel zquez in 1511 making it the oldest colonial city in the Americas is not in doubt However locals also claim that Columbus first landed at this spot rather than near Gibara north and west of here as most historians believe They insist that Columbus planted the Cruz de la Parra Cross of the Vine in the soil on his arrival The cross is on display in Nuestra Se ora de la Asunci n the church on Plaza Independencia Whatever the truth of the matter carbon dating has established that the cross is more than 500 years old Baracoa though has so much going for it that any associations with Columbus are a bonus A good place to get your bearings is the hilltop Hotel El Castillo a former castle looking out over old red tiled roofs the town s oyster shaped bay and the landmark mountain known as El Yunque The Anvil so named on account of its singular shape On Calle Antonio Maceo you ll find people queuing for hot chocolate drinks in the baking tropical sun at Casa del Chocolate Opposite is a charming Casa de la Trova with rooftop performances In the main square is a striking bust of Hatuey the brave Indian leader who resisted early conquistadores until he was caught by the Spanish and burned at the stake Also wander along the Malec n the seaside avenue from the snug Fuerte Matach n an early 19th century fort that has a small municipal museum attached to the Hotel La Rusa named after a legendary and glamorous Russian migr e who over the years hosted celebrities from Che and Fidel to Errol Flynn In and around Baracoa are several dozen pre Colombian archaeological sites related to the three major Indian groups that inhabited the town at one time or another Only one native group the Yateras still exists Baracoa really shines the week of 1 April when heady street parties every night commemorate the date General Antonio Maceo disembarked at nearby Playa Duaba in 1895 marking the beginning of Cuba s War of Independence
