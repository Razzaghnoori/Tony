 Body by Mail Order The editors of Slate have in their wisdom decided to improve my life at minimal expense to them by giving me a budget to test health products available in catalogs Even though I pose as a cynic I harbor a belief in the transformative power of consumer goods despite the documented failure of any product with slim or anti in its name I looked for items that required no effort to use yet promised dramatic effects I also chose items that were either ubiquitous suggesting they had something going for them or unique the company must have locked up rights to a magical object I judged them not only on whether they delivered on their claims but also on whether I would buy one for myself or send one as a gift Feet I decided to work from the bottom up My first purchase was an odd looking shoe called the Arcopedico with a flat PVC sole and a knitted nylon upper Normally the first thing I do when I get home is kick off my shoes but these were so comfortable that I d realize late into the evening that I d forgotten to take them off After a few weeks of wearing my Arcopedicos almost exclusively what I thought was a permanently throbbing bunion has virtually disappeared There s one drawback to the Arcopedico When you wear them people will say things like Look at your shoes This is not a compliment They don t have the I ve never shaved my armpit hair aura of the Birkenstock but they are strangely elfin in appearance Would I buy a pair with my own money I already have Would I buy them as a gift Shoes are a peculiar gift but I ve recommended them to many people Purchasing information The Arcopedico is sold at many prices under various names I ordered them from the Norm Thompson catalog where they are called Mile Mates and sell for 54 plus 7 25 shipping They arrived in two days 800 547 1160 or www normthompson com Tush Moving up I settled on the Tush Cush Almost every catalog dealing with health or comfort carries this item It s a wedge shaped foam cushion with a U shaped piece cut out of the thicker end Sitting with your spine aligned over the hole is supposed to reduce pressure on your disks It has definitely made sitting in front of the computer easier and is far more comfortable than the throw pillows I previously used At 40 it s a pretty pricey piece of foam but it is a lot cheaper than an ergonomically correct chair It does not unfortunately firm your tush as you sit Would I buy one for myself Yes although I think all editors should in their own self interest give them to writers Would I buy one as a gift Yes Purchasing information I ordered the Tush Cush from the Harmony catalog for 40 plus 6 95 shipping It arrived in 10 days 800 869 3446 no Web site Wrists If you ve ever spent an evening plunging your wrists into ice water you are an easy mark for devices that promise to relieve carpal tunnel syndrome The wrist supporters sold in the Real Goods catalog feature the antibiotic of the New Age world magnets The Food and Drug Administration is skeptical of magnets ability to relieve pain but last December the New York Times published a story about a researcher at Baylor s Institute for Rehabilitation Research who found that magnets significantly reduced pain from post polio syndrome The wrist supporters I ordered were black neoprene with a metal brace and a flexible magnetic band I found them bulky and their primary benefit seemed to come from the heat retention qualities of the neoprene They were certainly no more effective than the nonmagnetic wrist stabilizers I d picked up at the drugstore At 35 95 each who would order just one they seem overpriced Would I order a set for myself No Would I buy one as a gift No Purchasing information 79 90 for the pair plus 10 95 shipping from Real Goods Because it takes up to two weeks for delivery I paid an extra 7 to have them in five days 800 762 7325 or www realgoods com Back Another widely touted panacea is a foam bedding material developed by NASA It is a thick heat sensitive material that molds to your body Catalogs extol its ability to induce an almost vegetative state depth of sleep The full mattress runs about 1 000 but Slate doesn t want its contributors to be that relaxed so I got the pillow from Brookstone for 95 On the box is a small sticker that states the pillow may have a particular smell that is completely harmless and will disappear after some time which sounds like something the proprietor of the Bates Motel might say The smell is sort of a cross between mildew and a petrochemical plant A salesman at a Brookstone store gave me this hint Roll the pillow up tightly several times a day to squeeze out the trapped air After about a week of doing this the odor had dissipated enough for me in the interest of my investigative duties to take a nap The pillow does let you sink into it while also giving support It didn t change the quality of my sleep as all the hype promised But it is really comfortable Would I buy one for myself Yes if I were feeling extravagant Would I buy one as a gift I ve already had to After letting my husband sleep on it one night he insisted on one of his own Purchasing information The pillow is available under a variety of names Pressure Relaxation Latex Foam BetterNeck Visco Elastic Pillows etc I bought the Tempur Pedic standard Swedish pillow from Brookstone for 95 plus 12 shipping Delivery is promised in five to seven days I picked mine up at their retail store 800 926 7000 or www brookstoneonline com Hair The Ionic Hair Wand exclusively from the Sharper Image is one of the most maddening products I ve used If it didn t actually work it would be a disaster The wand is a battery powered hairbrush that through ion conditioning claims to make the hair lustrous add body and remove odors and dandruff Along with magnets and Swedish foam ions make up the holy trinity of self improvement The first problem was that before I used it I rinsed it off and turned it back on apparently before it was completely dry It burned up in my hand The free replacement I got didn t shut off properly and melted the batteries in the base The third one has been working fine but you have to double check to make sure it s really off or it will exhaust its batteries in a matter of hours I have dry hair and with the Ionic Hair Wand I thought I could follow my hairdresser s advice to shampoo less often So I faithfully brushed my hair with the wand for the recommended two minutes a day day after day Miraculously eight days later my hair looked good and smelled clean How long could I go I m not French so I finally hit the shower Then I discovered one of the secrets to the wand is that it produces minute amounts of ozone which acts as a germicide However ozone is an air pollutant I decided I d rather just shampoo Would I buy one for myself No Would I buy it as a gift Only for people who refuse to wash their hair Purchasing information The Ionic Hair Wand is available from the Sharper Image for 39 plus 8 95 shipping It arrived in five days 800 344 4444 or www sharperimage com Skin My final stop was my crow s feet Even though I work at home alone the W H Auden look I ve been developing around my eyes has begun to bother me How could I pass up the Wrinkle Patch which promised noticeable improvement You leave these small expensive wing shaped patches on your worst furrows overnight and the same technology that makes nicotine patches work is supposed to deliver vitamin C it s not just for colds it s for wrinkles too to them In the interest of science I patched only one eye never thinking the thing would actually work By the fourth patch I realized I had to start catching up with the other side if I didn t want to wear a Phantom of the Opera mask on my wrinkled side I spoke to Dr Daniel Shrager a cutaneous pharmacology fellow at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia who did a six month study of the patches He said the 10 subjects who used them had a 30 percent to 40 percent decrease in wrinkle depth Yes I still have crow s feet But now I look only like Auden s younger sister Would I buy them for myself I m already on my third box Would I buy them as a gift You just can t give someone the Wrinkle Patch as a gift Purchasing information I ordered a box of 12 double patches from the SelfCare catalog for 50 plus 4 25 shipping They arrived in five days
