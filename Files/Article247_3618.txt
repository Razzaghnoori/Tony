 Barron s on AOL All Talk No News America Online s stock price dropped more than six points yesterday In itself this is of course hardly stop the presses news In fact given the volatility of Internet stocks it s more like the proverbial dog bites man story But the drop in AOL s price was noteworthy because it seems to have been provoked almost entirely by a negative item on the company that appeared in Barron s over the weekend The item was the centerpiece of the weekly column by Alan Abelson as bearish a commentator on Wall Street as exists today and a man who bears a special enmity toward Internet stocks all of which as far as I can tell he thinks are grossly overvalued In essence Abelson gave a short seller with a significant short position in AOL meaning that he s betting that the company s stock price will drop the opportunity to blast the company and explain why AOL s future is so bleak Now there s nothing wrong with quoting short sellers on companies even when they stand to make a great deal of money if their comments knock those companies stock prices down Short sellers are often founts of useful information and a certain kind of institutionalized skepticism seems to make them adept at sniffing out fraud and deception particularly in corporate accounting Certainly the financial press is full of more than enough fund managers touting the stocks they love for there to be plenty of room for short sellers attacking the stocks they hate What was striking about the attack on AOL though was just how obvious and devoid of new information it was We were informed that AOL s subscriber growth was slowing that the company was facing increased competition and that the advent of free Internet services especially abroad would hurt it We were also told that AOL was already suffering and would suffer more in the future from price cuts on the part of its American competitors and that soon the company would have to rescind the price hike it was able to push through last year The last point is of course pure speculation and it rests on two fundamental misconceptions The first is the idea that AOL is just like any other Internet service provider It s not because even though it s considerably more integrated with the Internet than ever before its proprietary services including above all its chat rooms continue to attract and keep consumers There s no evidence that AOL users are price sensitive The second misconception is the idea that Net users are willing to abandon their e mail addresses to save a few bucks This is just wrong E mail is the killer app of the Internet and it is a true source of customer stickiness It may be easier to change your e mail address than your street address but for a lot of us we d probably have to tell more people about the former than the latter In any case whether Abelson was right or wrong is not really as interesting as the fact that despite the familiarity of his critique it was able to drive down AOL s stock price by almost 7 percent in a single day No AOL investor who read that piece could have come away from it thinking Damn I was just wrong about the business I need to sell In other words there was no new information in the story that needed to be incorporated into the stock price Except of course that the existence of the story itself was information about AOL It s not that what was in Abelson s column drove the stock down The fact of Abelson s column hurt AOL because investors assumed that the fact of Abelson s column would hurt AOL The real question is whether in incorporating the reality of Abelson s column so quickly the stock market was efficient or inefficient Unfortunately this is almost a metaphysical question An efficient market is one that assimilates everything meaningful that can be known about a company into that company s stock price In the long run Abelson s critique of AOL is meaning less But in the financial news saturated and twitchy market we live in in the short run a piece blasting a stock is almost sure to move that stock which would seem to make it meaningful And so the snake ends up eating its own tail Illustration on Slate s Table of Contents by Mark Alan Stamaty
