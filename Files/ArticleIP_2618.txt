 Strikes Lies and Videotape Start with a union advocate celebrating a successful election late Hoffa style waving a can of beer and shouting We won baby Whoo hoo Proceed through a docudramatic depiction of an angry strike and a consumer boycott that forces the company to shut down End with a union member standing in front of a shuttered factory looking blitzed and saying I guess we showed them Is this the ultimate morning after video or what The video was produced by Fieldcrest Cannon Inc the Kannapolis N C based company that is the nation s largest manufacturer of furniture coverings and textile bath products and mailed to the homes of 5 500 Fieldcrest workers three days before they were due to vote in a union election just two weeks ago Not surprisingly the workers ended up voting against unionization by a slim margin After all no one likes people who yell Whoo hoo This was the second union election at Fieldcrest s factories in six years and the first in which the company faced UNITE the newly invigorated textile workers union that in the last 18 months has won 29 of 34 union elections in the South In 1991 Fieldcrest defeated an organizing drive by the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union but committed innumerable well OK more than 150 labor law violations in doing so which is why the 4 th U S Circuit Court of Appeals eventually got around to ordering a new election At this point Fieldcrest hopes UNITE will pick up and move away but that seems unlikely at best A week after the election union reps filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board against the company In fact perhaps in 2003 I ll get to write this story all over again Just once I d like to see the union say We lost fair and square and now it s over says Dick Reece the company s point man on labor relations But they never do Fieldcrest Cannon s history suggests that when it comes to keeping unions out of its plants it s a firm believer in the Malcolm X approach use any means necessary In the 1991 election among other things company supervisors interrogated employees about their attitudes toward the union dismissed 13 activists and refused to give union reps access to the company s factories More interestingly although this was not held to be a violation following the election Fieldcrest gave a 5 5 percent raise to workers at its nonunion plants plants that had just rejected the ACTWU while delaying a 4 5 percent raise for workers at its unionized plants This was Fieldcrest insisted a coincidence In all this Fieldcrest builds on a venerable tradition In a 1985 election at its plants the last paycheck employees received before the vote contained a note from the company telling them that the union was planning to take their money In a race at Cannon Mills that same year billionaire financier David Murdock who had purchased the mills from the Cannon family in 1982 promised workers that if they supported him by voting against the union he would support them by keeping the company independent The union went down in an overwhelming defeat at which point Murdock sold the company to Fieldcrest He had already dumped the workers pension funds into insurance annuities run by a company eventually seized by federal regulators And if you want to go way back In 1934 the Cannon family averted labor unrest by calling in the National Guard and decorating the tops of their factories with machine guns and barbed wire Even as most of North Carolina s textile workers walked out Cannon workers stayed put Seen in this context what s a mere video threatening plant closings But Fieldcrest has not kept all except three of its plants union free simply by pushing the limits in fighting organizing drives The company also has benefited from the special obstacles that its Southern location adds to those that have eroded labor s strength nationally Every state in the South is a right to work state which means that closed shops and union shops are illegal Much of Southern industrialization took place outside metropolitan areas encouraging development of a company town mentality and hindering industry wide organizing Kannapolis was owned schools houses stores and police force by the Cannon family until after World War II For most of this century in fact the history of unionism in the South was one of broken strikes employer violence and unkept promises In 1921 for example workers at Cannon Mills walked off the job They returned after two and a half months when the National Textile Workers Union failed to come through with the food supplies it had promised them In 1946 the AFL CIO launched Operation Dixie an abortive attempt to organize the entire region but it collapsed when unions proved more interested in raiding other unions for members than in organizing new workers There s little evidence that an ingrained conservatism among Southern workers has kept unions out But it certainly seems true that the absence of a tradition of Southern unionism has made it easier for employers to play on fears about union corruption and greed and to suggest that plant closings are an inevitable consequence of unionization The question of course is whether the employer should be able to play on those fears The National Labor Relations Act embodies a rather romantic view of democracy in which workers coolly consider both sides of the unionization issue and then vote The problem is that the NLRA in a curious way saw workers making that decision primarily by talking among themselves The act envisioned the employer standing to one side as the vote was held perhaps expressing its opinion but certainly not playing an active role in shaping the debate which is simply to say the NLRA was designed to encourage unionization When employers want to play that active role as of course they all do all sorts of complicated questions come into play If for example a company wants to argue that unionization will raise labor costs to the point where it will be forced to shut down operations should it be allowed to do so Is it coercive for people with supervisory authority to ask workers how they plan to vote or for management to give anti union speeches on company time Answering these questions requires a constant redefinition of the difference between an argument and a threat And while there are many situations like the dismissal of workers for organizing where this difference seems inarguably clear elsewhere things are fuzzier And Fieldcrest has used that fuzziness to great advantage It has in the words of UNITE s Michael Zucker banged on workers fears To say it s banged on them of course is not to say the fears are not real The striking thing about workers comments after the vote was how many of them mentioned the possibility of the company shutting down its operations The mills in North Carolina exist because textile capital migrated from the Northeast in pursuit of low wages no unions and cheaper materials It s easy for today s textile workers to imagine that the Caribbean or the Far East is the next stop on this trip As it happens there s no evidence at all that Fieldcrest Cannon is contemplating moving manufacturing abroad or outsourcing But in this case I guess videotape speaks louder than words
