                    Background        Microarray technologies provide the means of measuring        the expression of thousands of genes or proteins        simultaneously This revolution brings new perspectives for        the study of expression networks and their regulation        potentially providing valuable insights into the molecular        mechanisms underlying disease   Increasingly accessible        microarray platforms allow the unrestrained and rapid        generation of large expression datasets As large volumes        of data are being generated the need for datamining        programs that provide the means to manage normalize        filter group and visualize expression data expands These        tools help to identify subsets of genes whose expression        changes significantly and organize them according to their        expression profiles Although necessary this type of        analysis does not reveal the biological implications        encrypted in expression data Indeed the evaluation of the        functional significance of large heterogeneous and noisy        groups of genes constitutes the real challenge for        microarray users          A further problem is that the wealth of knowledge        accumulated after decades of biological research has        resulted in a considerable narrowing of research fields As        a consequence indepth knowledge of gene function        possessed by highly specialized investigators is biased and        limited to relatively small subsets of genes that become        the focus of the expressiondata analysis The definition        of functional classes and improved access to information        associated with individual genes partly makes up for this        lack of perspective However information about gene        function is primarily contained in the  million articles        indexed in the Medline database Evaluating the functional        associations that might exist among large groups of genes        from this huge volume of literature is not feasible in a        time frame compatible with the pace at which the data can        be generated Limitations in our capacity to explore the        functional dimension of microarray expression are one of        the major impediments to the optimal exploitation of this        powerful technology Surprisingly only a few groups have        previously addressed this shortcoming            We describe here how a literaturederived term frequency        database can be generated and mined through the analysis of        patterns of occurrences of a restricted subset of relevant        terms This literature profiling produces a coherent        picture of the functional relationships among large and        heterogeneous lists of genes and should enable the        development of tools for rapidly extracting meaningful        knowledge from large microarray expression databases                    Results and discussion                  Literature indexing          The method requires articles related to each of the          genes included in the analysis to be extracted This is          done by querying the Medline database though PubMed            using appropriate search strings We chose to retrieve          entries containing the official gene name abbreviation          or aliases in the title field Information about gene          nomenclature can be found on the website of the Human          Gene Nomenclature Committee HGNC   Using this          source we created a database containing URLs in the          PubMed query format for the more than  known human          genes defined by HGNC for example for protein kinase C          eta the URL found in the database is          httpwwwncbinlmnihgovhtbinpostEntrezquerydbformtermPRKCHBtiDORPKCLBtiDORPRKCLBtiDORproteinkinaseCetaBtiD          pointing a web browser to this address gives the           entries that would have been retrieved by typing the          following search string PRKCH ti OR PKCL ti OR          PRKCL ti OR protein kinase C eta ti URL entries          are indexed by GenBank   and LocusLink   IDs and          can be downloaded as a Microsoft Excel table see          Additional data files The search for relevant          literature for each individual gene is complicated by the          fact that the same gene can have many different names          associated with it and that the same name or abbreviation          can have different meanings A rapid scanning of the          search results is useful for the identification and          removal of inappropriate search strings see below          For each gene the result of the query is downloaded          in XML format Abstracts are then extracted from the file          by means of a macro running on Microsoft Excel and saved          as a new file to be used for text analysis          Methodologies described in this report were tested on          a list of  genes see Additional data files derived          from a subset of conditions belonging to a sample          geneexpression dataset generated to study the          transcriptional response of professional          antigenpresenting cells to pathogens using highdensity          oligonucleotide arrays D Chaussabel R Semnani M          Mcdowell D Sacks A Sher and TB Nutman unpublished          observations We were able to find at least five          relevant records in the Medline database containing          abstracts for  out of the  genes listed Another           genes had at least five records with accompanying          abstracts when their generic name was used as a search          string for example interferon induced transmembrane          protein instead of interferon induced transmembrane          protein                           Text analysis          Word occurrence in abstracts is determined for each          gene by analyzing the contents of Medline entries nearly           in the example presented here This parameter          describes the relative frequency of abstracts containing          a given word for example  of the abstracts indexed          for the gene           GADDB contain the word          proliferation                          Data filtering          Occurrence values are assigned to every unique word          found in the literature analyzed resulting in tens of          thousands of entries for each gene A vast majority of          these terms are either found ubiquitously for example          if because cell identified are present in most          abstracts of most genes or very rarely present in very          few abstracts of few genes and therefore are of very          little use for the definition of genespecific term          occurrence profiles However a third category of terms          can be found in most abstracts of very few genes and          convey relevant information about these genes These          terms are characterized both by high occurrence values in          genespecific collections of abstracts and a low baseline          occurrence in the literature          An example is given in Figure  where terms present          in more than  of the abstracts related to the gene          RANTES are plotted on the           y axis Baseline occurrence was          determined by averaging the values found for these terms          for genes picked at random from all known human genes As          shown Figure  when sufficient genes are used to          constitute the baseline averaged occurrence values          become stable In this example we found that most of the          terms for which baseline occurrence was less than           conveyed significant information on that gene for          example infection secreted chemokine          inflammatory Some production regulated seemed          to be less meaningful however and terms with higher          baseline occurrence were nonspecific for example          induced response activation important As          expected terms such as a we protein or cells          had the highest baseline occurrence    and           respectively          The terms found in thousands of abstracts retrieved          for the list of genes considered in this report were          filtered systematically using several criteria The first          step consists in removing terms commonly found throughout          the scientific literature A baseline occurrence for each          term was determined by taking the average occurrence of          the set of  randomly picked genes as described in          Figure  In our example terms with a baseline          occurrence of more than  were categorized as          undiscriminatory and eliminated Table  In the second          step termoccurrence values for each gene were compared          to the baseline We arbitrarily set the difference          cutoff between gene term occurrence and baseline          occurrence at  see Table  A term can only be          useful in defining relationships among genes if it is          shared by at least two of them For this reason only          terms found to pass the filter for at least two of the          genes considered for analysis are further retained see          Table  For the set of genes used to illustrate the          technique Table  and see Additional data files           terms out of nearly  were retained after          application of these filters Stringency of term          selection can be adjusted at the users convenience by          modifying the filtering parameters For instance a          greater number of relevant terms might be retrieved by          lowering thresholds insuring term specificity at the          cost of increasing the level of noise lessrelevant          terms in the list of terms When lists of terms become          too noisy the manual removal of irrelevant terms can be          considered                          Clustering analysis          Isolating useful information out of tens of thousands          of irrelevant terms closely resembles the task of sorting          through geneexpression data produced by microarray          technology But the parallel is not restricted to the          filtering of data as we also found that tools used for          the analysis of gene expression could be applied to          termoccurrence values to identify groups of genes          sharing similar literature profiles The vocabulary          defined after successive rounds of filtering is used to          create a termbygene array of termoccurrence values          relative to each individual gene Relationships among          genes are then assessed by hierarchical clustering          analysis using a software package originally created for          the analysis of geneexpression data   The resulting          clustergram shows the grouping of genes according to          patterns of term occurrences Figure  Genes are          grouped on the basis of similarity between          termoccurrence profiles The nature of the relationships          found through the analysis of term occurrences in          abstracts can be determined by browsing this diagram The          relationships among genes listed in Table as determined          through the analysis of literature content are          represented by the dendrogram detailed in Figure  In          this tree diagram the distance between nodes is inversely          proportional to the degree of correlation found between          the genes The main ramifications of the tree define the          predominant groups identified by this analysis To help          understand the nature of the associations found among          groups of genes occurrence values of a limited number of          terms used in the analysis are shown opposite the          dendrogram Figure           It is notable that the functional groups identified in          this list of genes significantly induced after infection          of professional antigenpresenting cells are related to          immune responses Genes for transcription factors that          control inflammatory responses and programmed cell death          make up the first gene cluster considered Figure           color coded in blue These genes have abstracts with a          frequent occurrence of terms such as TNF the          inflammatory mediator tumor necrosis factor death or          apoptosis The largest group is composed of genes          associated with the term interferon also IFN and          IFNalpha color coded green Figure  indeed STATs          are factors specifically required for interferon          signaling Interferon regulatory factors IRFs trigger          the interferon response whereas other members of the          group are effector antiviral molecules for example          ISG ISG sometimes associated with terms such as          virus infected or infection OAS Mx Mx The          next group Figure  red is composed exclusively of          chemokines Interestingly the analysis of abstract          contents was able to distinguish monokines belonging to          the CXCR family SCYB chemokines IP IP MIG          associated with CXC CXCR monokine or MIG from          CC chemokines SCYA chemokines LARC RANTES MCP          MCP The last group Figure  violet is composed of          genes involved throughout the MHC class I          antigenpresentation pathway Specifically these genes          encode proteins involved in the degradation of proteins          into peptides by the immunoproteasome PSMAs PSME          antigenic peptide loading and transport ABCB also known          as TAP for transporter associated with antigen          processing  and presentation at the cell surface          HLAF BM It is notable that one of the closest pairs          formed consists of a receptorligand pair VEGF and NRP          Figure  Overall these examples illustrate the          concept that appropriate terms taken out of context can          still convey valuable information and can be used to          rapidly explore and assess the biological meaning of          complex datasets                          Analyzing patterns of term occurrence in groups of          genes with different degrees of association          The basis for analyzing expression patterns is the          assumption that genes under common transcriptional          control are involved in similar processes    This          notion provides a rationale for developing tools to          evaluate the existence of functional relationships among          groups of coregulated genes In the group of           coinduced genes in our example we found that  terms          were shared by at least two genes according to our          filtering criteria with as many as  positive          associations between genes and terms defined as          exceeding baseline occurrence by  For comparison          analysis of the literature relative to  genes picked          randomly from all known human genes indexed in the          LocusLink database only retrieved  shared terms and           associations Figure b This is in contrast with the           shared terms and  associations found when  genes          are picked randomly from a homogenous functional group          all known cytokines and chemokines and their receptors          Figure c As shown by this example the number of          associations found by literature profiling correlates          with the likelihood that a group of genes is functionally          related                          Conditions for the formation of meaningful gene          clusters          We sought to identify the critical elements leading to          the formation of clusters of related genes described in          Figure and represented in Figure ausing similar color          codes The terms making up each genes literature          profile include gene names or words making up gene          names To meet our filtering criteria each term must have          had a high occurrence in the literature of at least two          of the genes covered by the analysis To test the          relative importance of such terms for the analysis gene          names and termoccurrence values were clustered without          gene names for example RANTES IP NFkappaB STAT          IRF or terms included in gene names for example          interferon proteasome regulatory monokine As shown          in Figure b clusters were largely conserved Gene names          or terms included in gene names are therefore not          necessary for the formation of meaningful clusters but          may have a significant role terms such as NFkappaB or          interferon which are found throughout the literature          on genes involved in these pathways will generate valid          associations Similarly the discovery of references to          the chemokine RANTES in abstracts relevant to different          genes suggests the existence of a functional link          Indeed the literaturemining tool developed by Jenssen           et al   is based on a gene          cocitation network and therefore relies entirely on the          same type of association          To exclude the possibility that groups of meaningful          genes may arise by using a sufficient number of          cooccurring terms we permuted termoccurrence values          for each gene before clustering Figure c The fact          that this treatment results in a complete loss of the          original hierarchy proves that the formation of          meaningful groups of genes cannot be attributed to a          clustering artifact                          Literature profiling of large gene lists          The size of the list of genes that must be analyzed          can vary greatly from one microarray experiment to          another In an ideal setting the analysis of          geneexpression patterns groups coregulated genes into          small subsets In most cases however partitioning of          the data on the basis of expression is impaired by a          small number of conditions or straightforward expression          profiles As a consequence microarray experiments often          generate lists of several hundred genes for which          biological meaning must be sought The use of a mining          technique such as the one described here will be most          valuable in this context In this section we give two          examples of literature profiles generated from published          datasets          When a large number of genes are analyzed the level          of noise lessspecific terms can be more important and          filtering criteria were adjusted accordingly The fixed           cutoff we used in our previous example can be too          high for a gene represented by hundreds of abstracts but          can also be relatively low when considering a gene for          which only five abstracts could be retrieved To take          such discrepancies into account we optimized the cutoff          for each gene as follows cutoff            t             k            n  where           t is the minimum threshold           k is a constant and           n is the number of abstracts          retrieved for a given gene           t and           k must be set arbitrarily and will          directly influence resolution and noise levels For these          examples we chose           t   and           k   therefore cutoff values          for genes represented by  or  abstracts are  and           respectively The geneterm specificity was further          improved by adding a filter that removes terms present in          the vocabulary of more than half of the genes considered          for example bound contained clones putative          process Such a filter is particularly appropriate for          large datasets as the chance of lessspecific terms          being retained by other filters increases with the number          of genes analyzed The functional heterogeneity inherent          in large gene lists eliminates the risk of relevant terms          being removed by this filter Similar themes were          identified when the cutoff applied in the previous          example is used instead However increasing the          stringency of the filter resulted in a tighter clustering          of large datasets In these examples we eliminated          redundant singularplural forms by averaging          termoccurrence values derived from both entries          considering for instance lipoprotein and          lipoproteins as a single entity          In the first dataset a list of nearly  genes and          expressed sequence tags ESTs that constitutes the human          macrophage common transcriptional program induced upon          bacterial infection   is analyzed Sufficient          publications could be retrieved for  of these genes          see Additional data files Patterns of term occurrence          appear once gene names have been rearranged by          hierarchical clustering Figure  The existence of          functional relationships between genes can be inferred          from the visual analysis of the resulting clustergram          Figure  top left panel Putative relationships are          then confirmed by investigating the few relevant          publications pinpointed by the analysis of literature          profiles          Several groups of genes involved in different aspects          of the immune response to an infection were uncovered by          literature profiling interferon response chemotaxis          inflammation Figure df and g respectively But          many other functional groups were also identified as          follows          As indicated by their names lipoprotein lipase LPL          and lowdensity lipoprotein receptor LDLR genes are          involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism and were          logically associated by literature profiling Figure a          Interestingly the CDlike  antigen alias          thrombospondin receptorlike   CDL clustered          tightly with LPL and LDLR and shared with these genes          terms such as lipoprotein lipid or cholesterol          Figure a This association was validated by browsing          the literature relevant to CDL whch contains reports          showing the role of this molecule as a receptor for          highdensity lipoprotein          The two major groups of proteinases involved in          extracellular matrix degradation  serine proteinases and          metalloproteinases  have been grouped by literature          profiling Figure b urokinase plasminogen activation          cascade UPA PLAUR SERPIN and matrix          metalloproteinases MMP MMP MMP Both families          are activated during inflammation and as indicated by          their literature profiles are involved in tumor invasion          and metastasis    In the context of a bacterial          infection these proteins enable activated macrophages to          cross endothelial barriers and gain access to the site of          the infection    other terms shared by these          genes are migration vascular endothelial An          extracellularmatrixbinding protein SPARC secreted          protein acidic cysteinerich alias osteonectin was          also associated with these proteinases by literature          profiling SPARC can increase endothelial permeability          and is known to participate in tumor angiogenesis and          extravasation   Interestingly this protein has not          been reported as being upregulated upon cell infection          and its possible role in macrophage transendothelial          migration was never addressed This example illustrates          how functional relationships that could not be deduced          from gene names were uncovered through the analysis of          patterns of term occurrence matrix metalloproteinases          MMP   and urokinase plasminogen activator UPA          SPARC are matrixinteracting molecules involved in tumor          invasion and metastasis          The cluster shown in Figure cis composed of members          of two genes families adenosine receptors ADORA and          ADORAA and purinergic receptors PRX and PRX          Indeed although not evident from its name PRX acts as          a receptor for a phosphorylated form of adenosine          adenosine triphosphate          Another interesting example where nonobvious          associations were revealed by literature profiling is          shown in Figure e This group consists of genes for          which related abstracts have in common terms such as          disorder allele recessive or autosomal This          shared vocabulary is indicative of an association that          given the diversity of genes implicated would have          undoubtedly been overlooked by the mere examination of          the gene list Indeed a rapid search of the Online          Mendelian Inheritance in Man database OMIM   for          genes associated with the terms severe and disorder          confirmed that mutations of GALC LAMB GJB JAG          TGFBI LPL and LDLR were the origin of serious disorders          Krabbe disease Herlitz junctional epidermolysis bullosa          autosomal dominant deafness  Vohwinkel

previous example gene          expression in this case was not measured for a purified          cell population but for heterogeneous tumor tissue This          fact is reflected in the analysis of literature profiles          as groups of genes could be found to be associated with          brain tissues Figure f for example HPCA          hippocalcin SYP synaptophysin GRIK glutamate

      potentially important role in the regulation of cell          growth as TAXBP CREB and TARBP possess          antiapoptotic tumor suppressor and oncogenic activities              respectively

these examples demonstrate the power          of the analysis of literature profiles in revealing          unsuspected functional relationships in large and          heterogeneous lists of genes                          Benefits and limitations          The mining technique we describe is designed to guide          the interpretation of complex expression databases Key          aspects of the technique contributing to the fulfillment          of this goal include The method is independent of the          users knowledge of gene function and can therefore be          used to identify promising findings rapidly in an          unbiased way The method renders the data intelligible by          bringing functional coherence to large and heterogeneous          lists of genes The terms used as criteria to explore          relationships among genes differ with the composition of          the group of genes considered for analysis Because the          basis for classifying genes is flexible associations          made between them will change with the context in which          they are found The technique is based on the analysis of          the content of scientific publications and constitutes a          contemporary solution for the exploitation of swelling          literature resources by providing investigators with          leads for further indepth investigation of the          literature Termoccurrence data derived from literature          profiling can be used to annotate heterogeneous gene          lists thus adding to the value of this technique as a          visualization tool Figure           The implementation of our mining technique as a          computational tool is hindered by the need to retrieve          the relevant literature reliably for each gene included          in the analysis Indeed genebygene editing of          automatically generated PubMed query strings is often          required to insure low levels of false positives among          the abstracts retrieved Several names and abbreviations          are often associated with a single gene but are used in a          different context for example to designate drugs          bacterial strains or medical procedures or they belong          to the English vocabulary eg Wars           tryptophanyltRNA synthetase Sky  TYRO protein          tyrosine kinase God  Godzilla Short acronyms are          especially problematic for example CT the          abbreviation for calcitonin can be found in the title          of over  abstracts of which only  contain the          term calcitonin Parsing issues that are caused by a          confusing gene nomenclature can however be avoided when          curated literature resources are available for example          the Yeast Literature Database            The reduction of the information contained in the          literature is also limiting Words taken out of their          context convey useful but limited information and this          superficial assessment of the literature can only be used          to direct further investigation The selection of terms          through rounds of filtering inevitably results in the          selection of irrelevant terms false positives and          pertinent terms will also be lost false negatives          Reviewing the terms and literature that prompted the          definition of relationships among genes can easily          identify falsepositive associations Falsenegative          associations are harder to identify and can only be kept          to a minimum by combining existing approaches designed to          assess the biological significance of large sets of          genes Like the other literaturemining approaches          previously published our technique cannot be expected to          give definitive answers but nonetheless provides          investigators with muchneeded solutions for the          functional evaluation of complex microarray data                     Relatively few groups have attempted to resolve the          bottleneck constituted by the inability of highly          specialized investigators to assess the existence of          relationships between genes in a highthroughput fashion              Jenssen           et al   analyzed literature          contents to create a genetogene cocitation network          revealing associations between genes Our technique          differs fundamentally from Jenssen           et al s method in that it is          based on term occurrences in indexed abstracts as opposed          to gene name cocitation frequencies This approach          allowed us to take advantage of the powerful algorithms          used for the analysis of patterns of gene expression          Also this literatureprofiling method should benefit          from ongoing efforts to improve visualization tools          clustering techniques and associated statistics             Another major advantage arises from the capacity to          include any of the terms present in abstracts resulting          in a considerable increase in the number of potential          relationships generated Finally the number of genes          covered by this type of analysis is also much greater          thanks to the low requirements in the volume of          literature associated with each gene          Textmining software is also available commercially          Omniviz   one of the most advanced solutions for the          analysis of the scientific literature can group          publications or patents or any other kind of text          entries associated with a common theme for example          Alzheimers disease through the analysis of their          content In contrast our mining algorithm was          specifically designed to group genes instead of          publications through the analysis of the content of          their associated literatures This conceptual difference          makes the techniques distinct from one another Our          approach requires the literature to be indexed for each          gene and treated separately throughout the analysis We          also filter terms using stringent criteria a critical          step that allows the analysis of patterns of term          occurrences by hierarchical clustering                          Applications and perspectives          This report constitutes a proof of principle on the          feasibility and use of literature profiling for          highthroughput research Although room exists for          improvements in indexing filtering and clustering          strategies the methodology described provides a          blueprint for the development of computational tools that          can rapidly assess literature content to guide the          biological interpretation of complex expression data          Because this literaturemining technique analyzes data at          a high level it is independent of the platform used by          investigators for example spotted cDNA or highdensity          oligonucleotide arrays protein arrays and could find          applications in both genomics and proteomics          research          In addition to providing help to explore large          expression datasets occurrence values displayed for          certain terms in the format used in Figure can be used          to annotate large and complex lists of genes providing          readers with information on gene function In our          example giving occurrence values for terms such as          apoptosis endothelial interferon inflammatory          chemoattractant or histocompatibility provides a          naive reader with insight into the function attributed          in the literature to each of the listed genes          Associating literature profiles with geneexpression          data could be used for orienting gene discovery It is          believed that coregulated genes share similar promoters          andor are involved in similar biological processes            Using this principle of guilt by association functions          attributed to known genes can be inferred for unknown          genes sharing similar expression profiles In the first          example used in this report see Additional data files          many of the genes were identified using literature          profiles as being related to interferon virus and          infection and thus it can be assumed that some of the          genes and ESTs that were not included in the analysis          from lack of literature see Additional data files are          also associated with these terms For instance among the          coregulated ESTs is the Homo sapiens cig mRNA partial          sequence AF which was obtained using          differential display analysis to identify sequences for          which transcription is induced following cytomegalovirus          infection   Another coregulated but poorly studied          gene is secreted and transmembrane  U which          resembles a cytokine or growth factor in its broad          structural characteristics   This gene was later          reported to be the ligand for the surface antigen CD and          found to be capable of activating NK cells   which          constitute the primary source of IFNgamma during early          responses to infection   In both examples the link          to interferon virus or infection can only be          suspected but certainly deserves attention because these          sequences are regulated together with genes known to be          involved in the biology of interferons                            Conclusions        The sequencing of whole genomes and the introduction of        technologies capable of measuring simultaneously the        expression of thousands of genes provides biological        research with a global perspective that opposes the trend        over the past few decades of the narrowing into highly        specialized research fields But the optimal exploitation        of these invaluable resources by researchers necessitates        the development of mining tools to explore and interpret        data in a time frame compatible with the impressive rate at        which they are generated Individual knowledge is built on        associations made between the information we acquire from        the literature The method we describe here mimics this        learning process by associating meaningful terms found in        scientific publications to create a coherent picture of the        relationships that exist within complex groups of genes        Because this analysis is performed independently of        knowledge of gene function it provides a means of rapidly        probing the biological significance of complex expression        data in an unbiased fashion                    Materials and methods                  Literature indexing          Relevant literature was retrieved for each gene by          querying Medline for entries containing gene names or          abbreviations or aliases The URL database used to          generate basic PubMed search strings for human genes can          be downloaded see Additional data files The database          is indexed by LocusLink   and GenBank IDs   Most          search strings must be edited on a genebygene basis as          a vast majority of publications do not adhere to the          official nomenclature and gene names and abbreviations in          use can differ from the aliases provided by HGNC or lack          specificity see discussion in Benefits and          limitations Acronyms that contain only few letters are          particularly problematic and must often be removed from          the query in order to avoid high proportions of          falsepositive hits                          Data filtering          Data were filtered as described in Results and
