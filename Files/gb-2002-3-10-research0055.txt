 Background Microarray technologies provide the means of measuring the expression of thousands of genes or proteins simultaneously This revolution brings new perspectives for the study of expression networks and their regulation potentially providing valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying disease 1 Increasingly accessible microarray platforms allow the unrestrained and rapid generation of large expression datasets As large volumes of data are being generated the need for data mining programs that provide the means to manage normalize filter group and visualize expression data expands These tools help to identify subsets of genes whose expression changes significantly and organize them according to their expression profiles Although necessary this type of analysis does not reveal the biological implications encrypted in expression data Indeed the evaluation of the functional significance of large heterogeneous and noisy groups of genes constitutes the real challenge for microarray users 2 A further problem is that the wealth of knowledge accumulated after decades of biological research has resulted in a considerable narrowing of research fields As a consequence in depth knowledge of gene function possessed by highly specialized investigators is biased and limited to relatively small subsets of genes that become the focus of the expression data analysis The definition of functional classes and improved access to information associated with individual genes partly makes up for this lack of perspective However information about gene function is primarily contained in the 11 million articles indexed in the Medline database Evaluating the functional associations that might exist among large groups of genes from this huge volume of literature is not feasible in a time frame compatible with the pace at which the data can be generated Limitations in our capacity to explore the functional dimension of microarray expression are one of the major impediments to the optimal exploitation of this powerful technology Surprisingly only a few groups have previously addressed this shortcoming 3 4 5 We describe here how a literature derived term frequency database can be generated and mined through the analysis of patterns of occurrences of a restricted subset of relevant terms This literature profiling produces a coherent picture of the functional relationships among large and heterogeneous lists of genes and should enable the development of tools for rapidly extracting meaningful knowledge from large microarray expression databases Results and discussion Literature indexing The method requires articles related to each of the genes included in the analysis to be extracted This is done by querying the Medline database though PubMed 6 using appropriate search strings We chose to retrieve entries containing the official gene name abbreviation or aliases in the title field Information about gene nomenclature can be found on the website of the Human Gene Nomenclature Committee HGNC 7 Using this source we created a database containing URLs in the PubMed query format for the more than 10 500 known human genes defined by HGNC for example for protein kinase C eta the URL found in the database is http www3 ncbi nlm nih gov htbin post Entrez query db 0 form 1 term PRKCH 5Bti 5D OR PKC L 5Bti 5D OR PRKCL 5Bti 5D OR protein 20kinase 20C 20eta 5Bti 5D pointing a web browser to this address gives the 17 entries that would have been retrieved by typing the following search string PRKCH ti OR PKC L ti OR PRKCL ti OR protein kinase C eta ti URL entries are indexed by GenBank 8 and LocusLink 9 IDs and can be downloaded as a Microsoft Excel table see Additional data files The search for relevant literature for each individual gene is complicated by the fact that the same gene can have many different names associated with it and that the same name or abbreviation can have different meanings A rapid scanning of the search results is useful for the identification and removal of inappropriate search strings see below For each gene the result of the query is downloaded in XML format Abstracts are then extracted from the file by means of a macro running on Microsoft Excel and saved as a new file to be used for text analysis Methodologies described in this report were tested on a list of 70 genes see Additional data files derived from a subset of conditions belonging to a sample gene expression dataset generated to study the transcriptional response of professional antigen presenting cells to pathogens using high density oligonucleotide arrays D Chaussabel R Semnani M Mcdowell D Sacks A Sher and T B Nutman unpublished observations We were able to find at least five relevant records in the Medline database containing abstracts for 44 out of the 70 genes listed Another 10 genes had at least five records with accompanying abstracts when their generic name was used as a search string for example interferon induced transmembrane protein instead of interferon induced transmembrane protein 1 Text analysis Word occurrence in abstracts is determined for each gene by analyzing the contents of Medline entries nearly 4 000 in the example presented here This parameter describes the relative frequency of abstracts containing a given word for example 18 2 of the abstracts indexed for the gene GADD45B contain the word proliferation Data filtering Occurrence values are assigned to every unique word found in the literature analyzed resulting in tens of thousands of entries for each gene A vast majority of these terms are either found ubiquitously for example if because cell identified are present in most abstracts of most genes or very rarely present in very few abstracts of few genes and therefore are of very little use for the definition of gene specific term occurrence profiles However a third category of terms can be found in most abstracts of very few genes and convey relevant information about these genes These terms are characterized both by high occurrence values in gene specific collections of abstracts and a low baseline occurrence in the literature An example is given in Figure 1 where terms present in more than 25 of the abstracts related to the gene RANTES are plotted on the y axis Baseline occurrence was determined by averaging the values found for these terms for genes picked at random from all known human genes As shown Figure 1 when sufficient genes are used to constitute the baseline averaged occurrence values become stable In this example we found that most of the terms for which baseline occurrence was less than 5 conveyed significant information on that gene for example infection secreted chemokine inflammatory Some production regulated seemed to be less meaningful however and terms with higher baseline occurrence were nonspecific for example induced response activation important As expected terms such as a we protein or cells had the highest baseline occurrence 92 59 41 and 39 respectively The terms found in thousands of abstracts retrieved for the list of genes considered in this report were filtered systematically using several criteria The first step consists in removing terms commonly found throughout the scientific literature A baseline occurrence for each term was determined by taking the average occurrence of the set of 250 randomly picked genes as described in Figure 1 In our example terms with a baseline occurrence of more than 5 were categorized as undiscriminatory and eliminated Table 1 In the second step term occurrence values for each gene were compared to the baseline We arbitrarily set the difference cut off between gene term occurrence and baseline occurrence at 25 see Table 1 A term can only be useful in defining relationships among genes if it is shared by at least two of them For this reason only terms found to pass the filter for at least two of the genes considered for analysis are further retained see Table 1 For the set of genes used to illustrate the technique Table 2 and see Additional data files 101 terms out of nearly 25 000 were retained after application of these filters Stringency of term selection can be adjusted at the user s convenience by modifying the filtering parameters For instance a greater number of relevant terms might be retrieved by lowering thresholds insuring term specificity at the cost of increasing the level of noise less relevant terms in the list of terms When lists of terms become too noisy the manual removal of irrelevant terms can be considered Clustering analysis Isolating useful information out of tens of thousands of irrelevant terms closely resembles the task of sorting through gene expression data produced by microarray technology But the parallel is not restricted to the filtering of data as we also found that tools used for the analysis of gene expression could be applied to term occurrence values to identify groups of genes sharing similar literature profiles The vocabulary defined after successive rounds of filtering is used to create a term by gene array of term occurrence values relative to each individual gene Relationships among genes are then assessed by hierarchical clustering analysis using a software package originally created for the analysis of gene expression data 10 The resulting clustergram shows the grouping of genes according to patterns of term occurrences Figure 2 Genes are grouped on the basis of similarity between term occurrence profiles The nature of the relationships found through the analysis of term occurrences in abstracts can be determined by browsing this diagram The relationships among genes listed in Table 2as determined through the analysis of literature content are represented by the dendrogram detailed in Figure 3 In this tree diagram the distance between nodes is inversely proportional to the degree of correlation found between the genes The main ramifications of the tree define the predominant groups identified by this analysis To help understand the nature of the associations found among groups of genes occurrence values of a limited number of terms used in the analysis are shown opposite the dendrogram Figure 3 It is notable that the functional groups identified in this list of genes significantly induced after infection of professional antigen presenting cells are related to immune responses Genes for transcription factors that control inflammatory responses and programmed cell death make up the first gene cluster considered Figure 2 color coded in blue These genes have abstracts with a frequent occurrence of terms such as TNF the inflammatory mediator tumor necrosis factor death or apoptosis The largest group is composed of genes associated with the term interferon also IFN and IFN alpha color coded green Figure 2 indeed STATs are factors specifically required for interferon signaling Interferon regulatory factors IRFs trigger the interferon response whereas other members of the group are effector antiviral molecules for example ISG15 ISG20 sometimes associated with terms such as virus infected or infection OAS Mx1 Mx2 The next group Figure 2 red is composed exclusively of chemokines Interestingly the analysis of abstract contents was able to distinguish monokines belonging to the CXCR family SCYB chemokines IP 9 IP 10 MIG associated with CXC CXCR monokine or MIG from CC chemokines SCYA chemokines LARC RANTES MCP2 MCP3 The last group Figure 2 violet is composed of genes involved throughout the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway Specifically these genes encode proteins involved in the degradation of proteins into peptides by the immunoproteasome PSMAs PSME antigenic peptide loading and transport ABCB2 also known as TAP1 for transporter associated with antigen processing 1 and presentation at the cell surface HLA F B2M It is notable that one of the closest pairs formed consists of a receptor ligand pair VEGF and NRP2 Figure 3 Overall these examples illustrate the concept that appropriate terms taken out of context can still convey valuable information and can be used to rapidly explore and assess the biological meaning of complex datasets Analyzing patterns of term occurrence in groups of genes with different degrees of association The basis for analyzing expression patterns is the assumption that genes under common transcriptional control are involved in similar processes 1 11 This notion provides a rationale for developing tools to evaluate the existence of functional relationships among groups of co regulated genes In the group of 50 co induced genes in our example we found that 101 terms were shared by at least two genes according to our filtering criteria with as many as 300 positive associations between genes and terms defined as exceeding baseline occurrence by 25 For comparison analysis of the literature relative to 50 genes picked randomly from all known human genes indexed in the LocusLink database only retrieved 49 shared terms and 109 associations Figure 4b This is in contrast with the 116 shared terms and 523 associations found when 50 genes are picked randomly from a homogenous functional group all known cytokines and chemokines and their receptors Figure 4c As shown by this example the number of associations found by literature profiling correlates with the likelihood that a group of genes is functionally related Conditions for the formation of meaningful gene clusters We sought to identify the critical elements leading to the formation of clusters of related genes described in Figure 2and represented in Figure 5ausing similar color codes The terms making up each gene s literature profile include gene names or words making up gene names To meet our filtering criteria each term must have had a high occurrence in the literature of at least two of the genes covered by the analysis To test the relative importance of such terms for the analysis gene names and term occurrence values were clustered without gene names for example RANTES IP10 NFkappaB STAT IRF or terms included in gene names for example interferon proteasome regulatory monokine As shown in Figure 5b clusters were largely conserved Gene names or terms included in gene names are therefore not necessary for the formation of meaningful clusters but may have a significant role terms such as NFkappaB or interferon which are found throughout the literature on genes involved in these pathways will generate valid associations Similarly the discovery of references to the chemokine RANTES in abstracts relevant to different genes suggests the existence of a functional link Indeed the literature mining tool developed by Jenssen et al 5 is based on a gene co citation network and therefore relies entirely on the same type of association To exclude the possibility that groups of meaningful genes may arise by using a sufficient number of co occurring terms we permuted term occurrence values for each gene before clustering Figure 5c The fact that this treatment results in a complete loss of the original hierarchy proves that the formation of meaningful groups of genes cannot be attributed to a clustering artifact Literature profiling of large gene lists The size of the list of genes that must be analyzed can vary greatly from one microarray experiment to another In an ideal setting the analysis of gene expression patterns groups co regulated genes into small subsets In most cases however partitioning of the data on the basis of expression is impaired by a small number of conditions or straightforward expression profiles As a consequence microarray experiments often generate lists of several hundred genes for which biological meaning must be sought The use of a mining technique such as the one described here will be most valuable in this context In this section we give two examples of literature profiles generated from published datasets When a large number of genes are analyzed the level of noise less specific terms can be more important and filtering criteria were adjusted accordingly The fixed 25 cut off we used in our previous example can be too high for a gene represented by hundreds of abstracts but can also be relatively low when considering a gene for which only five abstracts could be retrieved To take such discrepancies into account we optimized the cut off for each gene as follows cut off t k n where t is the minimum threshold k is a constant and n is the number of abstracts retrieved for a given gene t and k must be set arbitrarily and will directly influence resolution and noise levels For these examples we chose t 15 and k 1 5 therefore cut off values for genes represented by 5 or 100 abstracts are 45 and 16 5 respectively The gene term specificity was further improved by adding a filter that removes terms present in the vocabulary of more than half of the genes considered for example bound contained clones putative process Such a filter is particularly appropriate for large datasets as the chance of less specific terms being retained by other filters increases with the number of genes analyzed The functional heterogeneity inherent in large gene lists eliminates the risk of relevant terms being removed by this filter Similar themes were identified when the cut off applied in the previous example is used instead However increasing the stringency of the filter resulted in a tighter clustering of large datasets In these examples we eliminated redundant singular plural forms by averaging term occurrence values derived from both entries considering for instance lipoprotein and lipoproteins as a single entity In the first dataset a list of nearly 200 genes and expressed sequence tags ESTs that constitutes the human macrophage common transcriptional program induced upon bacterial infection 12 is analyzed Sufficient publications could be retrieved for 147 of these genes see Additional data files Patterns of term occurrence appear once gene names have been rearranged by hierarchical clustering Figure 6 The existence of functional relationships between genes can be inferred from the visual analysis of the resulting clustergram Figure 6 top left panel Putative relationships are then confirmed by investigating the few relevant publications pinpointed by the analysis of literature profiles Several groups of genes involved in different aspects of the immune response to an infection were uncovered by literature profiling interferon response chemotaxis inflammation Figure 6d 6f and 6g respectively But many other functional groups were also identified as follows As indicated by their names lipoprotein lipase LPL and low density lipoprotein receptor LDLR genes are involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism and were logically associated by literature profiling Figure 6a Interestingly the CD36 like 1 antigen alias thrombospondin receptor like 1 CD36L1 clustered tightly with LPL and LDLR and shared with these genes terms such as lipoprotein lipid or cholesterol Figure 6a This association was validated by browsing the literature relevant to CD36L1 whch contains reports showing the role of this molecule as a receptor for high density lipoprotein The two major groups of proteinases involved in extracellular matrix degradation serine proteinases and metalloproteinases have been grouped by literature profiling Figure 6b urokinase plasminogen activation cascade UPA PLAUR SERPIN and matrix metalloproteinases MMP14 MMP10 MMP1 Both families are activated during inflammation and as indicated by their literature profiles are involved in tumor invasion and metastasis 13 14 In the context of a bacterial infection these proteins enable activated macrophages to cross endothelial barriers and gain access to the site of the infection 15 16 other terms shared by these genes are migration vascular endothelial An extracellular matrix binding protein SPARC secreted protein acidic cysteine rich alias osteonectin was also associated with these proteinases by literature profiling SPARC can increase endothelial permeability and is known to participate in tumor angiogenesis and extravasation 17 Interestingly this protein has not been reported as being upregulated upon cell infection and its possible role in macrophage transendothelial migration was never addressed This example illustrates how functional relationships that could not be deduced from gene names were uncovered through the analysis of patterns of term occurrence matrix metalloproteinases MMP1 10 14 and urokinase plasminogen activator UPA SPARC are matrix interacting molecules involved in tumor invasion and metastasis The cluster shown in Figure 6cis composed of members of two genes families adenosine receptors ADORA3 and ADORA2A and purinergic receptors P2RX1 and P2RX7 Indeed although not evident from its name P2RX acts as a receptor for a phosphorylated form of adenosine adenosine triphosphate Another interesting example where non obvious associations were revealed by literature profiling is shown in Figure 6e This group consists of genes for which related abstracts have in common terms such as disorder allele recessive or autosomal This shared vocabulary is indicative of an association that given the diversity of genes implicated would have undoubtedly been overlooked by the mere examination of the gene list Indeed a rapid search of the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database OMIM 18 for genes associated with the terms severe and disorder confirmed that mutations of GALC LAMB3 GJB2 JAG1 TGFBI LPL and LDLR were the origin of serious disorders Krabbe disease Herlitz junctional epidermolysis bullosa autosomal dominant deafness Vohwinkel syndrome Alagille syndrome corneal dystrophy type I hyperlipoproteinemia and hypercholesterolemia respectively In addition two genes sharing a similar vocabulary could be found outside the region outlined in Figure 6e GCDH linked to glutaric acidemia type I and MPI linked to carbohydrate deficient glycoprotein syndrome type Ib Literature profiles were generated for a second large dataset consisting of the 200 genes and ESTs found to be the most differentially regulated in classic versus desmoplastic medulloblastomas in a study of central nervous system tumors 19 At least five references were found for 137 of the genes listed see Additional data files In contrast to the previous example gene expression in this case was not measured for a purified cell population but for heterogeneous tumor tissue This fact is reflected in the analysis of literature profiles as groups of genes could be found to be associated with brain tissues Figure 7f for example HPCA hippocalcin SYP synaptophysin GRIK1 glutamate receptor ionotropic kainate 1 APLP amyloid beta A4 precursor like protein immune cells Figure 7b for example CD40 IL15RA IL 15 receptor alpha chain LILB4 leukocyte immunoglobulin like receptor 4 or tumor cells Figure 7a for example MYBL1 v myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene ABL2 v abl Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 Interestingly three genes whose products are known to promote viral replication were associated with v myb and v abl oncogenes shared terms virus transformation or leukemia TAX1BP1 Tax1 binding protein 1 CREB3 cAMP response element binding protein 3 LZIP and TARBP2 TAR binding protein 2 Figure 7a 20 21 22 These proteins could have a potentially important role in the regulation of cell growth as TAX1BP CREB3 and TARBP possess anti apoptotic tumor suppressor and oncogenic activities 23 24 25 respectively Another group of genes encoding three enzymes PLK Polo like kinase CDKN3 cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 3 p27 Kip1 CDC25A cell division cycle 25A and a transcription factor E2F1 E2F transcription factor 1 involved in the control of the cell cycle were grouped Figure 7g All three enzymes have been found to be overexpressed in tumors of various origins 26 27 28 Other groups of functionally related genes are shown in Figure 7 some are ion channels Figure 7d whereas others are associated with keratinocytes Figure 7c or involved in the respiratory chain Figure 7e A wide diversity of adhesion molecules was also identified Figure 7h These included the obvious MCAM melanoma cell adhesion molecule but also ATP1B2 ATPase Na K transporting beta 2 polypeptide which is believed to function in neuron astrocyte adhesion 29 30 THBS thrombospondin an adhesion molecule involved in blood clotting OPN osteopontin which promotes osteoclast adhesion 31 and OSF2 osteoblast specific factor 2 a human homolog of the insect protein fasciclin thought to have a role in bone adhesion 32 Finally as shown in Figure 7i MADH2 and MADH5 mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2 and 5 shared with TGFB3 transforming growth factor beta 3 terms such as TGF beta transforming and factor beta reflecting the involvement of MADH in the signaling pathway of TGF beta family members 33 Taken together these examples demonstrate the power of the analysis of literature profiles in revealing unsuspected functional relationships in large and heterogeneous lists of genes Benefits and limitations The mining technique we describe is designed to guide the interpretation of complex expression databases Key aspects of the technique contributing to the fulfillment of this goal include The method is independent of the user s knowledge of gene function and can therefore be used to identify promising findings rapidly in an unbiased way The method renders the data intelligible by bringing functional coherence to large and heterogeneous lists of genes The terms used as criteria to explore relationships among genes differ with the composition of the group of genes considered for analysis Because the basis for classifying genes is flexible associations made between them will change with the context in which they are found The technique is based on the analysis of the content of scientific publications and constitutes a contemporary solution for the exploitation of swelling literature resources by providing investigators with leads for further in depth investigation of the literature Term occurrence data derived from literature profiling can be used to annotate heterogeneous gene lists thus adding to the value of this technique as a visualization tool Figure 3 The implementation of our mining technique as a computational tool is hindered by the need to retrieve the relevant literature reliably for each gene included in the analysis Indeed gene by gene editing of automatically generated PubMed query strings is often required to insure low levels of false positives among the abstracts retrieved Several names and abbreviations are often associated with a single gene but are used in a different context for example to designate drugs bacterial strains or medical procedures or they belong to the English vocabulary e g Wars tryptophanyl tRNA synthetase Sky TYRO3 protein tyrosine kinase God Godzilla Short acronyms are especially problematic for example CT the abbreviation for calcitonin can be found in the title of over 20 000 abstracts of which only 25 contain the term calcitonin Parsing issues that are caused by a confusing gene nomenclature can however be avoided when curated literature resources are available for example the Yeast Literature Database 34 The reduction of the information contained in the literature is also limiting Words taken out of their context convey useful but limited information and this superficial assessment of the literature can only be used to direct further investigation The selection of terms through rounds of filtering inevitably results in the selection of irrelevant terms false positives and pertinent terms will also be lost false negatives Reviewing the terms and literature that prompted the definition of relationships among genes can easily identify false positive associations False negative associations are harder to identify and can only be kept to a minimum by combining existing approaches designed to assess the biological significance of large sets of genes Like the other literature mining approaches previously published our technique cannot be expected to give definitive answers but nonetheless provides investigators with much needed solutions for the functional evaluation of complex microarray data 35 Relatively few groups have attempted to resolve the bottleneck constituted by the inability of highly specialized investigators to assess the existence of relationships between genes in a high throughput fashion 3 4 5 Jenssen et al 5 analyzed literature contents to create a gene to gene co citation network revealing associations between genes Our technique differs fundamentally from Jenssen et al s method in that it is based on term occurrences in indexed abstracts as opposed to gene name co citation frequencies This approach allowed us to take advantage of the powerful algorithms used for the analysis of patterns of gene expression Also this literature profiling method should benefit from ongoing efforts to improve visualization tools clustering techniques and associated statistics 36 37 Another major advantage arises from the capacity to include any of the terms present in abstracts resulting in a considerable increase in the number of potential relationships generated Finally the number of genes covered by this type of analysis is also much greater thanks to the low requirements in the volume of literature associated with each gene Text mining software is also available commercially Omniviz 38 one of the most advanced solutions for the analysis of the scientific literature can group publications or patents or any other kind of text entries associated with a common theme for example Alzheimer s disease through the analysis of their content In contrast our mining algorithm was specifically designed to group genes instead of publications through the analysis of the content of their associated literatures This conceptual difference makes the techniques distinct from one another Our approach requires the literature to be indexed for each gene and treated separately throughout the analysis We also filter terms using stringent criteria a critical step that allows the analysis of patterns of term occurrences by hierarchical clustering Applications and perspectives This report constitutes a proof of principle on the feasibility and use of literature profiling for high throughput research Although room exists for improvements in indexing filtering and clustering strategies the methodology described provides a blueprint for the development of computational tools that can rapidly assess literature content to guide the biological interpretation of complex expression data Because this literature mining technique analyzes data at a high level it is independent of the platform used by investigators for example spotted cDNA or high density oligonucleotide arrays protein arrays and could find applications in both genomics and proteomics research In addition to providing help to explore large expression datasets occurrence values displayed for certain terms in the format used in Figure 3can be used to annotate large and complex lists of genes providing readers with information on gene function In our example giving occurrence values for terms such as apoptosis endothelial interferon inflammatory chemoattractant or histocompatibility provides a naive reader with insight into the function attributed in the literature to each of the listed genes Associating literature profiles with gene expression data could be used for orienting gene discovery It is believed that co regulated genes share similar promoters and or are involved in similar biological processes 1 Using this principle of guilt by association functions attributed to known genes can be inferred for unknown genes sharing similar expression profiles In the first example used in this report see Additional data files many of the genes were identified using literature profiles as being related to interferon virus and infection and thus it can be assumed that some of the genes and ESTs that were not included in the analysis from lack of literature see Additional data files are also associated with these terms For instance among the co regulated ESTs is the Homo sapiens cig5 mRNA partial sequence AF026941 which was obtained using differential display analysis to identify sequences for which transcription is induced following cytomegalovirus infection 39 Another co regulated but poorly studied gene is secreted and transmembrane 1 U77643 which resembles a cytokine or growth factor in its broad structural characteristics 40 This gene was later reported to be the ligand for the surface antigen CD7 and found to be capable of activating NK cells 41 which constitute the primary source of IFN gamma during early responses to infection 42 In both examples the link to interferon virus or infection can only be suspected but certainly deserves attention because these sequences are regulated together with genes known to be involved in the biology of interferons Conclusions The sequencing of whole genomes and the introduction of technologies capable of measuring simultaneously the expression of thousands of genes provides biological research with a global perspective that opposes the trend over the past few decades of the narrowing into highly specialized research fields But the optimal exploitation of these invaluable resources by researchers necessitates the development of mining tools to explore and interpret data in a time frame compatible with the impressive rate at which they are generated Individual knowledge is built on associations made between the information we acquire from the literature The method we describe here mimics this learning process by associating meaningful terms found in scientific publications to create a coherent picture of the relationships that exist within complex groups of genes Because this analysis is performed independently of knowledge of gene function it provides a means of rapidly probing the biological significance of complex expression data in an unbiased fashion Materials and methods Literature indexing Relevant literature was retrieved for each gene by querying Medline for entries containing gene names or abbreviations or aliases The URL database used to generate basic PubMed search strings for human genes can be downloaded see Additional data files The database is indexed by LocusLink 9 and GenBank IDs 8 Most search strings must be edited on a gene by gene basis as a vast majority of publications do not adhere to the official nomenclature and gene names and abbreviations in use can differ from the aliases provided by HGNC or lack specificity see discussion in Benefits and limitations Acronyms that contain only few letters are particularly problematic and must often be removed from the query in order to avoid high proportions of false positive hits Data filtering Data were filtered as described in Results and discussion using Microsoft Excel The spreadsheet used to filter the gene list analyzed in this report
