 The New Walter Cronkite The rampant civility of the presidential and vice presidential debates is enough to make me wanna give somebody a mouthful of bloody Chiclets That somebody is debate moderator Jim Lehrer I know my anger is misplaced That the debates sputtered rather than sizzled wasn t Lehrer s fault He may have pitched softballs but that s what the ground rules of the occasion required And Lehrer can t be blamed for the fact that Dole and Clinton satisfied themselves by slapping singles when they could have swung for the fences Still my irritation is not entirely misplaced The Dole and Clinton campaigns having blessedly dumped the usual panel of preening journalists selected Lehrer as sole moderator for a reason He has become our national icon of broadcasting probity and they knew that he would bring the sort of solemnity to the occasion that would minimize the risk of things getting interesting There s a kind of dignity in Lehrer s plodding reluctance to opine in his hangdog humility in his desire to serve as moderator rather than interrogator There s also a reward From his role as the sole moderator in all three presidential and vice presidential debates it is suddenly clear that we finally have a successor to Walter Cronkite in the semiofficial role of America s first TV father Lehrer age 62 obliquely acknowledged this milestone when he won the debate assignment I see my selection as a tribute to our NewsHour way of doing things he said Cronkite retired almost two decades ago but the chair has remained empty until now Who s the alternative Of the three commercial anchors Peter Jennings is Canadian and has that randy gaze that makes men hide their wives Tom Brokaw looks too boyish and has a speech impediment and Dan Rather is famously nuts Bernard Shaw s got the gravitas and a great magisterial voice but there s still something too cheesy about the CNN mise en sc ne Ted Koppel is too in your face The retirement last year of Robert MacNeil another Canadian gave Lehrer full ownership of the PBS NewsHour and his debate moderator gig which made him the one man in America who can lay down the rules to presidents sealed the deal Lehrer s apotheosis has been two decades in the making It began in the early 70s when he abandoned Dallas newspapering for a job at the local public television station He moved on to PBS and during the Watergate summer of 1973 partnered with MacNeil to parlay PBS weakness a lack of resources to dig for stories into strength Presaging the t l vision v rit of C SPAN Jim and Robin covered the hearings gavel to gavel from an Olympian distance mostly letting the story and participants speak for themselves An Emmy followed as did their evening show that now goes by the name of The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer More talk show than news program the NewsHour likewise lets people and things mostly speak for themselves Each week dozens of government officials foreign leaders experts journalists and voluble wonks descend upon the NewsHour s suburban Washington studios for mild chat with the anchors about genocide and tax policy and abortion and air traffic safety and other topics of the day Lehrer isn t always as flat as he was required to be in the debates but there is the same vacant and impassive style and there are for my taste too many of the same easily answered or evaded questions Off camera Lehrer is a jovial skeptic Yet even though he knows that most politicians CEOs and activists who appear on his show are accomplished liars he offers little in the way of interruption or contradiction Like the Lehrer led debates the NewsHour is a low scoring game of singles passed balls and sacrifice flies Many people claim to find the NewsHour stimulating but I suspect that what they really find it is soothing Friction and strife are the post and beam of genuine journalism but Lehrer s product is comfort first for his viewers whom he shields from the passion and fury of the news The NewsHour s mini documentaries don t shy away from distressing scenes of war and misery but the panel discussions that follow generally still the racing heart Comfort also is extended to NewsHour s guests and I do mean guests He looks at you with those big brown eyes confides one talking head who has appeared on NewsHour and you know you re going to be safe As on other talk shows NewsHour guests are pre interviewed When the 50s game shows engaged in this sort of coaching it was considered a scandal And like other talk show hosts Lehrer reserves the right to hammer guests with unexpected questions But he rarely does No wonder then that the exchanges between Lehrer and the Cabinet secretaries and senators and law professors and reporters seem so articulate and poised that the guests are eager to return to the show that Lehrer was a guest at one of Al Gore s pretentious metaphor salon dinner parties in 1994 Lehrer is unabashed about this socializing with pols and power and it has turned him into one of them He runs the NewsHour as if it were a Senate office and he the senator says one veteran of the show But Lehrer is not corrupt When his friends appear on his show they get treated no better than some war criminal with whom he is not acquainted Or rather the war criminal gets treated no worse than his friends Alexander Cockburn once imagined this MacNeil Lehrer segue And now for another view of Hitler Since Cockburn cracked wise in 1982 the news business especially the TV news business has grown more aggressive and competitive The networks and syndicates have expanded news magazine coverage political talk shows have multiplied like bacteria the Sunday shows have grown more slick and three 24 hour news channels now clog cable television Admirably to many resisting this commercial tide the NewsHour seems even more civil and staid A 1994 Roper Poll concluded that the NewsHour is perceived by the public as the most credible newscast in the country Maybe so But credibility apparently isn t everything About 1 2 million homes tune in the NewsHour each night while a combined total of 20 4 million homes watch the evening news on CBS ABC and NBC The Cronkite crown though is not awarded on the basis of ratings Credibility is a vital factor and Jim Lehrer does indeed have it It s an odd factor though Do people believe that Brokaw Rather and Jennings reading scripts written by others from their TelePrompTers are making things up No it s something more amorphous like Who do you want to hear it from the next time a plane crashes or a world leader is assassinated Hell even I might choose Jim Lehrer
