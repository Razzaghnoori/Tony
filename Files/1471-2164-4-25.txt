 Background Reading disability RD or dyslexia is a common syndrome with a significant genetic component Genetic linkage studies have identified five potential RD loci located on chromosomes 1 1 2 2 3 4 6 5 6 7 8 9 15 7 10 and 18 11 The linkage to 6p has been the most often reproduced in independent samples with five studies showing peaks of linkage to different regional marker sets 5 6 7 8 9 We recently constructed a BAC PAC contig of the 6p RD locus 12 and identified the precise location and order of 29 short tandem repeat STR markers spanning this region 13 A subsequent study with this new marker panel identified a peak of transmission disequilibrium at marker JA04 G72384 14 We searched the expressed sequence tag EST database dbEST http www ncbi nlm nih gov dbEST index html with the genomic sequence corresponding to the peak of transmission disequilibrium at marker JA04 ESTs are partial and usually incomplete cDNA sequences prepared from various tissues Presently nearly four million ESTs dbEST release 04 19 02 are catalogued in dbEST representing about 80 or more of all human genes with at least one representative entry 15 While not every gene is accounted for in dbEST computer database searching also known as in silico cloning can identify new genes without actual physically manipulating DNA These types of analyses can also characterize intron exon boundaries splice variants tissue specific expression levels and gene homologies 16 Furthermore clustering ESTs together to form a contiguous sequence can predict putative open reading frame ORFs The first map of the human genome which contained over 30 000 genes was generated by mapping EST clusters to human hamster radiation hybrid cell lines 17 Despite their wide ranging utility ESTs have two inherent drawbacks 1 they are based on single sequence reads making them vulnerable to sequencing errors and 2 they are generated from cDNA libraries that may contain unexpressed or incompletely spliced sequences derived from heteronuclear RNA or other artifacts The clustering of ESTs to form ORFs could contain both expressed and unexpressed sequences and should be treated with caution Fortunately the high redundancy of entries in dbEST permits the alignment of multiple ESTs for most genes thus diminishing the effects of these drawbacks To identify candidate genes for RD and other disorders mapping to this region we downloaded and searched the two million base pairs of genomic sequence surrounding the peak of transmission disequilibrium In addition to RD risk loci for Beh et s disease 18 inflammatory bowel disease IBD3 19 20 hypotrichosis simplex HSS 21 insulin dependent type 1 diabetes mellitus 22 attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD 23 and schizophrenia 24 have all been assigned to this general chromosomal location by genetic linkage analysis Using in silico cloning we identified a total of 19 genes and 2 pseudogenes and mapped their precise physical location and direction of transcription The expression pattern of each gene was characterized by examining the number of ESTs identified from various tissues as well as by qualitative RT PCR with RNA from 20 different human tissues This study also allowed us to test the usefulness of in silico cloning to identify and map new genes in a focussed region of the genome Results Using the blastc13 server at NCBI we performed in silico cloning studies of the 6p RD locus to identify coding regions In total 623 ESTs from 80 different tissues were identified and aligned to 2 Mb of genomic sequence These searches captured 157 putative coding regions from 19 genes and 2 pseudogenes concentrated in the central 1200 Kb shown in detail in Figure 1with base pair 1 starting at the 5 prime end of FLJ12671 and ending 1 Kb centromeric to the 3 prime end of RPS10 Short tandem repeat marker JA04 which identified the peak of transmission disequilibrium for RD phenotypes in previous studies 14 is at 540 Kb The most telomeric 200 Kb and the most centromeric 600 Kb of genomic sequence are void of coding regions Intergenic distances range from less than 1 Kb KIAA0319 and TRAF to 110 Kb HNRPA1 and P24 Cytokeratin 8 transcribed telomere to centromere is located in the intron between exons 1 and 2 of KIAA0319 transcribed centromere to telomere Table 1lists the genes identified in Figure 1 their size

SSADH KIAA0319 TRAF HT012 FLJ12619 Geminin KIAA0386 Cyclophilin A CMAH and NUP50 and are present on the NCBI accession view NT_017021 of 6p21 3 22 Our in silico studies identified an additional six genes RPS10 FLJ12671 UBE2D2 AP3 Cytokeratin 8 and P24 and two pseudogenes HNRPA1 and ASSP2 not represented on NT_017021 In addition we identified a putative fifth exon for P24 from hypothalamus BG715502 and pineal gland AA363698 cDNA libraries located between exons 2 and 3 in the 5 prime untranslated region and flanked by non traditional splice donor and acceptor bases 25 The novel exon was not present in the full length mRNA sequence AF418980 The functions of the newly identified genes were inferred by their similarity to other known genes identified in the BLAST searches Ribosomal protein L21 RPS10 is 95 identical to the genomic and mRNA sequences of a known ribosomal gene RPS10 is one of the many proteins that make up the ribosome macromolecule Other highly homologous genes of RPS10 are RPS5 RPS9 RPS29 RPL5 RPl27a and RPL28 26 FLJ12671s a hypothetical gene with an unknown function identified by the NEDO human cDNA sequencing project 27 Blasting the FLJ12671 sequence against the nr database also identified hits on chromosomes 1 and 11 suggesting that this gene has been duplicated on several chromosomes Ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2D2 UBE2D2 is a protein that targets abnormal or short lived proteins for degradation by the 26S proteasome 28 The EST sequences identified for the UBE2D2 gene on chromosome 6 are 93 identical to the human UBC4 5 gene located on chromosome 5 suggesting that this gene could be a duplicate as well Adapter related protein complex 3 AP3 may be involved in intracellular protein transport 29 Cytokeratin 8 is 95 identical to both the genomic and mRNA sequences of keratin Vesicular membrane protein P24 a previously characterized but unmapped gene 30 has been localized in intracellular organelles of highly differentiated neural cells and may have a role in the neural organelle transport system ASSP2 is one of 12 pseudogenes of argininosuccinate synthetase encoded on 10 chromosomes with the only functional sequence residing on chromosome 9 31 Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 HNRPA1 is also a pseudogene with three other copies on chromosomes 3 13 and 20 32 The copy on chromosome 12q13 1 is thought to encode the gene responsible for the functional HNRPA1 which serves as a carrier for RNA during export to the cytoplasm 33 The results of the qualitative RT PCR though not quantitative were useful for characterizing the pattern of tissue expression Figure 2 While most genes were about equally represented in the mRNAs of the twenty tissues in the panel three genes P24 NAD dependent succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase SSADH and KIAA0319 had exceptional patterns P24 was almost exclusively expressed in brain by RT PCR correlating with the origin of all 29 publicly accessible ESTs from brain cDNA libraries Figure 2 RT PCR suggested that the expression of SSADH was greatest in brain though it was ubiquitously expressed in all tissues tested Correspondingly only 5 of 38 SSADH ESTs accessible on public domain servers were from brain cDNA libraries with the remainder of mixed origin KIAA0319 had strong signal from brain and cerebellum mRNA reflected by the 10 of 29 publicly accessible ESTs originating from brain cDNA libraries Discussion The primary goal of this study was to identify candidate genes surrounding the peak of transmission disequilibrium for RD on chromosome 6p and to characterize their patterns of expression A secondary goal was to investigate the usefulness of the in silico approaches and specifically the dbEST database to identify and map new genes We identified 19 genes within 2 Mb of the peak of transmission disequilibrium but are some better candidates for RD than others The patterns of tissue expression as profiled by RT PCR and the frequency with which ESTs originated from brain cDNA libraries Figure 2 serve to highlight five genes that are highly expressed in the brain P24 SSADH GPLD1 KIAA0386 and KIAA0319 Of these five only one gene SSADH has been associated with a brain related phenotype Two frameshift mutations a G to T transversion in the intron 9 splice donor site and a G to A transition in the intron 5 splice donor site cause an exon to be skipped resulting in abnormal metabolism of GABA an important neurotransmitter in the brain The handful of described cases were originally diagnosed by anomalous GABA metabolites in the urine associated with developmental and speech delays hyporeflexia and behavioral problems including mild autism with clinical variation between affected family members 34 There is no data however that links GABA or GABA metabolism to specific defects of reading independent of IQ None of the other genes highly expressed in brain have associated diseases or clinical phenotypes GPLD1 selectively hydrolyzes inositol phosphate linkages in vitro releasing the protein bound to the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor into the cytosol 35 P24 is a neuron specific membrane protein localized in intracellular organelles of highly differentiated neural cells and is involved in neural organelle transport KIAA0386 encodes a protein that stimulates the formation of a non mitotic multinucleated syncytium from proliferative cytotrophoblasts during trophoblast differentiation 36 KIAA0319 encodes a protein of unknown function 37 While HT012 an uncharacterized hypothalamus protein could also be considered as a possible candidate gene RT PCR and EST searches 1 of 18 from brain cDNA libraries do not suggest a high level or selective expression in the brain The in silico studies also identified candidate genes for other diseases that map to this region The five brain candidate genes described above for RD are also reasonable candidates for the neurobehavioral disorders schizophrenia and ADHD HSS results in the complete loss of scalp hair in childhood Betz et al 21 described evidence for linkage to HSS with markers spanning D6S276 400 Kb telomeric of JA04 through D6S1607 5 6Mb centromeric of JA04 Neither the RT PCR results nor the tissue origin for any single gene suggests any best candidates among the 19 Beh et s disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by a systemic vasculitis that affects the joints all sizes and types of blood vessels the lungs the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract 38 There is evidence for linkage with markers spanning nearly 28 Mb of 6p with JA04 in the middle 18 Candidate genes for Beh et s would include those expressed in lymphocytes or perhaps bone marrow such as AP3 and FLJ12671 and other immune related genes such as TRAF and RU2AS These genes may also serve as candidates for other autoimmune disorders that map to this region such as IBD3 Overall the in silico method for identifying genes in a specific genomic region worked well here yielding a reasonable gene density of one per 95 kb This method is highly dependent upon the quality of the information in dbEST Any contamination from non coding DNA bacterial DNA cDNA from other species vectors or mitochondria DNA could generate false gene assignments Fortunately the high redundancy of EST hits in dbEST increased our confidence that any identification was likely physiologic and that the searches were sensitive It is possible however that our in silico approach may have missed some genes in particular those with small ORFs and or large 5 prime and or 3 prime UTRs 39 As dbEST expands over the next few years new genes may be identified with repeated in silico searches or with biophysical approaches such as cDNA hybridization 40 exon trapping 41 and amplification 42 or by identification of evolutionary conserved sequences 43 and HTF islands 44 Conclusion In summary we examined 2 Mb surrounding the transmission disequilibrium peak with RD at short tandem repeat marker JA04 on chromosome 6p In silico searches of the dbEST database identified 19 possible candidate genes While tissue expression patterns suggest five candidates that are highly expressed in brain one with a known association with neurological disease neither the RT PCR data nor the EST information can absolutely rule out any of the 19 as culpable candidates We conclude therefore that in silico cloning is a powerful and effective technique for quickly identifying existing and novel genes which can then be used to develop cDNA single nucleotide polymorphism markers cSNPs for pinpointing a more precise location of the 6p RD gene and other disease genes that map to this region Methods In silico cloning The two million base pairs of index genomic sequence surrounding marker JA04 was downloaded from the NCBI website accession number NT_017021 A perl script was written to parse the sequence into 200 files each containing 10 Kb segments in FASTA format Repeat sequences were masked with the RepeatMasker program RepeatMasker at http ftp genome washington edu RM RepeatMasker html Each masked file was sent to the blastc13 server as a query for searching the dbEST database using the BLAST algorithm 45 Only ESTs with an identity of 93 or greater were considered all other hits were discarded Surviving ESTs were then used to search the nr database to identify parental cDNA or mRNA matches which assembled 623 non overlapping ESTs into 21 gene or pseudogene antecedents The BLAST search of nr also showed hits against chromosome 6 BAC or PAC sequence ESTs not mapping to chromosome 6 were also discarded The final assemblies of EST and cDNA or mRNA sequences were aligned to the index NT_017021 genomic
