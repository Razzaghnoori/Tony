 Background The cytokine interleukin 2 IL 2 has been used extensively as a single agent for immune modulation of the host in cancer therapy 1 2 Clinical regression of metastatic melanoma and renal cell cancer resulted in long term cures and IL 2 has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for standard therapy Systemic IL 2 administration also appears to dramatically increase the frequency of tumor regression in specific immunization against cancer 3 It has been postulated on clinical grounds that the anti cancer effects of IL 2 are mediated through in vivo expansion and activation of cytotoxic lymphocytes 1 and or promotion of their migration within target tissues 3 but it has become apparent that IL 2 at the doses used therapeutically has broader immune pro inflammatory effects 4 5 In addition IL 2 may have a role in activation induced T cell death therefore causing peripheral tolerance 6 7 IL 2 administration is also associated with potent systemic toxicity that limits its therapeutic usefulness 8 and a relationship between toxicity and clinical effectiveness has been observed suggesting a common effector pathway 9 Most peculiarly the extent of IL 2 induced thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia is associated with increased frequency of clinical responses 10 Reversal of IL 2 induced toxicity by corticosteroid or anti tumor necrosis factor TNF antibodies also blunts its therapeutic efficacy further indicating the mandatory nature of this association 11 12 The ability to distinguish the effects of IL 2 in target tissues from its systemic effects may yield important insights for the development of improved anti cancer therapies With the advent of functional genomics 13 it has become possible to study complex biological behaviors in concert in order to obtain a panoramic view of downstream events resulting from pathophysiological alterations of entire biosystems Thus various aspects of the immune response can be analyzed in vitro 14 To our knowledge however little information is available about the effects of IL 2 in controlled in vitro conditions 15 and none about the effects of in vivo administration We have therefore characterized the effects of IL 2 administration in vivo on the transcriptional program of circulating cells as markers of its systemic effect and on the tumor microenvironment as a marker of its effect on target tissue We compared the time course of gene induction after in vitro exposure of peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC to IL 2 6 000 IU ml with in vivo exposure to a dose regimen 720 000 IU kg every 8 hours which is associated with fairly high systemic toxicity and clinical effectiveness 16 The changes in expression profile induced by IL 2 in the tumor microenvironment were monitored by repeated fine needle aspiration FNA biopsies Amplified antisense RNA aRNA obtained from in vitro or ex vivo samples was fluorescence labeled and hybridized to 6 500 spot cDNA arrays as previously described 17 Test samples consisted of gradient separated PBMC exposed either in vitro or in vivo to IL 2 labeled with Cy5 red and co hybridized with reference samples labeled with Cy3 green Reference samples for PBMC consisted of corresponding material for each experiment obtained before IL 2 exposure For in vitro experiments for example reference samples were PBMC cultured in the absence of IL 2 For ex vivo experiments references consisted of PBMC obtained from the respective patient before IL 2 administration For test FNA samples obtained during the course of IL 2 administration reference material consisted of FNA from the respective lesion obtained before IL 2 therapy This unusual strategy was selected to emphasize the differences between pre and post IL 2 exposure expression profiles while minimizing differences related to individual lesion and or patient heterogeneity The complete data set was filtered letting through only genes expressed at ratios 3 or 0 33 compared to the reference in at least one experiment A parameter was applied to the filter that selected genes whose fluorescence intensity was above 300 in one channel at least in one experiment This arbitrary threshold was chosen to exclude genes whose fluorescence intensity was close to background fluorescence To recover possibly useful information this filter was removed if the same gene demonstrated high intensity of fluorescence in the other channel 3 000 in at least one experiment A total of 2 393 genes out of the 6 500 clones were selected for subsequent analyses Results Technical challenges Administration of IL 2 in humans induces dramatic changes in the frequency of different subsets of circulating cells These changes need to be addressed when considering the more specific and minute changes induced at the transcriptional level by this cytokine Perhaps the most perplexing effect of IL 2 administration is a rapid within 1 hour and paradoxical clearance of monocytes and lymphocytes from the peripheral blood Figure 1a IL 2 may directly eliminate mononuclear cells through activation induced death 6 7 Contrary to the in vivo observation however in vitro stimulation with IL 2 6 000 IU ml of PBMC obtained from apheresis of melanoma patients did not alter mononuclear cell counts suggesting that cell death is not a direct effect of IL 2 Figure 1b A substantial difference between gradient separated PBMC and circulating cells in vivo is the lack of plasma platelets and polymorphonuclear cells as a result of the apheresis process This may directly or indirectly contribute to mononuclear cell death in vivo in response to IL 2 administration However IL 2 6 000 lU ml stimulation of lepirudin treated Aventis Pharmaceuticals Kansas City MO fresh blood did not alter mononuclear cell number data not shown suggesting a limited role for lymphocyte apoptosis as the cause of their rapid clearance from the circulation Whatever the reason the dramatic changes in the proportions of different subsets of circulating cells during IL 2 therapy introduce a strong bias into the interpretation of the in vivo data Observed variations in gene expression profile could be due to differential gene expression in individual cells shifting proportions of different cell subsets or a combination of the two The effect of proportional shifts in cell subsets could not be overcome by ex vivo mechanical separation of these subsets because of the limited quantity of material obtained from blood draws 20 ml However density gradient separation of PBMC almost totally compensated for these shifts by eliminating polymorphonuclear cells eosinophils and basophils Figure 1c and leaving a mononuclear cell population comparable with pre IL 2 treatment samples PBMC from apheresis used as reference for in vivo studies and as source of cells for in vitro studies are highly enriched in monocytes and lymphocytes as seen in Figure 1b Therefore both in vivo and in vitro studies reflected similar starting populations of mononuclear cells This at least in part mitigated the variation in gene profile pattern due to shifting cell subset proportions in vivo It has been suggested that rapid clearance of mononuclear cells after IL 2 administration is due to increased permeability of vascular endothelium 4 facilitating cell migration into extravascular spaces including tumor sites 3 However the level of genes constitutively expressed by various subsets of mononuclear cells did not change significantly within the tumor microenvironment Differential display of pre compared with post IL 2 specimens detected changes only in circulating cells that is of genes for CD8 CD3 CD10 and CD24 green and gray bars in Figure 1d These most probably reflected proportional shifts in cell subsets rather than altered gene expression because the level of expression of the same genes remained constant in the in vitro time course data not shown No changes could be detected in FNAs obtained pre IL 2 administration compared with FNAs obtained 3 hours after one light blue bar or four dark blue bar doses We could not confirm the aRNA based results by immunohistochemistry because the material obtainable by FNA was not sufficient for both analyses However we have previously shown good correlation between transcript detection of cellular markers in aRNA total RNA and at the protein level 18 We further evaluated the effects of IL 2 on endothelial cell permeability as a possible factor mediating migration of circulating immune cells into the tumor site IL 2 had no direct impact on the permeability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells HUVEC Figure 1e The addition of PBMC enriched in lymphocytes and monocytes by gradient separation increased the permeability of HUVEC within 3 hours Treatment of the enriched PBMC with IL 2 6 000 IU ml increased HUVEC permeability compared to PBMC alone only after 24 hours Student t test p 0 02 This finding suggests that IL 2 affects endothelial cell permeability through activation of PBMC The delayed effect of IL 2 on endothelial cell permeability observed with this functional assay was supported by gene profiling IL 2 alone had minimal effects on HUVEC Supernatant from PBMC cultures in serum free medium had extensive effects on HUVEC transcriptional profile data not shown However supernatants from PBMC conditioned for 24 hours with IL 2 6 000 IU ml induced differential expression in six additional groups of genes Figure 1f that could not be induced with supernatants conditioned for 3 hours These results suggest that the effect of IL 2 on endothelial cells is predominantly mediated indirectly through activation of immune cells and occurs at a later stage of IL 2 treatment This conclusion is in line with the clinical observation that fluid shifts and vascular leak occur in the later phases of high dose IL 2 therapy Taken together these results suggest that immediate migration of mononuclear cells to the tumor microenvironment is not the primary effector mechanism of systemic IL 2 administration This observation of course does not exclude the possibility that at a later time mononuclear cells might migrate or proliferate at the tumor site The reason for the clearance of circulating cells immediately following IL 2 administration remains unsolved and may be related to their sequestration in the reticular endothelial system a hypothesis that could not be evaluated by this study Time course analysis of IL 2 induced gene expression in PBMC in vitro To assess the direct effect of IL 2 on mononuclear cells without the experimental noise caused by proportional shifts in cell subsets we first determined the transcriptional changes occurring on exposure of PBMC to IL 2 in vitro IL 2 has direct effects on immune cells carrying the IL 2 receptor which in turn release soluble factors and or activate other cells by cell cell interactions Thus to match as closely as possible the in vitro conditions with those occurring in vivo we stimulated lymphocyte monocyte enriched PBMC preparations with 6 000 IU ml IL 2 in serum free medium This concentration approximates the pharmacokinetic distribution of IL 2 following intravenous bolus administration with mean peak levels around 250 ng ml corresponding to approximately 5 000 lU ml 19 This time course analysis identified 155 genes expressed more than threefold over pre IL 2 samples Figure 2 According to their kinetics of expression the large majority of genes were identifiable approximately 3 hours after IL 2 exposure with the exception of a subgroup including transcription and regulatory factors c Fos MKP1 which underwent early and short lived upregulation An overview of the genes most consistently affected by IL 2 therapy revealed a large array of transcripts with functions ranging from regulation of cell division and apoptosis to the secretion of immune stimulatory and or pro inflammatory factors In addition several surface activation markers in lymphocytes and monocytes that may influence migration and interaction with other cells were induced Thus the effects of IL 2 on PBMC span as expected a broad range related to the function of several different types of mononuclear cells Time course analysis of lL 2 induced gene expression in PBMC in vivo A similar time course analysis was performed in the patient who donated the PBMC for the in vitro time course by obtaining blood at intervals following intravenous administration of the first dose of IL 2 720 000 IU ml The blood was separated by density gradient which left a population of cells enriched in lymphocytes and monocytes In the in vivo time course 167 genes displayed differential expression 3 fold change in at least 70 of the samples with IL 2 treatment We then compared the expression profiles in the in vivo time course for the 155 genes differentially expressed as a result of IL 2 exposure during the in vitro time course analysis Differences between the two data sets could be due to shifts in cell subset frequencies in vivo and or true alterations in the gene expression profile of individual cells We hypothesized that expression profiles concordant in vitro where no change in cell subset frequency is observed and in vivo may represent with most confidence the pattern of gene expression induced by IL 2 A set of 93 out of 155 genes concordantly expressed in the in vitro and in vivo experiments were identified Figure 3a 3b 3c 3d 3e by cluster analysis of the combined in vitro and in vivo time course samples Genes for chemokines and cytokines related to inflammatory processes IP 10 MIP 1 MCP1 MCP 3 GM CSF IL 15 IL 3R IL 1 receptor showed a concordant early upregulation in vitro and in vivo Downregulation of growth factors cell cycle transcription factor related genes for ERF 2 CDC16 L Myc occurred in a similar fashion in vitro and in vivo As the majority of genes appeared to be concordantly expressed in vitro and in vivo we postulate that for these at least the effect of IL 2 on gene expression overrides its effect on population shift Although variability in the kinetics of expression of individual gene was noted in vivo as for the in vitro time course the 3 hour time point appeared to yield the most comprehensive view of alterations in gene expression profile following IL 2 administration Thus this data point was used in a larger cohort of patients to identify genes consistently modulated by IL 2 administration Genes whose expression is consistently altered in peripheral blood following IL 2 administration The expression pattern of the 155 genes identified by the in vitro time course was evaluated in PBMC samples obtained 3 hours after IL 2 administration in a larger cohort of patients Figure 4 A first node including 52 genes consistently upregulated at least 3 fold change in 70 of samples was identified Of these genes all but 6 were included among the 93 genes coordinately expressed in the in vitro and in vivo time courses Figure 3 A second node included 28 genes consistently downregulated most of them represented among those coordinately downregulated in the time course studies These data suggest that the genes identified were highly representative of the effects of IL 2 administration on circulating cells For some genes it was possible to extrapolate a potential cell subset responsible for their expression by testing different mononuclear cell subsets separated by negative selection after in vitro exposure to IL 2 monocytes CD4 T cells CD8 T cells total lymphocytes and neutrophils respectively under the orange bar Figure 4 Several were selectively expressed by either monocytes or CD4 and or CD8 T cells Interestingly IL 2 also appeared to stimulate the expression of some of these genes in neutrophils which however could not be accounted for in the analysis of PBMC samples enriched in monocytes and lymphocytes and almost completely depleted of neutrophils Genes specifically expressed in the tumor microenvironment in response to IL 2 administration The genes whose expression was consistently altered in PBMC following IL 2 administration were analyzed in a set of FNAs obtained from the same patients plus an additional group of patients Figure 4 Because there are practical limits on the number of FNAs that can be carried out in the same lesion without causing excessive disturbance of its structure we sampled lesions 3 hours after one dose first four samples in the array and four doses remaining six samples of IL 2 The fourth dose 24 hours after the administration of the first was selected as a later point likely to be reached by all patients before treatment was discontinued because of limiting toxicity 20 The post IL 2 FNA material was co hybridized with reference RNA obtained pre IL 2 from each lesion as previously discussed Only a small proportion of these genes were consistently upregulated in FNA samples and belonged to a closely related subcluster consisting of genes for inflammatory chemokines MCP 1 MCP 3 IP 10 LD 78 and interferon IFN related genes guanylate binding protein IFN inducible MxA IP 10 Analysis of mechanically separated subsets related their expression to activation of either monocytes or T cells Whereas the previous analysis was based on a pool of genes identified by studying the effects of IL 2 on circulating T cells an independent analysis was carried out by selecting from the complete data set genes whose expression was preferentially altered in FNA samples following IL 2 administration Genes were ranked according to their median ratio of expression among all FNA samples FNAs obtained after one or four doses were pooled together to identify genes associated with IL 2 administration independent of dose number The 75 genes with the highest median ratio and the 75 with the lowest were selected Figure 5 The expression of most of these genes seemed to be specifically modulated by IL 2 and not by the trauma of needle aspiration as only a few differentially expressed genes in parentheses in Figure 5 were detected in control FNA samples obtained at 24 hour intervals in the absence of IL 2 administration Eisen s hierarchical clustering analysis 21 was applied to this data set to compute relatedness among transcriptional profiles of different FNA samples This was done to evaluate whether FNAs obtained sequentially after one or four doses of IL 2 from identical or different lesions would cluster according to time of sampling or tissue of origin According to this data set based on the most consistently expressed genes samples from the same lesion clustered together independently of time suggesting that profiles of IL 2 induced genes tend to be lesion specific throughout IL 2 therapy The relationship among the samples independent of time of treatment was even more robust when the all data set was queried data not shown Different functional subsets of genes were identified that included those for several chemokines GRO 1 MIG MCP 1 MCP 3 MIP1 MIP PARC IL 8 cytokine receptors C CR 1 IL R IL 1R antagonist IL 2R transforming growth factor receptor TGF R IFN R chain adhesion molecules associated with mononuclear cell migration CD62L VCAM 1 CD64 CD29 cytotoxic proteins in granules produced by activated monocytes grancalcin and calgranulin and several genes associated with IFN activity such as HLA class II molecules and IFN regulatory or responsive genes such as those for MxA MxB and IRF 1 Interestingly no genes associated with apoptosis or cell proliferation were identified In addition no evidence of migration of various immune cell subsets was observed by analyzing changes in frequency of genes constitutively expressed by such cells that is CD8 CD4 CD14 and so on see Figure 1 Thus the early effects of IL 2 administration are more associated with an inflammatory modulation of the tumor microenvironment rather than with specific migration activation and or proliferation of immune cells at the tumor site To identify genes whose upregulation in the tumor microenvironment was time and or dose dependent we then queried the FNA data set by selecting genes differentially expressed between samples obtained 3 hours after one or four doses of IL 2 unpaired sample t test p 2 value 0 05 The cut off p 2 value of 0 05 was arbitrarily selected and was not corrected by the number of hypotheses tested genes Thus the genes identified should be considered more as an exploratory finding than a definitive proof of differential expression according to dose number Ratios were shown according to the central method for display using a normalization factor that emphasizes differences in expression between the experimental groups analyzed by resetting the equality parameter ratio 1 to the mean of all the experiments 22 In this fashion 54 genes were identified Figure 6 Interestingly among them we noted a further upregulation of MHC molecules and other interferon inducible factors Among the lesions analyzed one underwent partial regression Figure 7a To explore possible markers associated with immune responsiveness we queried the data set for genes expressed differentially in the responder lesion after one M F 1 and four M F 4 doses of IL 2 Two t tests two tail unequal variance were carried out comparing M F 1 and M F 4 respectively with the rest of the FNA samples Also in this case a cut off p 2 value of 0 05 was arbitrarily selected and was not corrected by the number of genes studied Thus the findings have only exploratory value In this fashion 68 and 102 genes were identified respectively Figure 7b of which four were overlapping two expressed sequence tags ESTs a nuclear protein CHD3 and a sphingosine kinase type 2 isoform When a similar analysis was carried out by comparing each of the non responding lesions to the rest the average of genes differentially expressed was 2 1 after one dose and 56 27 after four doses From the group of genes differentially expressed in the responder lesion after four doses of IL 2 19 were identified with the highest ratio of expression Among these 19 genes those for NKG5 T cell receptor chain and HLA class II related transcripts appeared of particular interest because they have been found to be upregulated in the context of acute rejection of renal allografts 23 24 In addition three were associated with IL 2 dependent NK cell activation NK4 CD62 P selectin and galectin 1 as recently observed when purified NK cells were exposed to IL 2 S Mocellin M C P and F M M unpublished observations Discussion The goal of this study was to dissect the events following administration of high dose IL 2 for therapeutic purposes In particular we were interested in comparing the systemic effects of IL 2 as reflected by the transcriptional profile of circulating mononuclear cells with the effects observable within the tumor microenvironment This was achieved by serial sampling of blood and tumor samples to follow the dynamic changes occurring during the course of IL 2 administration The results suggest that IL 2 exerts a broad range of effects on circulating cells These systemic effects have downstream repercussions only a few of which were reflected in changes in gene expression at the tumor site Analysis of the genes identified as affected by IL 2 administration suggested that IL 2 exerts its effect at the target site by causing activation of monocytes This could be best explained by the secondary release of pro inflammatory substances such as IFN and IL 1 by circulating or intra tumoral lymphoid cells as most of the genes identified are known to be responsive to the effect of either of these cytokines These pro inflammatory cytokines are probably responsible for the direct activation of monocytes as suggested by the upregulation of CD64 and IL 1R Figure 8 In addition gene profiling identified genes whose expression is most probably dependent upon IL 1 and IFN rather than IL 2 genes for MHC molecules HSP70 MxA MxB and other IFN inducible proteins It is possible that macrophage activation is followed by release of pro inflammatory chemokines such as IL 8 MCP 3 MIP 1 MIP and MIG These indirect effects of IL 2 within the tumor microenvironment seem also to affect the activation of dendritic cells DCs through the expression of PARC MCP4 Finally activation of macrophages results in the upregulation of the expression of molecules with lytic activity such as calgranulin and grancalcin Although it is possible that the downstream effects noted after IL 2 administration could be attributed to stimulation of tumor cells exposure of three melanoma cell lines LF1TU 624 38 and A375 to supernatant from IL 2 conditioned PBMC identified transcriptional changes only in a small proportion of these genes for IFI 16 IFN R2 and TGF inducible protein data not shown The results therefore suggest that IL 2 exerts its primary role at tumor sites through the release of pro inflammatory cytokines On the basis of the transcriptional profile identified we postulate that IL 1 and IFN are the most likely cytokines responsible for this phenomenon These in turn activate a local inflammation probably through induction of monocytes and macrophages This inflammatory process can subsequently help recruit immune cells from the periphery and or activate locally infiltrating cells This hypothesis is appealing because it converges on IFN as a central mediator of immune regulation within the tumor microenvironment Recent murine experiments have shown that IFN may be the central mediator of immune surveillance in the immunocompetent host 25 This cytokine could possibly also have a central role in therapeutic settings It may have broad downstream effects that according to our findings can be best summarized as activation and maturation of monocytes DCs in concert with the release by these cells of chemokines capable of attracting lymphoid cells to the tumor These in turn may complete the activation of cells of the monocytic lineage which can then switch their function from cross tolerization to cross priming 26 A particular subset of genes whose expression appeared to be associated with a clinical response was noted Although this observation was based on a single lesion we were surprised to observe among them the genes for NKG5 MHC class II which was upregulated beyond the level noted in non responding samples and T cell receptor which have all been recently associated with acute rejection of renal allografts 23 24 and M Sarwal unpublished data The phenomenon of allograft rejection and IL 2 induced tumor rejection may not only be characterized by the induction of a vigorous inflammatory response but share a common cytotoxic effector mechanism NK T cell degranulation that is ultimately responsible for direct tissue destruction This observation agrees with the suggested synergistic role of IFN and effector T cells in controlling tumor growth in experimental models 25 In vitro studies are presently ongoing testing whether the changes in expression profile noted in tumor samples following IL 2 administration can be directly ascribed to the effects of IFN and or IL 1 on monocytes Conclusions The results of this study suggest that IL 2 administration induces inflammation at the tumor site with three predominant secondary effects activation of antigen presenting monocytes a massive production of chemoattractants that may recruit other immune cells to the tumor site among which are the chemokines MIG and PARC specific for T cells and the activation of lytic mechanisms ascribable to monocytes calgranulin grancalcin and NK cells for example NKG5 NK4 Figure 8 In practical terms these results suggest that systemic IL 2 administration may facilitate T cell effector function in the target organ not by sustaining their proliferation as presently believed but rather by promoting their migration and by providing a milieu conducive to their activation in situ through activation of antigen presenting cells If this hypothesis is correct then adoptive transfer of effector T cells should follow rather than precede as at present administration of systemic IL 2 27 28
