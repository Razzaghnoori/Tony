somewhat Wednesday s spin from U S and International Monetary Fund officials Our 41 billion bailout package to Brazil two months ago saved its economy and stopped the global financial meltdown

spending The programs include long term health care after school programs new cops and aid to disabled workers This comes after the tobacco industry killed last year s legislation backed by Clinton that would have brought the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars Now that the states have struck their own settlement deal with the industry Clinton is considering whether to extract some of that money by withholding Medicaid reimbursements to the states Old spin Clinton underestimated the tobacco industry s savvy resolve and ruthlessness New spin The tobacco industry underestimated Clinton s savvy resolve and ruthlessness 1 15 99 The 2000 presidential race was shuffled again On the Republican side House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich R Ohio and former Gov Lamar Alexander R Tenn formed exploratory committees joining Sen John McCain R Ariz and Sen Bob Smith R N H The major headline is still the evidently emerging candidacy of Elizabeth Dole She trails Gov George W Bush R Texas 42 22 in the latest national poll of GOP voters but she edges Bush 31 30 in New Hampshire with the other candidates eating their dust On the Democratic side Vice President Gore and Sen Bill Bradley D N J have launched their campaigns while Sen Bob Kerrey D Neb and Sen Paul Wellstone D Minn have bowed out The big Democratic story is that House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt is reportedly planning to skip the race as well focusing instead on winning back the House and becoming speaker 1 15 99 Michael Jordan retired He said he was physically fit but mentally exhausted The media responded with worshipful saturation coverage reciting his records six championships 10 scoring titles five Most Valuable Player Awards and the highest per game scoring average ever and replaying highlights especially his final shot which won last year s championship The spins in order of descending reverence 1 He was the greatest and most popular athlete of all time 2 How fitting that he s going out on top 3 We ll miss his heroism 4 Without him we re left with players who kick photographers and choke coaches 5 Without him we re left with players and owners whose greed has nearly destroyed the sport 6 His retirement is final just like last time 7 According to Italy s La Repubblica America would willingly take Clinton s retirement in exchange for Jordan s 1 13 99 H ustler publisher Larry Flynt accused Rep Bob Barr R Ga of adultery and hypocrisy Barr has been one of the House s most aggressive prosecutors of President Clinton s misconduct in the Lewinsky scandal In an affidavit paid for and released by Flynt Barr s ex wife accuses Barr of having an affair with another woman whom he has since married She also says he knew of her plans to have an abortion and didn t try to dissuade her Barr refused to answer questions about the affair during his divorce hearing Flynt s spin Barr is a hypocrite for ducking the questions and then prosecuting Clinton for evasive testimony about sex Barr s spins 1 He declined to answer questions whereas Clinton answered them falsely 2 He never suggested urged forced or encouraged anyone to have an abortion 3 Larry Flynt s money has been used in an attempt to drive a wedge between the mother and father of two wonderful boys 4 This is very clearly an effort to take old documents and divert attention from Clinton s trial 5 I m going to do the honorable thing and present the case that I ve been elected to present in the Senate 1 13 99 The baseball Mark McGwire hit for his 70 th home run last season sold for 3 million The previous record price for a baseball was 126 500 The record price for a baseball card is 640 000 The cost of the McGwire ball before it went out of the park was 10 The spins in order of ascending cynicism 1 Isn t it swell that Philip Ozersky the 30 000 a year medical researcher who caught the ball is now a millionaire 2 The bidding went nuts because baseball fever is back 3 The bidding went nuts because rich people have money to burn 4 Three million dollars for a baseball makes sense because players are beginning to get 100 million contracts 5 Now the fans who caught McGwire s other home run balls and returned them for free feel like suckers 6 Ozersky s spin I m glad I did this I was just a research scientist now I m a media star 7 At the same auction the ball Hank Aaron hit for his record setting 755 th career home run drew no bids 1 13 99 Egypt and Saudi Arabia called for the overthrow of Saddam Hussein First Saddam urged Arab masses to overthrow Arab leaders who boast of friendship with the United States Then Iraqi legislators accused Saudi Arabia and Kuwait of complicity in the recent U S British bombing of Iraq and proposed to rescind Iraq s recognition of Kuwaiti sovereignty The official Saudi press agency responded by urging an Iraqi revolution against Saddam and the Egyptians agreed This is the first explicit advocacy by Arab governments of Saddam s overthrow The rosy spin Saddam is playing with fire The sober spin So are Egypt and Saudi Arabia whose governments moderate pro United States policies are unpopular at home 1 11 99 Attorney General Janet Reno became the longest serving attorney general of the 20 th century The spins 1 It s amazing considering she was President Clinton s haphazard third choice 2 It s amazing considering she oversaw the Waco fiasco barely a month into her tenure 3 It s amazing considering she s done nothing of note in six years 4 It s amazing considering Clinton doesn t trust her 5 It s unsurprising since if Clinton replaced her with somebody he trusted it would look like an attempt to shield himself from further scrutiny by the Justice Department 6 It s unsurprising since she s served Clinton well by quashing independent counsel investigations of his scandals 7 What s amazing is that the press is so bored it s making a fuss over how long she s been in office 1 11 99 The National Football League semifinals are set The Minnesota Vikings will host the Atlanta Falcons in one bracket The Denver Broncos will host the New York Jets in the other The Vikings Falcons winner will be the first team to get to the Super Bowl after playing its home games in an indoor dome In the on field tournament the Vikings have the NFL s best record this year and set a record for points scored in a regular season but the Broncos are the defending champs and were undefeated until their final three games However in the off field sentimental tournament the Falcons and Jets have more appealing story lines The Falcons were 3 13 two years ago and are inspired by their coach Dan Reeves who had quadruple bypass surgery a month ago The Jets were 1 15 two years ago and are one win away from their first Super Bowl since the famous Joe Namath triumph in 1969 Both teams story lines are marred by the fact that their coaches have been to the Super Bowl with other teams 1 11 99
