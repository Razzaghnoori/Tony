              okay   okay now when you babysit what age group children do you sit with   well gosh all kinds um mostly between the ages of two and ten um last like a few summers ago i kept two children every day for the entire summer and i mean they became like my children   uhhuh id think so   and um and they live in an apartment complex so we swam a lot and we played on the playground a lot and we would go to a movie on Thursdays and um there was always an activity you know they had their favorite TV shows and things like that that we watched and then we took naps and um i dont know it it just seems like there was always something to do children are so full of energy   uhhuh   and oh they were they just they they just keep you going   now was this a one parent or two parent family   uh one parent   one parent how much time did she spend with them   yeah shes just not much at all  i mean i would get there at eight oclock in the morning the children usually werent awake by then and she would get home at like five thirty in the afternoon   uhhuh   and they would have dinner and then it was time for them to go to bed   uhhuh   um now at this particular time the children were two and six but then i also ive been babysitting this child uh for about eight years hes nine now and um you know ive watched him grow up and hes like a little brother to me   uhhuh   and its changed over the over the years um we get along a lot better now that hes older and uh we do different things now we used to play ball a lot but now its he likes to watch TV and hes into wrestling and um i kept him on Friday night we went see we went to go see a movie and um things like that but i feel like i dont know when i have children i want to be able to spend a lot of time with them   do you now you say your you go to school   uhhuh i go to LSU   and what are you studying   uh communications   well sounds like your getting a lot of experience in communicating with children   oh yeah i mean i love children um i dont know seem when i was growing up my Mom stayed at home with me and my brother until we were in junior high       and i dont it would i think it was very beneficial to us i mean like in the summer we were always in the library programs reading books and we went skating a lot and   uhhuh   you know she was just always there for us but nowadays if there are two parents to a family the mother works just as hard as the father does and the children either stay at home and get into trouble or theyre stuck in a day care and i just i just dont want my children to have to be raised like that all my friends they their parents worked all the time they got to stay at home by themselves and when i was younger i thought they were lucky because they got to get away with things like i couldnt ride my bike across the street but they could because theyre Mom would never know it but now i realize that it was better because   uhhuh yeah   um they have got into a lot of trouble   uhhuh   because of lack of supervision   well that that certainly can happen now if you you say youre in communications uh what base of communications would you be most interested in getting in to   uhhuh well im majoring in uh public relations   public relations so so you would have a job with a company   yeah yes maam   rather than uh radio or television or newspapers or what have you   right uhhuh   and uh then youd be willing to give up your job to stay home and with or stay with the children   well i would like to uh stay at home with my children for at least the first five years   uhhuh   but what what i plan to do in the future is um go ahead and get my upper education as far as my masters and work on my doctorate and teach um college   uhhuh uhhuh   and in that case then ill be ill be at home when my children are at home but id like to stay at home with them until they get in at least into kindergarten   uhhuh   where theyre at school from what eight to three or something and then i would be at my school teaching   uhhuh uhhuh   and um   well that thats uh is an advantage of being in the education field i spent thirty four years in education   oh really   yes and so oh i started out with college and then went to high school and then i preferred the high school age level much better than i did the college because you have a closer relationship with the uh students   what grade oh did you what did you teach   that i taught physical education   oh oh i started out as a PE major   uhhuh   in education i wanted to be a PE teacher i sure did   well i uh i found that uh it was a perfect combination from the standpoint of having vacations off at the same time   oh yeah   and uh and it worked out fine from that standpoint uh plus the fact that uh when i left uh usually uh my husband was seldom home for maybe forty five minutes or so and then our son he had to get on the bus and he did get on the bus it was his responsibility and he never ever thought   uhhuh   of uh not going to school he said in view of the fact that he was certain i had a hot line to his school because uh i uh well i i was in physical education then and i just kept getting pushed into administration wound up in administration   absolutely oh   and so he thought surely that i or i would have bought a hot line to know if he ever skipped school which of course was not the case and i wouldnt have checked on him however uh there are there are points       both directions in that uh from the standpoint of parents working and not working   yeah   uh i listened to more than one parent say i dont know what this child wants im working two jobs they each have their own television they each have their own telephone they each have their own rooms they each have this they each have that id say but what they dont have is you   thats right they need some attention   absolutely and uh acting out because that is the way of getting attention   well see whenever my Mom stayed home with us we did without a lot i mean we were its hard to make it on one income but we did and and we lived in a trailer for eighteen years and um   thats right huh   you know we we only had one car we only had one telephone you know we didnt get to eat out all the time but i i feel like that it helped me now because i appreciate the value of the dollar   uhhuh right   and um i also had the supervision that i needed while i was growing up and i hope that i can provide that for my child too   and we certainly uh we need more of that we need more parents willing to supervise though weve had such a breakdown in the family structure from the standpoint of of uh church and school and everything along the way   oh we have   and that i think has contributed much to uh the delinquency that works grant and the poor school results that were having uh that the students uh parents have just not really taken enough interest in them from the very very beginning and i think my feeling was that the very best teachers should be in grades one two and three to get the students off to a good start let them have positive um uh experiences from the lower levels so they want to continue learning and uh keep going and not wait until theyre theyre in the ninth and tenth grades its too late then you cannot reverse that trend at that point   uhhuh it is its way too late i agree   right and uh while parents very often will be involved with the school activities when the childs in the elementary school and they get into the high schools so often they seem to drop away at that point and that is just as valuable   it is   at that time as to the rush in the elementary yes right   because all the peer pressure it starts in high school and the parent really needs to be there for the child   right and uh the child needs to take pride in the fact that their parent is doing something uh we were fortunate in view of the fact that my son did play football and i did keep statistics for his team and his Dad did take movies of the football   oh great   team and movies of the basketball team and we tried to be a part of it but not overshadowing him or making him feel that we had to be there all the time   yeah   so what i feel that i learned a great deal from my students uh with regard to what their biggest complaints were with parents and a thing such as uh one of the biggest complaints i well remember because i spent a lot of time with seniors uh was um caring their parents say when i was your age i didnt have this or that and i know i never ever said that because i knew that that was one thing that was really irritating to young people   uhhuh well i guess that was good that you were you were hearing it from other students   yes and i had to deal with their problems and i could talk about the kinds of problems which they were bringing that they had just in general aspect and our son would share this and then he would have to make decisions for himself along those same types of of uh lines   well um   so that i think he benefited from my experiences   does your son work for TI   no   oh   no he uh works uh for a different company yeah in the Dallas area but when he went away to college and he was on an allowance from the time he was in the seventh grade and uh a small allowance and all the way through college and he held three jobs while he was in college and we didnt even know it he didnt even tell us uh that he had three jobs but when he graduated he had a five thousand dollar bank account   oh goodness     and uh we had told him that if he ever wanted to go to college he could go if he got married he was on his own if he flunked out he was on his own
