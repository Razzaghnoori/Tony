 Take Two Tabloids and Call Me in the Morning Dave Oddly in midtown it s a balmy 72 degrees You really ought to come up here for a visit it s lovely OK so it s actually freezing cold here colder than the mayor s heart as New Yorkers like to say Or as I like to imagine they like to say Since there seems to be no earth shattering news in today s papers let s go right to my favorite story the 78 year old doorman retiring from the Plaza Hotel What I like about this story is that it s a perfect tabloid story a heart tugging human interest piece with lots of celebrity names and since both tabloids were clearly tipped off to it it provides an ideal opportunity to compare and contrast the New York Post and the Daily News As it happens their coverage confirms a long held belief of mine You don t mess with Gersh Kuntzman Kuntzman is as best I can tell responsible for something like half of the text that appears in the Post each day You can find his byline all through a typical day s paper usually appended to a few news items and at least one human interest story written with all the tough guy with a heart of gold panache you expect from the tabloids but so rarely get I like to imagine him as the sort of newspaper reporter you d see in movies from the 1940s pounding the street from dawn to dusk picking up tips from shoeshine boys and calling his boss Chief For an object lesson in the magic of Gersh Kuntzman compare the Plaza doorman stories in the News and the Post Both papers do a fine job of hitting the guy s career highlights the Beatles Jackie Gleason Lana Turner But the News glosses over the reason for his retirement Szorentini decided that yesterday would be his last day Gersh however gets the scoop I wouldn t be leaving this job if it weren t for my heart I feel like I ve lost everything Szorentini said crying Advantage Post This actually ties in with my earlier thought on Monday about the division of labor between the city s papers It s actually far more finely nuanced than I initially said It s not just that the Times handles the serious news and the News and Post handle the fun frivolous stuff There are also subdivisions among the tabloids The Post has better gossip more celebrity coverage and of course Gersh Kuntzman The News has better TV coverage better city news coverage and Doonesbury You really have to buy all three papers if you want to make one whole one and the Wall Street Journal if you d like a business section plus lifestyle pieces on how to spend 20 000 in a hurry As for the character issue it seems to me to be a convenient canard to distract attention from the fact that the candidates real differences run the gamut from A to well pretty much A It s not so much that they re all saying the same thing there are some substantive differences in their approaches to policy as it is that the public has by now picked up the sense that those differences won t necessarily result in substantially different outcomes in the long run The president is not after all king he has Congress to contend with and even once a law has been passed it doesn t necessarily mean that it ll be enforced The barriers between a candidate s rhetoric and his achievable results mean that the two bear the same relation that an original document does to its 200 th photocopy So like I said the character thing is a canard Which means duck Perhaps instead of focusing on the character issue each character should groom a duck to be his representative and we could all grade them on grooming behavior ability to do tricks and the like I d like that Tim
