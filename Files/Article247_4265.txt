 A Rationalist s Guide to New Year s Sentimentality Having read all the Op Eds and magazine articles mocking millennial emotions as so much numerological bunk Culturebox is well aware that this New Year s Eve is strictly speaking meaningless She knows that the year 2000 arrives at least 2 005 years after Christ was actually born that due to an error in calculation stemming from medieval ignorance of the number zero the new millennium doesn t start till next year that the Gregorian calendar is filled with arbitrary adjustments and slippages and so forth But Culturebox also knows that when she raises her glass at 11 59 50 p m the day after tomorrow she ll feel a wave of excited anxiety She suspects you ll feel it too She does not believe that the obvious culprits Y2K terrorism the usual New Year s hype that makes you feel that everyone else is having a better time than you are entirely responsible Like most of the rest of America apparently Culturebox won t be flying or driving or congregating downtown or eating at some ludicrously overpriced New Year s extravaganza She ll be at the home of friends standing beside her loved ones etc And when New Year s arrives and she experiences that brief sense of being overwhelmed by something she can t explain she ll be tempted to dismiss it as she does every year as sentimental and superstitious But is it What is New Year s anyway if not a reminder that time has passed which is to say that death has drawn that much closer New Year s 2000 is just New Year s to a higher degree For lack of a better reference point Culturebox has spent her entire life dividing it into before the year 2000 and after New Year s Eve is the moment this personal temporal marker arrives for what it s worth It s actually not unreasonable to feel awe on this New Year s Eve even if you don t believe that it is the 2000th anniversary of the birth of the era of our savior The great religions are a product of the same sense of awe They were invented in large part to help us deal with the terrifying fact that time propels us toward our own destruction The revolution of Judaism was that it transformed time from cyclical to historical a history belonging to man but directed by God so that the Jews could think of a future beyond mortality Christianity posited two shining moments one in the past and one in the future when human time meets up with eternal time Those are of course Christ s appearance and return Before Islam the Arabs believed that the passing of time led them inexorably to a horrible fate their God was created partly to guarantee that the fullness of time would be good rather than evil The Hindus banished time altogether by calling it unreal The Greeks had a word for a moment in time that seemed to stand apart from other moments They called it a kairos an auspicious moment le moment juste The existential philosopher Martin Heidegger translated the concept into the German word Augenblick an instant that occurs in the blink of an eye To Heidegger this is an interval in which the world opens up and we are allowed perceive it differently to grasp it more authentically Maybe New Year s Eve 2000 is one such blink of the eye an opening in time which forces us to grapple with time and death Enjoy it if you can
