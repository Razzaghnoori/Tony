                okay   well i do not know how big a city is Rome i mean you have heard about Dallas and the the crime here is pretty bad   well Rome pretty small but uh we hear a lot about uh New York City there is a lot of crime down there and i am i am afraid to go down there because   yeah i was going to say uhhuh   you know i mean you hear about people getting mugged You leave your car for ten minutes and it is stripped when you come back so   yeah have you ever been there   no i have not only to the airport   that is uh probably enough to see  um are you in college right now     no i am i work at for the Air Force so there is a base up here and   oh okay are base thats interesting interesting concept are bases safe you know   bases are pretty safe because they check your ID on your way in and   yeah the they uh minimize the access   right but even so we had a um um at New Years we had some people come in and uh   uhhuh   like attack one of the planes because they were protesting uh the presence over in the Persian Gulf   oh no sure oh great thats wonderful yeah well Dallas uh we lived in Minneapolis uh we moved here about ten months ago and   so   Dallas is pretty uh well we live in north Texas north Dallas which is like a suburb near a suburb called Plano so we are out of the city but it is uh it is bad everywhere in terms of uh you know the handgun situation um the number of rapes the number of muggings just its its i would not say it is not as bad as New York but it is pretty scary you know people put bars on their windows in certain neighborhoods and you know they call them ornamental grates but they are still bars   yeah yep that makes it bad for getting out during a fire   yeah it really does and if youre a little bit claustrophobic but uh i dont know i mean the jails are crowded i i im not a criminal justice specialist so i dont know what you know what can be done im   i dont i dont know it seems to i think it is getting worse because i keep hearing things like i when i was home i went home my parents live in Boston but i went home and we were watching TV and   you know uhhuh   this thing came on where these a group of like five or six guys went and filmed themselves beating up people in the street and and robbing them and it was really disgusting and my mom was like they should just be all shot right now and   oh   i mean you hear   were they teenagers or like that girl in New York that got beat up by you know when she was jogging in Central Park a couple of years ago   um yeah yeah um they werent i think they were early twenties they were young men   huh yeah but they so they werent you know and were they uh were they were they obviously poor or deprived you know that is really strange sick   i know and how  deprived could they be if they had a camcorder those are a thousand bucks   yeah unless they stole it and i mean that is one big thing down here i mean they have like uh and they are not all young i mean they are eighteen to twenty four some of the young men and women but i mean you can you can see the Crime Stoppers ads on television or sometimes its the same people that have been that have been observed and they still cant catch them   yeah   and you are wondering how you know um we lived in Minneapolis and Wisconsin i mean there was all kind of i i know i i i know it is getting worse i do not know what the world is or is not um the  in a small town in Wisconsin near Madison um a young boy somehow got a hold of a shotgun and killed his parents and his three brothers and sisters   uhhuh     and the child had and he they said that he was twelve years old and he had uh he had not uh displayed any tendencies deviant or disturbed or whatever you know and you are thinking to yourself um i know   yeah i wonder where i do not know i wonder where he gets it you know you must i think TV is bad because they uh show all sorts of violence on   that and i dont think a lot of parents i mean i dont i dont know how it is in the Air Force base but uh i just dont think a lot of people because of the economy both need to work you know i just dont think a lot of parents are that involved any more   yeah they dont they dont talk to their kids and take them out and and arent there all the time so the kids are off to their own devices a lot     right and discipline i do not know how your folks were but i mean i sure knew as heck when i was growing up that uh my parents were   oh definitely   the superior and i was the subordinate and you know it was sort of like there were boundaries and i do not think i do not know i think today a lot of parents um are ruled by their kids i i   i think so definitely when you go to a restaurant like kids are running all over the place they   yeah right i mean theyre  not learning such as well like boundaries i mean i dont i see it in work place too sometimes i  do not know how old you are but you sound a little bit younger than me but i am in my thirties and i i i see um even people that work with me that are ten years younger that you know they kind of have an attitude that i hate i i hate to say it but its thats just what it is it is an attitude like the world owes them something   yep but right i i see that too in the Air Force especially oh yeah a lot of uh especially since a lot of us are engineers where i work   do you are you in the Air Force okay   im in the Air Force and so people outside the Air Force doing engineering get paid a lot more than we do and so all the young engineers are like well i am just going you know get it for all it is worth and that you know and i am like you are the one who signed up if you did not want to do it and   sure   right right right and the Air Force is one of the bitter better military supposedly military military experiences i mean   yep it is i like it but uh   pardon me   i like it so far   i mean that is are you going to be a career person im digressing but  i dont talk to many people in the military so i am     oh probably not but um they pay for my college so      thats the way to do it i mean and thats you know at least the Air Force is i dont know i just um i am nervous in Dallas i mean i you know i mean i go to like an aerobics class or something you know i um seventy women in your average size exercise class in a public um parks and rec building and you are supposed to feel safe but then there are all these it doesnt matter race but you know its an interracial mix and you see these guys standing there watching you jump around in your leotards leotards   yep   and i do not even think that way but i mean you just think to yourself you you just i mean nobody can think that that it cant happen to them no matter who they are or where they are at you know   it yeah and you never know who is watching either   i mean did you i do not know i was in the grocery store this morning we um went to New Orleans for four days and came back late last night driving its about seven hours um and thats a very we had never been there thats a very very neat town to visit uh in terms of the French Quarter and all of th e things you hear about but the crime is so bad there     uhhuh right   i mean in all the tourist brochures you read about what you should or should not do how to carry your wallet um   uhhuh this is New Orleans oh id hate to be there during Mardi Gras let   New Orleans yeah i would never yeah you just dont dont even bother its not worth it uh the when we came back i dont know if you have seen i was in the super market this morning and on the cover of Time magazine there is a girl she is in Boston she is on the east coast somewhere real attractive young girl college freshman i college coed i think she is a freshman shed been dating a fellow for several weeks and they went back to her dorm room and date rape i mean and it just   uhhuh uhhuh   she she looked anguished i mean it was really just sad i mean didnt pick it up and read it but i should have but i just looked at the picture and thought what a world   i know   i mean i do not yeah i do not have any uh cure   you cant trust anybody its its really scary   no you really cant i mean i they we lease out a really nice two story town home in North Dallas and they have a real big thing here people i mean even dry cleaners knock on the door and are soliciting you know they everybody wants your business kind of thing and my husband is the kind of guy hes   right   hes sometime he was raised on a farm in southern Ohio near Dayton and think sometimes it is just he and i are very different in terms of that i i mean i basically have started not to trust anybody in general street smarts   right     and uh he opened the door i came downstairs and i was real upset and i probably got more nasty  than i should have but i just said Howard you know oh my God i would not i mean     well you you hear about people opening the door and getting blown away or people you know   oh yeah And it does i mean it is it is not a reason i mean i have been to New York You shouldnt deny yourself going to visit and all that   uhhuh   uh but it is not any worse i used to work for a mortgage company that was owned by uh are you from Boston   yeah   Home Owners Savings and Loan in Boston and i know i never felt   uhhuh   i mean ive been to downtown New York City and ive been to downtown Boston and i never felt any safer on Milk Street in Boston staying at the Meridian i didnt  pay for but i mean i never felt any safer there than i did in any other city in any other city i have been in you know     right   so i would say one thing do not deny yourself the New York experience but experience but go with people that you know   yeah i wouldnt want to go by myself   no uh but i mean it yeah i dont know i mean i i guess i could go on and on about what to do about criminals uh i think the handgun im not real big on guns myself so i mean   uhhuh i think our justice system needs to be stricter i mean because everyone they do it and then they get out in a couple of years it seems like   are the New York uh are the New York i do not know how the New York state prison system is but   they are booked up yeah   are they booked up  that is a way to put it they are booked up Are they paroling uh like murderers and i mean here it is just a real big deal they parole people that have killed police officers and then they are out doing it again     right um i do not i do not know because i am not real up on a lot of news things but you know you just hear about that that you know it is a lot of repeat crime   uhhuh uhhuh   and you are like why are they repeating they should have been in there longer or   i know and then you think i mean i have i mean i can remember i havent been out of school that long but it has been at least ten years and you think to yourself was it that bad back then or is it just i think that like you said television is it just that more people think there is like excitement in it you know i mean people that may have been close to the edge just go over because they see something or read something   it seems like a lot of it that it is more like in Boston there was a case of uh a couple of kids fifteen year olds they wanted to see what it was like to kill someone so they they picked on this kid who was like new in town and they were like well no one was going to miss him anyway   uhhuh   you know and it like ugh that is horrible how can you even think like that   oh God it it is yeah isnt it something i mean i i have a i am originally from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania and i have a niece and nephew and i just um i mean my ten year old nephew  says things that he is aware of that i am just going Michael how did you hear about that       you know it is just i think kids get too much too fast and all those sort of things in Atlanta where my inlaws live um they had that thing you know the high top sneakers the Air Jordans et cetera   yeah right   kids killing each other and beating their brains out you know right or the or the jackets the team like the Raiders and the caps you know stealing the hundred dollar jackets um   oh for the sneakers yeah yep   i mean it is i guess it goes from the most petty like that to like what you were saying that they in Boston that is crime where they videoed that is probably one of the most bizarre i have heard of where they videotape themselves   yep yeah it seems like a crime is turning into a pastime instead of like you know be
