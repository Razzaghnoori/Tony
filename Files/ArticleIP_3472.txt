 The Usable Past Sometimes you read a preface by a writer who doesn t seem to have absorbed the book he purports to be introducing In his opening remarks for Eyes of the Nation A Visual History of the United States Librarian of Congress James H Billington strikes a fondly nationalistic note What makes the American narrative unique is the ability we have displayed time and again to remedy our mistakes to adjust to changing circumstances to debate and then move on in directions that seem better for all These words which might be appropriate for a Time Life coffee table volume titled say We the People seriously misrepresent the downbeat contemplative collaboration of picture editor Vincent Virga and historian Alan Brinkley Far from being a celebratory collection of inspiring American images Eyes of the Nation is in stretches at least a lavishly illustrated bad trip through 500 years of heavy handed nation building Though it s hard to sustain a point of view when the goal is to be best selling and definitive the book s reigning mood is progressive populism tempered by realistic pessimism After a bit of visual throat clearing Eyes of the Nation begins in earnest with a drawing of the Indian village of Secota on Roanoke Island in what would become North Carolina It shows neat rows of corn Ceremonial dancers A central marketplace The drawing done by an expedition mate of Sir Walter Raleigh s portrays the state of native grace that the rest of the chapter Encounter 1492 1600 depicts a falling away from The emphasis is on European ignorance backed by engravings of fanciful New World monsters and references to Shakespeare s The Tempest a play inspired by explorers journals The rise of Spanish English conflict marks the exit from Eden From the moment the European rivals began fighting among themselves for territory the security of villages like Secotan came to an end What follows is several pages The Garden linked thematically rather than chronologically picturing sunflowers rattlesnakes and bison The color plates are pretty the captions neutral and informative but the metaphorical message is sharp Behold what was lost Chapter 2 drives home the point Titled The World Turn d Upside Down 1600 1800 it opens with an apocalyptic watercolor America A Prophecy by William Blake Though it resembles a standard high school history text with chapters on the Civil War immigration imperial expansion and so on Eyes of the Nation is a book one flips through not a book one views and reads in sequence It speaks through clusters of words and images not through argument and exposition Open to Page 240 for example and you ll find stills from D W Griffith s Intolerance juxtaposed with a pencil sketch of the Lincoln Monument and on the facing page a photograph of a charred and limbless lynched black male surrounded by smiling whites in coats and ties combine a black and white shot of Dust Bowl farmers a fertile California tomato field captured by Edward Weston and a Technicolor Emerald City from The Wizard of Oz The ironies aren t always as blunt as these but in general it is tension not harmony that governs the arrangements The richest part of the book is its middle Visually there are just more sparks to strike after the invention of the camera and the flowering of modern advertising The writing brightens too Brinkley a highly class conscious historian is better at robber barons depressions strikes and grass roots politics than at wars and natural history He knows how to isolate cultural decision points the moment say when the populist cause was lost and William Jennings Bryan became a fool and how to pin down such phantom entities as social conformity between the wars and Southern agrarian idealism Though Brinkley s sympathies clearly lie with the progressives he has a knack for portraying reactionaries His Klansmen and red baiters are people too not just bigots but also misguided dreamers And though hindsight sometimes breeds determinism Brinkley is alert to alternative histories and paths just barely not taken The book concludes in orthodox multiculturalism and a surprisingly bitter estimate of America s democratic potential America approached the century s end as fractured along social racial ethnic economic gender and regional lines as it had been in all but a few moments in its history with a culture so diverse and so contentious that it seemed to lack any coherence or shape with declining faith in its government its leaders and its principal institutions The facing page shows a picture of a brick wall scratched full of chalk marks tallying enemy deaths in the Gulf War Less conventionally ambitious and possibly more affecting because of it is Michael Lesy s Dreamland America at the Dawn of the Twentieth Century a collection of turn of the century photographic postcards that are both graphically gorgeous and spiritually haunting Silvery and immaculate with hallucinatory depth and detail the pictures of Western mines and Eastern skyscrapers cotton fields and battleships boomtown main streets and metropolitan train stations have a strangely deserted Sunday morning feel as if they represented the first day or perhaps the last of American modernity The first thing one notices paging through the book is that objects both natural and man made looked larger and more heroic in those days if only because the people were fewer Call it the age of titanic capitalism Shots of the Flatiron Building under construction are weirdly short on human passersby implying that the growth required to fill the place is still a hopeful article of faith not yet a practical reality That the American Century was built before the bulk of its tenants had arrived is one of those facts that shouldn t be any surprise but comes as a revelation nonetheless Lesy s text a filled in time line that notes such events as the founding of department stores the rise of banks and financial institutions and the erection of famous public monuments creates in combination with the pictures a retrospective mood that isn t nostalgia but a finer more elevated yearning The sadness is not for what was or even for what might have been but for what always comes between the two the feeling of being in the eternal dream absorbing imperfect present On Page 13 there s a shot of New York schoolboys admiring a sidewalk assortment of metal windup toys One boy who looks wiser than his friends glares at the camera seemingly aware that his image is being delivered to the future He appears to anticipate and resent our patronizing spying He doesn t like us We re from now and he s from way back when and he already seems to know we ve let him down
