 This is an interview with Darlene Maurer interviewing Eric St John So Eric would you tell us what stories or book you remember reading as a child What was your favorite story Uh my favorite book or stories were the uh phew The Cat in the Hat because I always loved all of the colors And there s always all of the kids were having a great time while the parents left and it was like one big huge flight of fancy and they just go from one thing to another thing and it was like really fun and chaotic and just neat And then and then it was always like an adventure though because then all of a sudden toward the end like the parents are coming back And we all know that if we don t have everything cleaned up you re going to get punished And so it was like Can they do it Can they do it Can they get cleaned up in time Are they going to make it So it s like having a blast and going on a flight of fancy and then coming back to reality and then like not getting caught kind of And they always did And what age were you when you read this Oh boy I don t know I was probably anywhere from anywhere five on up I don t have a lot of memories I can remember four and earlier They come once in a while but I don t really have anything real strong But uh I loved the colors and all the illustrations too and just the zaniness And then everything s a little bit later I really I loved reading I would be this is more like when I was eight nine and ten and 11 I would have a bedtime and it was always way earlier than I wanted but I would lay I would have this little lamp I d put underneath my bedcovers and I would be reading And I would read I would read like baseball biographies I loved baseball still do but uh you know just to read about these famous people and dream about playing sports and being some kind of hero And uh every once in a while I think my dad caught onto that but uh he d come down and tell me to shut the shut the lamp off every once in a while But uh I d usually I just read and read and read I m surprised I didn t set the whole house on fire with that high intensity lamp So what baseball hero did you want to be when you grew up Oh I wanted to be uh Harmon Killebrew because I was from MN Hmm He was the famous slugger from MN played for the Twins And then when I d play baseball I I could hit pretty good too when I was real young I couldn t in high school I became a pitcher Uh huh And they never hit but uh I always loved biographies of of famous people and events in history as I got older And uh I still have kind of a passion for history and historical type things Uh golly Also some of these other questions that also leads to the fact that uh my brother you know I had seven or six brothers and sisters four until I was 11 and then three more joined the family when I was 11 And my my younger brother was he s like the most hilarious storyteller And I remember his stories too because he would just make them up and just it would just be zaniness And yet he was he was really funny too and he could make faces and really creative even as a little kid He s always the happy go lucky kid and I was the oldest But it was a blast to hear him tell stories and then just start building off of them and just go all over the place I guess that s kind of like The Cat in the Hat story too But uh that was I liked him He was a really good storyteller Now a good as I get older a really good storyteller is my other brother who is like really serious You never really catch him really laughing he s always really controlled But he tells a good story with a dry sense of humor and uh golly he spent his career in the Army still he just went to Germany But uh those are the two best storytellers I know in our family I remember my dad my dad told us he would tell us stories about his childhood but usually usually from him that that doesn t really come until later But uh when he would start telling about when he was a teenager some of the some of the teenaged stuff he and his teenaged brothers did when they worked for their dad s business my grandfather Uh I didn t I never did know him I don t remember him he died when I was four But it was hilarious just hearing what they did I m surprised they re still in business Well they were in business Do you remember any of the stories Oh yeah How hard it was how hard it is you know way back then they would drive half ton trucks They were only half ton trucks and they would drive grain feed around and coal and stuff to the farmers in MN in southern MN But they would the father my grandfather wanted to save money so he would rig them up so they d haul he d haul a ton and a half on a half ton truck And so he was constantly busting up and twisting up axles and he always he would get mad when the sons would do it Uh huh which usually meant that they weren t being careful But anyway their stories would go on and on about going one mile an hour up a hill taking forever to get somewhere driving getting up a head up steam in the winter and Bucking snowdrifts is what they called it The snowdrifts would come out into the streets into the road and uh this was in rural MN so half the time you couldn t see where the road was anyway but they would go plowing these snowdrifts you know It was all fun and teenaged fun until you until you ended up in a ditch in the middle of a blizzard You broke the radiator or twisted an axle of a truck and had to call your dad and tell him what happened Oh And top of that of course all the dad all the grandfather wanted he wanted the customer serviced Get the job done Of course you re in the ditch trying to explain what happened but uh Was that your dad or his brother Both Both Both would do that I think my dad was the ringleader he was the oldest also What year do you think that would have been That was probably uh golly my dad was born in 1926 So when he was 15 and 16ish probably the early 40s as best I can tell from those stories because they both went into the service very late my dad went into the service at the very end of World War II and my uncle served in Korea So that would be about right I tell you I don t really remember anyone reading stories to me that s although I know my mom did I just have a sense that that happened but I don t remember specifics What are some stories that you might tell yourself now that to help you through hard times Well now now the two stories would always be uh would be the story of Joseph in the Old Testament or and or the story of Paul in the New Testament Which is in Joseph throughout his life he was basically done wrong by his brothers and jailed unfairly and so on and so forth but in the end no matter he didn t pay back his brothers even though he was the second most powerful man in Egypt He just said you know the moral of the story and what he said was You meant evil for me but the Lord meant good That I might save you know that many might be saved Uh and that s been a huge a huge blessing and and source of comfort Especially in the midst of trials that uh no matter what s happening it s being done to uh for our for our good and our and our uh perfection meaning meaning that uh he s sanding off the edges constantly of us And uh also the story of Paul and in particular it s in I think it s in the Book of Romans Romans 8 28 where he says All things work for good for those who love the Lord Uh and Paul Paul s life is like a Indiana Jones movie where at one time there s 40 40 Jews uh Jewish scholars or whatever had taken the vow of hunger until they caught him they weren t going to eat So there s 40 guys who hadn t eaten in 30 days chasing them So you reckon at least one of them is going to catch them somehow but he he managed to elude them all And then of course he spent the rest of his life you know on shipwrecks and in jail and being beat up and uh I m sure verbally abused and just you name it But he counted all that joy uh for the work he was doing for the Lord And and that no matter what was happening he was able he was able to uh mentally adjust to the situation knowing that the Lord was working in his life uh for his good even if he couldn t always exactly see why So that s it And then of course the story of Jesus is the other one uh the biggest uh just about what he took on himself and that he was you know he was betrayed by everybody his closest closest friends uh and loved ones uh down to the last the last disciple and apostle Well excuse me just disciple Uh and yet he you know he still carried through with the Father s will uh and and kept his composure and and his perspective and focused no matter what So those are the three that no matter what the situation there ll be something in those three lives that speak to me that I will repeat to myself no matter what Through difficult times The harder it gets the more I will reflect on those lives and go back to the passages that talk about their lives OK Sounds like you get a lot of strength from your faith in Jesus I get all of it all of it from there It happened three years ago and it s been amazing journeys I m looking forward to the rest of it Umm that s great that s great Is there anything else you d like to share That s about it I think OK Eric thank you You re welcome I appreciate it
