 My Other Self By Michael Ryan posted Tuesday Oct 22 to be composted Tuesday Oct 29 To hear the poem read by the poet click here or on the title He could have smacked youfor running out of gas at midnight in December at a middle of nowhere place coasting a few sorry yards toward home on the shoulderas a passing eighteen wheeler s Hawaiian sized wave of airwhomped the side of the car like a two story pillow As we sat there immobile the four of us including him as if waiting for the show to begin at a surreal drive in he wanted to reach into the front seatand bonk your heads togetherthe way the leader of the Three Stooges didwhen the other two did something stupid What had been road was now a cold placewithout a house light in sight in the rural South What had been a passionate highway talkabout the culture s indifference to the artist s workwould have been silence except for himgiggling at us at how danger dissolves discontentand flashes before us a life lost to pettiness which we soon start to lose again Who said there are no neurotics in wartime he planned to mock us with my voice but when I got outto see where we were he didn t He brooded in the car He didn t feel the pleasure of a skyful of starsso cold and clear when you look upits light illuminates your breath Nor was he worried about anyone but himself being the only one with nothing to worry about not made of flesh He was cryingI wanna go home inside the carlike a child trapped in a junked refrigerator This was one time I felt exactly like him as we three stood pondering our dilemma calmly maturely And I did again when he yelled I m scaredas the clunker with wide headlights and bad muffler Hell Wagon or Devil s Dream no doubt inscribed on the fender voted Car Of The Year by escaped convicts and serial killers glided like a crocodile toward our throbbing imported taillightsand idled there But when I approached the monsteralone my other self was having none of this action what I found when the window inched downwas reality a couple with a baby asleep between them country peoplewho still stop for anyone in trouble although they were wary So was I squinting into the warm darkness in which they stirredas if to the bottom of a moonlit pool as if what should surface nonetheless was a gun in my face They got back with a can of gas so fastthe whole event took about the time of a Howard Johnson hamburger and probably less time than a Howard Johnson hamburger off a lifein which it s almost impossiblenot to feel blessed How lucky we are we said on the smooth way home again trying to etch it into our brains At least I was since we had ditched him back there thumb out and grinning into the high beams of every approaching carbecause this one s got to be the starlet in the Jaguarwrapped in a mink with nothing underneath
