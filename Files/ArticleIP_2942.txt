 A Man of the Old School Louis Begley s work is like a bibliographer s idea of nostalgia Everything has been downhill since the first book Begley s first novel Wartime Lies was a work of great distinction Three novels later it is still his best a marvel of achieved restraint Unhappily the subsequent novels have been unwitting examples of the difficulty of writing about restraint as a subject About Schmidt his new book which explores the dwindling years of a morose retired lawyer a man who calls himself the last of the Wasps offers some of his most delicate writing yet but once again involves Begley in the paradoxical task of giving expression to repression Wartime Lies which is largely autobiographical recounts the adventures of Maciek a Jewish boy who with his aunt Tania is fleeing the Nazis in Poland The pair do not look Jewish and this combined with Tania s charm enables them to evade capture even as they live openly yards from the Warsaw ghetto Nonetheless they are in great peril and are hiding from that peril By contrast Begley s second novel The Man Who Was Late is about a man who is hiding a secret Ben is a successful American financier who has repressed the memory of his unhappy Jewish childhood What mysteriously disappeared from one book to the next is a sense of the perilous It is as if Begley could no longer identify the enemy In this novel and his third As Max Saw It his characters are still hiding but now they are hiding from themselves It is this self division that seems to defy lucid expression The secrecy is more opaque than it appears to warrant A bout Schmidt is a better book than its two predecessors partly because of the honesty of Albert Schmidt s self disclosures There is clarity here he hides nothing from us Publicly he maintains the Wasp proprieties a stiff upper lip a stiff drink the rattle of small talk But privately his soul is in turmoil Essentially Schmidt narrates this novel the third person narrator hews closely to his point of view in the process he uncovers his own hurts His only daughter Charlotte is marrying one of his former junior partners from the old law firm Jon Riker Schmidt thinks him dull and laborious and with the kind of bigotry that is the fermentation of social vintage disapproves of his Jewishness Schmidt is also still in mourning for his wife His daughter seems to be cleaving to the Riker family rather than to her sad father He kicks old memories around his lovely house in Bridgehampton a house that he tries to give to Charlotte and Jon but that they ungraciously refuse At 60 his body is cooling and even the heat of an affair with a dangerously young waitress at a local restaurant will not warm him for long What is fine here is the precision of Begley s attention he does not strive to make Schmidt either likable or a monster He paints with care the natural variegation of Schmidt s petty anti Semitism its defiance on top its embarrassment under leaf To the best of his recollection no matter how deeply or how far back he looked Schmidt was sure he had not once in his life stood in the way of any Jew Schmidt s codes of belonging his fastidious prejudices are laid bare In sentences of loping baroque syntax Begley makes his elegant stately report There is something impressive about a writer so undaunted by a character s trivial unpleasantness by his daily acts of meanness But About Schmidt loses delicacy as it proceeds Its power flows from its fidelity to Schmidt s unhappiness and this unhappiness has a reality only because we see how self invented it is Schmidt s selfishness is the most convincing element of this portrait But then Begley cheats he weights our sympathy in Schmidt s favor His daughter becomes not merely ungrateful but implausibly hostile In a climactic scene she telephones Schmidt to tell him that a rabbi will be performing the wedding service and that she will be converting There must be more to being a Jew than your kind of Episcopalian she sneers Since she has not until this moment shown interest one way or another in her inherited religion her sudden zeal to abandon it seems clumsy on Begley s part Meanwhile her fianc who is interestingly dull at the beginning of the book begins to curdle into uninteresting stereotype the dry ruthless Jewish lawyer poised to strip the in law of his treasures He is abetted by his beautiful psychoanalyst mother Renata who is also crudely drawn Like some caricature of a Freudian she has an urge to psychoanalyze Schmidt whenever he is in her presence Schmidt quotes from King Lear and Begley intends a soft echo of that play in his tale of an aged patriarch quarreling with a daughter But what s interesting about King Lear is that Lear has no reason to blame his daughters Their villainy is all in his head The obviousness of Charlotte and Jon s evil leaches the force from the story Begley wants us to feel pity for a man already swimming in the emotion As Begley loses his critical distance from Schmidt the novel grows maudlin and bleary Clannishly Begley offers Schmidt sexual release He romps with Renata and then with a 20 year old waitress named Carrie who is so eager to have sex with a man 40 years her senior that she begs for it The Jamesian upholstery is ripped off Begley s prose and we are down to springs and horsehair I haven t seen your breasts I think they are small and hard Schmidt muses You re wrong I ve got big tits she replies Then Schmidt retreats from us lost in a cloth that Begley throws over him and what began as a sharp examination of public restraint and private release dwindles into a self pity which seems not merely Schmidt s but Begley s Repression is one of Begley s main themes But his latest novels do more than just showcase it they become its victims It is difficult not to detect an autobiographical note in his heroes struggle to control inner distress and bury forgotten memories Even Wartime Lies apparently so different from Begley s later work is introduced by a man who has no childhood that he can bear to remember In the last 100 pages of this novel Schmidt s struggle to control himself fades from view and one suspects that it is a struggle Begley can no longer depict because it is a struggle he can no longer win Instead he shuts it down and Schmidt dissolves into Begley s anxious obscurity
