 Cook s Cranky Achievement Dear Marjorie Blanche Wiesen Cook is two volumes into an Eleanor Roosevelt biography that will stretch to thousands of pages Its worldview is cranky and at times irresponsible Its subject is a busybody And yet these books are a real achievement They leave no doubt that Eleanor deserves a William Manchester to her Winston Churchill or for that matter a Frank Freidel to her FDR A recap Eleanor Roosevelt is born in 1884 orphaned early Her mother lives just long enough to inculcate in her unjustifiably a sense of her own awkwardness Her beloved father Elliott Roosevelt is a kind hearted drunk who dies at 34 hounded to the grave by a sadistic and mentally warped elder brother who perhaps smarting at having been outshone by Elliott in his youth slanders him in public fleeces him out of his money turns his family against him and seeks to get him institutionalized That brother Teddy becomes president in 1901 OK so that s more my opinion than Cook s Eleanor attends Allenswood Marie Souvestre s radical girls school in England a vaguely Sapphic environment where she learns four languages and much poetry and blossoms No room for that back in the States once she marries her cousin Franklin Delano Roosevelt Eleanor comes under the thumb of her passive aggressive mother in law Sara Nurse Ratched cum Martha Stewart who uses the family finances to stay Top Woman in her son s life FDR is bound for glory New York state senator assistant secretary of the Navy 1913 1921 vice presidential nominee 1920 New York governor 1929 32 then president to 1945 He s also in Cook s nice phrase a flirt a bottom pincher and a knee holder When ER discovers love letters from Lucy Mercer while unpacking his trunk she offers him his freedom If that s a euphemism for divorce he declines If it means freedom tout court he accepts So does she And in a strange way after an initial frost their marriage grows more tender as it grows more distant Let s talk more about this He veers into the man s world of Albany Washington and once he s stricken with polio the spa he starts in Warm Springs Ga She becomes a woman s agitator trade unions suffrage Democratic Party backrooms Cook s bombshell is her assertion that Eleanor throughout the White House years was in a passionate lesbian relationship with AP reporter Lorena Hickok Hick is a deeply sympathetic character from a broken Midwestern home she knows not only real breadline and boardinghouse poverty but also opera and poetry She s Eleanor s Boswell Eckermann and Cook s eyes and ears In the White House Eleanor is too immersed in her life of women s activism to change But she adapts so skillfully that no one quite realizes it She continues with coalition building starts a column My Day and grapples with America s race problem Under Hick s influence she occupies herself with the Poor of all sexes The White House has two social circles two policy circles two agendas But while Eleanor s agenda looks separatist women only press conferences an attempt to avert World War II through a Lysistrata style women s strike for peace it also succeeds in grafting onto Roosevelt s coalition new blocs of the hitherto disenfranchised without which the New Deal would be impracticable The only shameful note Eleanor s seeming indifference to the plight of Europe s Jews This is Whig History for the PC era full of paeans to same sex love sweeping generalizations about emotional needs attacks on present day lack of civility and you go girl type interjections Such history brings strengths Since Cook s first allegiance is to feminism more specifically to gay rights she is not dug in on most of the political and economic questions that divide FDR s hagiographers from his detractors She thus shows the elitist paternalist and shallow roots of Franklin s progressivism his tendency to compromise the personalism of his program I d make the case that Eleanor had more in common with him than it appears It also brings weaknesses This is radical history and Cook s description of post World War I race riots of the Wobblies agitation in the 1920s of mid 1930s anti communism which she calls a Red Scare could have been written by Earl Browder Sorry to run on These are excellent books to be read with extreme caution I m puzzled that Cook at once urges that we study Eleanor in her own right yet so privileges these first five years of her husband s administration I m bothered that Cook uses the old leftist trick of praising her subject s visionary radicalism and then condemning as alarmist fabricators those who recognize but don t like it A particular paradox In insisting on Eleanor s lesbianism as central she follows the lack of circumspection of ER s contemporary detractors not allies I wonder if rich ladies self actualization provides a useful model for legislation to help poor women I m also curious about how Cook would compare Eleanor and Hillary Clinton since she is constantly inviting 1990s comparisons But I m most curious about what you think Best Chris
