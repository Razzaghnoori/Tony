 Does Money Buy Happiness Chatterbox is mesmerized by a cover story in the March 15 issue of Fortune on how Bill Gates the world s richest man invests his money According to Fortune Gates Microsoft stock is worth 76 billion That money is of course invested in Microsoft But another 11 5 billion in pocket change managed by someone named Michael Larson is scattered between Gates two foundations 6 5 billion and his personal investment portfolio 5 billion The latter alone is roughly the same size as the Fidelity Value fund a big mutual fund with 412 000 shareholder accounts But is Gates happy Chatterbox suspects he is and he suspects at least in part it s because Gates has more lettuce than the Sultan of Brunei However this rash conclusion flies in the face of social science research We turn now to page 56 of Robert Samuelson s 1995 book The Good Life and Its Discontents Samuelson here and throughout the book argues that money doesn t buy happiness It s family friends and work that contribute most to well being he quotes political scientist Robert Lane saying To support this view Samuelson reprints some fascinating data from the University of Chicago s National Opinion Research Center The numbers are a few years old but the 1990s haven t been wildly inflationary Here they are Income Very Happy Pretty Happy Not Too Happy 0 14 999 21 58 21 15 000 24 999 31 56 13 24 000 34 999 32 60 8 35 000 49 999 36 59 5 50 000 74 999 34 60 6 75 000 or more 45 49 6 While it s true that overall these data show that money doesn t dramatically affect the distribution of happiness let s examine some of the nuances One is that you re nearly four times as likely to be miserable if you make less than 15 000 than you would be if you made more than 35 000 True 79 percent of people making less than 15 000 still consider themselves pretty happy or very happy But what if you don t happen to belong to this naturally buoyant majority Clearly for at least 15 or 16 percent i e the proportion of unhappy people exceeding the naturally unhappy baseline of 5 or 6 percent the lack of money buys unhappiness Chatterbox is also intrigued by what happens when your income rises above 75 000 If you were unhappy before apparently you re likely to stay unhappy But 11 percent of the people who were pretty happy will become very happy Money may not buy happiness but if you re already happy there s a decent chance it will make you more happy Does the likelihood of such a happiness boost increase when you graduate from prosperous to out of sight rich The data doesn t say but Chatterbox bets it does By creating the broad category 75 000 or more the University of Chicago figures lump Bill Gates with lowlifes like Chatterbox and Linda Tripp Also there really ought to be a category for ecstatically happy which Chatterbox suspects rises precipitously when you get above 1 billion Chatterbox would appreciate hearing from any readers who have research to back up or refute these hypotheses Timothy Noah
