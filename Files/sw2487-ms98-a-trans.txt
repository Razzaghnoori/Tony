 are you in the new car market right now no i m not uh and i won t be for a while it s kind of called not having the money but i always like to look at what s out there are you looking at cars right now i m not looking right now but i have been considering what i would purchase uh in the near future what have what are you thinking about um well i m getting in the in my mid thirties now i m looking more for a uh kind of a luxury sedan i guess i m driving a two door coupe sport coupe right now and i m getting a little tired of it um hum so you re looking at uh luxury luxury cars a little bit bigger yeah a little bigger and have you looked at uh the Buick Riviera i haven t uh really been out looking at cars uh uh it s something i would possibly consider it is well i happen to drive that one just because i think it looks nice and um i owned a Buick for a while and it it performed real well uh huh um um i don t i have a lot of friends that have bought cars recently and it just seems like there s and epidemic um a million people who that buy Honda Civic uh Honda Accords its like everybody buys a Honda Accord right and i really don t know what makes them select that over any other car i don t know i ve been told to check out the uh Acura Legend first though and i guess they re made by Honda as well that s oh are they i didn t know that i didn t know that it s the uh luxury line of the Hondas i think uh and i uh i ve read some articles too about oh i think the last one that got me going i don t know much about it at all but those little Geos uh huh they re kind of cute and they get excellent gas mileage i mean they re like the top rated gas mileage car out there yeah i do need something that gets a little better mileage than what i m getting getting right now um hum i get about thirteen miles per gallon whoa now i ve been uh leaning more towards looking at uh Mercedes Benzes say four or five years old oh that sounds nice not the new cars but uh ones that are more affordable um hum they tend to be very reliable and uh people that uh own them uh typically have them serviced on a regular maintenance schedule i think they re kept in uh better condition than uh most other cars i agree with you there i have uh a friend who has one and you know another thing is is they don t age they always look the same so you really don t know what what year it is uh uh huh yeah they don t change style very often i like that they don t and uh they you know they re a quality car they uh huh if you were to buy uh a new car right now what factors would do you consider uh looking at to make you decision well i would definitely have to look at price uh huh uh and i would look at what i could afford uh i definitely would chose a car on on what appeals to me as far as looks but it d have to be dependable uh i find that price is always the governing governing governing factor uh regardless of what else you re looking at so it it d have to be it s difficult to buy something that s out of your price range something that you can t afford exactly and there there s such a range of prices prices in the car market that if you don t start by narrowing it down by that factor i mean that really gets you into just one little slot and then there are many many options to go to go to from there uh i d one thing that always interests me is whether or not to buy an American car or a foreign car uh huh well i yeah i drive a Pontiac right now and i ve had very good luck with it uh no problems i m just changing my preference for what type of car i d like to drive in the future um hum so you re going to uh something a little bit bigger and and having better gas mileage too yeah eventually i d like to do something like that uh huh get out out of uh uh driving this uh teenage teenage automobile well you make me laugh because right now i what i did is i i acquired a car through my folks which is a nineteen eighty four LTD and my teenage daughter hates it because it s an old persons car sure well there are cars that teens absolutely will refuse to drive oh well absolutely and uh it s it s a nineteen eighty four car and it has eighteen thousand miles on it actual miles so it s kind of thing like i m going to drive this car until it dies you know i mean it s just too good to and then maybe when i go out and look in in the car market i ll be able to get what i really want and uh huh do you prefer buying uh cars new from uh dealerships or uh buying used cars from individuals oh i think i m going to fall in to the category of most women uh in saying that i feel better going to a dealership because i don t know anything about a car mechanically right but don t you feel intimidated by talking to a car salesman oh that was an experiment i did last year was i went and and talk and drove a few cars and talked with the the salesman and i found that uh i had matured a little bit in that they don t intimidate me at all okay well that s great if they can make you feel at ease that s pretty good uh oh they well they they make you they don t make you feel at ease but i ve come to the point where i know that i m the one they charge and that they can t you know right talk me into something um i think they re intimidating to both men and women they certainly are and they try to take advantage of uh the consumer s ignorance towards automobiles and exactly and once you once they sense that you really like something then you re really in trouble yeah if they sense that you re really interested and that s the car for you they re when they re negotiating position is that they re going to get as much money out of you as they can um hum exactly with as many options piled on yeah the uh i had also had a had a nineteen eighty four uh Bronco too which uh my ex husband had purchased i paid it off and and when i acquired this LTD i thought well i m going to sell this car while i can get some money out of it yet so i was the selling a car and that was interesting because i had to kind of research well what is it worth um and kind of understand what someone would ask me about it sure well you tend to do a lot better on selling a used car as an individual placing an ad in the paper as opposed to trading it in at a dealership oh yes absolutely and yet at the same time it s it s a matter of like selling anything else you have to find someone who wants that pa rticular item sure well i ve found that any car that runs is basically in demand uh huh uh huh and uh you can go pretty much by the blue book value or by uh comparison uh listings that s what i did is i kind of did a little bit of both Blue book is kind of a dream it s kind of like if you can attain it you re doing well yeah um hum but if you go by what the other cars are listing for then you can rest assured that you re going to get right in that ball park Honda so yeah uh yeah i agree with you on that how so how soon do you think you ll be purchasing a car well i m not sure i m i m just uh kind of thinking about it and haven t really made any uh decisions or commitments on it do you think of colors at all when you well i drive a black car right now and i ve always liked black but uh i maybe uh interested in other colors uh i m not really interested in yellow or white uh huh but i ve always had a preference for red uh huh and black and uh well it s just something i d have to think about depended on it depends on which uh what cars are available that s right would you order it or would you uh oh no i would uh go to the want ads in the paper and uh find one that would meet my uh needs uh huh well that sounds exciting it really does so well maybe maybe sometime soon i don t know probably not this year i think i need to concentrate more on getting a paint job for the car that i have right now uh huh and just keeping it in uh good operating condition well that sounds like a good plan you might as well just you know get it enjoy it for one more year and get it in good shape shape for selling it or trading it in yeah well that s the point it isn t costing me any money right now it s running uh very well and i haven t had car payments for seven years i enjoy that immensely uh huh my goodness what type of car do you are you driving i m driving a nineteen eighty Trans AM uh huh the only trouble i have with it is with insurance companies oh i m sure they don t want to insure it uh huh because it has such uh just because it s a sporty model powerful enough right right has nothing to do with driving record i have no accidents or tickets and uh they re very reluctant uh yet even to insure that car uh huh i can understand that they re i mean they re just very difficult to work with and they can they can see a potential for a problem even if your record is good yeah well my insurance agent told me that uh when when i uh bought a new car or when when i more specifically when i bought my Honda to give him a call because then he would he would make me a good deal on an insurance policy well that s good but i haven t really no intention of buying a Honda they don t really appeal to me that much i it uh well it s it s more like an economy car right right and uh i d be looking more of uh more for a luxury sedan something with a little more status you seem to put a lot of um image into your selection of a car which lots of people do i really don t consider it to be a status symbol uh it s just i m interested i know people who have cars of that nature and uh they tend to hold their quality that s true and hold their value uh huh uh huh uh and they re just very attractive automobiles as far as i m concerned and i liked what you said also about when people have cars that are uh that are quality cars
