 Leak and Load Nostradamus apparently works in the Pentagon According to the April 12 U S News World Report this is what the Joint Chiefs of Staff concluded before the Kosovo operation If we bomb we will eliminate Milosevic s domestic opposition and he will become a hero He will go into Kosovo and slaughter thousands of Kosovar Albanians and create thousands of refugees Air power or bombing cannot stop any of those things The front page of Monday s Washington Post confirmed the prophecy revealing that the Joint Chiefs had expressed deep reservations in advance of the proposed bombing The New York Times reported that the Pentagon had warned the administration that Milosevic was likely to strike out viciously against Kosovo Albanians These wise men who saw in their crystal ball exactly what would happen in Kosovo are truly prophets without honor These prognostications divulged anonymously by senior military officials and Pentagon planners and officers who know the Joint Chiefs thinking but decline to be named represent a particularly demoralizing aspect of modern war making leaking as Pentagon policy Covering your ass is of course a time honored military tradition enshrined with its own acronym But what is remarkable about the Kosovo leaks is that they are covering something that is not being shot at No one literally no one is blaming the U S military for the shortcomings of the Kosovo mission All fault has been deposited on the doorsteps of the White House and the State Department Politicians not generals made the risky decisions and politicians not generals are getting reproached for them But no matter As soon as it became clear that the mission had gone awry Pentagon brass began leaking profligately In the span of a few days anonymous quotes appeared in the Post New York Times Los Angeles Times Washington Times Wall Street Journal and all three newsweeklies The gist of the leaks The Joint Chiefs knew this would happen they told the administration this would happen so don t blame them The leaks stem from a basic military practice worst casing During Vietnam generals insisted to their civilian bosses that we could win if we just had a little more time and firepower Today s armed forces won t make the same mistake They don t want to be put in a hopeless position and get blamed for it This is a product of Vietnam says George Washington University military historian Ronald Spector So even as the brass announces incessantly that America has the finest fighting force the world has ever known it responds bleakly to any presidential proposal to actually deploy that force A top Pentagon officer from the Gulf War describes the generals standard procedure They tell the White House You are going to need an overwhelming amount of stuff It s a bad idea There will be terrible casualties We recommend you don t do it You always make sure you have protested before says American University Professor Amos Perlmutter In Kosovo for example the generals said that a ground invasion would require 200 000 troops a number they knew was impossibly high and that bombing wouldn t work This worst casing has two results 1 The politicians are left wondering whether to believe the generals since they say this every time and 2 the military assures itself a victory in the war that matters in Washington the PR war If the pols overrule the generals and the mission goes sour the generals are safe on the record with sensible objections that can be leaked at an opportune moment as with Kosovo If the pols overrule and the mission succeeds the generals still harvest the credit No one remembers their poor mouthing Who recalls that Gen Colin Powell predicted horrible casualties in the Gulf War It s worth noting that the Joint Chiefs probably did not warn against the mission as emphatically or prophetically as the leaks claim Clinton after all is incredibly deferential to his Joint Chiefs because of his own history of nonservice It s impossible to believe that he would have overruled the chiefs if they were as absolute as the leaks suggest Most experts also doubt the Joint Chiefs were unified in the view that bombing wouldn t succeed It s Air Force doctrine that bombing will succeed in such circumstances so Air Force advisers almost certainly predicted a bombing triumph Moreover the generals public behavior casts doubt on the claim that they foresaw what Milosevic would do if we bombed The only public concerns the generals voiced before bombing were that pilots would be vulnerable to Yugoslavia s missile defenses They did not discuss the possibility that Milosevic would respond by accelerating his slaughter of Kosovars There is nothing wrong with the Joint Chiefs warning the administration privately that bombing was folly In fact it would be derelict for the generals not to warn the administration of that But after the fact anonymous leaks are corrupting The military is theoretically a nonpolitical institution but as soon as the operation went south the military abandoned its nonpolitical fa ade to protect itself From four stars to privates the armed forces loathe and distrust Clinton and the generals certainly weren t going to risk being associated with his Kosovo mess So they leaked to guarantee that they would not be blamed for a quagmire or be punished at budget time and to ensure that Clinton would suffer The backdoor sniping has become so pernicious and prevalent that even retired Gen George Joulwan NATO s military commander in the early 90s pleaded on CNN s Crossfire for the Pentagon to stop leaking and pull the team together The principal reason the leaks are troubling is not that they sabotage the relationship between the administration and the Pentagon that relationship is always shaky They are troubling because they may sabotage the mission itself The leaks suggest to our NATO allies that the U S military isn t seriously engaged in the operation And the leaks suggest to our own troops that their commanders secretly believe their mission is dangerous useless and possibly doomed No inside the beltway PR victory is worth that kind of demoralization
