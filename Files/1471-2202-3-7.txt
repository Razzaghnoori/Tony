 Background The discovery that the jellyfish green fluorescent protein GFP can form a functional fluorophore without other gene products or co factors 1 was rapidly followed by reports that GFP can be used to create fluorescent fusion proteins e g 2 3 For the first time it became possible to create a wide variety of genetically encodable fluorescent fusion proteins that could be followed in living systems reviewed in 4 Most GFP fusion proteins have been built by placing GFP at either the N or C terminus of the host protein This can however destroy the function of some host proteins The alternative is to insert GFP into the middle of the host protein 5 6 7 8 Unfortunately finding a permissive location for insertion of the GFP can be problematic and time consuming One way of speeding the process is to randomly generate libraries of GFP fusion proteins and then screen for clones that encode functional fluorescent proteins One group used a combination of nick translation and nuclease S1 treatment to randomly insert GFP into a cAMP dependent protein kinase regulatory subunit from Dictyostelium 6 A surprisingly large number of the resulting fusion proteins were fluorescent and retained cAMP binding demonstrating that this can be a powerful approach A weakness of this strategy however is that it can produce deletions in the host sequence Another approach is to use the random behavior of a transposon to insert GFP into many different places in a target protein Two synthetic transposons have been reported that can produce GFP fusion proteins 9 10 The design of these transposons included additional protein domains or linkers between the GFP and the target protein however and little is known about how many of the resulting proteins continued to function We reasoned that a Tn 5 transposon 11 12 could be designed that would generate GFP fusion proteins with relatively short linkers 7 amino acids between the GFP and the host protein analogous to GFP fusion proteins that have already been shown to function 6 8 To test this approach we targeted the G protein subunit s and the glutamate receptor subunit GluR1 Results Changes have been made to the Tn 5 transposon and its transposase that in concert produce a hyperactive transposon capable of a 1 insertion frequency in an in vitro reaction reviewed in 12 This hyperactive Tn 5 transposon is defined as any sequence flanked by the inverted 19 base pair repeats known as mosaic ends MEs The recombinant Tn 5 transposase binds these ME sequences and in the presence of Mg 2 catalyzes the random insertion of the transposon into target DNA in a complex process that involves generating a 9 base pair staggered nick in the target This staggered nick is subsequently repaired to produce a 9 base pair duplication of the target sequence that flanks the inserted transposon Two possible reading frames extend through the MEs of the Tn 5 transposon Our initial GFP transposon EGFP V was created by placing the sequence encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein EGFP in one of these frames such that if the transposon landed in another coding sequence in the correct orientation and frame it would produce a GFP fusion protein figure 1A The low probability of transposition in an in vitro reaction made it necessary to include antibiotic resistance so Kan r was added to the transposon flanked by Srf I restriction sites that can be used to subsequently remove it An epitope tagged version of the G protein subunit s s EE was chosen as the first target figure 1B Previous studies have shown that the N and C termini of s are important for its interactions with receptors G protein and subunits and the plasma membrane 13 14 so placing GFP within internal regions of s is more likely to generate a functional fluorescent subunit 8 Moreover the structure of s has been solved 15 making it possible to interpret the results in the context of the three dimensional structure After transposition and transformation colonies expressing dual antibiotic resistance were screened with PCR to identify clones in which EGFP V had landed in the correct orientation within the coding region figure 1C Assuming that Tn 5 behavior is random the probability that EGFP V will land in the s EE coding sequence during transposition should be the ratio of the coding sequence to the size of the total plasmid 18 5 However transpositions that disrupt critical elements of the plasmid the plasmid origin or the Amp r gene should not be recovered after transformation so the predicted probability of observed transpositions within the s EE coding sequence increases to 23 8 with half of these 11 9 being in the correct orientation PCR screening of 384 Amp r Kan r resistant colonies identified 44 clones with EGFP V insertions within the s EE coding region in the correct orientation 11 4 Each clone containing an in frame insertion should encode a truncated s protein with GFP at the carboxy terminus due to a stop codon in the Kan r Thirty five of the PCR positive clones were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells and 13 were fluorescent Sequencing confirmed that the 13 fluorescent constructs were truncated s GFP fusion proteins with 12 being unique insertions and that the remaining 22 EGFP V insertions were out of frame figure 2A The 12 clones encoding unique s GFP fusion proteins were digested with Srf I and re ligated to create full length fusion proteins figure 2B Transient expression of each of the 12 s GFP fusion proteins in HEK 293 cells produced a fluorescent signal This is surprising because several insertions appear to be in internal and or rigid secondary protein structures figure 3 It appears that the folding of GFP to form a fluorophore is thermodynamically favorable at most insertion sites To determine what effect the GFP insertions had on s localization the full length fusion proteins were transiently co expressed in HEK 293 cells with G protein subunits 1 and 7 which have been shown to mediate signaling between the adrenergic receptor and G s 16 Amino and carboxy terminus GFP fusions s GFP N and s GFP C respectively were also co expressed with 1 and 7 for comparison The end labeled GFP fusions and two of the transposon insertions s GFP 18 20 and s GFP 92 94 showed clear localization to the plasma membrane figure 4A The remaining 10 fusion proteins displayed a uniform fluorescence signal throughout the cytoplasm figure 4B The fusion proteins were tested for function by assaying their abilities to stimulate adenylyl cyclase in response to receptor stimulation They were co expressed with the luteinizing hormone LH receptor in HEK 293 cells and cAMP accumulation was measured in both the presence and absence of the LH receptor agonist human chorionic gonadotropin hCG Basal and stimulated cAMP accumulation in cells expressing s GFP 18 20 s GFP 92 94 s GFP N or s GFP C were higher than in cells expressing vector alone figure 5A However only in cells expressing s GFP 92 94 were these differences statistically significant p 0 05 The basal and stimulated activities of s GFP 92 94 were less than those of s although these differences were not statistically significant p 0 05 The remaining 10 of the12 fusion proteins exhibited no detectable activity One possible explanation for the decreased activities of the s GFP fusion proteins relative to s EE would be a decrease in protein expression level Cell fractionation and immunoblotting with an anti EE monoclonal antibody showed that both s GFP 92 94 and s GFP 18 20 were expressed at lower levels than s EE in contrast to s GFP N and s GFP C figure 5B Interpreting these results in the context of the structure of s leads to a surprising result A rational approach to designing a fluorescent functional s GFP fusion protein would have most likely targeted the exposed loops e g 8 yet these insertions were not functional The most functional protein was produced by the insertion of GFP into an helix that one would have avoided figure 3 The discovery that all of the in frame insertions in s produced truncated fluorescent fusion proteins suggested that we could identify in frame insertions by transiently expressing all of the transposed clones and visually screening them for fluorescence This alternative screening strategy could be particularly useful for large coding regions where a PCR based screen might fail To reduce the number of transient transfections required a second transposon was created with enhanced cyan fluorescent protein ECFP Two separate transpositions with the different colored transposons followed by co transfections in the visual screen one potential green clone and one potential cyan clone per well can identify twice as many in frame insertions in a given number of transfections This approach could be expanded to encompass many different fluorophores In the experiments with s several clones were recovered with identical transposon insertions This is consistent with previous reports of Tn 5 preferentially inserting into particular locations in the target sequence 17 18 Since these hotspots could become a limiting factor in the number of unique insertions recovered within a target sequence the second reading frame through the Tn 5 MEs was used for the ECFP transposon This doubles the number of potentially useful insertion sites within a given target sequence The glutamate receptor subunit GluR1 19 was used to test the new transposons and the visual screening process Independent transpositions of the GluR1 plasmid were performed with the EGFP and ECFP transposons TgPT 0 and TcPT 1 respectively In 288 co transfections there were 20 wells with EGFP fluorescence 21 wells with ECFP fluorescence and 2 wells with both EGFP and ECFP fluorescence Sequencing revealed 35 unique insertions 17 TgPT 0 and 18 TcPT 1 and 10 repetitive insertions figure 6A The recovery of 45 fluorescent clones from 576 colonies 7 8 agrees with the predicted frequency of transpositions resulting in GluR1 EGFP ECFP fusions 7 7 which is consistent with the interpretation that all in frame insertions produce a fluorescent protein Clones representing unique fluorescent fusion proteins were digested with Srf I to remove the Kan r selection cassette and re ligated to generate full length GluR1 EGFP ECFP fusions These fusion proteins were screened in transiently transfected HEK 293 cells for glutamate gated ion channel function Of the 29 unique tribrid fusion constructs tested all produce detectable fluorescence and 6 were functional figure 6B Discussion Creating functional fluorescent fusion proteins involves finding a permissive site for the insertion of GFP a process that in most cases still involves some guesswork The results of both the s and GluR1 transpositions illustrate this point Based on previous studies with the G protein subunit q 8 we anticipated that an insertion within an exterior flexible loop region of s would be most likely to produce a functional fusion protein Surprisingly the s fusion protein that was the most functional s GFP 92 94 resulted from an insertion into an helix figure 3 while the insertions in exposed loops s GFP 67 69 and s GFP 188 190 were not functional Similarly in the case of GluR1 one of the insertions that produced a functional channel GluR1 GFP 526 528 was within the hydrophobic region thought to be the first transmembrane domain see Additional File Figure 7 Additionally within a given region of GluR1 one insertion will produce a functional channel while another nearby insertion does not e g the intracellular carboxy terminus region or the amino terminus between amino acids 210 and 330 The reasons for these discrepancies are not obvious The discovery that GFP will still fold and form a fluorophore when placed virtually anywhere in another coding region suggests that the limiting step in the process is whether the target protein it is inserted into folds and functions correctly Indeed GFP fusion constructs have been used to assay and improve upon the folding of a variety of proteins in a bacterial expression system 20 The relatively random nature of the transposition events we recovered in this study suggests that it might be possible to insert GFP at nearly every position in a given protein but there are two potential limits First the laws of probability predict that there will be rapidly diminishing returns in the search for unique Tn 5 insertions as one recovers each additional clone Second the behavior of the Tn 5 transposon is not entirely random Goryshin and colleagues 18 have shown that there is a weak consensus site for Tn 5 insertion which is consistent with our results It appears that the resolution limit will be an insertion each three amino acids on average in a target protein Inserting a reporter domain such as GFP into another protein always has the potential of perturbing the target and destroying it s ability to function In this study 16 of the tribrid fusion proteins were still functional One explanation for why GFP can be used for internal insertion is that the N and C termini of GFP exit the structure quite close to one another and are unlikely to displace the surrounding domains of the target protein a great deal This is analogous to the use of the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor for internal insertions 21 The transposons described here could potentially be improved upon by optimizing the length and flexibility of the linkers between the target and the GFP Another potential improvement to the process would be to use bacterial expression to screen for transposon insertions that produce a fluorescent protein This could however be problematic with proteins from the mammalian nervous sytem such as ion channels that are difficult to express in bacteria The approach described here should speed the discovery of genetically encodable fluorescent sensors The pioneering work of Siegel and Isacoff showed that GFP placed within a portion of the Shaker K channel C terminus produced a fluorophore that responded to changes in membrane voltage 5 but they built a number of different constructs before finding one that worked Similarly Ataka and Pieribone created an EGFP Na channel fusion protein that changes fluorescence in response to membrane depolarizations on a time scale that would be sufficent to image action potentials This discovery however was the result of designing building and testing eight different tribrid fusion proteins 22 Little is known about the mechanism whereby changes in channel conformation are converted to changes in the fluorophore so it remains to be determined whether GFP can signal conformational changes in other kinds of proteins Nevertheless the use of the transposons described here should shift the work from building the constructs to devising high throughput assays for function Finally random GFP tagging will facilitate the creation of potential fluorescence resonance energy transfer FRET reagents to study protein interactions in living systems To date a few studies have demonstrated the potential power of GFP FRET by labeling different proteins 6 23 24 25 26 or by fusing two different fluorophores to the same protein 27 28 29 30 31 32 Creating efficent donor and acceptor fusion proteins is difficult however because FRET only occurs when the two fluorophores are attached to surfaces that are very close to one another The approach described here makes it possible to rapidly generate libraries of potential donor and acceptor tribrid fusion proteins that can be screened in pairwise combinations for function and FRET signals Additional File Figure 7 Click here for file Conclusions The transposons described here make it possible to rapidly generate large numbers of different GFP fusion proteins The results show that GFP can be inserted into a wide variety of other protein domains and it will continue to fold and form a fluorophore The rapid and random nature of the transposition process makes it possible to generate and screen many different fusion constructs to identify those that continue to function In the case of the two proteins tested here roughly 1 in 6 of the fusion proteins retained their signaling function and the random nature of the transposition process revealed permissive sites for insertion that would not have been predicted on the basis of structural or functional models of how that protein works This simple tool should speed the search for a wide variety of new biological probes for the study of nervous system Materials and Methods PCR and standard subcloning procedures were use to create the initial transposon EGFP V full sequence at http momotion med yale edu The Tn 5 MEs were added to the 5 and 3 ends of an EGFP coding sequence with a Srf I restriction site at its 3 end such that one continuous reading frame extended through both MEs and EGFP figure 2 To add antibiotic selection the Kan r gene from pUniV5 His TOPO Invitrogen Carlsbad CA was flanked with Srf I sites and inserted into the transposon The improved transposons TgPT 0 and TcPT 1 were created in the same way as EGFP V but Asc I sites were added to facilitate changing the fluorescent protein at a later date
