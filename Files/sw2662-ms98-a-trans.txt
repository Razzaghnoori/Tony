        uh i dont go to movies a whole lot but uh i went two or three weeks ago for the first time in a long time and saw Dances with Wolves which turned out to be an extremely extremely good movie   i havent seen that yet i i i hear we a whole bunch of us were going to go see it the its its playing at school actually in about in about in about two weeks i guess so were going to go see that but you enjoyed that   yeah its its something that uh my my brother lives over in Fort Worth and i was telling him about it couple of weeks ago and he said well ill wait until it comes out on uh tape and and rent the the video and i said no this is not one that you want to do that with   thats what i heard  yeah   its uh the the scenery and the the landscape and and the country that theyre in needs a big screen its just beautiful country in in the hills and the the trees and the buffalo and the whole thing its just uh just an amazing amazing picture   yeah ive heard it it its not one for the videos   no its its one i think well you know every every now and then you find one that you say yeah this is my favorite movie well this this is the one for me this time   really   yeah what have you been to lately   um lets see well  um this is almost sort of funny i was just at um friend and i went to see Out for Justice which is uh Steven Seagal   yeah uhhuh   because uh were both big karate fans so we wanted to see what this is like and uh wasnt very impressed with actually   oh yeah is that right that was   yeah i wasnt i mean ive ive seen his other movies and he i i just think hes pretty good but uh this movie its just im convinced now he cant act so   yeah uh hows his karate   oh his his his his karates been pretty good i think in this one it wasnt so good i generally um movies like that scare me though id id be just fine without them because you know kids come running out wanting to beat each other up and you   well they they do they get i remember when we used to go to uh see well i remember when Grand Prix came out when i was a kid and and some others movies like that we wanted to jump in the cars and and race   fighting umhum right   and i suspect today what they see is bound to be what they want to do when they get out of it   yeah yeah well that that was number one for the week actually too so so it was a little bit uh i was thinking wow people must be   into crime movies again   yeah   but but in the middle of that conversation we sort of picked an um an an interesting point last years number one movie for the year was Ghost   is that right   i dont know if you saw Ghost or not   i did see Ghost yeah   except yeah and and and that was that that helped us sort of feel good about you know about ourselves and about that everyone around us in that in that um at least at least if everyones if if if everyones running around seeing karate movies and stuff like that at least theyre still going to see the real good movies you know   yeah i think that that Ghost was one of those that a lot of people didnt think was going to be any good and it turned out to be an excellent movie   yeah yeah it was it was i was absolutely enthralled by it   i i ive forgotten the guys name who was in it who had the lead role yeah and i especially like him uh   oh Patrick Swayze yeah hes hes very good   hes a really a really good guy other than that Dances with Wolves seems like to be the the only thing ive seen in the past several months to have any uh   really im trying to think what else ive seen recently  what else have we seen recently  oh you know whats pretty cute actually um Defending Your Life   is that right ive ive seen the ads for it but im not really sure what its about   have you have you heard of this yeah um i actually hadnt heard anything about it and some friends called up and said do you want to go see this movie and and they said it starred um Meryl Streep and Mel Brooks at first they told me and i thought what a strange combination Mel Brooks and Meryl Streep   yeah that is a strange combination   well actually it starred out that it that its actually Albert Brooks   oh   so  so its lot better um Mel Mel Brooks you you probably know is uh you know so it it was a strange combination but it turned out to be a very cute movie i mean the whole premise is that they go out and they they die   yeah oh yeah   and and they have to   both of them   right both of them are dead and they happen to meet in this this town um this this sort of city where youre set up such that you know they go and they decide if you can move up to the next level   uhhuh   i dont know if youve ever read Jonathan Livingston Seagull but its something like that its something like that they sort of move up to levels and and they have to decide whether or not theyre good enough and as it turns out you know its uh they meet there and fall in love and stuff like that   yeah years ago oh   so you can guess the rest of the plot it actually its its really funny because they run through you know they do it they have them do is sit down and see scenes of their lives   oh yeah and then defend it well i guess thats where the title comes from then   and thats pretty good actually yeah and it oh thats thats what you do you actually have to go up there and you have a they have an attorney for you know attorney for you and attorney a a a defense and a prosecution and they have the you know the prosecutors job is to make sure you dont move up a level and the defenses job is to make sure that you you do you know and its uh its a neat little story actually   yeah yeah it is its   i was i was i was i i went i went in thinking itll be okay not great and then i actually came away thinking it was really pretty good so   yeah its funny weve got a couple of movies out recently Ghost and Defending Your Life that have to do with uh after life i guess and it kind of makes you wonder im a also besides working at TI im a graduate student at here North Texas and working on a masters in communication   yeah   its the behavioral science part of communercation and i i i think about these things and and people trying to define their own world view and uh what what exactly do we you know do we see about this world or why are we so fascinated with the other world is it just supposed to be better   hm the other world yeah   yeah sometimes i think we we think it is and we like those things that way   well im im im sure because it seems like it certainly would would would explain the preoccupation with it lately i mean but i suspect theres always been a preoccupation with that sort of thing in movies   well it has all all the way through history theres uh i guess if you want to call it mysticism or the occult or whatever its always fascinating i guess because we dont know and theres no real way of finding out well theres only one way of finding out   right well well did you ever see um Flatliners   no i did uh did not the a girl next to me saw it and she really liked it   that that thats probably one of those ones that you know its its on video now i think and its probably probably worth seeing on video um actually we really enjoyed it but it was it was it was also right along the same lines i mean they they would go ahead and kill themselves for a few three or four minutes to see what happens and   yeah it is yeah yeah they say uh she said that this was uh almost believable that could really happen you know you get the medical profession doing these kinds of things and it you know you never know   almost yeah i i its its its a little far fetched to find a bunch of medical students doing it but     yeah   but it was um it was it was odd enough you know and the and they didnt just sort of make it silly it was you know it was done fairly well i think so act ually i actually enjoyed that as well   i yeah i like it when they will will do something and not get too silly ive been disappointed in some movies that   okay   um they dont know how to end it it seems like so then they get crazy and and it doesnt end like the story has been going   umhum the story just sort of keeps going and going yeah   yeah well i guess that covers our topic uh the   yeah great well it was nice nice talking to you alrighty byebye   nice talking to you bye
