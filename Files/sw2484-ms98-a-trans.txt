          hello   hello   hi uh my names Nicole   hi Nicole im Mary Ann   uh where are you Mary Ann   uh im in McKinney   oh youre im in Dallas  not very long distance   i see okay no not at all and yet long enough if we were calling back and forth it would be a toll call     it would yes it would  okay are you uh do you know about the topic   uh if if i understood correctly it was what what changes we might uh suggest or whatever for the justice system is that  perhaps above my head   yeah  uh justice system or and what we think about the uh judge changing it to so the the judge would do the conviction or no sentencing sentencing   sentencing and would all the jurors have to agree on okay thatd be a good place to start   okay all right im going to push one   all right       have you ever served on a on a jury trial   yes one time one time but we found him innocent so uh   was it was it a criminal   yes it was this guy bit another guys finger off   okay oh oh   but he deserved it i probably would have bit his finger off too if he was trying to strangle me or beat me up you know if i could have gotten his hand in my mouth id have bit him just like this guy did he was scared he was a kid   oh my   you know and the guy was trying to beat him up this older teenager was shacking up with this guys exwife or something they were uh uh   huh   they were really in a mess and there were children involved and it was just terrible but i didnt think anybody you know they all deserved to go to jail not just the one guy you know   uh it really does sound like it was a self defense kind of thing   it really was he was trying to beat him up so you know we found him innocent so i really dont know what happens after you find them guilty i thought that the judge did do the sentencing   no i served on on both a criminal and a a civil um jury and in my criminal trial he pled guilty um to the first to to kidnapping and so we went through the second part of the trial because in Texas there are two parts first of all to find if they are guilty or innocent he already said hes guilty so then then we go through the trial to determine what uh punishment should be meted out   oh   so we still went through three days of of uh testimony and so forth and and witnesses saying oh hes an upstanding young man just weak and was led by another guy and so forth so we were the ones that that came up with the sentence and the judge gave us some parameters and said you know according to the law it can be no more or no less uh no more or less than and he gave the the number of years and he said it would also include a a possible fine up to ten thousand dollars and and we had thats that took us six hours just to agree on what we thought was appropriate for this young man   good grief that would be hard to do you know   um it wasnt the easiest thing ive done but no nor was it hard to to us the young man had kind of taken care of it when he said he was guilty so we did not   yeah   we didnt have to struggle at all with that it was now whats fitting and and wed gone through you know all that so i i dont know i thought that was easier than than trying to decide his guilt or innocence yeah   yeah whether hes guilty or not yeah thats true   i i probably would not mind letting the judge do the sentencing as long as the jury of of peers were determining guilt or innocence for one thing we didnt know that the others involved in the trial had uh or i or i mean had i mean involved in the crime had already come up for trial we couldnt know what had come of their uh sentencing   umhum   and and we couldnt know that until after wed made our findings so it turned out we had done about what the other juries had done and so it you know we felt a little better but i think if that could be in the hands of of someone who knew the law and could be privy to that information seems like it would be fairer   is it different in different states do you know   since its state uh laws yes   because i know on some at times the news you know and they say the judge gives the sentencing and so thats what i guess i thought it was that way everywhere being as i hadnt been all the way through you know anything like that   it now now it may be on some Federal Laws you know it it this was a we were dealing with uh with the state laws not necessarily  not necessarily federal that may have something to do with it and it may be too that if it were um a capital crime   state yeah   uh capital murder or something like that that it may be different   yeah well i wouldnt oh that would be hard   yes it would   it would be hard to sentence somebody to death if you werent really really really sure youd have to be really really really sure that he did it i mean really sure   well i had a friend who sat in on a or who was on a jury recently for a murder but the man was not being tried for capital murder and so that was not even an option uh the death penalty was not an option so and in in this case everyone on the jury felt that it should have been  and they were very convinced the man had no redeeming uh qualities and couldnt be rehabilitated and they were they were really upset that he was getting off so lightly for the heinous crime that he had been involved in   oh   im real glad that i dont that i dont work in that kind of a uh a background background ill take my job any day   yeah think of the pressures     you know i dont work with perfect people anymore than anybody else does but i can handle the imperfections that im around i i could not work in the in the uh criminal area for very long as a as a police officer as uh someone who works for the court system or whatever   yeah   so anyway back to the original question i really think i if if we were still allowed to choose guilt or innocence   well   id be more than happy to let the judge determine the uh the sentencing   the sentencing yeah i agree i agree with you right i do agree with you i i figure that its been a couple of years now since ive served now so im ive been looking lately for mine  its about time for me to get called up down there again     um   so i enjoy doing it   i do too   as long as i get paid well now before i worked for TI and i didnt get days uh time off for jury duty you know it was difficult     oh i bet   because there are a lot of places that dont give you time i mean they give you the time but not the pay   i see okay   so you know you lose a days pay and you  well you make about eight dollars or whatever it is you know   big deal oh you make eight dollars now in Dallas County huh its only seven fifty here in Collin   i think its eight it might i i dont remember   it probably is which is about what it costs you to park your car right   well they send you a free bus ticket and i use it   oh do they oh okay   so you know i come out pretty good on it i mean i get and plus my TI money i come out real good on it now the last one i served on i was working at TI and so i got time off for it but i was working third shift and that made it a little difficult   yeah oh   to decide   yeah i i can see how that would be difficult   yeah to decide which day to take off and you know do you take off the day   before you go oh that would be tough   after you go or before you go so it was tough so but anyway well i dont have much more to say about it   um what about the other suggestion that they had that uh about the jury all the jury agreeing on the sentencing do you feel that that is a requirement   i think if anybody has a doubt you need to yeah i do feel that yes i really do   that there there should be agreement agreement   yeah   i think i do too   because someone might see something that you dont see i mean you know they may have they may have picked up on something that gave them that doubt that   umhum   you know yeah i really think everybody needs to agree   its its its so easy anyway for everybody to just kind of become a yes man and get carried up along with the emotions and so if theres somebody whos strong enough to stand up with a specific doubt i would a whole lot rather go through the expense of another trial because of a hung jury than that a justice not be meted out correctly   yeah   so   yeah   i agree with boy its really easy  to discuss something when you both agree   yeah well you know that i mean i uh you have to agree on this almost i would think i cant imagine not agreeing that everybody should agree on a jury i i i dont know on ours when we we all really agreed on this did you all have any disagreements when you were doing the sentencing   well it took us six hours to reach agreement yeah   i cant remember how many it didnt take us but an hour i think or an hour and a half we were all pretty i think we had one man in there that uh wanted to find him guilty because he kept saying he did it then we kept saying he did it but the other guy you know yeah we had to convince him that um you know that yes he did it but he wasnt guilty he didnt need to go to jail for doing it that was you know he did it he admitted it that he bit that guys finger but he did it in self defense so you know we just didnt feel that he needed   yeah apparently you all were successful in uh convincing him at last   yes finally we did it didnt take
