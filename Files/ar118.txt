 Synopsis Introduction A reduction in the sex ratio male female is characteristic of most autoimmune disorders The increased prevalence in females ranges from a modest 2 1 for multiple sclerosis 1 to approximately 10 1 for systemic lupus erythematosus 2 This tendency toward autoimmunity in females is often ascribed to hormonal differences because in a number of experimental disease models estrogens exacerbated disease and androgens can inhibit disease activity 3 4 However human studies have failed to demonstrate a clear cut influence of hormonal environment on disease susceptibility to lupus or other autoimmune disorders In addition many childhood forms of autoimmunity such as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis exhibit female predominance 5 Interestingly juvenile type 1 diabetes is an exception to this general trend with a sex ratio close to 1 in most studies 6 Therefore it is reasonable to consider alternative explanations for the increased prevalence of autoimmune diseases in human females A unifying feature of autoimmune disorders appears to be the loss of immunologic tolerance to self antigens and in many of these diseases there is evidence that T cell tolerance has been broken The most profound form of T cell tolerance involves deletion of potentially self reactive T cells during thymic selection Thus lack of exposure to a self antigen in the thymus may lead to the presence of autoreactive T cells and may increase the risk of autoimmunity An elegant example of this has recently been reported 7 The existence of X chromosome inactivation in females offers a potential mechanism whereby X linked self antigens may escape presentation in the thymus or in other peripheral sites that are involved in tolerance induction Early in female development one of the two X chromosomes in each cell undergoes an ordered process of inactivation with subsequent silencing of most genes on the inactive X chromosome 8 This phenomenon occurs at a very early embryonic stage 9 and thus all females are mosaic and may occasionally exhibit extreme skewing towards one or the other parental X chromosome In theory this may result in a situation in which polymorphic self antigens on one X chromosome may fail to be expressed at sufficiently high levels in a tolerizing compartment such as the thymus and yet may be expressed at a considerable frequency in the peripheral soma Thus females may be predisposed to a situation in which they can occasionally express X linked autoantigens in the periphery to which they have been inefficiently tolerized Stewart 10 has recently speculated that such a mechanism may play a role in the predisposition to systemic lupus This hypothesis predicts that females with autoimmunity may be particularly prone to this mechanism of inadequate tolerization by virtue of extremely skewed X chromosome inactivation We therefore performed a comprehensive analysis of X chromosome inactivation patterns in populations of females with multiple sclerosis systemic lupus erythematosus juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and in female control individuals The results do not provide support for a major role for skewed X chromosome inactivation in female predisposition to autoimmunity however neither is the underlying hypothesis disproved by the present data Materials and method DNA was obtained from female patients from the following sources 45 persons with juvenile diabetes seen at the Virginia Mason Research Center in Seattle Washington 58 multiple sclerosis patients seen at the New York Hospital Multiple Sclerosis Center 46 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus seen at the Hospital for Special Surgery New York 18 patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis seen at the Children s Hospital Medical Center in Cleveland In addition 30 healthy age matched females were studied as normal controls Employing a modification of previously described methods 11 we utilized a fluorescent Hpa II PCR assay of the androgen receptor AR locus to assess X chromosome inactivation patterns The AR gene contains a polymorphic CAG repeat which is flanked by Hpa II sites These Hpa II sites are methylated on the inactive X chromosome and are unmethylated on the active X chromosome By performing PCR amplification across this region after cutting with the methylation sensitive enzyme Hpa II the relative amounts of the methylated AR alleles can be quantitatively determined with a high degree of accuracy variance on repeated assays is approximately 4 12 Skewing of X chromosome inactivation is expressed as percentage deviation from equal 50 50 inactivation of the upper and lower AR alleles Therefore the maximal possible deviation is 50 in which case all of the X chromosomes bearing one of the AR alleles are inactivated Results We examined X chromosome inactivation patterns in several different populations The results are summarized in Fig 1 A wide range of X inactivation skewing was observed in all five groups Approximately 5 nine out of 197 of individuals exhibited extreme skewing greater than 40 deviation from a 50 50 distribution However there was no difference between the groups either in the overall mean skewing or in the fraction of individuals with extreme skewing 40 Although the present study was not initiated in order to examine allelic variation in the AR gene per se the data provide an opportunity to address this question Excessively long CAG repeats in the AR are a rare cause of spinal bulbar muscular atrophy 13 and AR repeat length appears to have an influence on the biology of certain tumors 14 15 In this context it has been shown that transcription of AR correlates inversely with repeat length 16 We therefore compared AR repeat length in control individuals and patients with autoimmunity No differences were observed for mean repeat length or for maximum and minimum repeat length among the five groups Discussion The reason for the female predominance in most autoimmune diseases remains obscure The present study was initiated in order to address the hypothesis that a nonhormonal mechanism related to X inactivation might be involved The hypothesis rests on the idea that skewing of X inactivation might lead to a deficiency of tolerance induction in the thymus particularly with respect to polymorphic X linked autoantigens The hypothesis predicts that skewed X inactivation would be more prevalent in females with autoimmune diseases than in female control individuals This was not observed Nevertheless these negative data do not rule out a role for X inactivation in female predisposition to loss of tolerance A general model for how this mechanism might operate is shown in Fig 2 Thymocytes undergo selection in the thymic parenchyma and in the case of negative selection the selecting elements appear to be derived from the bone marrow and consist mainly of thymic dendritic cells If the thymic dendritic cell population exhibits random X inactivation it is highly likely that differentiating thymocytes will contact dendritic cells that express self antigens on both X chromosomes This situation is outlined schematically on the left side of Fig 2 However if there is extremely skewed X inactivation in the thymic dendritic cell population a particular thymocyte might not come into contact with dendritic cells that express one of the two X chormosomes This would lead to a situation where T cells may undergo thymic maturation without having been negatively selected for antigens that are expressed on the predominantly inactive X chromosome This situation is shown on the right side of Fig 2 In order for this mechanism to be physiologically relevant some assumptions must be made First defective tolerance from skewed X inactivation should only be directed at X linked antigens that are polymorphic and for which the individual is heterozygous Thus this mechanism would not be expected to lead to lack of tolerance commonly unless there are at least several highly polymorphic X linked autoantigens in the population that are involved in thymic deletion events Second if this actually leads to autoimmunity it also predicts that the initial break in tolerance that leads to disease should involve an X linked autoantigen that is expressed in a peripheral nontolerizing site or circumstance A recent report 7 has elegantly demonstrated the importance of thymic deletion events in predisposition to autoimmune disease The proteolipid protein PLP autoantigen is expressed in alternatively spliced forms which exhibit tissue specific expression A nonspliced variant is expressed in peripheral neural tissue However in the thymus a splice variant results in the lack of thymic expression of an immunodominant peptide This results in loss of tolerace of T cells to this peptide presumably on the basis of lack of thymic deletion of thymocytes that are reactive with this antigen Interestingly PLP is encoded on the X chromsome However there is no evidence that genetic polymorphisms control the level splicing of PLP within the thymus Nevertheless these data illustrate the potential importance of deficiencies in thymic deletion for autoimmune T cell reactivity The present results suggest that if skewed X inactivation is relevant to thymic tolerance induction then the effect does not depend on global skewing of X chromosome inactivation at least in the hematopoietic compartment In this study we examined X inactivation patterns in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the results should reflect the state of X inactivation in all mesenchymal tissues including dendritic cells X inactivation occurs at a very early time point in development and thus the results in one tissue should reflect the general situation in the rest of the body However there may be exceptions to this We have occasionally observed differences in X inactivation patterns between buccal mucosa an ectodermally derived tissue and peripheral blood in the same individiual unpublished observations This could be a chance event or it may result from selection for certain X linked alleles during embryonic development as has been described in carriers of X linked immunodeficiencies 17 Another consideration is that certain tissue microenvironments may be derived from very small numbers of founder cells and thus may exhibit skewed utilization of one or the other X chromosome even if the tissue as a whole is not skewed This situation could vary over time Thus there may be time points at which certain thymic microenvironments are populated by dendritic cells that for stochastic reasons all utilize the same X chromosome This would create a window of opportunity in which a given thymocyte in a given selecting location could escape negative selection by antigens on the inactive X chromosome The likelihood of this happening would obviously depend on the number of dendritic cells that are usually contacted by a thymocyte during thymic selection There is limited information on this point although Stewart 10 has theorized that this number may be as low as 15 If this is the case then escape from thymic deletion may still occur in females who are heterozygous for a relevant X linked antigen even if the hematopoietic cells in general do not exhibit extreme skewing In conclusion we suggest that X chromosome inactivation needs to be considered as a potential factor in the predominance of females in most autoimmune diseases Our inability to show an increase in X chromosome skewing in females with autoimmunity does not eliminate this as an etiologic contributor to loss of immunologic tolerance Future experiments must be directed at a detailed analysis of tissue patterns of X inactivation as well as at a search for potential X linked autoantigens Introduction A reduction in the sex ratio male female is characteristic of most autoimmune disorders The

Special Surgery New York 18 patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis seen at the Children s Hospital Medical Center in Cleveland In addition 30 healthy age matched females were studied as normal controls Hpa II polymerase chain reaction assay for X chromosome inactivation A modification to a previously described assay for AR methylation 11 was used for these studies In the normal females the AR gene is methylated on the inactive X chromosome and is undermethylated on the active X chromosome Furthermore the presence of a highly polymorphic triplet repeat within the AR gene allows for the discrimination of each X chromosome in most female subjects Fig 3 Thus allele specific methylation patterns can be distinguished using this gene Genomic DNA approximately 200 ng was digested overnight using a methylation sensitive restriction enzyme HpaII as per the manufacturer s instructions Gibco BRL Rockville MD USA A mock sample as control was prepared simultaneously without the HpaII enzyme After the digestion the samples were boiled for 10 min to inactivate the enzyme PCR amplification was performed with final concentration of the digest equivalent to approximately 100 ng of the DNA 1 PCR bufferII Perkin Elmer Foster City CA USA 2 5 mmol l MgCl 2 and amplitaq gold 1 25 units Primers used were AR1 5 TCCAGAATCTGTTCCA GAGCGTGC 3 and AR2 5 GCTGTGAAGGTTGCT GTTCCTCAT 3 These primers flank the triple repeat CAG and the HpaII sites in the first exon of the AR gene Fig 3 The AR1 primer was fluorescence labeled with 6 Fam and TET The 6 Fam AR1 and the TET AR1 were used for mock and HpaII digested samples respectively This combination allowed simultaneous analyses of the PCR products of the HpaII and mock treated samples using the ABI310 Genetic Analyzer Perkin Elmer The final concentration of the AR1 primer was 3 pmol 6 Fam AR1 7 pmol unlabelled AR1 and 10 pmol of unlabeled AR2 in a 50 l reaction The cycling conditions were as follows denaturation at 95 C 12 min to activate the amplitaq gold followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 C 45 s annealing at 60 C 30 s and extension at 72 C 30 s After 35 cycles the final extension was done at 72 C 10 min The PCR products of each sample mock and HpaII were diluted 1 10 in the same vial One microliter of the diluted product was then added to a mixture containing 12 l deionized formamide and 0 5 l molecular weight standard GS 350 TAMRA The vials were denatured at 95 C 5 min cooled on ice and resolved using a 310 Genetic Analyzer Perkin Elmer Calculations for percentage of skewing of X inactivation Two peaks corresponding to two alleles were obtained from the 310 Genetic Analyzer for each mock and HpaII treated sample The relative intensity of the larger AR allele higher molecular weight peak 2 with respect to the smaller AR allele low molecular weight peak 1 was calculated and expressed as the ratio R peak 2 area peak 1 area The ratios in the mock digested R M and HpaII digested R H samples were calculated separately and were then averaged for each of the two sets of duplicate samples For each individual a normalized ratio R N R H R M was calculated to correct for occasional minor variation in efficiency of amplification of the two AR alleles This normalized ratio was used to determine the percentage of inactivation of the X chromosome bearing the larger AR allele percentage inactivation R N R N 1 100 The degree of skewing was calculated by subtracting 50 from the observed degree of inactivation Results Fluorescent Hpa II polymerase chain reaction assay for X chromosome inactivation Employing a modification of previously described methods 11 we utilized a fluorescent Hpa II PCR assay of the AR locus to assess X chromosome inactivation patterns As shown in Fig 3 the AR gene contains a polymorphic CAG repeat that is flanked by Hpa II sites These Hpa II sites are methylated on the inactive X chromosome and are unmethylated on the active X chromosome By performing PCR amplification across this region after cutting with the methylation sensitive enzyme Hpa II the relative amounts of the methylated AR alleles can be quantitatively determined with a high degree of accuracy variance on repeated assays is approximately 4 12 Two examples of this assay are shown in Fig 4 In Fig 4a an individual with equivalent methylation of both AR alleles is shown In this case the relative peak intensity is equivalent in the mock digested and Hpa II digested samples In Fig 4b an individual with extremely skewed X inactivation is shown in whom the lower allele 271 bp is relatively over methylated compared with the upper 284 bp allele Thus the X chromosome bearing the lower allele is preferentially inactivated As described in the Materials and method section all assays were normalized to the mock results and performed in duplicate Skewing of X chromosome inactivation is expressed as a percentage deviation from equal 50 50 inactivation of the upper and lower AR alleles Therefore the maximal possible deviation is 50 in which case all of the X chromosome bearing one of the AR alleles are inactivated Comparison of X chromosome inactivation patterns in normal females and females with autoimmune diseases We examined X chromosome inactivation patterns in several different populations The results are summarized in Fig 1 A wide range of X inactivation skewing

very early time point in development and thus the results in one tissue should reflect the general situation in the rest of the body However there may be exceptions to this We have occasionally observed differences in X inactivation patterns between buccal mucosa an ectodermally derived tissue and peripheral blood mesoderm in the same individual unpublished observations This could be a chance event or may result from selection for certain X linked alleles during embryonic development as has been described in carriers of X linked immunodeficiencies 17 However in general subsets of cells within the hematopoietic compartment do not display differences in X inactivation patterns unpublished observations Another consideration is that certain tissue microenvironments may be derived from very small numbers of founder cells and thus may exhibit skewed utilization of one or the other X chromosome even if the tissue as a whole is not skewed This situation could vary over time Thus there may be time points at which certain thymic microenvironments are populated by dendritic cells that for stochastic reasons all utilize the same X chromosome This would create a window of

low as 15 If this is the case escape from thymic deletion may still occur in females who are heterozygous for a relevant X linked antigen even if the hematopoietic cells in general do not exhibit extreme skewing If the latter scenario is operative it will be extremely difficult to document it by studying X inactivation patterns One might examine X inactivation skewing specifically in thymic dendritic populations but if the effect is at the level of microenvironment and varies over time then it will not be possible to detect this using methods directed at large cell populations as we have done here Conceivably examination of thymic tissue sections could provide support for the hypothesis Another aspect of this is that some thymic deletion events appear to be mediated by thymic epithelial cells at the cortico medullary junction Interestingly thymic epithelial cells appear to be derived from very few founder cells 18 and thus should exhibit a rather large degree of patchiness with respect to X inactivation This again might lead to local epithelial cell microenvironments that fail to delete for X linked autoantigens It has recently become apparent that mechanisms of peripheral tolerance also exist and we have considered the possibility that skewed X inactivation in a peripheral tolerizing compartment might also lead to inefficient tolerance A major mechanism of peripheral tolerance induction appears to involve the recognition of tolerizing antigens by T cells in the absence of costimulation 19 This may specifically occur in the paracortical regions of lymph nodes without further progression of the tolerized T cells into lymph node follicles Because this mechanism presumably involves circulating antigen it is difficult to invoke a role for X inactivation skewing in altering this process unless the skewing were virtually complete Tolerance induction by parenchymal tissue has also been described 20 and may be a multistage process that is still not entirely understood Conceivably skewed expression of X linked autoantigens could play a role here but this would require invoking a peripheral tolerizing compartment that is limiting with respect to the dosage of tolerizing cells to which peripheral T cells can be exposed No such compartment has yet been defined In conclusion we suggest that X chromosome inactivation needs to be considered as a potential factor in the predominance of females in most autoimmune diseases Our inability to show an increase in X chromosome skewing in females with autoimmunity does not eliminate this as an etiologic contributor to loss of immunologic tolerance Future experiments must be directed at detailed analysis of tissue patterns of X inactivation as well as at a search for potential X linked autoantigens
