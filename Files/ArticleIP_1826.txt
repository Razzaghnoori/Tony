 Dick Armey You better not try to stand in my way as I m walkin out the door Take this job and shove itI ain t workin here no more Johnny Paycheck What politician enjoyed the Fourth of July holiday more than Dick Armey While his colleagues were out hustling for campaign dollars and marching in sticky hot parades the House s majority leader was casting for bass on an Army Corps of Engineers lake just northwest of Dallas humming a Hank Williams tune At least that s what we ve come to expect given the persona Armey has cultivated a plain speaking country music loving guy who would to quote the bumper sticker rather be fishing than putting up with Washington s political BS This I ain t much at speechifyin image has served Armey well in his surprising rise through the ranks of the House Republican leadership setting him apart from other politicians and making him seem personable But it has cost him respect Is Armey just one step away from the speakership Or is he the only thing keeping the debilitated Newt Gingrich in power The moderates in the GOP caucus such as they are find Armey too conservative and outspoken to serve as speaker while the hard liners say he s too ineffective a spokesman to replace Gingrich Having already paid too high a political price for Gingrich s failings Republican incumbents don t want another headache leading the party Hence GOP insiders are taking Armey down a few pegs Arianna Huffington bicoastal proprietress of the Republican political salon took a break from her endless campaign against Gingrich to attack his heir apparent in one of her recent op eds Calling Armey Newt Gingrich s best insurance policy she accused him of duplicity in defending Gingrich when simply everyone knows dahling that the GOP needs new leadership It is high time Huffington wrote for some young Turks to recognize that there are moments when appeasement is more destructive than war and to strike Armey has been dismissed before beginning with his first run for Congress in 1984 A geeky economics professor with a Midwestern accent challenging an entrenched Texas Democrat Armey was given no chance of winning Soon after capturing what would become a safe seat he fathered one of the unlikeliest pieces of legislation to emerge from Congress a bill creating an apolitical process for closing obsolete military bases In 1992 he surprised fellow Republicans by challenging GOP Conference Chairman Jerry Lewis R Calif a party insider and known conciliator and took his job from him In 1993 asked whether he would run for the minority whip post in the 104 th Congress Armey told everyone including an incredulous Dick Gephardt in a limousine ride back from the White House that he expected to be the next majority leader He may have been grinning but he wasn t joking But Armey s refusal to play the Washington game to dine with media stars or golf with lobbyists makes him an outsider And he pays for this lack of political refinement as the political oddsmakers portray him as a boorish ideologue and rhetorical bumbler prone to such Armey Axioms as You can t put your finger on a problem when you ve got it to the wind Damaging Armey further is his contemptuous relationship with the press He rarely gives direct answers to unfriendly questions although he s always good for a few bizarre Dan Rather Texasisms Instead of giving artful non answers to tough questions a prerequisite talent for politicians Armey usually lets fly a smart aleck comment that gets him in trouble Soon after becoming majority leader he referred to Rep Barney Frank D Mass as Barney Fag But after a shaky first few months in charge Armey settled in as the House s relatively effective chief operating officer In recent weeks a series of Republican legislative misplays has increased skepticism about whether Armey can be speaker Most of the fault lies with Gingrich The speaker has been considered politically dead for so long that most folks talk about him as a quaint memory But as Huffington noted Armey has not acquitted himself well with his effort to keep up appearances Still suppose Armey were passed over for the job Consider the rest of the Republican leadership Majority Whip Tom DeLay another Texan is Armey s opposite the Republican Jim Wright Rank and file Republicans fear DeLay and respect his political abilities but they don t like him or trust him as much as they do Armey John Boehner a slick but likable Ohioan who chairs the House Republican Conference is as adept at playing the Washington game as is DeLay befriending reporters making goo goo eyes at lobbyists passing around campaign contributions on the House floor etc But he s more comfortable behind the scenes pencil him in as the next whip Bill Paxon a Gingrich minion at the National Republican Congressional Committee the party s fund raising and spending apparatus that helped win the House for the GOP in 1994 is enthusiastic and smart but doesn t seem tough enough to be speaker The classic sidekick even to his wife Susan Molinari Paxon is being talked about as the next majority leader Call him Armey s good cop counterpart Which leaves us with Armey Knowing that he s close to getting the job he s started to cultivate a more conciliatory image But a softer Dick Armey is a tall order and it s resulted in more verbal gaffes and more unseemly backpedaling On a recent Meet the Press the New Dick agonized over the question of human rights in China but then reached the conclusion that free trade is a basic human right and voted as usual for MFN status What to expect from Speaker Armey He doesn t waffle Throughout his political career he has focused on free market economic principles unrestricted trade low taxes less government regulation Unlike Sen Phil Gramm R Texas another former economics professor Armey has avoided budget hypocrisy by eschewing the pork barrel some of the military bases he closed were in his state He took on farm subsidies He was pro flat tax before flat tax was cool And his advocacy of the flat tax isn t just some Gingrichian intellectual dalliance a Gephardtian populist pose or even a Forbesian attempt to pocket a few million more bucks a year Holding fast to one s beliefs has never been a desirable trait in congressional leaders Yet it would be unwise to count Armey out Even Republican loyalists would agree that anybody is better than Gingrich whose image softening efforts consist of photo ops with furry animals Armey prefers his wildlife flailing at the end of a baited hook Those who worry about how the ruffian image will play should Armey become speaker can rest easy As both angler and politician one Armey admirer told me He s catch and release
