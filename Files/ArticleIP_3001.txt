 Cold War Follies In October 1962 after the Soviet Union stationed nuclear missiles in Fidel Castro s Cuba President John F Kennedy called upon Dean Acheson for advice With typical self assurance the grand old man of the Cold War bellowed his recommendation at a meeting of the so called ExComm of top Kennedy aides a swift U S airstrike to take out the nukes When asked what the result would be Acheson replied that Moscow would then destroy a cache of NATO nuclear missiles in Turkey Then what he was asked Under our NATO obligations Acheson said Washington would have to attack a nuclear base within the Soviet Union itself And then Acheson paused That s when we hope the magisterial wise man said that cooler heads will prevail and they ll stop and talk Mercifully the end of the Cold War has brought an end to this type of hair raising exchange But those readers looking to remember the bad old days can find this sort of thing and plenty of it in Aleksandr Fursenko and Timothy Naftali s important new book on the Cuban missile crisis One Hell of a Gamble It would be nice to report that their account packs the pleasure and thrills of a spy novel but that s not exactly the case Spy novels induce a frisson of tension that s enjoyable because the reader knows nothing is really at stake But Fursenko and Naftali s book while it will leave readers knuckles white is no fun at all to read because the events it describes are so frightening Their impressive account is one of the best of a flood of new books about the Cold War triggered by the end of the superpowers long struggle These have ranged from the triumphalist such as Jay Winik s On the Brink a hagiographic account of the Reagan era officials he sees as the Cold War s victors to the tendentious say Peter Schweizer s simplistic Victory giving all the credit again to Reagan to the thoughtful such as We Now Know by the dean of Cold War historians John Lewis Gaddis One Hell of a Gamble belongs in the last category Fursenko and Naftali resist the urge to gloat or sermonize and instead let their research speak for them It has quite a bit to say little of it soothing Fursenko a leading Russian historian and member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and Naftali a fellow in international security studies at Yale add much to what we know about the coldest days of the Cold War from careful digging in newly opened Soviet archives In particular the popular image of the missile crisis as a triumph for JFK s diplomacy gets badly dented Kennedy began his term hoping to establish a new detente with Moscow but he also sought to rid the Western Hemisphere of communism by ousting Castro These goals soon proved incompatible In his 1960 campaign Kennedy talked up a fictional missile gap in order to show up the GOP as flaccid on communism During the Eisenhower administration Castro had begun moving deeper into the Soviet orbit out of fear of a U S invasion Kennedy s failed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 aggravated Castro s anxieties and gave him a rallying cry for a pro Soviet tilt Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev fearing the loss of his model for a new path of socialist development got mischievous Why not throw a hedgehog at Uncle Sam s pants he asked and decided to move missiles into Cuba The gambit would at a stroke deter Kennedy from invading Cuba cement Moscow s alliance with Havana and shift the world strategic balance Washington would learn to live with the missiles Khrushchev figured just as Moscow lived with NATO s nuclear missiles on its Turkish frontier But Kennedy had no intention of doing so Instead of Acheson s airstrike the ExComm chose to blockade Cuba with warships After several harrowing days Khrushchev blinked and agreed to remove the missiles in return for an American pledge not to invade Cuba and a secret pact to remove the Turkish missiles The superpowers subsequently entered a brief era of eased tensions installing the famous Kremlin White House hot line and signing a nuclear test ban treaty One Hell of a Gamble writes Arthur Schlesinger Jr Camelot s court historian shows an American president doggedly bent on the avoidance of nuclear war Actually it shows that mixed politics send mixed signals True the planet was not destroyed for which we should be grateful but Kennedy s maladroit foreign policy helped create the conditions for the crisis The world was brought to the verge of nuclear catastrophe because of a missile gap that did not exist Turkish missiles that were not supposed to be there and an invasion that was not coming Khrushchev doesn t come off looking any better Fursenko and Naftali offer a wealth of new details about Soviet and Cuban motives including the most comprehensive picture yet of Havana s slow entry into the Soviet orbit We also get a better look at the roots of Khrushchev s decision to back down In the X article the landmark 1947 essay that spelled out the fundamentals of America s Cold War strategy George Kennan argued that the Kremlin has no compunction about retreating in the face of superior force And being under the compulsion of no timetable it does not get panicky under the necessity for such retreat I f it finds unassailable barriers in its path it accepts these philosophically and accommodates itself to them Sure enough confronted with such a barrier in 1962 Khrushchev decided to give way He retreated as philosophically as he could although he described his reaction to the setback in rather less elegant language There was no need for the Kremlin he said to act like the czarist officer who farted at the ball and then shot himself Fursenko and Naftali s book is full of this type of gripping new detail including the book s biggest scariest revelation The Kremlin we learn had decided to use tactical battlefield nuclear weapons against U S troops if Kennedy invaded Cuba Had Kennedy not opted for the blockade it s clear that the first combat use of nuclear weapons since Nagasaki could have prompted a terrifying cycle of escalation The Cuban missile crisis it seems may have been even worse than we had thought Facing a more complex world some diplomats and conservative scholars seem to long nostalgically for the era of Mutual Assured Destruction One Hell of a Gamble comes as a welcome corrective Bad as today s global uncertainties may seem the Cold War system always had an even more dangerous potential for getting out of control Even after the superpowers 1962 showdown led to an easing of tensions the planet still had a series of nuclear scares such as the October 1973 nuclear alert which happened on the detente minded watch of Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon The inherent problem with Cold War brinkmanship as the Harvard theorist Thomas C Schelling has noted is that it could elicit concessions only if one s opponent didn t know exactly where the brink was One Hell of a Gamble reminds us just how terrifying that game could be Any fool could start a war Khrushchev used to like to say In 1962 Khrushchev Castro and Kennedy almost did
