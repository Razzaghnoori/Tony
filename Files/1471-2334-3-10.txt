 Background Amprenavir APV is a potent protease inhibitor PI that is used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of antiretroviral na ve and experienced adults and children with HIV infection 1 2 3 4 5 APV offers the convenience of twice daily BID administration with no food or fluid restrictions 6 7 Preclinical and clinical data suggest that APV has a lower potential to cause lipodystrophy and metabolic abnormalities than other currently available PIs 8 9 10 APV has a distinct resistance profile that permits it to be considered as a treatment option for either PI na ve or PI experienced patients 11 In a 64 week trial in treatment na ve patients NZTA4002 n 302 APV 1200 mg administered BID APV1200 with one abacavir 300 mg tablet and one lamivudine 150 mg zidovudine 300 mg combination tablet Combivir was as effective as nelfinavir 750 mg three times daily plus Combivir BID with regard to the proportion of patients achieving HIV 1 RNA 40 copies mL at week 64 77 vs 66 as treated analysis 12 However many patients in this trial withdrew prematurely because of adverse events that may have been in part related to the high pill burden 16 large 150 mg soft gelatin capsules daily associated with APV dosing and excipients contained in the APV formulation available at the time of the trial To reduce APV pill burden and possibly improve tolerability of APV treatment pharmacokinetic research efforts have been directed at combining APV with the PI ritonavir RTV which inhibits CYP3A4 mediated hepatic metabolism of APV thereby enhancing plasma APV exposure 13 14 15 The administration of RTV at the clinically sub therapeutic dosage of 100 mg BID was found to boost APV plasma exposure to such a degree as to permit halving the APV daily pill burden from 16 to 8 capsules day in addition to maintaining the minimum plasma APV concentration C min over 24 hours well above the 50 inhibitory concentrations IC 50 of patient derived HIV 1 isolates 15 A pharmacokinetic study in 20 HIV infected patients PROF1004 showed that APV at the lower dosage of 600 mg BID combined with RTV 100 mg BID APV600 RTV resulted in a geometric mean steady state APV C min 1 92 g mL over 6 fold higher than the C min resulting from APV1200 0 3 g mL 16 This C min was more than 13 fold higher than the IC 50 of APV against HIV of antiretroviral na ve patients mean 0 146 0 125 g mL and over 2 fold higher than the IC 50 of APV against HIV of multi PI resistant patients mean 0 903 0 846 g mL IC 50 s adjusted for the 90 protein binding observed with APV Following APV600 RTV the APV maximum serum concentration C max has been reported to be slightly lower by 27 than that observed with APV1200 17 which may account for the RTV boosted APV regimen being less likely to cause certain adverse events e g oral perioral paresthesia and headache 18 Since the above pharmacokinetic studies and others involving pharmacokinetic modeling predictions were conducted over only a short period generally 14 days and in a small number of patients there remained a need to evaluate low dose APV RTV combinations in large populations of HIV 1 infected patients over a therapeutically relevant period The purpose of ESS40011 was to compare the efficacy safety and tolerability of APV 600 mg BID plus RTV 100 mg BID APV600 RTV to APV 1200 mg BID APV1200 over 24 weeks in antiretroviral na ve or experienced HIV infected patients who were receiving other background antiretroviral drugs Late in the study patients who had not yet completed 24 weeks of treatment were given the option to continue treatment in a subsequent 24 week extension phase to assess the durability of virologic response Methods Patients Male and non pregnant non lactating female outpatients were eligible for study enrollment if they were at least 18 years of age had HIV 1 infection documented by HIV 1 antibody enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA and confirmed by Western blot test positive HIV 1 culture positive HIV 1 serum antigen or plasma viremia and CD4 cell counts 50 mm 3 Women of childbearing potential had to have a negative serum human chorionic gonadotropin HCG pregnancy test at screening and had to be willing to use an adequate method of contraception during the study Patients could be either antiretroviral na ve or experienced If patients were antiretroviral experienced they had to be na ve to APV have a plasma HIV 1 RNA 1000 copies mL show susceptibility to APV and 2 other antiretroviral drugs and remain on their most recent treatment regimen until completion of the screening visit For all drugs susceptibility was defined as an HIV isolate with 4 0 fold change in IC 50 determined by VIRCOGEN Tibotec Virco NV Mechelen Belgium a virtual phenotype assay in comparison to the control virus Patients were excluded if they had active Centers for Disease Control CDC Class C status could not comply with the study schedule were in another investigational drug study were undergoing opiate detoxification had a malabsorption syndrome or pre existing condition that interfered with normal gastrointestinal transit had clinically significant laboratory abnormalities required radiation therapy or cytotoxic chemotherapy or had received immunomodulating agents within 4 weeks pre study or had received an HIV 1 immunotherapeutic vaccine within 3 months pre study Patients were allowed to take pravastatin fluvastatin cerivastatin or atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia at the cautionary discretion of the investigators but were not allowed to take lovastatin simvastatin or any other drug known to significantly affect metabolism by the cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 enzyme system Study Design In this multicenter open label clinical trial patients were first stratified according to prior antiretroviral therapy exposure i e na ve or experienced then randomized 3 1 to treatment for 24 weeks with either APV 600 mg BID plus RTV 100 mg BID or to APV 1200 mg BID in combination with 2 non PI antiretroviral drugs APV was supplied as 150 mg soft gelatin capsules of Agenerase GlaxoSmithKline Research Triangle Park North Carolina thus eight capsules were given for each 1200 mg dose of APV and four capsules for each 600 mg dose RTV was supplied as 100 mg soft gelatin capsules of Norvir Abbott Laboratories North Chicago Illinois Late in the study patients who had not yet completed 24 weeks of treatment were given the option to continue treatment in a subsequent 24 week extension phase to assess the durability of virologic response During the 6 week period prior to the start of the study candidates were screened for study eligibility demography CDC classification HIV risk factors mode of HIV transmission antiretroviral therapy history and medical history and given a physical examination Prior to study initiation the ESS40011 study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at each participating study site All participants provided written informed consent before any study related procedures were commenced The initial 24 week portion of the study was conducted between June 13 2000 and October 18 2001 at 44 treatment centers in the United States Efficacy and Safety Assessment The primary efficacy parameter was the proportion of patients with plasma HIV 1 RNA levels 200 copies mL at week 24 Plasma HIV 1 RNA was assessed by the Roche Amplicor MONITOR Ultrasensitive assay version 1 5 lower limit of quantitation LLOQ 50 copies mL and quantitation range of 50 to 75 000 copies mL Roche Diagnostics Branchburg New Jersey Patients were classified as having reached a virologic endpoint if at week 24 plasma HIV 1 RNA levels were 200 copies mL or if the plasma HIV 1 RNA had not decreased by at least 0 5 log 10 from baseline at week 8 with confirmation at week 12 Secondary efficacy measures included assessment of the proportion of patients achieving HIV 1 RNA 50 copies mL using the above mentioned assay changes in CD4 cell counts measured by flow cytometry compared with baseline values and progression of HIV disease from baseline status to the occurrence of the first new event involving a change in CDC class for each patient Patients who remained at their entry CDC class were considered to be clinical non progressors Change from baseline in plasma HIV 1 RNA levels was assessed at weeks 4 8 12 and 24 in all patients as well as at weeks 32 40 and 48 in patients who participated in the treatment extension phase CD4 cell counts were assessed at baseline and at weeks 12 and 24 Patients had plasma collected for genotype virtual phenotype at screening for experienced patients only and at the time of virologic failure results to be reported elsewhere Statistical Analysis The study was powered to evaluate whether the virologic efficacy proportion of patients with plasma HIV 1 HIV 200 copies mL at week 24 in the APV 600 RTV arm was at least as good non inferior as in the APV1200 arm Non inferiority of the APV600 RTV regimen to the APV1200 regimen was established if the 95 lower confidence limit LCL for the difference in proportion of patients achieving HIV 1 RNA 200 copies mL at week 24 with APV 600 RTV minus APV1200 was 0 12 The non inferiority margin of 0 12 was chosen based on previous regulatory studies and was pre specified in the protocol Target enrollment was 198 in the APV600 RTV arm and 66 in the APV1200 arm The primary analysis was made in the intent to treat ITT population which consisted of all eligible patients who were randomized into the study regardless of what treatment was actually received and the eventual outcome of study participation Two types of analyses were performed an ITT observed analysis in which only available assessments were used no imputation for missing values regardless of whether the patient was still receiving their original therapy and an ITT missing failure ITT M F analysis in which all missing values constituted failure Comparisons between treatment arms regarding proportion of patients achieving HIV 1 RNA 200 copies mL and 50 copies mL were made using the Cochran Mantel Haenszel test controlling for prior antiretroviral drug experience Changes from baseline in plasma HIV 1 RNA log 10 copies mL and CD4 cell count and average area under the curve minus baseline AAUCMB in plasma HIV 1 RNA were tabulated by treatment arm and visit then analyzed using analysis of variance ANOVA The safety population consisted of all patients who consumed at least 1 dose of study drug Safety parameters included incidence of treatment limiting toxicities clinical and laboratory adverse events and change from baseline in selected laboratory variables at weeks 4 8 12 and 24 Fisher s exact test was used to compare adverse event rate and ANOVA was used to compare change from baseline for laboratory variables between the two treatment arms A P value of 0 05 was considered statistically significant Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 6 12 SAS Institute Inc Cary NC Results Patient Characteristics and Disposition A total of 211 patients enrolled they were predominantly male 87 ethnically diverse 48 Caucasian 37 African American 14 Hispanic and had a mean age of 42 years median baseline HIV 1 RNA level of 4 33 log 10 copies mL and median baseline CD4 cell count of 257 cells mm 3 Most of the study population was antiretroviral experienced 81 One hundred and fifty eight 158 patients were randomized to the APV600 RTV regimen and 53 to the APV1200 regimen The two treatment arms did not differ with respect to any baseline characteristic Table 1 The most common background antiretroviral regimens taken by patients in the APV600 RTV and APV1200 treatment arms were stavudine didanosine 25 vs 30 Combivir 19 for both arms abacavir stavudine 11 for both arms lamivudine stavudine 9 vs 4 and abacavir didanosine 5 vs 6 A total of 150 patients 71 completed all 24 weeks of the study including a similar proportion of patients in the APV600 RTV arm 72 and APV1200 arm 68 Reasons for premature withdrawal from treatment were also similar between the APV600 RTV and APV1200 arms except for fewer patients in the APV600 RTV arm withdrawing due to protocol defined virologic failure 1 vs 6 Table 1 Antihyperlipidemic agents were used by 1 patient in each treatment arm neither of whom had taken this type of medication pre study No deaths or clinical progressions of HIV disease occurred Twenty patients enrolled into the extension phase including 15 in the APV600 RTV arm and 5 in the APV1200 arm Virologic Measurements of Efficacy At week 24 the proportion of patients with HIV 1 RNA 200 copies mL in the APV600 RTV arm and APV1200 arm was 46 73 158 and 38 20 53 respectively in the ITT M F analysis Figure 1 and 62 73 118 and 53 20 38 respectively in the ITT observed analysis Figure 2 The APV600 RTV regimen proved to be similar to or better than the APV1200 regimen because

mL endpoint although differences attained statistical significance Thus at week 24 significantly more patients in the APV600 RTV arm than the APV1200 arm achieved HIV 1 RNA 50 copies mL ITT M F

15 patients continued to have HIV 1 RNA levels 200 copies mL between week 24 and week 48 3 rebounded and 1 discontinued at week 32 Of the 5 patients who had HIV 1 RNA 200 copies mL at week 24 1 discontinued when an HIV 1 RNA of 186 copies mL was measured at week 32 1 missed week 32 and 40 visits but had an HIV 1 RNA of 878 copies mL at week 48 and 3 continued to have HIV 1 RNA 200 copies mL from week 24 to week 48 In these 3 patients HIV 1 RNA levels ranged from 316 to 3645 copies mL 1247 to 5175 copies mL and 143 to 12 149 copies mL respectively between weeks 24 and 48 Immunologic Measurements of Efficacy At baseline the median CD4 cell count in the APV600 RTV and APV1200 arms was 271 and 255 cells mm 3 respectively Over the 24 weeks of the study the median CD4 cell count remained higher than baseline with median elevations above baseline peaking at week 12 in both treatment arms 51 and 52 cells mm 3 respectively Figure 3 At week 24 the median change from baseline in CD4 cell count in the APV600 RTV and APV1200 arms was 35 and 46 cells mm 3 respectively and the final median CD4 cell count was 321 and 346 cells mm 3 respectively In patients who participated in the 24 week extension phase 12 of 15 patients in the APV600 RTV arm and 4 of 5 in the APV1200 arm had a median change from baseline in CD4 cell count at week 48 of 156 cell mm 3 and 143 cell mm 3 respectively The final median CD4 cell count in these patients was 404 and 407 cells mm 3 respectively The remaining patients did not have CD4 data reported Safety Table 2shows the drug related adverse events that were reported in 5 of patients Nausea diarrhea vomiting and fatigue were the most common adverse events in both treatment arms The incidence of drug related oral perioral paresthesia was lower in the APV600 RTV treatment arm than the APV1200 arm 2 vs 8 No differences between the APV600 RTV and APV1200 treatment arms were observed regarding the frequency of drug related grade 1 4 adverse events 44 vs 45 frequency of discontinuing treatment due to adverse events 7 vs 8 incidence of hyperglycemia 1 vs 0 patient nonspecific lipodystrophy 1 vs 0 buffalo hump 1 vs 0 or hypercholesterolemia 1 vs 0 More cases of hypertriglyceridemia were reported as adverse events in the APV600 RTV arm 11 7 vs 0 However review of laboratory changes revealed that the incidence of grade 3 4 hypertriglyceridemia was the same 4 in each treatment arm Discussion The virological results of this study indicate that over a 24 week treatment period the APV600 RTV regimen was statistically similar to or better than the APV1200 regimen according to the 200 copies mL endpoint criterion However a significantly greater proportion of patients in the APV600 RTV treatment arm achieved HIV 1 RNA 50 copies mL Greater reductions in plasma HIV 1 RNA levels were also observed in patients receiving APV600 RTV BID than those using APV1200 BID The greater magnitude of virologic suppression in the study population as a whole with the APV600 RTV regimen was expected in view of the results of earlier clinical pharmacokinetic studies showing a 6 fold higher C min level with APV600 RTV BID compared with the APV1200 BID regimen 16 Higher C min values achieved with RTV boosting may be critical in treating antiretroviral experienced patients particularly those with HIV isolates having increased IC 50 values The proportion of antiretroviral na ve patients who achieved HIV 1 RNA 200 copies mL in the APV600 RTV arm was twice that for the APV1200 arm 63 vs 30 P 0 141 No differences in virologic efficacy between treatment arms were evident in the antiretroviral experienced subgroup 42 vs 40 P 0 859 It is possible that proportionally more treatment na ve patients may have responded to APV600 RTV due to poorer or more difficult adherence to the APV1200 regimen but no adherence checks were included in this study to verify this Although the 50 copies mL endpoint criterion also showed a higher proportion of antiretroviral na ve patients responding to APV600 RTV than to APV1200 47 vs 20 the differences were not statistically significant possibly due to the small size of this subgroup In another study of APV600 RTV in antiretroviral na ve patients Arasteh et al 19 reported a higher proportion of patients achieving plasma HIV 1 RNA 50 copies mL 75 than in the present study perhaps due to the use of only lamivudine and abacavir as background antiretroviral medication and to differences in their study population relative to ours The proportion of antiretroviral experienced patients in the APV600 RTV treatment arm who achieved HIV 1 RNA 200 copies mL at 24 weeks 58 ITT observed analysis 42 ITT M F analysis was comparable to that reported in antiretroviral experienced patients at 24 weeks in the studies by Schooley et al 20 ESS40006 PEARL 69 ITT observed analysis but much higher than that reported by Katlama et al 21 31 ITT M F analysis Differences in virologic suppression between the present study and the Katlama study may stem from the use of other background agents and the far greater antiretroviral experience and well documented PI mutations in Katlama s patients The 24 week extension phase showed that most patients who had HIV 1 RNA 200 copies mL at week 24 maintained this level of virologic suppression through week 48 Thus some indication of durability of viral suppression might be gathered from these data although the number of patients evaluated in this study phase was small The durability of virologic response to APV600 RTV was also suggested in an earlier study by Katlama et al 21 The increase in CD4 cells observed at 24 weeks in the APV600 RTV BID arm was not different from that in the APV1200 arm It was lower in magnitude than the CD4 cell count increases reported for APV600 RTV arm at 24 weeks in antiretroviral experienced patients in ESS40006 20 and similar to that reported in heavily pre treated patients by Katlama et al 21 in a patient population with comparable baseline disease characteristics median HIV 1 RNA of 4 5 log 10 mL and CD4 count of 227 cells mm 3 The safety profile of the APV600 RTV regimen was similar to that of the APV1200 regimen with respect to the main adverse events which were gastrointestinal GI in nature in both treatment arms GI adverse events reported in the APV600 RTV arm were possibly due to the addition of RTV to the regimen or because the reduction in pill burden and hence in excipients was not great enough to improve GI tolerance The higher incidence of oral perioral paresthesia in the APV1200 treatment arm was most likely due to the higher APV C max that occurs following APV1200 dosing compared with APV600 RTV BID dosing 17 Although the incidence of headache has been shown to increase with higher APV C max values 18 the incidence of this adverse event did not differ between treatment arms in this study The higher incidence of hypertriglyceridemia in the APV600 RTV arm was probably due to RTV because this PI has been reported to cause elevations in serum triglycerides 22 Other studies of RTV boosted APV regimens have also reported that triglyceride elevation is usually grade 1 or 2 in magnitude and as in the present study seldom necessitates treatment discontinuation or the addition of antihyperlipidemic drugs to the patient s treatment plan 10 19 This study evaluated a patient population that was ethnically diverse with just over half of the patients being either African American or Hispanic The inclusion of a large proportion of African American and Hispanic patients was deemed important because these are the populations in whom the HIV epidemic is increasing the most 23 Earlier clinical trials have tended to underrepresent these populations 24 One limitation of our study was that no pharmacokinetic analyses were performed to validate whether the RTV dosage regimen co administered with APV600 was effectively boosting plasma APV exposure or C min levels However ESS40006 which also evaluated the APV600 RTV regimen over a 24 week period did conduct a pharmacokinetic evaluation showing steady state serum APV C min values of 2 49 g mL i e over 8 fold higher than that usually achieved after the APV1200 regimen Thus plasma APV levels well above the IC 50 s of most HIV isolates were most likely achieved in ESS40011 Higher RTV doses of 200 mg BID and 400 mg BID co administered with APV600 have resulted in no greater virologic suppression than 100 mg BID 25 and raising the dose of APV from 600 mg BID to 900 mg BID does not improve efficacy either although it may increase the incidence of adverse events 20 In conclusion APV600 RTV BID was similar to or better than APV1200 BID based on virologic results using the 200 copies mL HIV 1 RNA endpoint Of note a significantly greater proportion of patients in the APV600 RTV treatment arm achieved HIV 1 RNA 50 copies mL at week 24 which was a secondary endpoint Other beneficial features of the APV600 RTV regimen such as improved dosing convenience and reduced pill burden need to be factored into decision making when APV600 RTV is being considered by clinicians as a therapeutic option for the treatment of either antiretroviral na ve or experienced patients with HIV infection
