 L A Too Much for the Man Hello Richard As always it is a treat to read your cogent insights I agree with you that the big story here involves the changes in capitalism and especially in the nature of work Unfortunately I think it would have been a much stronger book if the author saw it that way First I have an urgent message for Susan Faludi Get out of Los Angeles as soon as possible There is a real world out here with real people in it If possible bring Sylvester before his spirit is crushed forever beneath the weight of all those muscles We re waiting for you Susan Faludi s book has two great strengths First she engages with a big and profound set of questions that affect all of our lives She does this with great earnestness and deep commitment She devoted years of her life to the undertaking How many authors will do that Too few I think Second Faludi s interviews with an unusual selection of men are masterful gems each one cut and shaped by profound empathy vivid observation and keen listening They are rendered in rich romantic prose that pungently conveys the disparate worlds of her interlocutors I love the way she lets us in on the action through her own responses of compassion and bewilderment She is always there never silent as we feel men and women opening up to her trusting her bonding with her so much so that months and years later they continue to call and bring her up to date on their lives and their troubles What I cherish about this book and about Faludi herself is the way she surrendered to the mystery and adventure of this intellectual journey She began with one set of assumptions and allowed them to transform as she herself was transformed by the men she came to know Her personal authenticity was the backdrop against which these men were able to turn their experiences into words with an anguished and heartbreaking transparency Without being mawkish I think one can say that Susan Faludi reached beyond her role as a feminist or even as a writer She reached toward her own individual humanity and through that medium reached a deeper truth with those men she sought to understand Between her introduction and her conclusion each of the empirical chapters on the shipbuilders the Citadel cadets the gangstas the Spur Posse the Vietnam vets the Promise Keepers the football fans the militiamen the porno film stars the fashion tyrants and their slaves and Sylvester Stallone can stand alone as testimony to a rich and unique life world The question inevitably arises though What does it all mean Here I believe Susan Faludi gets it mostly wrong There are two critical intellectual errors that form the very foundation of her undertaking one substantive the other methodological I was hopeful when I read on Page 15 her complaint that popular accounts of the male crisis and male confusions are almost unrelievedly ahistorical but I was crestfallen some pages later when she identifies some of the deep historical structures that might have allowed her to unravel her data and then dismisses them as irrelevant I m not speaking simply of the economic shift from industry to service nor about a shift from a society organized around industry to one set up around electronic technology And I m not speaking simply about the irony of men supporting a massive military industrial effort to produce machines that ultimately would replace them Those changes were only surface symptoms There is no way to talk about these historic shifts simply And this is the first time I have heard these monumental issues in the evolution of material life referred to as surface symptoms Whoa If that s the surface then we must be talking about something very deep indeed that is the cause of all this angst But what is it Well by Page 596 we arrive at Faludi s definition of the heart of this particular darkness The deep pain experienced by the men she meets is explained by this confession and complaint My father never taught me how to be a man So here we are once again on a canvas of ahistorical pop psychology where the silence of the fathers and their devotion to commercial culture has crippled the sons leaving them no source of meaning other than Were they sexy Were they known Had they won If there is a crisis of masculinity then it truly can only be understood through history We are now completing at least in the West the last feudal century For the first time in any society a majority of its people are educated and informed For the first time in any society a majority of its people use their brains and not their backs to accomplish its work The bonds of hierarchy and patriarchy are not dissolved but faded and weakened as never before The fixed productive and reproductive roles of men and women once determined by anatomy are now giving way to an exhilarating and terrifying plethora of choices The concept of work has been forever transformed and the boundaries of class have followed suit These are the deep structures that are in motion These are the sources of the ruptures with the past we all face If there is a crisis then rejoice The old sources of meaning that kept us each in our place are dead or dying Susan Faludi s men are being crushed as the tectonic plates of history roil and split and mow them down They complain and whine and wail for a world that is vanishing OK It hurts But this is their opportunity to not just be he men but human beings If they can t be useful by protecting their women and making things then it s time to embrace the usefulness of supporting their women learning new skills committing to their families and finding new ways to teach their children and contribute to their communities The old world had women in a box and men in a harness No one was allowed to venture outside their roles If the fathers were silent its because that s how they thought the script was written Don t pine for that Get on with the challenge of forging a new life and writing your own better script Finally the methodological fallacy at the heart of this book If you want to see what s happening in the stream called our society says one of Faludi s patriots go to the edges and look at what s happening there This alleged societal dynamic becomes her methodological justification for using the stories of the underemployed contracted out and laid off men of Southern California to illuminate more general male losses It must be said that this kind of approach is very tricky If you are going to pick a few cases to illustrate the larger whole then you have to have some pretty compelling and well articulated reasoning for their selection I am surprised Richard that you find Faludi s characterizations of the male crisis to fit the British profile I think that what she has unearthed in grisly detail is the uniquely shallow instrumental and crass culture of Los Angeles which I once heard described as high school with money where looks fame and income compose the ranking rules for a truly wacky hierarchy Lamentably she has lost sight of just how weird and out of the mainstream that culture is It is not our culture It is not our society It is not the grain of sand in which the real world that most of us live in is etched The gangsters the militiamen the porn actors the over the top football fans they re all fascinating but I don t think that any of them says very much about most of us But then I live in Maine where ornamental culture has made little impression except possibly through a widespread interest in the L L Bean catalogue Once again a plea to Susan and Sylvester Move to Maine It s not too late We ll love you here even if you have a paunch or imperfect thighs More later Shoshana Zuboff
