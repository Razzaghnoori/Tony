 Introduction In addition to the role of smoking in cancer initiation and promotion cigarette smoking accelerates atherogenic cardiovascular disease in both a dose and a duration dependent manner through several concurrent pathways Smoking incites an immunologic response to vascular injury described as oxidative stress leading to lipid peroxidation endothelial cell dysfunction and foam cell proliferation in the tunica media 1 2 Smoking also enhances platelet aggregation impairs lipoprotein metabolism depresses high density lipoprotein HDL cholesterol and reduces distensibility of vessel walls 3 4 Cigarette smoking is associated with increased levels of inflammatory markers During the acute phase of inflammatory states there are quantifiable increases in C reactive protein white blood cell count and fibrinogen and decreases in serum albumin 5 8 Acute inflammatory markers have been shown to be both prognostic and predictive of future cardiovascular events in several populations For example C reactive protein has been discussed extensively as a marker of cardiovascular disease risk 9 16 C reactive protein in particular is also increasingly being implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis 17 19 C reactive protein is a pentaxin highly conserved across species 17 20 21 and stimulated synergistically by both IL 6 and IL 1 22 25 Previously believed to be synthesized by the liver recent evidence suggests that C reactive protein is also produced at the site of atherosclerosis by smooth muscle cells 17 In the vessel wall it induces expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells and increases monocyte chemotactic protein 1 which attracts monocytes and T cells into the vessel wall 26 28 Additionally C reactive protein reduces endothelial nitric oxide synthase upregulates the proatherosclerotic NF B pathway enhances low density lipoprotein LDL uptake by macrophages which become foam cells and facilitates T cell and complement mediated destruction and apoptosis of the endothelium 2 26 29 31 Thus C reactive protein is increasingly described not only as a marker of the inflammatory response but also as a mediator in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 2 27 Other inflammatory markers may also have causal properties but are not as well understood The inflammatory response therefore not only indicates atherosclerotic potential but may accelerate atherosclerosis Several studies have described a prevalent inflammatory state in smokers Despite the known impact of smoking on cardiovascular disease progression few studies have examined the impact of smoking cessation on levels of inflammatory markers or on cardiovascular risk reduction 6 32 The level to which the inflammatory response subsides following smoking cessation and the rate at which the inflammatory response subsides are uncertain Furthermore it remains unclear whether traditional risk factors can adequately explain the decline in cardiovascular risk following smoking cessation Using the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES III a population based representative sample of United States adults we investigated the association between smoking and smoking cessation and levels of inflammatory markers and traditional cardiovascular risk factors We examined the association between changes in the inflammatory markers C reactive protein white blood cell count albumin and fibrinogen and the traditional risk factors total cholesterol HDL cholesterol triglycerides systolic blood pressure and diabetes with decreased smoking intensity and increased time since smoking cessation Our primary objective was to investigate changes in C reactive protein in an effort to characterize the excess cardiovascular risk associated with smoking and any associated decline in risk with smoking cessation We also aimed to characterize whether the inflammatory markers or traditional risk factors explained observed cardiac risk reduction following smoking cessation Methods Study Population The NHANES III survey and data collection procedures have been described in detail elsewhere 33 34 Briefly NHANES III was a national probability survey conducted between 1988 and 1994 This survey used a complex multi stage stratified cluster sampling design to obtain a representative sample of the non institutionalized civilian United States population Participation included a home examination and a visit to a mobile examination center in one of 89 locations For those unable to travel to a mobile examination center a special home visit was arranged Of the 19 618 persons aged 18 and over included in the NHANES III population we excluded 3 021 persons for whom C reactive protein levels were missing given that this was our primary marker of interest Another 292 persons were excluded because they were pregnant and 816 people were excluded because they reported cigar pipe snuff or chewing tobacco use Data for 15 489 persons were analyzed Measures Self reported race ethnicity was categorized as non Hispanic white non Hispanic black Mexican American or other The self reported poverty to income ratio a marker of socioeconomic status used in multiple prior studies 35 36 was classified as 1 5 1 5 3 or 3 Self reported clinical factors were dichotomized for analysis Participants reported on use of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs estrogen replacement therapy and vitamin supplements Use of any alcohol in the past 24 h was measured by dietary recall questionnaire Prior physician diagnosed angina myocardial infarction or stroke was defined as prevalent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ASCVD Prevalent inflammatory disease was defined as the presence of rheumatoid arthritis asthma emphysema or chronic bronchitis Presence of acute illness was indicated by a positive answer to the question In the past few days have you had a cough cold or other acute illness Additional clinical factors were measured by a combination of participant self report and clinical exam and were also dichotomized for analysis Hypertension was indicated by use of anti hypertensive medication an average systolic blood pressure over 140 mm Hg or an average diastolic blood pressure over 90 mm Hg over four readings Diabetes mellitus was considered present if the participant reported physician diagnosis of diabetes mellitus excluding diagnosis during pregnancy was taking diabetes medications had fasting plasma glucose over 7 mmol l 126 mg dl or had non fasting glucose levels over 11 1 mmol l 200 mg dl Finally serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels were measured enzymatically Hitachi 704 analyzer Boehringer Mannheim Mannheim Germany LDL was calculated using the Friedewald equation and measured fasting triglycerides total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol LDL cholesterol and triglycerides were included as continuous variables and were logarithmically transformed to approximate the normal curve Smoking history was categorized based on both self report and serum cotinine levels Persons who gave a history of current smoking and or had serum cotinine levels greater than 56 8 nmol l 10 ng ml were considered current smokers Current smokers were categorized into four roughly equal groups based on number of cigarettes per day 1 9 10 19 20 29 and over 30 cigarettes per day Former smokers were defined by self report as having smoked over 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and as having quit smoking Former smokers were categorized by years since smoking cessation Since the zero year since cessation point is subject to misclassification bias the following levels were used in analyses 1 1 3 3 5 5 7 7 9 and 9 ysince cessation Never smokers were defined by self report and as having serum cotinine levels under 56 8 nmol l 10 ng ml Passive smokers with cotinine levels over 56 8 nmol l 10 ng ml were categorized as smokers at the lowest dose intensity level Our main outcome variable C reactive protein was measured using a latex enhanced Behring Nephelometer Analyzer System Dade Behring Deerfield Illinois United States Because the presence or absence rather than the absolute level of C reactive protein appears to be associated with cardiovascular risk we compared undetectable versus detectable levels of this marker This is consistent with previous research given the nonlinearity of C reactive protein interpretation 37 38 Since the limit of detection for the latex enhanced nephelometry assay was 2 1 mg l we defined undetectable as less than 2 1 mg l Other outcome variables were treated continuously White blood cell count was determined using a fully automated Coulter S PLUS JR hematology analyzer Beckman Coulter Fullerton California United States Albumin was measured using the bromocresol purple method Fibrinogen was measured using a quantitative assay of clotting time compared to a known standard Statistical Methods The distributions of traditional risk factors inflammatory markers and clinical and sociodemographic factors were examined by smoking status Chi square and analysis of variance tests as appropriate were performed to test for statistically significant differences Variables identified as potential confounders by these bivariate analyses were included in multivariate models as were the cofactors believed to be clinically relevant For multivariate analyses our primary independent variables were smoking intensity and time since smoking cessation Our primary dependent variables were the inflammatory markers C reactive protein fibrinogen white blood cell count and serum albumin and the traditional risk factors systolic blood pressure total cholesterol triglycerides HDL LDL diabetes and alcohol use Two sets of multivariate models were developed The first set of analyses minimally adjusted were adjusted for age sex and race given previously reported differences in the distribution of inflammatory markers in those groups The second set of analyses fully adjusted were adjusted for all covariates and potential confounders age sex race poverty to income ratio body mass index prevalent cardiovascular disease prevalent diabetes prevalent chronic inflammatory condition current acute illness and use of alcohol non steroidal anti inflammatory medication aspirin and estrogen replacement For inflammatory markers and traditional risk factors that were measured continuously linear regressions were used to model the relationship to smoking intensity and time since smoking cessation Least square means were calculated C reactive protein a dichotomous variable was modeled with logistic regression using never smokers as the reference category Odds ratios however do not approximate risk ratios given that the prevalence of elevated C reactive protein is over 10 The dose response relationship between both smoking intensity and time since smoking cessation and each of the outcomes was assessed using Mantel tests for trend Three sets of tests were performed evaluating the trends 1 among current smokers by cigarettes per day 2 among former smokers by time since cessation and 3 among smokers former smokers and non smokers despite the potential nonlinearity between groups To further explain the relationship between smoking exposure and C reactive protein to increase the power to detect a trend and to reduce residual confounding C reactive protein was categorized into three levels under 2 1 mg l undetectable 2 1 9 9 mg l mildly elevated and 10 0 mg l clinically significant Lastly blocked group comparisons were done using adjusted chi square tests Inflammatory and traditional risk factors were compared across current former and never smokers to validate findings from previous studies All analyses were weighted to represent the total civilian non institutionalized United States population they are therefore population prevalence estimates Analyses were conducted in SAS version 8 02 SAS Institute Cary North Carolina United States and SUDAAN version 9 0 Research Triangle Institute Research Triangle Park North Carolina United States incorporating sampling weights to account for nonresponse and oversampling All analyses were conducted using two sided tests with alpha set to 0 05 Results Of the 15 489 persons in our sample 7 665 were classified as never smokers 3 459 were classified as former smokers and 4 365 were classified as current smokers The average time since smoking cessation for former smokers was 13 y The average cotinine level for current smokers was 1 255 nmol l 221 ng ml for both former and never smokers the average cotinine level was 3 nmol l 0 5 ng ml Weighted descriptive statistics are given in Table 1 Bivariate analyses of smoking status showed that among the inflammatory risk factors unadjusted C reactive protein white blood cell count and fibrinogen were all significantly and positively associated with smoking status p 0 01 Albumin levels were similar across smoking categories Among traditional risk factors smokers had higher total cholesterol and triglycerides but were otherwise younger had lower body mass index and had lower blood pressure and a smaller proportion were diabetic Former smokers were most likely to have prevalent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease Bivariate analyses of the inflammatory markers showed that C reactive protein was significantly associated with older age p trend 0 01 by 10 y age group female sex p 0 01 and black race p 0 01 Serum albumin and serum fibrinogen showed similarly significant associations White cell count was associated with race p 0 01 but not with age or sex Among traditional risk factors analyses showed that total cholesterol triglycerides HDL cholesterol LDL cholesterol and systolic blood pressure were each associated with age sex and race all p 0 01 Diabetes was associated with age and race only p 0 01 Alcohol use was associated with age and sex only p 0 01 All models therefore were adjusted for age race and sex Table 2 displays abatement of the inflammatory response with 1 reduced intensity of smoking and 2 increased time since smoking cessation adjusted for age sex and race C reactive protein white blood cell count and fibrinogen were all positively associated with increased smoking intensity p 0 01 and were all significantly negatively associated with time since smoking cessation p 0 05 Similarly albumin showed a negative association with intensity of smoking p 0 01 but no relationship after cessation All acute phase reactant inflammatory markers had significant trends overall from current to former to never smokers p 0 01 Figure 1 Differences in the traditional cardiovascular risk factors are shown in Table 3 adjusted for age sex and race Total and HDL cholesterol triglycerides alcohol usage and systolic blood pressure all showed a dose dependent association with smoking intensity p 0 05 Triglycerides and alcohol use showed time dependent associations with smoking cessation p 0 01 Overall trends from current to former to never smokers were present for alcohol use triglycerides total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol as shown in Figure 2 In models fully adjusted for all covariates not shown dose dependent associations persisted for HDL cholesterol and triglycerides p 0 01 Both total cholesterol and triglycerides showed an association with time since smoking cessation p 0 03 for both and an overall trend from current to never smokers in fully adjusted models Lastly the inflammatory markers were examined in fully adjusted models C reactive protein continued to show abatement of the acute phase response with reduced smoking intensity and increased time since cessation despite adjustment for covariates Table 4 White blood cell count and albumin were associated with smoking intensity but not with time since cessation All positive acute phase reactants showed an associated decline from current to former to never smokers in fully adjusted models p 0 01 albumin likewise showed a significant increase p trend 0 01 Analyses using pack years were also done not shown the results were unchanged using this measure Additionally data were reanalyzed excluding those individuals with prevalent cardiovascular disease not shown results were again unchanged and measures of association were even slightly stronger Overall we observed the following associations 1 improvement in both inflammatory markers and traditional risk factors with decreased intensity of smoking and 2 improvement in inflammatory markers with increased time since smoking cessation Discussion In this cross sectional population based study we were able to demonstrate dose effects from smoking and temporal effects from cigarette smoking cessation The NHANES III dataset allowed us to utilize both self reported smoking and serum cotinine levels to minimize misclassification error It also allowed us to control for a wide range of confounders and assess consistency across measures by analyzing four acute phase proteins and several traditional risk factors By examining both traditional risk factors and inflammatory markers of cardiovascular risk this study contributes to the literature by providing a more complete analysis with regard to the effects of smoking and smoking cessation It is known that after smokers give up smoking their risk of mortality and future cardiac events declines 32 39 but there is little data quantifying the rate of risk reduction and when or even whether cardiovascular risk for former smokers reaches that of never smokers 12 40 41 We found that the smoking associated inflammatory response subsides within 5 y after smoking cessation This suggests that the vascular effects are reversible and that cardiovascular risk subsides gradually with reduced exposure The time to risk factor correction was longest with C reactive protein only one traditional risk factor triglycerides showed a similar pattern Our findings are consistent with prior studies suggesting that the full benefit of smoking cessation may be achieved gradually 39 42 43 Our estimates of the time to risk factor correction are shorter than those for the decline in mortality risk and risk for specific cardiac events reported in some prospective studies 42 44 but on par with those in other prospective 45 case control 46 47 and cross sectional 48 studies Discrepancies may be due to smoking recidivism in prospective studies where former smokers recommence smoking and increase their risk such that the reported time since cessation is longer than the true time or due to a lag between changes in cardiovascular risk factors and regression of disease Additionally one would expect morbidity risk to subside first since mortality is a more distant endpoint Prior studies also did not control for known cardiovascular risk factors did not use serum cotinine levels did not examine the associated change in inflammatory markers post cessation or grouped participants into broad categories of current former and never smokers increasing residual confounding while failing to explore the relative effects within each group 9 12 49 Nevertheless it remains unclear whether C reactive protein s ongoing decline in former smokers simply indicates a prevalent underlying burden of atherosclerotic plaque or simmering ongoing disease processes The direct associations of C reactive protein with mortality decrement seen in these other studies and the dose response seen in our own study suggest the latter Three studies have systematically examined inflammatory markers following smoking the MONICA Study Monitoring Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease 46 the Cardiovascular Health Study CHS 48 and the Northwick Park Heart Study 45 The Cardiovascular Health Study found no association between inflammatory markers and smoking status itself although C reactive protein was strongly related to lifetime smoking exposure as measured by pack years Our results while based on more complete modeling support findings from the Northwick Park Heart Study and MONICA Study both of which found that fibrinogen levels adjusted only for age reached normal levels within 5 y Our study supports the hypothesis that cardiovascular risk falls with inflammatory abatement and that inflammatory markers are better indicators of such risk reduction In this analysis triglycerides showed the strongest dose intensity and temporal trends of the traditional cardiovascular risk factors This is both consistent with prior research and not surprising since the strongest association between C reactive protein and lipid measures is for triglycerides Despite the colinearity the inflammatory markers studied appear to have a much clearer trend and longer lasting effect after smoking cessation than traditional risk factors This would suggest their greater utility in being more accurate markers of disease particularly given C reactive protein s increasingly apparent role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis Alternative explanations include 1 the presence of multiple independent causal pathways leading to cardiovascular disease and 2 traditional risk factors correlating more closely with mortality than morbidity or underlying pathophysiology The relative value of novel inflammatory markers versus traditional risk factors remains of much debate 50 51 Limitations of this study include measurement error from self reporting residual confounding from use of indicator variables smoking recidivism lack of newer measures such as interleukin 6 and high sensitivity C reactive protein 52 and lack of data on secondhand smoke Recent studies have suggested that toxin exposures from secondhand smoke may impact the biomarkers used in this study 53 54 We attempted to adjust for bias in self reporting and secondhand exposure by using serum cotinine levels but residual confounding may exist It has also been suggested that circulating C reactive protein levels may not reflect all relevant inflammatory effectors owing to post transcriptional regulation of C reactive protein 22 We chose C reactive protein however for its clear role in the inflammatory response and for its increasing clinical relevance Lastly it is noteworthy that we are not using a linear scale but measures of both intensity and duration Time since cessation and cigarettes per day are distinctly different measures and a discontinuity arises at cessation Further research should explore the acute phase response in the months following smoking cessation 53 55 57 Time intervals of less than a year since cessation have not been assessed adequately in other studies nor in this study because of sample size limitations of the NHANES III data Additionally if cardiovascular risk subsides gradually upon smoking cessation do vessel wall damage and pro aggregatory cascades all completely reverse course upon cessation Future research should continue to explore the relationship between the inflammatory cascade and alterations in the vessel wall 7 58 This and other similar studies suggest that smoking cessation should play a larger role in public policy Linked to poverty decreased productivity and premature death tobacco remains the second major cause of preventable death in the world and fourth most common risk factor for disease worldwide 59 While tobacco is clearly a worldwide concern states and localities are left responsible for addressing tobacco use and smoking in a comprehensive manner Our results suggest that policy makers faced with escalating health care costs should look to smoking cessation as an opportunity to achieve both long and short term health care cost savings through cardiovascular risk reduction 60 If cardiovascular benefits are in fact readily attainable there exists an opportunity for short term gain from smoking cessation This may be sufficient to induce policy change Larger scale action is also needed Arguments persist in the developing world regarding the forced opening of tobacco markets as a result of the Global Agreements on Tariffs and Trade Guidance may be forthcoming however from the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control which began operation in February 2005 as an international treaty aimed at controlling tobacco packaging marketing and use 61 Over 60 nation states are currently parties to the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control including many European nations and Japan although the United States has yet to approve this treaty Opportunities for tobacco control remain available and it is becoming increasingly clear that smoking cessation models deserve high priority both in research and in any preventive health care system
