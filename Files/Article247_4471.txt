 Mike s New Gig Hi Interesting you mentioned Michael Jordan because I was reading a story in yesterday s Washington Post about his first practice with the Wizards What does it say about a team when its best player is its owner A lot huh So the owner or president of basketball operations or whatever he is puts on a Wizards No 23 practice jersey love that and sits around waiting for the real players to show up for the morning workout Here s a quote I was one of the first guys here forward Tracy Murray tells the Post and when he Jordan saw me he said What are you doing showing up late I said Late I m early But he was already dressed and ready to go This is going to be fun Here s the story The wily old veteran as wrecking ball crashing into the infrastructure of today s 20 something multi millionaire What Me practice new age sports world Fabulous As you know I ve never covered the NBA people reading this must be saying what does this woman cover The answer is the Olympics and football and chick soccer as of last July and of course the most entertaining sport on the planet figure skating Among other things So I ve never reported on Jordan Ever But then I got the call about the 4 p m press conference at the MCI Center and so I made it last week s USA Today column I went in thinking I wouldn t like Jordan I don t know why I thought this probably because of all the MJ hype and MJ adoration and MJ this and MJ that and a lingering feeling that ESPN SportsCentury totally blew it and should be renamed ESPN SportsDecade The 90s Jordan over Babe Ruth Or Ali Come on And where was Billie Jean King on that list 59 th Thanks boys That s what that was The boys picking their favorite boys who play sports But get this I loved the guy I loved the way he came into the news conference and didn t mince words mince words This was a scorched earth policy He called the Wizards underachieving said his agent David Falk was a pain in the ass wondered how scared his players would be to practice against him and called all his new employees disposable When was the last time you heard such honesty Ditka Bobby Knight But who wants to listen to either of those tired old misbehaving bad boys What I love about this Jordan thing is that he has embraced an opportunity that could lead to his total failure on a basketball court Golf and baseball are one thing Now he s putting that golden image of his on the line in the sport that matters He left us the last time with that wonderful picture of hitting the jumper to win Game 6 and the NBA championship in 1998 He nails the shot He wins the title He walks away Perfect Better than Ted Williams even And then he s bored obviously carpooling wasn t for him and so he comes back for more Lucky us we get to watch See you Chris
