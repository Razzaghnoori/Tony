 George W s Wimp Factor In 1992 over the protests of outraged liberals Arkansas Gov Bill Clinton flew home in the midst of his presidential campaign to supervise the execution of a retarded killer The message to voters was that Clinton unlike previous Democratic presidential candidates was tough on crime Last week after a gunman murdered seven people in a Fort Worth church Texas Gov George W Bush flew home to urge Americans to pray for love in people s hearts The message this time is that Bush unlike previous Republican presidential candidates is compassionate If Bush succeeds in projecting such sensitivity the cure may prove worse than the disease Republicans used to win elections by calling their Democratic opponents soft on crime Clinton first as a candidate and then as president frustrated this tactic by recasting gun control previously an issue of big government as an issue of getting tough on thugs Bush who opposes most federal gun control proposals and signed the law that lets Texans carry concealed handguns is in danger of completing this reversal By fighting crime with love he is coming across not as a gun nut but as a wimp Bush tried to send two messages in response to the Texas shooting The first is that as conservatives have traditionally argued culture particularly religion is more important than government In remarks replayed endlessly on television and in the print media Bush blamed the shooting on a wave of evil The killer he surmised was acting as a result of evil in his heart And I would hope that America would collectively pray for love in people s hearts Rather than discuss gun control or prosecution Bush s campaign Web site offered visitors a single quote atop his home page This is a terrible tragedy made worse by the fact it took place in a house of hope and love My thoughts and prayers are with the victims their families and the congregation Second Bush tried to project a virtue traditionally scorned by conservatives compassion It s inexplicable to me how somebody s heart could be so full of hate that he would walk into a place of worship where youngsters were seeking God s grace and love and kill people Bush told the media Rushing home to add some comfort to the pain and sorrow Bush regretted that there s not much to say and that all I could do was embrace the victims and their families It s hard to do anything but just to say I love you he lamented Rather than dismiss the shooter as a cold blooded killer Bush called him a sick person who must be demented The second message has curdled the first Swaddled in hugs empathy and spiritual musings on the gunman s heart Bush s appeal to cultural renewal instead of government intervention comes across more as a plea for love instead of laws We as a society can pass laws and hold people accountable he told reporters But our hopes and prayers have got to be that there is more love in society I wish I knew the law to make people love one another Bush added We can pass laws but there needs to be a higher law And that is Love your neighbor like you d like to be loved yourself Bush isn t the only conservative projecting such an oddly mixed message Most people are going to understand what a terribly terribly tragic thing this is what a horrible tormented person this is lamented House Majority Leader Dick Armey R Texas Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer blaming the massacre on societal elements that create such empty hearts that commit these crimes adopted the leftist pose of victimhood calling for a federal study of crimes against men and women of faith While Vice President Al Gore professes reluctance to politicize the tragedy his allies at the Democratic National Committee have seized the opportunity to label Bush soft on crime In 1997 Bush went out of his way to make it harder to prosecute gunmen carrying deadly weapons into churches and school events the DNC charged You can t say you support law enforcement and then refuse to support law enforcement s attempts to close the gun show loophole It s time for Bush to start listening to law enforcement and stop listening to the NRA Gun control activists have gone further Speaking on television and in the print media about the Texas massacre they juxtapose today s weak gun laws with the tough restrictions they would prefer They claim the support of police and the enmity of criminals Mocking Bush s plea that he didn t know a governmental law that will put love in people s hearts Handgun Control Chairwoman Sarah Brady blasted the cowardice of elected officials who blame everything for the carnage except for the guns Texas she pointedly suggested must contemplate what its lax gun laws and liberal gun culture have created The media seem to be having fun with the notion of Bush as a liberal The Los Angeles Times reported that after the shooting Bush again ruled out the need for stronger gun controls In Texas Bush has liberalized gun laws The New York Times cited speculation that Bush was concerned about renewed charges by many Democrats that he was soft on guns On CNN s Capital Gang Al Hunt of the Wall Street Journal cracked that Bush was a little bit Clintonian flying back from Michigan to feel the pain U S News World Report concluded that while Bush was concentrating on love Al Gore was concentrating on laws Tuesday Bush tried to steer his campaign back to the right Flanked by Texas attorney general and the state s leading prosecutors he unveiled a plan to hire extra prosecutors who would focus exclusively on gun crimes Scarcely a sentence passed his lips without a mention of toughness The best way to protect our citizens is to vigorously enforce the tough laws we have on the books Bush declared We have some very tough laws against gun violence in Texas and federal law with its mandatory sentences is tough as well Only with tough enforcement can we win the war against gun violence Many Republicans thought Bush s dad lost in 1992 because he was out of touch They thought Bob Dole lost in 1996 because he was mean and distant This time they were looking for a candidate who knew how to speak the language of love Next time they may be looking for a candidate who knows when to stop Frame Game has also scrutinized and who have hounded George W Bush
