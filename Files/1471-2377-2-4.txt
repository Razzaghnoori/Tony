 Background Fabry disease is an X linked disorder resulting in reduced activity of the lysosomal enzyme galactosidase A 1 2 This results in the systemic accumulation of D galatosyl conjugates particularly globotriosylceramide Gb3 3 4 Although the disorder is heterogeneous patients suffer renal cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications 4 Enzyme replacement therapy has recently shown to have an effect on resting cerebral blood flow abnormalities and on other organ systems functions 5 6 In the cerebrovascular system there is an increased incidence of stroke together with vessel ectasia 7 This may be related to the progressive accumulation of storage material in the cerebral vessel or possibly may be due to an abnormality of vessel function 8 9 The cerebrovascular complications are distributed predominantly in the posterior circulation with a progressive increase over time in the posterior distribution of small vessel disease as found on T 2 weighted images or fluid attenuated inversion recovery FLAIR MR 7 10 11 It likely that such high signal lesions on MR images represent ischemic small vessel disease however there are no neuropathological radiological correlative studies confirming this assumption Since ischemic brain lesions are irreversible and accumulate over years demonstrating a reduction in incidence is likely to require prolonged therapy in a relatively large cohort of patients following this disease end point Previously in Fabry disease we have reported resting cerebral hyper perfusion in a predominantly vertebro basilar distribution together with abnormalities of vascular nitrotyrosine staining This was reversed by enzyme replacement therapy 5 10 The current study examines the cerebrovascular system in Fabry disease in response to functional and pharmacological activation We hypothesized that the cerebral vasculopathy of Fabry disease is associated with abnormal cerebrovascular responses and furthermore that these would normalize with repeated intra vascular infusion of galactosidase A 5 6 We compared the functional cerebrovascular responses in Fabry disease to those in age and sex matched controls using both visual stimulation and acetazolamide challenge by 15O H 2 O and positron emission tomography PET to measure rCBF The patients were then re examined following a 6 month double blind placebo controlled trial of enzyme replacement therapy ERT Functional activation by visual stimulation was chosen to examine the vertebro basilar diathesis of Fabry disease Acetazolamide on the other hand was hypothesized to identify areas of decreased cerebral perfusion following maximal cerebral vasodilation in Fabry disease compared to controls Such an abnormality if present might then be used to assess the therapeutic efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy We define our usage of the term cerebral vasomotor reserve as CBF res the CBF response at 20 or 30 minutes post acetazolamide challenge minus the resting CBF for each subject We define cerebral vascular reactivity as the functional CBF response to a stimulus minus the resting CBF CBF react while the maximal response to acetazolamide challenge provides an index of the cerebrovascular capacity The CBF response curve to acetazolamide can be considered like a high pass filter with an onset time constant to a steady state 1 and an offset time constant of 2 Alteration and prolongation of 2 will correspond to prolonged cerebral vascular response time An important concept of a high pass filter is that the system response is dependent on both the resistive R and capacitative C elements Hence the steady state value as well as time constants 1 and 2 depend on both the R and C components Therefore the value of CBF res also depends on the RC component of the cerebral vascular system so that if there is an increased R component then CBF res will be reduced a situation seen in cerebral vaso occlusive disease If on the other hand the RC components are approximately equal in the comparison groups similar steady state values of CBF and CBF res values will be seen The magnitude of the steady state response by itself gives an index of the cerebrovascular capacitative component C Patients and Methods Patients The methodology for this work has been described in detail 5 Twenty six male hemizygote patients with Fabry disease age range 19 48 mean age 33 7 8 1 years and 10 control subjects age range 21 48 years mean age 33 4 9 7 years were enrolled in the study The Institutional Review Board of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the NIH Radiation Safety Committee approved the study and all patients and healthy volunteers gave their written and informed consent All patients recruited to this study had neuropathic pain main inclusion criterion no focal or global neurological deficits and normal clotting function Radiological evidence consistent with small vessel disease was noted primarily on the FLAIR MRI as hyper intense signal areas in 10 patients Four patients had one lesion on FLAIR imaging three patients had 3 lesions and three patients had 3 lesions There was no significant progression of the lesion burden over the 6 month trial period No significant radiological abnormality was found on magnetic resonance angiography in the Fabry patients with no report of dolichoectasia One patient randomized to the placebo study arm withdrew from the study for personal reasons and three further patients 1 from the ERT group and 2 from the placebo group declined the follow up acetazolamide challenge arm of the study at completion of the trial A further patient had suffered a lacunar infarct ten years prior to commencement of the present study The double blind placebo controlled randomized trial of ERT consisted of intravenous infusions of galactosidase A Replagal every two weeks Transkaryotic Therapies Inc Cambridge MA with fourteen patients receiving ERT and twelve placebo for six months PET Procedure PET was performed with a Scanditronix PC2048 15B tomograph tranverse resolution of 6 5 mm A radial arterial line was placed in all participants for measurement of the 15O H 2 O input function and arterial blood gases Subjects were aligned in the scanner with slices parallel to the orbital meatal line with at least one slice obtained within the posterior fossa The head was restrained with a thermoplastic facemask Transmission scans were obtained with a rotating 68Ge 68Ga pin source and were used to correct emission scans for attenuation Emission scans four minutes duration were obtained after intravenous injection of 35 mCi of 15O H 2 O and were begun automatically following arrival of radioactivity in the brain Each study commenced with a sham scan in order to acclimatize the subject to scanning procedure which was followed by two resting cerebral blood flow scans during which the subject maintained eye closure Two scans during visual stimulation were also performed 10 minutes apart During visual activation the subjects were asked to focus on a black and white pattern reversal screen The reversal frequency was 8 Hz This stimulus frequency is known to induce the maximal change in the striate cortex blood flow 12 The visual stimulus was commenced 15 seconds before radioactivity reached the head Following the visual activation scans intravenous acetazolamide was injected at a dose of 15 mg kg body weight and two further scans were obtained 20 and 30 minutes later Data Analysis The time shift between arterial blood and brain data was determined by aligning the scanner count rate data sampled at 1 Hz to the blood data with the slice count data fitted to a one tissue compartment two parameter model The CBF images were constructed from a pixel by pixel least square fit for blood flow and partition coefficient 13 14 The MRI T1 template was downloaded from the Montreal Neurological Institute http www bic

voxels Pixel by pixel averaging of the replicated visual activation PET scans was performed Spatial registration of the PET images and T1 MRI template was performed using SPM99 http www fil ion ucl ac uk spm spm99 html 16 The analysis is divided into a comparison of the baseline Fabry group with the control group and the comparison of the ERT group with the placebo group A straight comparison was made between the control group and the baseline time zero Fabry group visual and acetazolamide co registered PET data using SPM99 allowing appropriate multiple comparisons analyses In order to isolate a potential treatment effect following ERT a mixed statistical model was used This analysis of variance model divides the total variance into fixed and random effects with the treatment effect attributable to the fixed effect A two step approach was adopted The first allowing isolation of the fixed effect by forming subtraction images for each patient by subtracting the pre trial response from the post trial response forming a contrast image The second consisted of direct comparison of the ERT and non ERT subgroups contrast images In this way the attributable treatment effects were compared for the analysis of the visual activation and acetazolamide responses on a patient by patient basis This gave for each patient a difference image representing an independent estimate of each subject s response to visual activation and acetazolamide after ERT or placebo Statistical parametric maps SPM t were then calculated on the spatially registered PET images by obtaining a set level statistic of p 0 05 after setting the voxel threshold at p 0 05 or less and the cluster extent at 1024 or greater The cluster extent threshold represents 1 0 cm 3of brain tissue The set level statistic represents the statistical significance of the compared data volumes All the p values given in the Results section are the set level statistic In order to characterize the visual activation response further a specific region of interest ROI was used that included Brodmann areas 17 18 and 19 as determined from the Talairach Tournoux electronic brain atlas 17 The visual ROI was derived from T1 MRI template which was then used to mask the SPM registered CBF images prior to calculation of the visual CBF responses The mean visual cortex CBF and global CBF values were calculated on a pixel by pixel basis after setting a CBF threshold value of 10 0 ml min 100 g of tissue below which the pixels were excluded from calculation This CBF level represents the lower limit of CNS tissue viability The ROI consisted of both gray and white matter areas associated with the visual cortex and association areas Results Visual Activation Studies Table 1 Mean absolute CBF in the visual cortex was significantly greater in Fabry patients during visual stimulation compared to the control group p 0 002 The visual CBF reactivity CBF react following visual stimulation was calculated in each subject by subtracting the visual cortex resting cerebral blood flow from the mean visual activation CBF No significant difference was found in the visual area CBF react between patients and controls After enzyme replacement therapy there was no significant change in the mean absolute CBF response to visual stimulation over the visual area p 0 184 or in CBF react compared to placebo p 0 629 Acetazolamide Challenge Studies global CBF Table 2 Resting and post acetazolamide global CBF values were not significantly different between the control group and the untreated patient group for either the twenty minute or thirty minute time point Following the enzyme replacement trial no significant change in the global CBF was found at the 20 minutes post acetazolamide time point in the ERT group compared to the placebo group however the resting global CBF in the ERT group was significantly decreased p 0 026 A significant reduction p 0 036 in the global CBF was found 30 minutes post acetazolamide in the ERT group compared to the placebo group No difference in the global vasomotor reserve was found between Fabry patients and controls before or following ERT Regional SPM Analysis of Visual Activation and Acetazolamide Challenge Studies There was a significantly increased blood flow in the Fabry patients during visual stimulation compared to controls Figure 1 p 0 001 The increased rCBF was found predominantly in the posterior circulation area and visual cortex but some voxels increases in rCBF were found in the anterior circulation No rCBF voxels were found to be significantly greater in the control group compared to the Fabry group data not shown Restriction of the rCBF analysis to Talairach defined visual cortex ROI showed no significant difference in visual reactivity CBF react between the patient and control groups Following acetazolamide at the 20 minute time point the rCBF in the control group was significantly elevated in a more central and anterior distribution p 0 041 while the distribution of the higher rCBF voxels in the Fabry group was more posterior data not shown p 0 002 At the 30 minute time point the significantly elevated rCBF in the control group had disappeared while the significantly elevated rCBF in the Fabry group persisted Figure 2 p 0 003 indicating a prolonged cerebral vascular response time No difference in regional CBF res between the Fabry and control groups was found indicating normal regional cerebral vascular reserve in Fabry disease ERT resulted in a significantly lower absolute rCBF during visual stimulation in the treatment group compared to the placebo Figure 3 p 0 001 while no significantly decreased areas of rCBF were found in the placebo group A reduction in rCBF was also found when the analysis was restricted to the visual cortex p 0 001 with no areas of significantly decreased rCBF in the placebo group ERT led to decreased rCBF after acetazolamide infusion at both time points time 20 minutes p 0 001 time 30 minutes p 0 004 Figure 4 No significant decrease in rCBF was found at a comparable cluster extent and voxel threshold in the placebo group Discussion Our data indicate the presence of an abnormal functional response to visual stimulation both in global and regional CBF analysis in Fabry disease This however was not due to an alteration in vascular reactivity Previously we demonstrated that the resting rCBF in Fabry disease is elevated compared to controls particularly in the posterior circulation 5 In view of the normal visual area reactivity in Fabry disease these findings indicate that the Fabry group response to visual activation is largely explained by the elevated resting rCBF However the more generalized cerebrovascular response noted in both the carotid and vertebro basilar circulation suggests stimulus spread in Fabry disease possibly due to a decreased response threshold in non visual cortex vasculature Following ERT this resting rCBF abnormality was reversed 5 The cerebral visual stimulation paradigm used in the current study is known to induce maximal cerebral blood flow 12 and is therefore a useful stimulus for the study of neuro vascular coupling Visual stimulation was chosen in particular because of the known predilection of the cerebrovascular abnormalities in Fabry disease for the posterior circulation 7 10 The lack of an increase or decrease in visual rCBF reactivity in Fabry disease suggests normal neuro vascular coupling mechanism 18 19 Acetazolamide induced maximal cerebral vasodilatory response is often used to assess cerebrovascular reserve 20 The greatest difference between our patients and controls occurred at the 30 minute time point rather than at the 20 minute time point of the acetazolamide challenge This finding is consistent with a prolongation of the cerebral vascular response time in the Fabry disease ERT significantly decreased the prolonged cerebral vascular response time The vasodilator effect of acetazolamide on the cerebral vasculature has been characterized by both PET and transcranial Doppler TCD studies 21 22 At a dose of 15 mg kg the effect of acetazolamide is thought to be supramaximal with maximal cerebral vasodilation induced within about 20 minutes By TCD a maximal dose response was found to occur with an acetazolamide infusion of between 15 and 18 mg kg with maximal vasoreactivity occurring between 10 and 30 minutes post acetazolamide 21 Using 15O H 2 O and PET a further study of rCBF following 1 g of acetazolamide demonstrated the peak response to occur at 10 minutes while the plateau phase occurred during the twenty to thirty minute time period post acetazolamide 22 The measurements in the current study obtained at twenty and thirty minutes post acetazolamide injection therefore probably corresponds to the plateau phase of reported acetazolamide responses The CBF response to supra maximal acetazolamide challenge consists of a phase of increasing CBF followed by a plateau phase with a terminal recovery phase This can be considered in terms of cerebrovascular resistance and capacity analogous to a high pass filter where high frequency components of the system response are removed The importance of this analogy is that the plateau response is dependent on both the system s resistive and capacitative components In the present study it was seen that the vasomotor reserve in Fabry disease was within normal limits despite the elevated resting rCBF The cerebrovascular capacity in Fabry disease was also within normal limits suggesting absence of clinically significant vaso occlusive disease in the cohort of Fabry patients examined This finding is supported by the absence of abnormalities on magnetic resonance angiography in the same group Reduced CBF res would be expected when the resistive component is increased reducing the amplitude of the acetazolamide induced plateau response The hyperemic cerebrovascular response to hypercapnia or acetazolamide is not inhibited by nitric oxide synthase inhibitors such as N G monomethyl L arginine L NMMA suggesting that NO does not mediate vasoreactivity 23 24 The mechanism of acetazolamide vasodilation beyond smooth muscle intracellular and extracellular acidosis due carbonic anhydrase inhibition is unclear Abnormalities of the peripheral vasculature responses to acetylcholine have been previously described in Fabry disease together with nitric oxide pathway dysregulation 5 9 suggesting participation of non NO regulation of vascular tone A similar vascular hyper responsiveness has been noted in caveolin 1 knock out mice 25 26 raising the possibility that the accumulation of Gb 3 results in over activity of uncoupled endothelial nitric oxide synthase within endothelial cell caveolae generating superoxide and other reactive oxygen species 27 The latter may have a vasodilatatory effect 28 Predominance of vascular abnormalities in the vertebro basilar system in Fabry disease suggests fundamental biologic differences between the anterior and the posterior circulation Such difference might for example result from the neural crest origin of pericytes and vascular smooth muscle in the anterior circulation as opposed to paraxial mesoderm in the vertebro basilar or posterior circulation 29 Conclusion The current study indicates that ERT normalized acetazolamide induced prolonged cerebral vascular response time in Fabry disease This finding suggests that the underlying abnormality is present at the luminal side of the blood brain barrier BBB complex and is due to an abnormality of the cerebral vessels since it is unlikely that galactosidase A crosses the BBB to any appreciable extent Further the treatment effect appeared to be uniform across all cerebral vascular distributions Competing interests None declared Authors contributions DFM carried out and coordinated the PET studies performed the
