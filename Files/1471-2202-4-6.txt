 Background Objects in nuclei recognized by antibodies specific for phosphoprotein epitopes cytoplasmic IFs or both have been reported in glial and neuronal cells in situ and in vitro The nuclear structures appear spherical or rod like and may have a positional relationship with nuclear pores 1 2 3 4 Morphologically these structures appear similar to the nuclear speckles that are thought to be storage sites for RNA splicing factors 5 6 7 However while intermediate filament IF phosphoproteins could be components of nuclear speckles they are immunologically distinct Investigations of intermediate filaments IF in the nucleus have focused on lamins see Goldman for a current review 8 but many reports of in situ nuclear localization of cytoplasmic IFs also exist e g vimentin in association with nuclear DNA in cultured fibroblasts 9 10 and an estrogen sensitive cytokeratin association with nuclear DNA in human breast cancer cells 11 In a recent study Glass et al 12 using the SMI 31 monoclonal antibody mAB to identify phosphorylated neurofilament proteins reported discrete SMI 31 labeling within nuclei of SH SY5Y neuroblastoma cells SH SY5Y cells are a subclone of the SK N SH human neuroblastoma cell line derived from neoplastic neural crest cells and under certain growth conditions generate neuritic processes 12 13 Sternberger and Sternberger 14 describe SMI 31 mAB as specific for phosphorylated epitopes on the heavy neurofilaments peptide NF H and to a lesser extent medium neurofilament peptide NF M The RT 97 mAB 9 has been characterized as recognizing phosphorylated epitopes on the 210 kDa NF H peptide 15 and used similarly to SMI 31 to identify neurites in vitro and in situ 16 17 18 One would predict therefore that labeling with RT97 would produce staining patterns including nuclear similar to those of SMI 31 in SH SY5Y cells The nuclear localization of RT 97 and SMI 31 mAB could be the result of an association of phosphorylated NFs with nuclear components Alternatively it could be that lamins or other nuclear proteins have a phosphorylated epitope also found on NFs For example Schilling et al 1 identified nuclear structures using SMI 31 mAB in rat glial nuclei in vitro and in vivo and Shea et al 19 showed both SMI 31 and RT 97 strongly labeled nuclei of NB2a neuroblastoma cells Herrera 20 demonstrated nuclear localization patterns similar to those obtained by Glass et al 12 using rat glioma cells 9L immunolabeled with the J1 31 mAB which appears to recognize a phosphorylated form of GFAP 21 22 These observations prompted us to further investigate nuclear antigens in SH SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and to attempt to determine the relationship between these nuclear objects and cellular growth dynamics We asked the following questions 1 are the immuno labeled structures within the nucleus or just closely associated 2 is the phosphoepitope labeled by SMI 31 and RT 97 mABs specific to NFs or can it be identified on other IFs in other cell types and 3 is there a relationship between the cell cycle as determined by DNA synthesis and the amount of nuclear labeling by SMI 31 and RT 97 Results The immunolabeled structures are within the nucleus As visualized by confocal microscopy the SMI 31 and RT 97 mABs labeled discrete locations apparently within nuclei and revealed a filamentous network in the cytoplasm Figure 1A 1B The nuclear structures were clearly seen to be located seen within nuclei when visualized by confocal z projections and this location was confirmed by demonstrating mAB staining and DNA in single optical planes 300 nm thick The nuclei were found to be 3 to 5 m thick or about 10 to 17 optical section thick The nuclear structures were also found to co localize with nuclear DNA using the co localization function of the Bio Rad LaserSharp software data not shown Therefore within the limits of resolution of confocal microscopy SMI 31 mAB and RT 97 mAB label epitopes in SH SY5Y cells that are inside the nucleus The phosphoepitope labeled by SMI 31 and RT 97 is not specific to NFs and it can be identified on other IFs in other cell types SMI 31 mAB labeled F98 rat glioma nuclei and cytoplasm with equal or greater avidity than in SH SY5Y cells Figure 1D The cytoplasmic staining produced by SMI 31 was not distinguishable from that produced by anti GFAP in the F98 glioma cells Figure 1F F98 glioma cells are not known to express neurofilament protein and SMI 32 a mAB characterized as specific for non phosphorylated NFs 19 stained the expected cytoplasmic network in SH SY5Y cells Figure 1C but did not label any structures in F98 glioma cells data not shown Thus it appears that SMI 31 recognizes a phosphoepitope that occurs on proteins in addition to NF H and NF M as previously reported see the Discussion for other reports of SMI 31 staining glial cells in situ RT 97 also labeled nuclear and cytoplasmic structures in F98 cells Figure 1E Electrophoretic and western analysis of SH SY5Y and F98 cell extracts corroborated the finding that SMI 31 recognized an epitope on proteins other than NFs In SH SY5Y cell extracts the SMI 31 and SMI 32 lanes show strong labeling of bands corresponding to the MW of NF H and NF M Additional bands not seen in the SMI 32 lane are present in the SMI 31 and RT 97 lanes between and above the NF H and NF M and probably represent forms of NF M and NF H with varying degrees of phosphorylation SMI 31 and RT 97 also revealed a band or closely spaced bands at 70 kDa which corresponds approximately to the MW of lamins Western analysis using anti lamin B revealed a similar 70 kDa band in extracts of SH SY5Y cells but no bands were labeled by anti lamin A C Labeled bands below 65 kDa may represent degradation products produced during cell extraction Normal serum controls were negative data not shown Western analysis with anti GFAP pAB SMI 31 mAB RT 97 mAB and anti lamins mAB was performed on F98 cell extracts subjected to SDS PAGE The anti GFAP lane shows a strong band at the expected MW and multiple bands above it as well as minor bands below The higher MW bands most likely represent GFAP multimers while the lower MW bands are possibly degradation products Multiple bands also appear in both the SMI 31 and RT 97 lanes although for the most part the antibodies do not appear to label the same bands In lanes labeled with SMI 31 RT 97 or anti lamin B a weak but well defined band appears at approximately 70 kDa Figure 2 Controls normal mouse serum were negative data not shown Numerous putative phosphorylation motifs were identified in the amino acid sequences of NF H GFAP and nuclear lamins A B and C when analyzed by the NetPhos server including a single tyrosine kinase motif LNDRFAG Y IDKVR found in the N terminal region of all five proteins see Figure 3 In addition 74 putative serine 0 99 26 threonine 0 9 and 7 other tyrosine 0 5 phosphorylation sites were identified however only the tyrosine phosphorylation site shown was shared among the five proteins analyzed Therefore it is possible that this sequence constitutes or contains the epitope recognized by the SMI 31 and RT 97 mABs and may account for the cross reactivity of these antibodies with respect to NF H GFAP and lamins DNA synthesis and the volume and intensity of nuclear labeling are related Analyses of nuclear labeling intensity and comparison to proliferation index as a function of days in culture revealed a strong correlation Comparison of nuclear labeling of SH SY5Y cells immuno stained with SMI 31 and RT 97 mABs to the culture proliferation index shows that nuclear labeling reached its greatest extent when DNA synthesis was also maximal Both values fell as cells exited the cell cycle as indicated by lack of BrdU uptake and by day 5 when the cultures appear confluent essentially all cell replication had stopped see Figure 1G 1H 1Iand Figure 4 Discussion SH SY5Y cells immunolabeled with SMI 31 mAB or RT 97 mAB demonstrated discrete nuclear localizations in nuclei with pronounced staining in neuronal processes and diffuse staining within cell bodies Confocal microscopy demonstrated clearly that the antibodies label structures within the nucleus Comparison among antibodies that are specific for phosphorylated IFs SMI 31 RT 97 and those not SMI 32 anti GFAP suggests that the nuclear structures are a phosphorylated IF Cross reactivity of both SMI 31 and RT 97 on glial cytoplasm and nuclei indicates the epitope is not cell type specific Examination of western blots indicate SMI 31 and RT 97 recognize among others a protein in the 66 74 kDa range in extracts of both neuroblastoma and glioma cells Western analysis with anti lamin B labeled a similar band in the same extracts The calculated molecular weights of lamins A B and C are approximately 74 66 and 65 kDa respectively therefore it seems most likely that lamins NF H and GFAP all share a common motif that when phosphorylated is recognized by SMI 31 and RT 97 mABs In support of this a search for phosphorylation motifs among NF H GFAP and lamins A B and C revealed a single high probability tyrosine site that occurs once on each of these proteins Figure 3 further suggesting the possibility that this site constitutes or is contained within the epitope recognized by these two antibodies Based on the finding of a shared tyrosine phosphorylation site it seems likely that the nuclear structures reported in this and previous studies 1 12 that employed SMI 31 are phosphorylated lamins Furthermore nuclear labeling and DNA synthesis appeared tightly associated in SH SY5Y cultures consistent with the suspected role of lamins in DNA replication 8 Others have reported SMI 31 labeling in glial as well as neuronal nuclei For example Schilling et al 1 identified developmentally regulated nuclear antigens recognized by SMI 31 mAB in C6 rat glioma cells in vitro as well as glial and neuronal nuclei in vivo suggesting the presence non neurofilament epitopes In addition Shea et al 19 in a study of neurite outgrowth from NB2a cells showed that both the SMI 31 and RT 97 mABs strongly labeled nuclei of undifferentiated cells and the nuclear labeling declined as differentiation progressed These results are similar to the results reported here In a recent paper by Glass et al 12 SMI 31 was described as labeling nuclear epitopes in cells in culture and in neurons of mature rat brain as visualized by cryo sectioning and confocal microscopy However in light of the findings reported here the nuclear objects reported by Glass et al in rat brain sections may have been in mitotically active glial cells as well as in neurons Although these nuclear epitopes appear similar to nuclear speckles the latter have not been reported as IF associated structures but rather storage sites of RNA processing proteins see Sanford 2002 for a current brief review 5 However as it is know that lamins are involved in nucleo skeletal organization 23 and organization of DNA replication sites 4 it would not be unexpected to find lamins associated with nuclear speckles perhaps as structural organizers Conclusions Both RT 97 and SMI 31 may recognize the phosphorylated tyrosine motif LNDRFAG Y IDKVR which occurs in NF H and thus provides the basis for the claim of these antibodies being specific for phosphorylated NFs 14 However this same motif occurs in GFAP and lamins A B and C and possibly other proteins and is not restricted to neurons as shown by the glial staining reported here and in other studies 1 It would be interesting to look at nuclei from a variety of tissue types using these antibodies as probes In this study and in previous studies performed in other laboratories 1 19 a close relationship between the nuclear phosphoepitopes and growth phase has been reported Because of the association of phosphorylated lamins with DNA replication and the cell cycle 8 and the sharing of phosphoepitopes among lamins NFs and GFAP it seems most probable that the nuclear epitopes revealed in neuroblastoma and glioma cells by SMI 31 and RT 97 are contained on lamin B Methods Preparation and Maintenance of Cell Cultures All culture reagents were obtained from Sigma St Louis MO unless otherwise noted SH SY5Y cells were maintained in culture as previously described 12 Initial cell density was determined using a hemacytometer Fisher Scientific Pittsburgh PA and diluted appropriately to maintain a seeding density of 4 0 10 4cells cm 2of surface area Cells were grown for approximately 72 hours and fixed in cold methanol unless otherwise indicated F98 rat glioma cells ATCC http www atcc org Manassas VA were also used for comparative purposes in this study and were cultured as described for SH SY5Y cells Fixation and Immunofluorescence Staining for Confocal Microscopy Cells grown on coverslips were washed briefly in a phosphate buffered saline PBS solution pH 7 4 137 mM NaCl 2 7 mM KCl 4 3 mM Na 2 HPO 4 1 4 mM KH 2 PO 4 and then either fixed in 100 methanol at 20 C for 1 minute or at room temperature in a 4 formaldehyde PFA solution freshly made from paraformaldehyde Electron Microscopy Sciences Ft Washington PA and buffered with PBS or PBS with 0 2 Tween 20 PBST for 10 minutes followed by 3 washes in PBS PBST for 10 minutes each As a previous study 13 had suggested nuclear staining by antibodies targeted to cytoplasmic proteins might be fixation dependent 4 or an artifact of fixation we did a preliminary comparison of SMI 31 labeling of methanol vs paraformaldehyde fixed cells We found minor differences in the staining pattern between methanol and paraformaldehyde fixed cells but immuno labeled nuclear structures were visible regardless of fixation No differences in the localization of mAB staining in the cells was noted when comparing between the two methods of fixation After fixation the cell bearing coverslips were incubated in 20 non fat powdered milk in PBS to block non specific protein protein interactions for 2 hours at room temperature The coverslips were then washed 3 times 10 minutes each and incubated with the desired primary antibody Table 1 for 16 24 hours at 4 C The cells were again washed three times in PBS 10 minutes each and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody Table 2 for 2 hours at room temperature During the final 30 minutes of secondary antibody incubation 40 l of TO PRO 3 T 3605 Molecular Probes Eugene OR a DNA specific probe was added for identification of nuclei Table 1 Negative controls for all immuno preparations were prepared by use of the appropriate normal serum in place of the primary antibody The coverslips were then mounted on glass slides in a medium consisting of 90 glycerol in water containing 1 mg ml p phenylenediamine and stored at 20 C in the dark Microscopy and Quantitative Analysis of Immunolabeling An Olympus IX 70 fitted with a Bio Rad MRC 1024 confocal scanhead via the Keller port was used for all image acquisition Initial image processing was done using Bio Rad LaserSharp software running on a Compaq PC final processing and printing of images was done using Adobe Photoshop 7 0 software Culture dynamics were determined for SH SY5Y neuroblastoma cells at an initial density of 4 0 10 4cells cm 2 Cells were introduced into five 25 cm 2flasks then harvested from one flask each day using 5 ml Puck s saline solution pH 7 3 137 mM NaCl 5 4 mM KCl 0 7 mM Na 2 HPO 4 9 5 mM HEPES 5 6 mM dextrose and 0 8 mM EDTA Detached cells were pelleted at 2500 rpm for 5 minutes in a clinical centrifuge and resuspended in 2 ml of PBS Cell density was determined each day by counting the number of cells present in representative samples using a two chambered hemacytometer A proliferation index was calculated as the percentage of nuclei present engaged in DNA synthesis using BrdU uptake as an indicator see part D below for BrdU labeling method also see Figure 4 Quantitation of fluorescent labeling was performed on confocal images collected using calibrated microscope channel settings for cells grown 1 5 days All images were collected from cells stained at the same time with the same batch of antibody Thus any differences in staining intensity and area stained were expected to be a function of time in culture and or culture density This entire process was performed in duplicate Confocal stacks were projected and then imported into NIH Image 1 6 software freeware at http rsb info nih gov nih image Density slice filtering was used to remove background autofluorescence and then record the area stained in each nucleus in the flattened image Intensity values above background were also determined but not used as they were found insensitive to growth conditions and more sensitive to nuclear thickness the number of optical sections in the projected stack than to experimental parameters The area per nucleus stained is not affected by the number of sections in the projected stack and was significantly related to culture conditions These data were used to relate nuclear area stained to time in culture Statistical analysis was done using linear regression and single factor analysis of variance ANOVA Identification of Actively Growing Cells using 5 Bromo 2 Deoxyuridine Cells were seeded onto glass coverslips at an initial density of 4 0 10 4cells cm 2and allowed to grow for 1 5 days Twenty four hours prior to fixation the cells were incubated with 10 M 5 bromo 2 deoxyuridine in MEM see Table 1 At the appropriate time the cells were fixed in methanol at 20 C for 1 2 minutes allowed to air dry then stored at 20 C until all coverslips were ready for processing The cells were rehydrated in PBS for 5 minutes followed by immersion in 2N HCl for 1 hour at room temperature The cells were incubated in 0 1 M borate buffer pH 8 5 0 1 M boric acid 25 mM Na 2 B 4 O 7 and 75 mM NaCl twice for 5 minutes each 10 minutes total followed by three 10 minute washes in PBS Next cells were immunolabeled using anti BrdU monoclonal mouse IgG primary antibody followed by goat anti mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 see Tables 1and 2 All antibody incubations were 1 hour at room temperature in reduced light During the final 30 minutes of secondary antibody incubation TO PRO 3 nucleic acid stain Molecular Probes was added at a 1 1000 dilution The coverslips were then washed and mounted for microscopic analysis The intensity and area nucleus of BrdU labeling was quantitated as described above for immunolabeling Preparation of Total Cell Lysates Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analysis Cells were seeded at an initial density of 4 0 10 4cells cm 2and grown in 150 cm 2flasks for 2 days MEM was removed and cells were detached from the substrate using 10 ml Puck s saline solution and incubated at 37 C for 5 minutes The detached cells were transferred to a centrifuge tube and spun at 2500 rpm for 5 minutes The pellet was resuspended in 5 volumes of 2 sample buffer 60 mM Tris HCl 25 glycerol 2 SDS 14 4 mM 2 mercaptoethanol 0 1 bromphenol blue and 1 mM EGTA then diluted 1 1 in PBS Samples were incubated in boiling water for 5 minutes then passed through a 20 gauge and 26 gauge needle repeatedly to shear chromosomal DNA The lysates were centrifuged at 4000 g for 15 minutes then aliquoted and stored at 20 C prior to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis SDS PAGE and western analysis as previously described 12 Protein concentrations of the cell lysates were determined using the Bio Rad Protein Assay Hercules CA and sample volumes adjusted so that 5 10 g of total protein were loaded into wells of a discontinuous 12 separating 4 stacking polyacrylamide gel Gels were prepared in duplicate and one of each pair stained in Coomassie blue and the other used for electrophoretic transfer onto a nitrocellulose membrane Bio Rad Hercules CA The identities of the proteins bound to the nitrocellulose membrane were revealed using the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies Tables 1and 2 Molecular weight values were determined by calculating Rf ratios as the distance from the bottom of the well to the protein band of interest divided by the distance from the bottom of the well to the dye front Standard curves were developed using log MW of protein standards versus Rf ratio of those standards Apparent molecular weights of proteins identified by western blot analysis were determined by extrapolating MW from the standard curve using measured Rf ratios Identification of Consensus Phosphorylation Motifs in IF proteins Amino acid sequences for human NF H Accession QFHUH lamin A C Accession P02545 and B Accession P20700 and human GFAP Accession
