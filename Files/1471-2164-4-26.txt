                    Background        Grain filling aspects of nutrient partitioning are        intensely studied as they affect the yield and quality of        many important cereals This quality can be measured in        nutritional and aesthetic terms The grainfilling process        of cereal development typically has two processes dilatory        and filling Together these processes encompass the        synthesis transport and storage of carbohydrates fatty        acids proteins and minerals The dilatory process is        characterized by high biosynthetic activity and low dry        matter accumulation During the filling phase all plant        resources contribute toward a steady rate of starch        accumulation in the starch storage unit Genes that        influence the grain filling process are particularly        important in achieving the goal of manipulating nutrient        partitioning pathways        In Zhu         et al      several genes        responsible for grain filling in rice were computationally        identified There clustering of gene expression profiles        was used to identify grain filling genes and their        transcription factors from  rice genes The method        used consisted of an initial identification of nutrient        partitioning genes based on annotation and selection of        genes that potentially participate in the grainfilling        process by clustering of expression profiles via        SelfOrganizing Map SOM followed by hierarchical        clustering influenced by the SOM gene ordering     A        set of grain filling related nutrient partitioning gene        clusters were identified via informed visual inspection of        the hierarchical clustering results This initial set of        genes formed the sole basis for identification of a wider        range of grain filling related genes with diverse        functions overrepresented         cis acting regulatory elements and        associated transcription factors Such an approach provided        a powerful way to associate genes with traits of interest        to identify key regulators as putative target genes in this        complicated biological process and a potential method to        identify strategies for improvement of crop yield and        nutrient value by pathway engineering However the        identified genes and their regulatory networks require        thorough functional validations by experimental methods        such as reverse genetics These experimental validation        steps usually are timeconsuming and expensive Thus        improvement of microarray data analysis by false positive        reduction becomes necessary        Competitive learning schemes like the Kohonen SOM           and hierarchical clustering are popular methods for        visualization and identification of patterns in a large set        of gene expression profiles SOM analysis can provide        nonexclusive classifications but requires an estimate for        the number of classes nodes and is usually carried out in        a lowdimensional space Hierarchical clustering is a more        frequently used method but visualization via        onedimensional lists can lead to poor resolution of        related genes even if a SOM gene ordering influences the        branch flipping as implemented in the software tool        Cluster            Recently singular value decomposition SVD has emerged        as an alternative method for genomic research Several        groups have demonstrated its utility in identifying global        cyclic patterns of gene expression      and its        application in reduction of experimental and biological        noise in microarray datasets      SVD is a feature        generation technique that facilitates the exploration of        multiple dimensions of data variability SVD is an        operation applied to a matrix that results in a list of        vectors which contain features measuring different aspects        of variation in the data One can produce multiple        nonexclusive gene orderings or classifications based on        significant feature vectors The patterns exhibited by one        or more feature vectors singly or in combination may        correspond to biological processes        To improve accuracy of target identification by avoiding                exclusive clustering and exploring a        wider range of dimensionality in expression pattern        variation we have examined the utility of singular value        decomposition in identifying grainfilling genes In this        manuscript we focus on nutrient partitioning genes        potentially involved in grain filling After evaluating the        full spectrum of expression patterns we address the        identification of grain filling genes by a measure of        correlation with a familiar expression pattern        conceptually conforming to grain filling In this manner we        have identified several genes potentially involved in grain        filling and evaluate them by comparison with grain filling        genes identified in an earlier study     These genes        have similar expression profiles showing significant        differential expression during rice grain development and        tissue specificity to panicle and grain         Cis acting regulatory element        surveys also support their role in the grain filling        process                    Results        The decomposition of a matrix of expression levels         A  presented us with several        interesting patterns for gene expression during grain        development Figure  The first three patterns are        significant according to the relative variance threshold         t  described by Everitt and Dunn                      n          n            t   The entropy in the        distribution of relative variances is very low indicating        uneven contribution of the patterns to the expression        profiles in         A Figure  The first pattern         v           reflects a significant deviation        from the basal expression level with an insignificant        variance between experimental conditions In addition the        coefficients of         u          have higher entropy of distribution        than the following left singular vectors making it a        weaker gene classifier         v          may represent normalized global gene        expression deviation from the project mean and was not        used to identify grainfilling genes         v          has a significant pattern of variation        between experiments indicative of a process very similar        to our grainfilling ideal         u          was used to sort the  genes The        sorted expression profiles are shown in Figure  We        classified genes as grain filling if their rank percentile        was greater than or equal to  We limited our threshold        to  in order to obtain a set of at least  genes The        control set was a list of  genes previously classified as        grain filling by Zhu         et al      Thus the        maximum possible fraction of overlap between our grain        filling gene list and the control set could be         Seventytwo percent of the control set had rank percentiles        greater than  There were  genes ranked above this        level that were not in the control set Table a The        control set percentiles are shown in Table  see        Additional file  with values derived from rankings by        several patterns Those in the control set not greater than        the  thpercentile in the         v          ranking were investigated further to        see if they followed other potential nutrient partitioning        patterns Of these twentyseven five were strongly        composed of pattern         v           and ten of         v           leaving thirteen genes in the grain        filling control set unaccounted for Table b        Additional file                         Click here for file        The selection of grain filling genes by SVD pattern        association when compared to visual selection relying on        clustering returns genes with expression profiles more        consistent with our grainfilling ideal The expression        profiles for genes in the control set found by one pattern        or another were averaged Class A A similar treatment was        given to those not found Class B and separately those        not in the control set but highly ranked by         u          Class C Classes A B and C were        plotted together to compare their expression profiles        Figure  Class B shows little differential expression when        compared with C and A A shows differential expression that        corresponds with our ideal for grain filling expression        profiles Class C also shows grainfillinglike        differential expression but with lower magnitude of        variation        The detailed classification of the grain filling related        nutrient partitioning genes was examined and compared        between the two studies It is clear that the previously        selected grainfilling genes in our control set comprised        four different gene clusters Figures   In Table         see Additional file  the genes are ordered according to        that in the clustering Among them ninetytwo percent of        the genes in cluster node  were classified by         u          as grain filling genes while the        other three clusters had approximately  of their genes        classified as grain filling genes These three clusters        differ from the first in purity of signal The three        clusters with fewer matches seem to exhibit a mixture of        expression patterns while the first cluster does so to a        much lower extent        The involvement in grain filling of the novel set C of        genes is supported by the overrepresentation of the grain        filling         cis element A survey of         cis elements of the C set of genes        shows that they have more in common with grain filling        genes than the unselected genes The element AACA was found        to be over represented among grainfilling genes in earlier        work by Zhu         et al  and is more abundant among        the novel genes AACA was part of the motif CAACA which        occurred in  of the  promoters This motif was        described as the RAV AAT binding consensus sequence of         Arabidopsis thaliana transcription        factor RAV     AACA was also found in an ETATA Box        element contained in  of the  promoters     Looking        for AACA in the set of unselected genes it was found in        the motif TAACAAA which only occurred in  of the         promoters This motif was described as a binding site for        GAMYB     Considering the similarities in expression        pattern and promoter elements between the novel genes and        the previously identified grain filling genes the novel        set of genes is likely to be involved in grain filling as        well        To characterize the function of genes that were        classified differently by each method Class B we        analyzed their expression patterns in the vegetative growth        phase and their promoter sequences Among the vegetative        growth samples this set of genes is generally expressed at        a higher level than either the novel set Class C or the        grain filling set Class A  both of which have very        similar unnormalized expression levels Figure        illustrates the unnormalized average expression levels        for each set Closer inspection of the differences between        expression levels of these genes in the vegetative growth        samples reveals a slight elevation in expression for        nonphotosynthetic samples including all root samples and        senescence stem and senescence leaf samples Figure  A         cis element unique to this set of        genes is AACCAA and may explain this bias It was found in         of the  promoters from this set but was not present        among the other genes with a grainfilling pattern This        lightrepressed promoter element was previously found to        have higher DNA binding activity in etiolated plants but        much lower activity in green plants                        Discussion        Our association of genes to singular vectors was not        exclusive A genes expression profile can be described as        linear combination of each right singular vector and said        gene can be associated with those vectors that contribute        the most Clustering provides nested clusters with mutual        exclusivity among clusters at a given correlation        threshold When there are genes with low intensity        patterns clustering can result in groups with a mixture of        patterns and low internal correlation Sets of genes        strongly correlated with a particular singular vector will        have greater internal correlation Given these differences        both methods agree on a majority of grain filling genes        which had very significant differential expression during        grain development This could be expected as both        clustering and SVD seek to minimize the squared error        The area of disagreement between methods concerned genes        with low differential expression They were listed as grain        filling in the control set but were not selected with the        SVD method These unselected genes are not any less        important than those identified with SVD they simply        exhibit small changes in expression level during grain        filling  changes that may be insignificant due to the        presence of errors In many cases regulatory genes have        small changes in expression level while target genes        further along in the cascade have larger changes The        increased sensitivity of pattern detection will improve our        ability to extract these target genes before using them to        search for regulatory genes with other methods Almost all        of these genes with a weak grainfilling pattern were        originally part of hierarchical clustering nodes with very        low internal correlation average pairwise correlation A        more stringent classification that excluded such nodes        would have resulted in a more concordant set of gene        expression profiles        The unselected set might be misclassified in the earlier        study     possibly carrying out roles important in the        grain filling process but sites physically distant from the        grain body itself Their expression profiles did not follow        a pattern similar to that of known grain filling genes and        during vegetative growth their expression levels are        consistently higher These genes in general lacked        promoter elements common to grain filling genes They also        had conserved promoter elements that were not found in        grain filling genes If functional in rice their light        repressed elements would explain the higher expression in        root which grows in dark conditions It is possible that        the higher expression levels observed during stem and leaf        senescence are due to suppression of photosynthesis        activity Rice is a monocot plant and there are portions of        stem that are etiolated due to blockage of light from        permanent leaf encirclement During senescence the light        sensitivity of stem and leaf is biochemically reduced This        may result in a         de facto etiolated state also        explaining the elevated gene expression The        misclassification of these genes was due to the combined        effects of including nodes with low internal correlation        and information loss from hierarchical clustering It        should also be noted that compared to the set of novel        genes and the set of agreedupon genes a greater fraction         vs    respectively of these unselected        genes have potentially unreliable probe sets This        unreliability stems from the inability to compile a full        set of unique probes for these genes and is indicated by        the Probe Set ID suffixes r and i indicating sequences        for which it was not possible to pick a full set of unique        probes or for which there are fewer than fifteen        probes        When using hierarchical clustering to classify gene        expression profiles there are several drawbacks to        consider Generally microarray data is informationrich        with multiple dimensions of variability The ordering of        genes produced by hierarchical clustering reduces this        variability to a single dimension which may not accurately        reflect the differences between expression profiles As a        result closeness in this single dimension may not reflect        similarities occurring in a higher dimensional space These        factors impact difficulttoclassify profiles more        significantly In Zhu         et al     this lead to        grainfilling genes with less obvious expression profiles        being grouped with a mixture of other profiles resulting        in the selection of unreliable patterns over better        candidates The SOM ordering used to influence the        hierarchical clustering ordering helped with this problem        but there are other ways to improve classification        accuracy To avoid these pitfalls a more stringent        selection criterion could have been used with the        hierarchical clustering results to build a core set        followed by a profile ranking based on correlation with the        core set The second round of selection would help to        recover profiles with a weaker pattern which would have        been randomly ordered by hierarchical clustering Another        way to avoid these pitfalls would be to take advantage of        the many fuzzy clustering algorithms which generate        nonexclusive assignment of genes to clusters                    While exploring this use of SVD there were a few        caveats learned which concern the contribution of noise to        the pattern spectrum The matrix that is decomposed by SVD        is usually a dissimilarity matrix like the covariance        matrix The singular values         w                   i           are typically used to indicate the significance of        each right singular vector to the dataset The first         n vectors that cumulatively account        for greater than  of the datasets variation are        sometimes used to describe the dataset and reduce its        dimensionality The rest of the right singular vectors are        then considered noise This interpretation is not always        correct and should be tempered by a study of the right        singular vectors themselves In the situation where the        dataset contains significant additive noise or where the        means are not centered the previous assumption could        result in one ignoring informative patterns exhibited by        the right singular vectors with relatively low singular        values The primary signal would represent this noise        unconformable pattern and mask the other patterns An        observation of the primary right singular vectors pattern        would indicate a relatively constant level for all samples        poorly classifying experiments or correlating with        differentially expressed genes Although possible there        was no need to filter out strong noise from the dataset and        recalculate the SVD This condition was dealt with by        focusing on right singular vectors that correlate with our        conceptual grainfilling pattern regardless of their        singular values magnitude These grain filling right        singular vectors were then used to classify the genes in        our dataset In fact a classification of genes using the        right singular vector with the largest singular value was        of low quality        As the coefficients for each right singular vector are        used to classify genes and the genes in each class should        ideally have coefficients different from genes in other        classes the challenge to identify a vector that produces a        good classification can be simplified by measurement of the        entropy for each vectors coefficient distribution Vectors        with the lowest entropy even if they have a small singular        value have the most ordered coefficient distribution and        may be quite useful in classifying genes into distinct        groups We will follow up on this idea in future        applications of SVD to RNA dynamics        SVD can be used to reduce the dimensionality of a data        set but our method uses the singular vectors generated by        the decomposition to identify patterns that may relate to        grain filling in rice In this way we attempt to avoid        overlooking any dimensions of expression profile variance        A gene ranking based on similarity to interesting        featurevectors allows recovery of profiles with weaker but        relevant grain filling patterns This method selected genes        with greater differential expression than the questionable        set presented by clustering The newly identified genes are        important because they represent genes that have a stronger        pattern of grain filling which were not easily visually        identified from the hierarchical clustering It is likely        that if the previous method only relied on SOM more of        these genes would have been identified SVD provides much        information about patterns of variability in a dataset        rather than a rigid assignment of genes to clusters This        added perspective plus the ability to amplify or attenuate        specific patterns in the dataset complements the        classifications given by commonly used clustering        techniques                    Conclusions        We conclude that SVD is a useful alternative method that        complements widely used clustering methods for studying        function of genes The SVD identified grainfilling related        genes providing additional valuable candidate genes for        improving grain composition and yield                    Methods                  Datasets used          The dataset comprised expression levels of  genes          in  samples with emphasis on the  samples directly          related to grain filling     The complete dataset          used is available at          httpwwwblackwellsciencecomproductsjournalssuppmatPBIPBIPBIsmhtm          Based on their sequence annotation and functional          classification     the  genes were selected          because their products are presumably involved in or          associated with three major pathways of nutrient          partitioning the synthesis and transport of fatty acids          carbohydrates and proteins The  grain filling related          tissue samples include panicle  cm

normalization          In our matrix           A each row corresponded to a          different gene and each column corresponded to one of           different conditions The           a                       ij            cell in           A was the expression level of gene                    i under condition           j  The data in           A was transformed to the           n            m matrix           A according to the protocol in Zhu           et al      During this          transformation values of           a                       ij            less than  were set equal to  and          logtransformed Next the expression vectors were          mediancentered and normalized such that the sum of          squares for each expression vector was equal to one In          efforts to validate our results we also investigated          gene expression level in a wider range of samples          including the  mentioned above totaling  samples          The normalization applied to this broader set was the          same as that described for the set of  above Note          that the difference in sample number will affect the          median centering and normalization steps

patterns in           A  The square of the singular          values divided by the sum of singular values squares          defines the relative variance for each singular value          This relative variance indicates how much of the variance          in A is explained by a particular singular vector The          expression profile of any gene can be written as a linear          combination of these singular vectors and the singular          values in           W                           Pattern recognition          The right singular vectors that match our          preconception of a grain filling pattern of expression          for example low expression during panicle development          and increasing expression during grain development were          identified after           A was decomposed For each          interesting pattern           v                       j             the genes           g                       i             were sorted by           u                       ij            and the top  thpercentile were selected These top          scorers were compared to  genes previously identified          as grain fillingrelated nutrient partitioning genes by          Zhu           et al  which they used as a          template for selecting other genes and transcription          factors involved in grain filling In Zhu           et al  the  genes were manually          selected by visualization of a hierarchical clustering          informed by a SOM grouping of the  potential nutrient          partitioning genes Figures   The quality of the          ordering given by           u                       j            was assessed by plotting the percent of the  found          having a percentile greater than           p for all           p less than  Similarly the          percent of those genes selected that are in the set of           for all           p  is plotted          We observed the entropy E of various distributions          during our study and the generalized formula we used is          shown in Equations  and  for a vector F containing N          scalars                                    Promoter analysis          After genes were classified their promoter sequences          were identified to check if pattern similarity could be          related to conserved           cis elements The statistically          significant elements were identified with a PERL script          and annotated with the PLACE database     The PERL          script identified motifs among promoter sequences for a          given set of genes Those elements that matched to an          annotated           cis acting regulatory DNA element          from the PLACE database were then presented We limited          our investigation to elements located within  KB of the          transcriptional start site and that had an evalue less          than E At the time of publication not all probe          sets could be associated with high quality
