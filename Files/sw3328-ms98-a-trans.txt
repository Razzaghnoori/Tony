        yeah they just raised our taxes up here about a year ago     well theyve uh statewide raises they raise ours it seems like constantly we just uh passed a new one uh fortunately or unfortunately it doesnt go into effect because we did not get the United Airlines   oh right Indianapolis got that didnt they   right and uh we had passed a a provisional one that if if it did if they did locate here we would raise our taxes but uh at least we thought wed get something back from that   yeah   uh how do you feel about taxes   oh it seems like a big politics game like up here last year the governors up for reelection so he said the budget was fine and that the state didnt have any money and then right after he won the election he said we owed a lot of money so they raised all our taxes       and now its election time again so theyre trying to lower them   oh   so theyre just talk about lowering them but they never do they just keep raising them   ive never seen taxes really go down   yeah me neither well actually theyre going to here because they didnt have a budget for so long so they raised the tax rate real high for the last three months of this year and theyre gonna lower it for next year   oh   i guess they figure theyre gonna make up for all they didnt get when they shouldve had a budget   i hope they put that in writing   yeah  yeah they say theyre gonna lower but ill see   i feel like the middle class people are supporting the nation  and uh that the rich are not paying their share and of course the poor cant afford it either but uh i really feel like and and i feel like you know im a middle class person income incomewise anyway and uh i get tired of supporting the whole country   yeah so do i i mean im a a middle class barely but uh i dont think the rich are paying more let not enough i think theyre paying too much   you think the rich are paying too much   yeah i mean if youre in the the three three percent bracket and they take a third of your check every month well thats ridiculous why bother working   well i dont know many rich that dont have enough tax breaks to i mean im talking about the really rich   well they should just tax everybody the same amount no matter what you make   right   thatd be fair   now ill go along with that i you know   yeah no loopholes or anything everybody pays ten percent or fifteen or whatever   right now i think that would be fair and i you know   right   no no ifs ands and buts you know no big elaborate laws that say uh you know call for a lot of enforcement or a lot of review its just you know you make this you pay ten percent  if you make a hundred dollars you pay ten percent if you make a million dollars you pay ten percent   yeah thats the way our state tax is here i think its pretty fair   our state taxes are somewhat based on the federal   hm   and uh  they have not gotten it  where the withholding is accurate   oh   so and and you withhold no matter what you do they withhold what theyre supposed to and at the end of the year its not enough   oh great so you ought to be saving up some every month to make up for all what they should be taking out   right so now you know when you sign your W form or whatever W whatever that is then they always say do you want a extra amount for state   umhum     which is ridiculous but its been that way for the last probably ten years   yeah i guess you you have to check yes or you come down to the end of the year and you dont have it to give it to them   right unless you have a lot of deductions but you know if you have a lot of federal deduction it ends up hurting you statewise   yeah really   and you end up owing  you know you may get nine hundred dollars back from federal and youre gonna owe  fifteen hundred in the state   ouch   and uh its its just ridiculous but i i dont know ive they just came up with a twenty five percent increase on personal property in in Oklahoma county and that is a chunk   yeah ill say   i mean twenty five percent increase   yeah
