 Chapter 4 Propagating Organization his book with its curious title Investigations seeks new questions about the universe It is not always that everything is hidden and science must ferret out the mysteries by scouring for unknown facts although often science proceeds in the manner of finding new facts Rather it can be the case that the world is bluntly in front of us but we lack the questions of the world that would allow us to see There are stories perhaps merely stories of the response to early Spanish ships in the Caribbean by native inhabitants The ships were not seen there was no concept for them Bluntly in front of us The closure of catalytic and work tasks in an autonomous agent by which it genuinely constructs a rough second copy from small building blocks by adroit linking of exergonic and endergonic processes A cell or colony of cells is propagating this organization of process My aim in the current chapter is to begin to investigate what we might mean and hence see by propagating organization No easy journey this I will begin with Maxwell s demon and why measurement of a system only pays in a nonequilibrium setting In a nonequilibrium setting the measurements can be stored and used to extract work from the measured system Maxwell s demon is the clearest place in physics where matter energy and information come together Yet we will find the demon and his eorts at measurement tantalizingly incomplete You see only some features of a nonequilibrium system if measured reveal displacements from equilibrium from which work can in principle be extracted Other features even if measured are useless for detecting such energy sources from which work can be extracted Thus whatever the demon s eorts there remain the issues of just what features of a nonequilibrium system the demon must measure such that work can be extracted how the demon knows to measure those features rather than other useless features and how once measured couplings come into existence in the universe that actually extract work Not good enough I shall say to assert that in principle work can be extracted How does work come to be extracted A simple example of a device that detects displacements from equilibrium and extracts work is a windmill The vane on the windmill in eect measures the direction of the wind and pivots the windmill such that its fan blades are perpendicular to the wind In turn the wind does work on the blades causing the windmill to rotate The system as a whole measures a deviation from equilibrium here the direction of the wind orients the entire system such that extraction of work by the wind is possible for the device and it actually extracts work The windmill turns The universe as a whole from galaxies to planetary systems and certainly our and any other biospheres is filled with entities that measure displacements from equilibrium that are sources of energy those entities actually do extract work Think of the teeming busyness of a coevolving mixed microbial community of long ago successfully linking exergonic and endergonic reactions fired by the sun and other high energy sources That community measured displacements from equilibrium extracted work and inhabited Manhattan three billion years ago literally building high rise microbial mat ecosystems Its microbial descendants are constructing similar high rise structures in the Sea of Cortez and on the Great Barrier Reef of Australia today Where did all this come from this measuring of useful displacements from equilibrium from which work can be extracted the devices coupling to such measurements and the extraction of work used to build up new kinds of devices that measure new kinds of displacements from equilibrium to extract work in new ways Yet a biosphere actually constructing itself up from sunlight water and a small diversity of chemical compounds does all this over evolutionary time The biosphere does achieve persistent measuring of displacements from equilibrium from which work can be extracted and does discover devices to couple to those energy sources such that work can be extracted And since the biosphere does this and the biosphere is part of the universe then the universe does it This coming into existence of self constructing ecosystems must somehow be physics Thus it is important that we have no theories for these issues in current physics The stark fact that a biosphere builds up this astounding complexity and diversity suggests that our current physics is missing something fundamental A biosphere becomes complex the universe becomes complex I will argue that the very diversity and complexity of a biosphere begets its further diversification and complexification I strongly suspect that the same is true of the universe as a whole The universe s very diversity and complexity begets its further diversification and complexification After exploring Maxwell s demon I will ask a physicist s question What is work Physicists have an answer work is force acting through distance given by a single number or scalar representing the sum of the force acting through the distance But it will turn out that in any specific case of work the specific process is organized in some specific way Work is more than force acting through distance it is in fact the constrained release of energy the release of energy into a small number of degrees of freedom It is the constraints themselves with as Phil Anderson points out a kind of rigidity that largely constitute the organization of the process But and here will be the hook in many cases it takes work to construct the constraints themselves So we will come to a terribly important circle work is the constrained release of energy but it often takes work to construct the constraints A conceptual cluster lies at the heart of the mystery The cluster concerns the progressive emergence of organization in the evolution of the physical universe and of a biosphere That emerging organization concerns the appearance in the evolving universe of entities measuring relevant rather than nonrelevant properties of nonequilibrium systems by which they identify sources of energy that can perform work Then physical entities appear that construct constraints on and couplings to the release of the identified source of energy whereby the energy is actually released and work comes to be performed Such work often comes to be used to construct further detectors of energy sources and entities that harbor constraints on the release of energy which when released constitutes work that constructs still further sources of energy and constraints on its release It should be clear that we have at present no theories about these matters nor even a clear concept of the subject matter of such theories The heart of the mystery concerns a proper understanding of organization and propagating diversifying organization Most profoundly the mystery concerns the historical appearance since the big bang of connected structures of matter energy and processes by which an increasing diversity of kinds of matter sources of energy and types of processes come into existence in a biosphere or in the universe itself This is what lies directly before us but which we have not been able to see A biosphere does all the above Ours has for four billion years of awesome ill understood creativity Doubt it Open your eyes and look around you The universe since the big bang was and remains out of equilibrium or vastly nonequilibrium It was a profound insight in the development of equilibrium thermodynamics to recognize that the energy present in the thermal motions of an equilibrium gas system could not be extracted to do work But we might ask a similar question of the nearly featureless profound nonequilibrium of the early universe How in the absence of specific structures and processes could the nonequilibrium universe couple that enormous energy to the specific generation of anything at all Part of the answer lies in the concept of broken symmetries Consider a pole standing vertically on a horizontal plane In due course it will fall over under the influence of gravity Prior to falling its range of possible directions to fall is the full circle After it falls it points in some specific direction By falling the pole has broken the circular symmetry of the system and come to a specific orientation Thus part of the answer to the emergence of specific structures lies in the expansion and cooling of the universe with the associated sequences of symmetry breakings that split the four fundamental forces yielded a quark gluon soup that cooled into other elementary particles then atoms simple molecules self gravitating masses galaxies giant molecular clouds and second generation stars As symmetries broke the variety of matter and process increased As the variety increased the pairwise diversity of matter and processes increased roughly as the square of the diversity Hence it became more probable that specific pairs of spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes might become linked in a variety of ways capturing the energy resources of the spontaneous processes that could then flow in constrained ways into the nonspontaneous processes to yield novel consequences Among those consequences are the construction of new structures able to measure sources of energy Among the other consequences are the generation of novel and specific nonequilibrium energy sources and of structures and constraints that might couple to those novel specific sources of energy The couplings and constraints in turn channel the release of energy in specific ways that constitutes the work that is done to construct still further novel energy sources measuring structures couplings and constraints This in a nutshell is the universe diversifying constructing structures and processes propagating and elaborating wondrous organization In chapter I introduced the chemical adjacent possible and will return to it in later chapters In terms of molecular diversity and other types of diversity the universe and the biosphere keep advancing into a persistent adjacent possible New kinds of molecules with new properties themselves and in couplings with other kinds of molecules persistently arise on planet Earth and presumably in the giant cold molecular clouds that are the birthplaces of stars in most spiral galaxies The new species of molecules aord the novel exergonic and endergonic reactions novel constraints and novel sources of energy that are part of the creativity outside our collective window Yet we hardly know how to say what this propagation and elaboration of organization and process is nor have we a clue about whether there may be general laws that govern such self constructing nonequilibrium processes Such a law could be my hoped for fourth law of thermodynamics for open self constructing systems We have begun with autonomous agents But we are here driven beyond bio spheres What are the general conditions that allow such self constructing nonequilibrium processes to flourish Are biospheres the only examples What of the evolution of the geology of a planet a solar system a galaxy the universe as a whole Are there ways of thinking about the emergence of structures that measure and discover sources of energy in nonequilibrium systems together with the emergence of structures and processes that couple to sources of energy do work to construct constraints and propagate the constrained release of the discovered energy such that more diverse structures constraints and processes can arise de novo in the adjacent possible of the evolving universe Is the universe highly diverse and is our biosphere diverse because there is some general law or tendency for such nonequilibrium self constructing systems to diversify I confess I suspect so In an intuitive nutshell in a nonequilibrium setting the greater the diversity of structures potential reactions or other transformations among structures measurement processes and devices coupling devices and constraints that already exist in a ramified web of propagating structures reactions work measurement constraint and coupling constructions the easier it is for the total system to generate new kinds of molecules or other structures processes measurement devices couplings and constraints such that a biosphere or the universe can expand into the newness of its adjacent possible But those new structures processes measuring devices couplings and constraints in turn increase the total diversity hence enable yet further expansion into the adjacent possible creating perpetual autocatalytic novelty on timescales that must be vastly longer than the current age of the universe The universe in short is breaking symmetries all the time by generating such novelties creating distinctive molecules or other forms which had never existed before Indeed there may be a general law for biospheres and perhaps even the universe as a whole along the following lines A candidate fourth law As an average trend biospheres and the universe create novelty and diversity as fast as they can manage to do so without destroying the accumulated propagating organization that is the basis and nexus from which further novelty is discovered and incorporated into the propagating organization Autonomous agents themselves self reproducing systems carrying out one or more work cycles linking exergonic and endergonic processes in a cyclic fashion that propagate the union of catalysis constraint construction and process organization that constitute such autonomous agents are but the most miraculously diversifying examples of this universal process in our unfolding ever changing universe Maxwell s Demon Arguably James Clerk Maxwell was the greatest scientist of the nineteenth century notwithstanding giants such as Carnot Boltzmann and Darwin While his most radical work is captured in the Maxwell equations for electromagnetic fields which introduced the fundamental concept of fields into physics Maxwell concerned himself deeply with the puzzle Carnot had raised in what is now called the second law of thermodynamics Consider again a thermodynamically isolated system That is consider some box containing a gas isolated from any change in its energy or mass arriving from the outside There are N gas particles in the box and as noted earlier we can consider the positions and momenta of all N particles Each position and each momentum can be decomposed into three numbers defining position and motion in the three spatial directions Hence the entire state of the N particles of gas can be defined by N numbers plus a specification of the interior boundaries of the box As described above all the possible states of this N system of particles can be divided into very small volumes of states which we will call microstates Again as noted in chapter a macrostate is a collection of microstates In particular the equilibrium macrostate is a collection of microstates having the property that the gas particles are nearly uniformly distributed in the box with a characteristic equilibrium distribution of velocities that Maxwell himself worked out This equilibrium macrostate has the further important properties that vastly many microstates are in the equilibrium macrostate a few macroscopic features temperature pressure and volume suce to specify the equilibrium macrostate In terms of microstates and macrostates as we saw the second law can be reformulated in its famous statistical mechanics incarnation The second law becomes the statement that at equilibrium the system will flow from any initial macrostate such that it spends most of its time in the equilibrium macrostate This statement of the second law does not preclude the extremely improbable case in which the N particles just happen to flow to one corner of the box Thus the second law is a statistical law in statistical mechanics But now Maxwell enters and invents a wee creature later dubbed Maxwell s demon I confess that I find the use of the term demon here more than slightly interesting Maxwell s demon is almost an autonomous agent While the demon is not defined as I have done you will soon see that he seems to be able to make decisions and to act on the physical world I suspect it is more than a mere coincidence that Maxwell and we seem forced to use this kind of intentional language In fact an odd feature of physics is that experimenters who are outside the system are always busy intentionally setting up experiments and preparing quantum systems in desired states Surely in a full theory the experimenters themselves each an autonomous agent would be part of the theory And if not why not In chapter I return to this theme for it relates to our incapacity to finitely prestate the configuration space of a biosphere Maxwell asks us to consider the very same box with N particles in it But he imagines the box to be divided into two chambers by a wall with a window in it In the window is a flap valve When the flap valve is open gas particles can pass from the left to the right box via the window or from the right to the left box via the window Now smiles Maxwell suppose the initial state of the gas in the box is in the equilibrium macrostate No macroscopic work can be done by the equilibrium system That was Carnot s central point There is plenty of energy in the random motions of the gas particles but there is no means to extract mechanical work from it say to drive a piston Next says Maxwell warming to his point Imagine that my wee friend operates the flap valve such that whenever a fast gas particle approaches the window from inside the left box toward the right box he opens the flap and lets the faster than average hence hotter gas particle through And suppose my demon also operates the flap value to let the slower than average hence cooler gas particles pass from the right to the left box Well soon the left box will be cool and the right box will be hot And now concludes Maxwell with a broad smile we can use the macroscopic temperature dierence between the left and right boxes to extract mechanical work say by driving a piston There you have it Maxwell posed a severe question for statistical mechanics and the second law It appeared that the actions of the demon might circumvent the second law Maxwell s demon has set a puzzle that is still not fully resolved An important step in saving the second law was taken by Leo Szilard who also conceived of the nuclear chain reaction one day in London and helped set in motion the development of the atomic bomb and atomic energy Szilard carried out a calculation linking for the first time the concept of entropy and a new concept of information The entropy of a system is a measure of its disorder Recall that we can define the volumes of dierent macrostates by the numbers of microstates each macrostate contains For convenience take the logarithm of the number of microstates in each macrostate In addition each macrostate also has a probability of being occupied by the system Multiply the logarithm of the number of microstates per macrostate by the probability that the system is in that macrostate Now add up all these quantities for all the macrostates The total is the entropy of the system Statistically of course the entropy of a system either increases over time or is constant At equilibrium it is constant If the system is released from an initially improbable macrostate its initial entropy for the first period of time is low since most macrostates are not occupied However over time it will tend to spread out over all possibilities and the sum of the probabilities of occupancy times macrostate volumes will increase to the equilibrium value Szilard took a first step in thinking about what Shannon later called information Roughly Szilard realized that when the demon lets a faster or a slower gas particle pass specifically into the left or right box respectively then the total entropy of the system is decreasing a little bit But in turn Szilard estimated the amount of work that must be done by the demon to discriminate that the gas particle is faster or slower than average It turns out that the work that must be done hence the energy utilized equals the work that can later be extracted from the system after the fast and slow particles are separated into the two boxes Since the work done by the demon equals the work that later can be extracted from the system no net work can be extracted from the equilibrium system and the second law is saved The link to information due to Shannon comes next Shannon was concerned with transmitting signals down wires He brilliantly thought of the minimal signal as a yes or no answer hence representable as the binary or now called a bit Shannon considered the entropy of a source sending a prospective signal as the set of possible messages that might be sent where each message was to be weighted by the probability of actually being sent He thought of receiving a message as reducing the entropy or uncertainty about which message was actually sent given the initial set of possible messages Thus Shannon wound up reinventing the same mathematics that covers entropy Here there is an ensemble of messages and each can be thought of as occupying a volume in a space of possible messages Each message is sent with some probability from the source So Shannon took the logarithm of the volume in message space occupied by a message and multiplied it by the probability that that message was sent from the source If the fraction of the total volume of message space occupied by a given message is p then the logarithm of this volume is logp and the probability of that volume is p Thus the logarithm of a probability of a message multiplied by that probability itself is plogp The sum of these plogp terms for the total set of messages at the source is the entropy of the source Reception of a signal reduces the receiver s uncertainty about what is being sent from the source hence is a negative entropy Shannon s information measure is thus just the negative of the normal entropy measure The link established by Szilard between information and Maxwell s demon is roughly that the discrimination by the demon that a given gas molecule is faster or slower than average and whether it is coming from the left or right box hence whether he should open or close the flap valve constitutes a measurement that extracts information about the gas system hence lowers the uncertainty about the gas system hence lowers the entropy of the gas system Importantly there is an implied observer in discussions about entropy Thus a physicist might typically say that the entropy of a system is due to our coarse graining of the system into arbitrarily chosen macrostates If we had more information about the microscopic states of the system our more refined coarse graining would reduce the entropy of the system from our point of view Indeed there has been some genuine confusion about the role of the observer and his more or less arbitrary choice of coarse graining in the concept of entropy One resolution to this confusion has been suggested by Rolf Sinclair and Wojciech Zurek who have returned to the demon problem with a wonderful set of concepts When the demon has at it with the flap valve he is in fact performing measurements on the gas system As he performs the measurements he knows more about the detailed state of the system Now just what might it mean to know about the gas system One useful sense of know is that the demon has some compact description of the state of the gas system Indeed the compact description of the equilibrium state is about as compact as you can get A few macroscopic variables temperature pressure volume suce One modern sense of a compact description of something is a computer program We are to think of the computer program as a calculating engine We give it initial input data It has some program typically written as a sequence of binary numbers and and the program operates on the input data also a string of binary symbols and churns out an answer Then the concept of a compact description becomes the concept of the shortness of the symbol string giving the input data and the shortness of the program In order to maximize compression we must get all redundancy out of both the input symbol string and the symbol string representing the program Sinclair and Zurek have independently carried out work that shows the following Initially as the demon operates his knowledge about the system increases hence the entropy of the gas system decreases But at the same time as the demon s information about the system increases the length of the most compact description of the system increases as well In fact the length of the most compact description increases on average exactly as fast as does the decrease in the entropy of the gas system But as the length of the most compact description increases bit by actual bit its information content increases bit by bit Thus for each bit in reduction of the entropy of the gas system achieved by our measurements the information content of the most compact description increases on average exactly as rapidly Or as Zurek says in the modern interpretation the sum of the entropy of the gas system plus the observer s knowledge about that system is a constant for an equilibrium gas system Well we could still cheat and extract work from our measured gas system using the information about its microstate achieved by all the measurements But Sinclair notes that in the long run the cheat will not work We have had to record the information about the gas system somewhere say in the registers on a silicon chip At some point in a closed system the chip will be filled up with bits in registers To keep measuring the equilibrium system we will have to erase the chip And Sinclair did the calculation that mirrors Szilard s To erase a memory stored bit has a minimal energy cost that exactly balances the work we could get from the gas system by using the stored information about the system The second law again in the statistical sense holds No macroscopic work can be done by an equilibrium system Measurement does not pay in an equilibrium setting Why this long discourse Because it does pay to measure the gas system if the gas system is not at equilibrium Think of a simple example The gas particles in the left box are actually hotter than the gas particles in the right box Thus pressure in the left box is higher than in the right box If the flap valve is opened gas will tend to flow from the left to the right box until equilibrium is established Note that a very simple compact description has captured these features of the nonequilibrium system and work can be extracted as the gas system flows to equilibrium More generally Zurek s point is that as measurements are performed on a nonequilibrium gas system the length of the most compact description increases more slowly than the knowledge thus gained reduces the entropy of the system It pays to measure the nonequilibrium system in the sense that those measurements specify the displacements from equilibrium that constitute energy sources that can be utilized to extract work So the demon is indeed a place in physics where matter energy information and indeed work come together Let s consider just how work might actually be extracted in the classical Maxwell demon situation with an ideal gas in two boxes separated by a partition with the window and flap valve As a simple example consider again the tiny windmill mentioned above consisting of a fan and a vane perpendicular to the fan Let the windmill be located very near the window with the flap valve inside the total gas system If the flap valve is opened a wind will pass transiently from the left to the right box The windmill s vane will measure the direction of the wind and actually orient the windmill fan blades perpendicular to the wind The wind will cause the fan to turn thus the turning fan extracts mechanical work from the system until equilibrium is reached But now we need to pause and reflect for the story of the demon is both tantalizing and incomplete Consider again our tiny windmill What feature of the total gas system was measured and detected such that work could be extracted Roughly the wind from the left to the right box But not all measurements of the two box system would have resulted in information that was useful in the sense that work could have been extracted by the actual box in its actual configuration For example the box with the flap valve separates the left and right boxes suppose that there is an identical number of gas molecules in the two equal sized boxes and that the gas in the left box is hotter than the gas in the right box Further suppose the demon measures the number and instantaneous locations of all the gas particles in the left and right boxes The fact that the particles in the left box are hotter than those in the right box hence are moving faster than those in the right box would not be revealed by a measurement of the instantaneous numbers and locations of all the gas particles in the left and right boxes To measure faster motion the demon must measure positions at two time moments or some other feature such as the recoil of the box s walls from the momentum transferred by the hotter versus cooler gas particles in the left and right boxes as they bounce o the wall So just how does the demon decide Figure or come to measure the relevant properties such that an energy source is successfully identified such that work can be extracted We have in fact no answer as yet But this is an essential issue Only certain features of a nonequilibrium system will upon measurement reveal a displacement from equilibrium that can actually be used to extract work Other features if measured are useless with respect to revealing a displacement from equilibrium that can be used to extract work by any given specific system It is important to stress that we have here a sense of useful outside the context of autonomous agents Useful measurements detect features of displacements from equilibrium that reveal energy sources from which work can be extracted Only some measurements are actually useful in this sense in a biosphere a geosphere or a galaxy These useful measurements participate together with the coming into existence of devices that extract work used to build further measurement and work extraction structures in the gradual buildup of the diversity of structures and processes of a biosphere a geosphere a galaxy or a universe This buildup is part of why the universe is complex I believe that we can ultimately create a statistical theory of the probability of the generation of specific novel processes structures and energy sources propagation of measurements detection of useful sources of energy and couplings of structures and processes to the energy sources to extract work and progressively build up still further new structures energy sources and processes all as a function of the current diversity of structures transformation processes and measuring and coupling entities Such statistical theories should be constructable for example for a giant cold molecular galactic cloud or early prebiotic planet or most fundamentally the expanding universe as a whole We need a theory in which symmetry breaking begets further symmetry breaking in a progressive construction of diversifying structures and processes Chapter with its discussion of the origin of self reproducing molecular systems as a phase transition to supracritical behavior in catalyzed chemical reaction graphs as a function of molecular diversity and the ratio of reactions to molecular species is a partial prototype for such a statistical theory A further partial prototype is present in chapter with its discussion of autonomous agents as self reproducing physical systems that do successfully measure displacements from equilibrium and do successfully evolve to couple exergonic and endergonic reactions to achieve completed work cycles The vast and richly coupled network of coupled exergonic and endergonic reactions in the global ecosystem is proof positive of such propagating construction in the physical universe In chapter I will discuss a quantum analogue to such a theory in which complex quantum systems that couple tend to decohere irreversibly to classical behavior and thereby progressively build up complex classical structures It is also important to unpack the sense three paragraphs above of actually and any specific system Consider a single gas particle in a box Measure its location left or right of any arbitrary surface transecting the box Here arbitrary means that we can choose to perform any such measurement we wish by placing the partition arbitrarily in the box If we know the particle is to the left of a given arbitrary partition we can in principle extract work by allowing the particle to pass through a window in the partition and do work on a fan as it passes to the right box Hence it seems that in principle any such arbitrary measurement can detect a source of energy that can be used to extract work But the conclusion is false that any arbitrary measurement of our single gas molecule system can detect a displacement from equilibrium from which work can be extracted The in principle just above includes the idea that having made an arbitrary choice of placement of the partition and a measurement of which side of the partition the particle is in and hence having detected by that arbitrary measurement the displacement from equilibrium that is a source of energy we can afterward decide on a construction procedure that will utilize the information about the displacement from equilibrium to extract work from the measured nonequilibrium system In short we can place the windmill in the system after we have measured the location of the gas particle We measure first then place the windmill in the compartment that does not have the particle of gas such that that particle upon passing through the flap valve will cause the windmill to turn slightly But what if we already have constructed the system that is to extract the work as in the tiny windmill case and already mounted the windmill at a specific location inside the box Thereafter we perform an arbitrary measurement by placing the partition in the box and then locate the gas particle We may have placed the partition in the box such that the windmill is on the same side of the partition that has the gas molecule rather than placing the partition such that the prepositioned windmill is in the empty side No net work can be extracted The gas molecule will repeatedly bounce o the windmill fan from all angles No net rotation of the fan can occur Thus in a concrete context when we can no longer alter the work extracting structure such as the location of the windmill but perform the measurement after the work extracting system is in place then only certain measurements of the nonequilibrium system will detect sources of energy that can couple to the work extracting structure such that work is extracted Other measurements of the extant nonequilibrium system may be utterly useless in the sense that no sources of energy that can couple to the work extracting system are detected We see the hints here of something new Only certain features of a given nonequilibrium system if measured will result in detection of sources of energy that might become coupled to specific other processes that by doing work propagate macroscopic changes in the universe Moreover the tiny windmill is an example of a device that not only detects the wind from the left to the right box but also orients the fan perpendicular to that wind and has couplings and constraints embodied in its structure such that mechanical work is actually extracted Fine but we built the tiny windmill How do such coupling structures that link identified sources of energy to the carrying out of work come to exist in the universe on their own There is not the slightest doubt for example that such entities have come into existence in our biosphere as autonomous agents have coevolved over the eons Thus a host of new questions are raised In the beginning presumably the universe was simple homogeneous featureless almost isotropic Now it is vastly complex In the beginning the early Earth had a paucity of complex molecules chemical reactions linked structures and processes Now it is vastly complex The universe as a whole has witnessed the coming into existence of novel structures and processes so too has the biosphere Where no dierence existed dierences have come into existence In a general sense the persistent emergence of dierent structures and processes is the persistent breaking of the symmetry of the universe What feeds this apparent propagating diversity One aspect may be the following Consider again the case of the box with the flap valve and something simpler than a fan say a small mica flake suspended in the cooler of the left and right boxes If the flap valve be opened a wind from the hotter to the cooler box is transiently present This is a simple displacement from equilibrium and a simple device the mica flake will be made to quake hence extract mechanical work Now consider an antiferromagnetic material Such material has magnetic dipoles that when adjacent prefer to point in opposite directions The north pole of one prefers to be adjacent to the south poles of its neighbors If arranged along a straight line an antiferromagnetic material has two equivalent lowest energy ground states NSNSNSNSN versus SNSNSNSNS Now consider a subtle displacement from one of these lowest energy states say NNNSNSSSN Here rather than alternating N and S poles being next to one another runs of NNN and SSS occur The energy of the total system would be lowered if the dipoles flipped orientation to come closer to one or the other of the ground energy states Therefore at a suciently low temperature such that the system can flow to and remain at a ground state the NNNSNSSSN antiferromagnet is displaced from its lowest energy equilibrium state and in principle work could be extracted from this system as it relaxes to one of the two lowest energy states But notice now that compared to detecting the direction of the wind by the mica flake a rather complex and subtle measurement must be made by any measuring device that is to detect the subtle displacement from equilibrium and that any device that is to use that displacement to extract work must be correspondingly subtle Roughly speaking a measuring device must be of similar complexity to the antiferromagnet Indeed a second antiferromagnet could serve as a measuring device if it were near its own ground state and brought into proximity to the first antiferromagnet The runs of SSS and NNN in the first antiferromagnet brought close to a second one with ground state runs of SNS and NSN could cause the first antiferromagnet to flip closer to its ground states Hence the measuring detecting extracting device must be more structurally and functionally complex than a mere mica flake considered as a thin planar crystal The linked exergonic and endergonic organic chemistry reactions present in the molecular autonomous agents that we call cells exemplify just this structural and functional subtlety The electric charge distribution on two complex organic molecules brought into proximity coupled with the modes of translational vibrational and rotational motions constitute the subtle means to measure displacements from equilibrium couple to those displacements and achieve linked catalyzed exergonic and endergonic reactions As the molecular diversity of the biosphere increases more such molecular species displaced from equilibrium come into existence more such molecular species able to detect such displacements from equilibrium come into existence more such coupled catalyzed exergonic and endergonic reactions come into existence In general it would begin to appear that as a higher diversity of entities come into existence entities that are then necessarily more complex their modes of being in nonequilibrium conditions increase in diversity and subtlety In turn the very existence of sets of these increasingly diverse and complex entities gives them an increased number of ways and so an increased probability to couple with one another such that one may measure a displacement from equilibrium of the other hence these entities happen upon a source of energy that can be and is extracted to do work In turn that work may drive nonspontaneous processes to create still more complex molecular species or other entities in the adjacent possible In short there appears to be some positive relationship between the diversity and complexity of structures or processes and the diversity and complexity of the features of a nonequilibrium system which can be detected and measured by the detecting structure to identify a source of energy then couple to the source of energy and actually extract work If there is a relation such that diverse and complex features of nonequilibrium systems useful as sources of energy can best be detected by equally diverse and complex structures then there appears to be some generalized autocatalytic set of processes in the universe since the big bang and in a biosphere by which nonequilibrium systems of increasing complexity and diversity arise provide sources of energy of increasing subtlety and complexity and in turn are detected and extracted by the increasingly complex structures that arise Of course to hint the above is to hint an initial answer At least in our bio sphere the cumulative coevolution of autonomous agents has in the past four billion years achieved precisely such a diversification Cells and organisms have achieved astonishingly ramified and subtle detectors that measure sources of energy plus coupling devices that extract work and use it to build rough copies of themselves Thus metabolism in cells is a coupled web of chemical reactions among simple complex and very complex organic molecules ranging from carbon dioxide to proteins comprised of thousands of amino acids The catalytic sites of enzymes possess high stereospecificity that is shape specificity for the transition state of the substrate s of the reaction Such reactions may release energy or may couple the release of energy to the endergonic synthesis of other molecular species Cells are replete with equally stunning receptor complexes decorating their surfaces Binding a ligand to a receptor may trigger a complicated sequence of reactions leading to the synthesis of hundreds of dierent molecular species But the high specificity of molecular interactions in a cell are precise examples of the coming into existence of richly nuanced structurally and procedurally complex molecular processes that measure and detect sources of energy and couple those sources to the carrying out of further chemical electrical or mechanical work A coevolving biosphere achieves exactly the emergence of such self constructing diversifying organization Whether galaxies planetary stellar or other systems do as well is an open question Again one senses the possibility of a statistical theory of the propagation and self elaboration of such linked structure transformational systems Work Let s turn to the concept of work I have detailed evidence that work is a puzzling concept I am deeply proud that Phil Anderson one of the world s best physicists is a close friend One day over an Indian dinner in Santa Fe thinking of the issues above and of more to come I said Phil the concept of work is rather puzzling Phil cracked o a bit of chapati scooped some chutney onto it paused and said Yes Thank God I m not a physicist so I was glad to get through that hurdle I shall proceed in steps First let s just consider the physicist s definition of work as the integral of force acting through distance The physicist has in mind something like Newton s laws where F MA And we understand distance plain old nonrelativistic distance So the work done is given by just adding up little increments of the force acting on a mass and accelerating it through a distance But already there is a bit of a puzzle In any specific case of work done some direction of application of force is specified in three dimensional space some actual direction of motion of the mass is specified in three dimensional space and some actual coupling mechanism is in place such that the force does act on the mass and get it to accelerate in that direction How does the specification of a direction come to be How does the organization of the specific case of work come about Now in normal physics say college level physics all these specifications occur at the beginning of the problem in the statement of the initial and boundary conditions The billiard balls are in such and such positions on the billiard table the cue is moved with such and such velocity and strikes a given ball in such and such a position with such and such velocity Now given Newton s calculus let us compute the forward trajectory of the balls on the table So the puzzle of where the initial and boundary conditions come from and the specific coupling of cue to ball are hidden in the initial and boundary conditions of the problem and in how Newton taught us to calculate In short the problem of the organization of the process in any specific case of work is hidden from view in the initial and boundary conditions of the usual statement of the physical problem In eect this choice is the choice of the relevant degrees of freedom which is equivalent to the choice of the boundary conditions versus the dynamical variables of the system But an evolving biosphere is all about the coming into existence in the universe of the complex diversifying ever changing initial and boundary conditions that constitute coevolving autonomous agents with their changing organization of capacities to measure and detect energy sources and couple those detected energy sources to systems that sometimes extract work We will return in a subsequent chapter to ask if it makes sense to try to finitely prestate the initial and boundary conditions of a biosphere I will claim that it does not I will claim that we cannot finitely prespecify the configuration space of a biosphere hence we cannot finitely prespecify the initial and boundary conditions of a biosphere If so then we cannot hide the issue of the organization of work processes in a statement of the initial and boundary conditions of the biosphere We must grapple with the emergence and propagation of organization itself on its own terms If so perhaps there is something amiss with the way Newton taught us to do science in his spectacular career Let s take a second look at work Consider an isolated thermodynamic system At equilibrium the system can do no work But let the system be partitioned into two or more domains say by a membrane Ah then one part of the system can do work on the other part For example if the average pressure in one part is higher than in another part the first part can bulge the membrane into the second part Where did the membrane come from How does the system come to be partitioned Is this just another initial or boundary condition hiding from view the question Where did this organization of stu and process come from Meanwhile note that the concept of work appears to require that the universe be partitioned Regions of the universe must be distinguished by what or whom such that work manages to happen Now I come to a definition I like due to Atkins in his book on the second law Atkins defines work as the constrained release of energy Work is says Atkins a thing Think about the cylinder and piston in the idealized Carnot cycle with the hot compressed working gas in the chamber What are the constraints The cylinder and the piston the position of the piston in the cylinder the grease between the piston and cylinder are constraints These roughly suce together with the hot gas compressed in the cylinder head for work to happen as the hot gas expands and pushes on the piston Where did these constraints come from In actual fact in the current case some human or some machine made by a human did work to construct the cylinder the piston assemble the piston into the cylinder with working gas and grease in place Then more work was done to compress and heat the gas by pushing on the piston from the outside So we appear to come to an interesting circle It sometimes takes work to construct constraints and it takes constraints to get work Does it always take work to construct constraints No as we will soon see Does it often take work to construct constraints Yes In those cases the work done to construct constraints is in fact another coupling of spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes But this is just what we are suggesting must occur in autonomous agents In the universe as a whole exploding from the big bang into this vast diversity are many of the constraints on the release of energy that have formed due to a linking of spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes Yes What might this be about I ll say it again The universe is full of sources of energy Nonequilibrium processes and structures of increasing diversity and complexity arise that constitute sources of energy and that measure detect and capture those sources of energy build new structures that constitute constraints on the release of energy and hence drive nonspontaneous processes to create more such diversifying and novel processes structures and energy sources I find it delightful that we hardly have the concepts to state these issues surely we have as yet no coherent theory for this burgeoning of process and structure Whatever it is a biosphere does it It was quite barren in Nebraska wherever Nebraska was four billion years ago Not now Propagating Work By way of whimsy consider Figures a and b Figure a exhibits a cannon clearly marked cannon firing a cannonball clearly marked cannonball that hits the ground some distance away creating a hole clearly marked hole In addition to creating the hole the cannonball now embedded in the bottom of the hole has created hot dirt marked hot dirt In Figure b I exhibit a device a Rube Goldberg device in fact of which I am extremely proud The same cannon as in a now fires the same cannonball which however hits a paddle on a sturdy paddle wheel I constructed Once struck by the cannonball the paddle wheel is set to spinning Prior to my firing the cannonball I contrived to tie one end of a red rope around the axle of the paddle wheel and a modest size bucket to the other end of the rope Thereafter I dropped the bucket down the well The water filled bucket has now rested silent and waiting until the cannonball strikes the paddle wheel whereupon the wheel spins the red rope winds up pulling the water filled bucket up the well up against the axle which tilts the bucket over you will have to imagine this part and pours the water into a long funnel that slopes down from the wellhead toward my bean field When the water from the bucket arrives at the bottom of the water pipe it pushes against a flap valve thereby opening the valve and watering my bean field You can see why I might be proud of my machine What is the dierence between a and b The point of the cannon and cannonball in the two figures is to emphasize that there is the same total input of energy into the two cases The explosion of gunpowder is evidently the same as is the flight of the cannonball Obviously in Figure a most of the energy carried by the cannonball is dissipated as heat random molecular motions induced in the particles of dirt Indeed I might have sent the cannonball bouncing along a large steel plate rather than hitting mere dirt In the case of the plate no hole would have formed and hot steel would have been the consequence In Figure b my Rube Goldberg device achieves a rudimentary or sophisticated depending upon pride of inventorship propagation of macroscopic consequences in the universe Note the linking of spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes the arc of the cannonball imparting energy that winds the wheel and lifts the water filled bucket Note also the constraints everywhere present that coordinate the flow of energy into the specific if slightly comical unfolding of events In fact my fine Rube Goldberg device does not quite demonstrate all I might wish it to show for it does not demonstrate the use of the release of energy to actually construct constraints However an ingenious modification of my device of which I am also deeply proud demonstrates constraint construction Let us modify the device such that the cannonball after hitting the paddle wheel and setting it spinning is deflected downward onto the ground and digs a long shallow groove in the dirt with high sides due to the displaced dirt Let this groove lead to the bean field and guide the water spilled from the bucket such that it flows to water the bean field The digging of the groove in the dirt by the cannonball constitutes the construction of constraints on the release of energy for the water flowing down the gravitational potential to the bean field is just such a constrained release of energy My Rube Goldberg device propagates work it succeeds in creating a sequence of coordinated macroscopic changes in the physical universe I do not know a formal definition of propagating work so in the absence of anything better I will point at what I mean by Figure b We have some clues in place now Work is the constrained release of energy Often constraints themselves are the consequence of work I have tentatively defined an autonomous agent as a self reproducing system that carries out at least one work cycle In turn this led us to note that an autonomous agent is necessarily a nonequilibrium device therefore that it stores energy To think about work cycles we have been driven to ask about Maxwell s demon measurement when and why measurement pays thence to what features of a nonequilibrium system are measured such that they constitute a source of energy thence to how couplings arise that capture the energy source thence to work and constraints and now to propagating work due to the occurrence of linked sets of constraints and flows of matter and energy A next step is to realize that the only well known autonomous agents namely real cells such as yeast bacteria your cells and mine do actually carry out linked processes in which spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes are coupled to build constraints on the release of energy The energy once released constitutes work that propagates to carry out more work building more constraints on the release of energy which when released constitutes work that propagates further Figure is a schematic representation of a cell The figure shows a typical bilipid membrane small organic molecules of dierent species A B C D E F G a transmembrane channel and so forth Now in fact your cell typically does thermodynamic work to build up lipids from smaller molecular species Typically the energy is supplied by breakdown of ATP to ADP or similar exergonic reactions in metabolism But lipids have the capacity to fall to a low energy structure which is precisely a bilipid layer As noted in chapter lipids are molecules with a hydrophobic tail and a hydrophilic head The hydrophilic head as the name implies likes water Consequently in an aqueous environment lipids will tend to form bilipid membranes with the hydrophilic heads facing the aqueous medium and the hydrophobic tails buried next to one another away from the water In fact if you take some cholesterol or another lipid or lipidlike molecule and dissolve it in water bilayer membrane vesicles form spontaneously that are called liposomes So your cells do thermodynamic work to make lipids which spontaneously form a low energy structure the membrane But the membrane constitutes constraints Watch A and B are small organic molecular species and are capable of three hypothetical reactions A and B can undergo a two substrate two product reaction to form C and D A and B can ligate to form a single product E Or A and B can undergo a dierent two substrate two product reaction to form F and G Naturally each of these three reaction pathways from A and B passes along its own reaction coordinates through its own dierent transition state Because each of the three transition states has a higher energy than does A and B or the products C and D or E or F and G the transition state energy is a potential energy barrier slowing the reaction from A and B down any of the three reaction pathways Let A and B dissolve in the bilipid membrane from the aqueous interior of the cell Once this happens immersion of A and B in the membrane environment alters the vibrational rotational and translational motions or degrees of freedom of A and B But in turn these alterations in the motions of A and B alter the heights of the transition state energies along each of the three reaction pathways from A and B to C and D or to E or to F and G But the alteration in potential energy heights along the three dierent reaction pathways from A and B is precisely the alteration of the constraints on these reactions The barrier heights together with the even higher energy barriers that provide the walls of the reaction coordinates along which the reaction proceeds constitute the constraints So in fact the cell has actually done thermodynamic work to construct constraints on the release of chemical energy stored in A and B that might be released to form C and D or E or F and G Moreover the cell does thermodynamic work utilizing ATP degradation to ADP to link amino acids together into a protein enzyme The enzyme diuses to the A and B laden region of the membrane and binds stereospecifically to the transition state leading from A and B to the products C and D By binding the transition state complex of this reaction pathway the enzyme lowers the potential barrier for the A B C D reaction and the chemical energy stored in A B is released to form C D Thus the cell does work both to construct constraints and to modify those constraints by raising or lowering potential barriers such that chemical energy is released More the released energy can and often does propagate to do work constructing more constraints Thus the product D may itself diuse to a transmembrane channel and bind to the channel giving up some energy stored in its structure by an internal rotation to a lower energy state and thereby both bind the channel and add energy to the channel to open the channel such that calcium ions can enter the cell A spontaneous and a nonspontaneous process are coupled Work propagates in cells and often does so by the construction of constraints on the release of energy which when released constitutes work that propagates to construct more constraints on the release of energy Records Let s turn to the concept of a record As we saw Zurek has led us to the point in thinking about Maxwell s demon at which a record of measurements might be kept and used later to extract work In the case of a nonequilibrium system in principle measurements of a system might pay in the sense that more work could be extracted from the system which now becomes a provider of energy than need be used to record and later erase the measurement Interestingly the erasure cost suggests that autonomous agents must be finitely displaced from equilibrium to aord the finite erasure cost and still reproduce In addition of course rapid reproduction requires finite displacement from equilibrium We have many colloquial notions of a record I want to try a tentative technical definition Records are correlated macroscopic states that identify sources of energy that can be tapped to extract work Thus we are to think of records as recording measurements that identify the source s of energy in the measured system which may then be tapped to do work My example of the wind through the window in Maxwell s two chambered gas system is a case in point We have good grounds from Zurek s work to believe that the complexity of the record is related to the reduction in entropy of the measured system Notice some interesting features of records First a useless feature of a nonequilibrium system with respect to extraction of work may be recorded Second errors may be made in the record of a useful feature of a nonequilibrium system from which work can be extracted Third the record may go out of date so that work can no longer be extracted by reference to the record Fourth the record may be erased and may be updated All the above features arise in a coevolving microbial community Indeed all sorts of signaling pathways in cells record and report energy sources and coordinate cellular activities within and between cells in a community Mutation recombination and selection are means to update the recording devices with respect to changing sources of energy opportunity and danger Again we see that cells in a community have the embodied know how to get on with making a living We are struggling with a circle of concepts involving work constraint constraint construction propagating work measurements couplings energy records matter processes events information and organization It has been said by many that we do not understand the linking of matter energy and information The circle above points at something we must trouble ourselves to understand and I suspect that the triad of matter energy and information is insucient Rather the missing something concerns organization While we have it seems adequate concepts of matter energy entropy and information we lack a coherent concept of organization its emergence and self constructing propagation and self elaboration If we do not yet understand organization fully we can at least think about what happens in autonomous agents such as real cells A real cell a real molecular autonomous agent does in fact carry out self reproduction In addition it carries out one or more real work cycles linking spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes It does in fact measure detect and record sources of energy and does do work to construct constraints on the release of energy which when released in the constrained way propagates to do more work often constructing further constraints on the release of energy or doing work by driving further nonspontaneous processes Cells do achieve propagating work The work propagating in a cell achieves a closure in a set of propagating work tasks such that the cell literally constructs a rough copy of itself In a later chapter I will return to discussing tasks which turn out on a Darwinian analysis to be a subset of the causal consequences of the release of energy at a point and time in the system For the moment I want to focus on the concept of a closure in a set of propagating work tasks We know what it means to cook dinner eat dinner and clean up afterward A coordinated set of activities is carried out that completes the events concerning preparing eating and cleaning up after dinner The notion of completing a set of tasks is not mystical So we can straightforwardly state that a cell completes a set of propagating work tasks such that it builds a copy of itself by linking spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes in constrained ways Thus a molecular autonomous agent achieves two dierent closures First it achieves a catalytic closure all the reactions that must be catalyzed are catalyzed by molecular members of the system Second it achieves a closure in a set of propagating work tasks by which it completes the construction of a rough copy of itself Cells achieve this work task closure nor is there anything nonobjective about this truth Notice that the closure in catalytic and work tasks cannot be defined locally No single reaction no single linking of spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes typically suces to specify the closures we are describing These closures are typically collective properties of the entire autonomous agent in its environment In fact cells achieve closure in some wider range of tasks by which they propagate their organization Thus cells carry out measurements and record them all the time The bacterium swimming upstream in a glucose gradient was my initial candidate example of an autonomous agent The bacterium does so by molecular sensors that measure glucose a molecular motor with a stator and a rotor that can rotate in either direction and a flagellum that can rotate in two directions causing swimming in one direction and tumbling in the other The cell achieves swimming upstream by continuing to swim if the glucose concentration is rising and tumbling then swimming in a random direction if not Autonomous agents achieve catalytic and propagating work task closures by which they build copies of themselves The myriad sensors receptors ligands enzymes and linked reactions of metabolism are the structure and dynamic of the reproducing cellular autonomous agent that constitutes the measurement detection recording and search for useful energy sources to link into its ongoing construction of itself The propagating closure of events and organization that is a cell or colony of cells an autonomous agent or a collection of autonomous agents is not matter alone energy alone entropy alone nor the negation of entropy Shannon s information alone The propagating closure that is an autonomous agent appears to be a new physical concept that we have not known how to see before What we can here see is the natural embodiment of organization We have I suggest no coherent concept of organization We have tended to think that the concept of entropy of order and disorder in statistical arrangements of states of aairs is the proper and central concept of organization But I claim that entropy is not yet adequate Nowhere does entropy cover the topics we have discussed the closure of catalysis and propagating work tasks creating the complete whole that is an autonomous agent coevolving in a biosphere This closure of tasks measurements records and linkages that propagates macroscopic work seems to constitute at least an ostensive definition a definition by example of organization Although my discussion above about organization is still preliminary the basic points seem correct A coevolving mixed microbial community that existed some three billion years ago diversifying and coevolving via Darwinian mutation recombination and natural selection did in fact measure and detect and create an increasing variety of energy sources did in fact couple those detected energy sources into work cycles and other activities and did in fact build a biosphere Self constructing organization did and does propagate Our globe is covered by this propagating organization life and its consequences Indeed it seems important to wonder which conditions in a nonequilibrium universe would allow such propagating organization to proliferate A biosphere does it of course One can imagine a watery planet with small sail boats sails and tillers trimmed to tack forever on a left tack forever circling the everywhere ocean Here the sails and tiller match the windmill and its vane orienting the fan to capture the transient wind and extract mechanical work Intuitively it seems unlikely that such a planet of nonliving complex entities could have arisen spontaneously since the big bang Just as intuitively all we have discussed seems sucient for the ongoing diversification of propagating organization the Darwinian processes of natural selection and random variation the coevolutionary construction of vastly complex autonomous agent cell systems that continually evolve ever novel measurements of novel sources of energy recordings of those energy sources couplings to those sources constraint construction and the linking of exergonic and endergonic reactions that builds the diversifying biosphere The biosphere is the most rambunctiously complex integrated diversifying milling buzzing busyness in the universe that we know Perhaps there are other biospheres and they too hum in persistent diversification Autonomous agents appear to be a sucient condition for application of this concept of organization and a biosphere comprised of coevolving autonomous agents appears to be a sucient condition for propagating self constructing organization It remains an open question whether other structures and processes in the universe that may not be autonomous agents say lifeless galaxies stars the giant molecular clouds in galaxies or lifeless planets can generate and propagate diversifying organization as radically well as do biospheres I close this chapter by asking whether there is a way to mathematize the concept of an autonomous agent and through it the concept of propagating organization The answer is perhaps category theory I am honored to note in memorium that my friend and colleague Robert Rosen first explored some of these issues and some others of those touched upon here in his book Life Itself Category theory is a branch of mathematics concerning mappings Consider a domain and a range A mapping takes points in the domain to points in the range The mappings might be or many or many For example in a mapping each point in the domain maps to a single corresponding point in the range The domain and range can be discrete sets or continuous An interesting feature of categories is that a category can have the property that the mapping from the domain to the range is specified by the category itself in a recursive way the elements of the range determine the mapping from the domain to the range This recursive specification comes close to an autocatalytic set We need merely think of a set of molecular species in the domain and a set of molecular species in the range the mapping from domain to range is just the set of reactions that transform the initial substrate molecules in the domain to the product molecules in the range Now an autocatalytic set has the property that certain product molecules in the range namely the products that are also catalysts choose the reactions that are catalyzed from the substrates to the products hence choose the specific mapping from the domain to the range Thus an autocatalytic set can be thought of as this kind of recursive category The category theory image is at least a start with respect to catalytic closure Perhaps some enhanced category theory that includes closures of work tasks measurements and records as well as catalysis is part of what an adequate formalization of autonomous agent may be It is too early to say On the other hand I am not persuaded that category theory will suce In category theory it seems necessary to specify ahead of time all the possible domains and ranges and mappings under consideration I will suggest in a later chapter when we consider the evolution of novelties that there is no finite prespecification for the work tasks measurements records and catalytic tasks that might constitute autonomous agents In short I will argue that we cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere Whether an incapacity to prestate the configuration space of a biosphere genuinely precludes the use of category theory to mathematize the concepts of autonomous agents and propagating organization is an open question We have arrived at this An autonomous agent or a collection of them in an environment is a nonequilibrium system that propagates some new union of matter energy constraint construction measurement record information and work It is a new organization of process and events The collective behaviors of coevolving autonomous agents have over the past four billion years constructed a biosphere If life is common the elaboration of biospheres in the universe is rife The propagating union of work cum record cum measurement cum constraint construction the propagation of organization unfolding and diversifying exhibits the very creativity of the universe We are entitled to ask whether there may be general laws governing such nonequilibrium self constructive processes in biospheres and the universe as a whole I return to candidate general laws in chapters and
