 Three Cheers for Negative Campaigning Last week the Republican Leadership Council began running an ad that accused Steve Forbes of tearing down his opponents Wednesday Forbes fired back at the RLC with his own ad George W Bush says he wants a positive campaign Then why are Bush s liberal supporters running this negative ad attacking Steve Forbes A Forbes press release added Forbes Calls on Bush To Cease Politics of Personal Destruction Against Senator John McCain Meanwhile in the Democratic race Bill Bradley and Al Gore denounced each other s personal attacks and scare tactics Everyone is accusing everyone else of negative campaigning but nobody s answering the question that ought to come first What s wrong with negative campaigning Politicians and journalists pretend to explain this through a series of platitudes none of which are convincing 1 Be nice The RLC says it s trying to keep the GOP civil by pressuring Forbes to maintain a high tenor Its ad says Forbes needs to be taught If he doesn t have anything nice to say don t say anything at all Bradley gets a similar lecture from the Washington Post which accuses him of forsaking his pledge of chivalry by criticizing Gore s modest proposals for health care and gun control But what s so great about being nice or chivalrous Bradley thinks Gore is running on a timid platform designed to avoid political heat rather than to solve problems Forbes thinks the same of Bush If they re right the worst thing they can do for the country is to refrain from pointing out these failings McCain is accused of getting angry Bradley is much nicer When Gore claimed that Bradley s health care plan would bust the budget Bradley s spokeswoman answered Bill Bradley reserves his anger for the Americans without health insurance Bradley might have served those Americans better by directing his anger at Gore s misrepresentations But that would have been impolite 2 Stay clean The Post asks whether Bradley s criticisms of Gore s policies belie Bradley s professed rectitude his desire to be super clean and his image as an above the fray politician But where s the virtue in such aloofness Why should Bush get credit for keeping his hands clean and preserving his above the fray image if as Forbes alleges he has achieved this by letting the RLC do his dirty work And shouldn t Bradley get credit by comparison for striding into the fray and leveling his charges squarely at Gore 3 Be positive Bradley accuses Gore of offering attacks instead of a positive vision based on the calculation that it s easier to campaign against your opponent than for yourself Last week former Labor Secretary Robert Reich illustrated Bradley s more positive style While endorsing Bradley Reich insisted I won t say anything negative about the vice president What nonsense Anyone who endorses Bradley is saying something negative about Gore Since elections are comparative the difference between campaigning against your opponent and campaigning for yourself is semantic When Bradley says he s the candidate of big ideas and poll free principles he s being just as negative as Gore 4 Don t hurt others Journalists and wounded politicians love to equate criticism with assault Bradley says Gore s strategy is attack attack attack attack Forbes and the RLC decry each other s attack ads The New York Times says Forbes became known as a slash and burn politician for his commercials that lacerated Bob Dole in 1996 Bush mimicking Bill Clinton calls questions about whether he used cocaine the politics of personal destruction The Los Angeles Times accuses Bush s rivals of Bush bashing at this week s GOP debate in Arizona A McCain adviser fears Bush will get out the blowtorch and go after McCain All this sounds awful until you remember that nobody has been attacked bashed slashed burned blowtorched lacerated or destroyed Forbes leveled charges about Dole s record that could be and were rebutted The bashing Bush endured in the Arizona debate consisted largely of the observation that he had failed to show up Clinton turned out to be guilty of the central allegation in the Lewinsky scandal and Bush still hasn t answered the cocaine questions The truth often hurts It ought to be told anyway 5 Don t get personal Bradley has alluded several times to the 1996 Clinton Gore fund raising scandal Monday he cited published reports that Clinton administration Cabinet officers are being asked to arrange their travel schedules and public announcements so the vice president can finance his political campaign with taxpayer dollars when his funds run out Rather than rebut Bradley s allegation Gore huffed Personal attacks have no place in a campaign But isn t a campaign exactly the place where Gore should be confronted if he has indeed abused his position and violated the spirit of the campaign finance laws How can one person point out another s misdeeds without getting personal 6 Don t throw the first punch The New York Times thinks Bradley crossed a moral line this week when he began to criticize Gore on his own initiative rather than in response to attacks by Gore Bradley agrees that a candidate who has been criticized is uniquely entitled to respond in kind Running a positive campaign he argues doesn t mean I m going to stand like this forever and let someone slap my face But why does it matter whether Gore criticized Bradley first This is a debate not a fistfight If Bradley can explain why Gore would be an inferior president why should he have to wait to say so 7 Don t be insensitive Last week Bradley began airing an ad in which a woman says When I was pregnant with my second child Bill Bradley proposed a law that women be allowed to stay in the hospital for 48 hours Thanks to Sen Bradley my daughter is alive today When critics pointed out that Bradley s bill hadn t passed until after the woman s daughter was born Bradley accused the Gore campaign of displaying a real insensitivity by challenging the ad I am appalled that people would attack a woman who obviously lived through tremendous trauma has her views and expressed them said Bradley Never mind whether the ad is true To raise that question is to attack a woman 8 Don t scare people Gore has been telling blacks and Hispanics that Bradley s health care plan would kill Medicaid and provide no sufficient alternative Bradley calls this a scare tactic and says it s wrong that Gore is using race or ethnicity to try to scare people But if Gore s assertion is true what s wrong with conveying it to the ethnic groups most broadly affected Gore isn t calling Bradley a racist He s making an economic argument which Bradley can rebut and has rebutted The scare tactic charge which implies that Gore is using fear and rhetoric to bypass rational scrutiny is itself a scare tactic 9 Don t be divisive Bradley accuses Gore of poisoning the atmosphere with divisiveness I believe the public wants solutions that work not attacks that divide says Bradley Similarly Bush boasts that he s a uniter not a divider while the RLC complains that Forbes by criticizing Dole in 1996 caused fighting within the Republican Party that was divisive and not inclusive Imagine that fighting and divisiveness in an election What s wrong with informing certain segments of the electorate that your opponent is using the feel good rhetoric of solutions to pull a fast one at their expense If you re lying shame on you But if you re telling the truth why does it matter that your message is divisive 10 Don t hurt your party The RLC ad says Forbes hurt the Republican Party in 1996 and will help the Democrats in 2000 by criticizing his GOP rivals Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson vows to blow the whistle on candidates who tear down other Republicans Meanwhile Bradley is taking heat for questioning Gore s campaign finance practices In the good old days says the Post Bradley was more restrained declining to comment on the Clinton administration s fund raising behavior But why should Bradley shut up about the Clinton Gore fund raising scandal And why should Forbes shut up about what he regards as a Republican betrayal of conservatism Does loyalty to party supersede loyalty to country 11 Don t alienate voters Bradley frets that Gore s attacks on his health care plan will alienate the public and foster skepticism toward big programs NOW President Patricia Ireland warns the candidates that negative campaigning depresses the women s vote On the bright side Forbes campaign manager says this year Forbes is much less likely to run the same kind of negative spots that he did against Dole because four years ago he was a message candidate Now he believes he can be president But what s wrong with alienating voters from bad programs and bad candidates And isn t it nobler to deliver a depressingly true message than to shade the truth so you can get elected 12 Don t practice politics as usual Just as Forbes accused Dole of playing sneaky Washington politics in 1996 Bradley now castigates Gore for resorting to the typical Washington politics of slash and burn Gore is delighted to reciprocate There goes Sen Bradley again acting like a typical politician launching negative attacks on Al Gore a Gore spokesman crowed last week How does the fact that such attacks are typical clarify whether Gore is right about Bradley or vice versa Never mind All you need to know is that negative campaigning is the oldest trick in the book And the next oldest trick if you can t answer the charge is to whine about negative campaigning
