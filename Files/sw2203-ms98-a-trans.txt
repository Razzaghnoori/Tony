fruit you know yeah and it s hard to come you know the i don t know the fruit we get down here at the store has just been pretty lousy lately so yeah it s like yeah it s same around here too makes you wonder what they re what they re sending out i mean yeah where is it yeah like where does all the good stuff go yeah where is it i know they have to grow some of it because certainly they re not using it for juices and stuff i mean they use the junk for that it makes me wonder gosh if they re using junk for that what are we getting here uh huh yeah what are we yeah yeah hat s in the juice this is what i would put in juice oh really yeah i i ve gotten to where i won t even buy juices anymore because i m afraid of what s in there uh huh that s so true yeah well i don t do very much gardening i i would like to but i just don t have the time to do it or keep it up right i i try to get into some flowers and stuff i just uh huh yeah uh huh placed an order again for some bulbs and waiting for those to show up and uh huh yeah we got some bulbs but we haven t gotten them planted uh my husband s uh been growing uh lots of flowers from seed and um hum all of his own plants under a a light he put out in the garage to help keep them you know alive and get them a good start so we hope we have a lot of flowers this year so um hum um hum well i started yeah i started some about uh about a month ago and had them in little planters all over the house and my cats got to them and that was the end of them uh huh uh huh oh yeah we don t have any pets so yeah these these two cats it s hard to keep anything around yeah like my husband says we just have two kids it s hard to keep them out of things let alone pets yeah really these these these cats are just about as bad as kids i ve got one that can even open the cupboard doors and get in inside the cabinets oh no that s no fun yeah she s yeah she s got it wired now she jumps up on the counter and stands up reaches up for the door and pulls on it till it opens and then jumps up in there uh huh oh you ought to you ought to send a videotape that and send it into America s Home Videos yeah i know i i ve been seeing all these weird things they send in and uh i says gee i ought to get that that s right you you know that could be worth ten thousand dollars so um you never know kitty cat what do you think about being a star i ll buy you buy you lots of cat food with that that s right yeah that s right you can buy lots of cat food with that so or hire somebody to do your lawn so then you don t have to worry about it we have a big problem around here with insect problems you know fire ants and yeah you believe that oh yeah yeah so that s it gets expensive around here to do a lawn because you re always you know buying the fertilizer and the you know the bug killers and weed killers yeah yeah and all that stuff well i m i m pretty easy as far as yard work i ll go out there and cut it and i ll edge it if it dies it dies uh huh uh huh oh my husband just has to have it green has to be green it s no i uh i ll take my chances with it course now where i where i m at now i don t have to worry about the lawn because they got somebody that comes in and does it oh that s nice it is nice he matter of fact he was here today it was the first really warm weather we ve had and he came out and cut the yard and trimmed the hedges and all that uh huh yeah well we had a real warm day today and all the neighbors were out you know in their front yards doing their yard and yeah i guess i i guess we re really into spring now it s a perfect day for it yeah i i love spring i just love it i don t i like winter yeah i like i like cold dreary weather do you oh not me oh i don t i i grew up in Wyoming and it s cold enough there for me so yeah i it it s hum um no i gosh i got use to it when i lived in South Dakota uh huh it s just great up there oh do you have a lot of that kind of weather there in North Carolina no this is another one of those winters that wasn t oh winter that wasn t huh yeah it s i don t know i was expecting snow and all of that i maybe i should have moved over to the mountains instead of here but uh they didn t get a lot of snow in the mountains either uh huh yeah no talking to my folks in Wyoming they uh they were still hoping they get some more because if they don t they re going to have water problems this summer so yeah yeah that was a big problem was i was in South Dakota course we d had plenty of snow but uh every once in a while they they get shorted on the snow and the water supply starts drying up uh huh that s right they need the the snow for the water so because those i mean those those summers up there are brutal uh huh terrible you get those uh Chinook winds coming across the prairies and golly it s uh it s unbelievable the extremes in weather up there but i enjoy it gosh i and just dries everything out uh huh i i hadn t been anywhere where the weather was so tremendously great for me oh well it sounds like you need to move back there yeah i i ve been thinking about it only problem is i i would be very limited in any job opportunities out there yeah that s that s it we d like to be closer to family but limits the job your welcome Brittany yeah yeah the uh i mean there s still basically ranchers and farmers up there you know yeah but it s hard to make it being a rancher or farmer yeah i what Brittany okay good hunting that s all right that s just another one wanting to get in on the conversation oh yeah she she was wanting oh i meant to ask you can you hear me okay on this thing okay good it s a it s a it s a headset so it makes it a little easier uh huh yeah i hear you just fine oh yeah You doing lots of these calls you work for TI oh oh okay my husband works for T I oh no i don t i m a i m a student uh oh oh okay my just about everybody i ve talked to has been with TI i guess that s i guess that s the same with your husband uh huh yeah he works for them right now he s been there almost six years now yeah i had a i had an interesting call about uh two weeks ago um came in late too it was like eleven thirty at night and i answered it and oh wow i said yeah well you know i m not doing anything so i took it and the subject was discuss the weather and find out how your weather compares to the caller s weather i had one of those too it was a weather phone call yeah well the interesting thing was this was from another student at state right across town from me oh oh well you really kind of have the same kind of weather i mean yeah gosh what s you weather like you know well i don t know let me look out my window yeah it s kind of foggy tonight i had one from somebody that was up in New York and they were out of their house because of the ice storm yeah they were living with families that would take them in and oh that ice storm yeah yeah i talked to somebody about two weeks ago from Rochester and same story they uh they really had a lot of damage from uh ice and all that uh huh yeah yeah they couldn t even be in the house because they had no power and everything yeah yeah that s pretty bad yeah and here we were i mean i talked to her we had just gotten over a ninety four degree day so we really had a lot to compare so oh oh sounds like that young one wants some attention oh i she s talking to my husband i think so yeah so oh oh that s okay yeah Rochester s a nice town too they they said that they had had uh lots of pretty little parks and stuff up there that just been wiped out oh yeah that s what she said they they were going to have the governor was going to try to have it declared a disaster area that s too bad because i yeah yeah that s too bad because i i i had a an old an ex professor who uh is up there in Rochester and he told me about how much they had worked to beautify the place uh huh and all these beautiful gardens and parks and all that good stuff now it s all been wiped out it s a shame oh yeah it really is oh well such is life yeah it seems like you work hard and something else goes wrong nothing s forever i guess yeah exactly it s like me with gardens i can go out there and plant a garden and then watch the bugs and oh that s what it is with us too you just like get so frustrated you get something about ready ripe and there goes the bugs and uh huh you get a get a frost or something hail that s even better uh huh or hail yeah it just you know yeah my the only the only thing i ever accomplished i i mean i ve had gardens for a long long time when i was a kid i started uh i had some squash and tomatoes and watermelons uh huh and i grew a thirty four and a half pound watermelon yeah absolutely tasteless had no taste whatsoever uh huh oh my word oh was it we trew grew cantaloupe last year and that s how they were just tasteless you couldn t even eat them uh huh cantaloupe s difficult to grow and get taste out of them i mean they re they re easy enough they ll grow easy enough but you can t get any flavor yeah uh huh yeah yeah you have to be so careful when you buy at the stores yeah i i buy them every once in a while and and i bought one and it was you know blah uh huh and then i said well i ll try another one so this is several weeks later and i bought another one and it was just as sweet and wonderful but you never know uh huh yeah nope you don t it s hard to pick them uh huh it s like oranges and everything else but anyway oh yeah the oranges here look disgusting so oh yeah they look terrible here i look at those thing i say i wouldn t buy them not even to squeeze for orange juice uh so uh huh yeah they re all
