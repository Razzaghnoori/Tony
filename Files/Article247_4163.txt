 The Paper Chase Dear David It has been 20 years since you left home and we have been talking intermittently since then by telephone You have gone far geographically and I was going to say careerwise but as your mother is a strict grammarian I knew she would wince at that wise ending We used to say that when you were an undergraduate at Harvard you were one of the few students who knew that one should not begin a sentence with Hopefully and more why one should not do so In any event meander as I am wont to do you have gone far in your chosen field I used to say that your sister and yourself both Ph D s in early modern European history would go to any lengths to find a subject for which your father could not give you a bibliography Now we are talking by e mail an unfamiliar venue for me Your mother has a computer I don t though I use hers fitfully This is in spite of the fact that I taught courses on technology for more than 10 years before I retired and have even written books on the new technology But as you know I always consider myself in the position of the young man drafted into the Israeli navy who when asked if he knew how to swim replied I know the theory of it My interest is in theory because I am interested in the logic of technology and how that unfolds And as a sociologist I have long argued for the priority of theory since theory allows one to take a finding or a proposition out of one context and apply these to different and even unfamiliar ones I stand by the old saw If something works in practice does it also work in theory As you can see I am seeking to avoid getting started over this unfamiliar route and talking as we are supposed to do about the day s events as they unfold in the morning newspaper But the morning newspaper for me is something I read at a distance so to speak Though we have now lived in Cambridge for almost 30 years I do not see the Boston Globe our local paper Each morning before we get up the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are delivered to our door I have always found the Globe to be somewhat dull and parochial and I would know what was playing at the New York nabes rather than in Boston But now the Times has a Boston edition with the Boston weather and television schedule and the Tab a community paper with special town editions such as Cambridge tells me what is playing at the local movie houses We get the Times because it is the Times and has all the news that it sees fit to print And having recently been in Paris and London we appreciate the Times all the more for its detailed news coverage as against all the nattering about Tony and Gordon and Alistair Campbell that fills to overflowing the quality London papers And the Wall Street Journal for its intriguing front page news stories and the succinct presentation of business and political news in two columns even though the editorial page makes me gnash my teeth I would prefer the London Financial Times which is the only decent newspaper in England and I mean decent in many senses since they do not show tits and bums or print gossip about the marital adventures of cabinet members but it is too expensive to get here daily Besides we read the Economist regularly such a prize for its fine and lucid prose and its comprehensive worldwide coverage that fills the gaps left by the Times and the Wall Street Journal All right to the news But I have gone on nattering for the asked for page and a half so why don t you begin Love Dad
