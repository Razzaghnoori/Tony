 Reich Writes on Rauch Rauch Writes on Reich Jonathan Rauch s article in last week s Slate Robert Reich Quote Doctor suggesting that the former secretary of labor fantasized large chunks of his recent memoir has stirred a pleasing fuss in Washington Of course like all journalists we at Slate when we must make troubling accusations against public figures do so more in sorrow than in anger It truly disappoints us when a man or a woman in public life fails to meet our standards of morality literary ethics or oral hygiene Like all journalists we would like nothing better than to be denied all such opportunities for indignation That said however we cannot deny a small frisson of excitement when the opportunity comes along No doubt we are the only journalists who suffer from this spiritual flaw Robert Reich has asked us to publish an article by him in reply to Jonathan Rauch Ordinarily this is tricky territory for a publication People are entitled to reply when criticized But usually that means a short letter If you allow everyone who comes under criticism in your pages to reply at equal or greater length you won t have any room left to criticize anyone new should that become tragically necessary In the vastness of cyberspace however these considerations do not apply with the same force Therefore in a special supplement to E Mail to the Editors we publish Reich s reply to Rauch We also publish Rauch s reply to Reich And if Slate columnist Robert Wright or Limbaugh Rush or Robert Rauschenberg wishes to write about Reich on Rauch or Rauch on Reich we ll find room for them too Cut to the Chase Forget aesthetic judgments the key overlooked question about film today is Why don t the plots make any sense To address this critical gap we inaugurate an occasional column called Plot Holes to be posted Tuesdays or Wednesdays which will analyze movies exclusively from the perspective of narrative logic The author screenwriter Stephen Harrigan will also try to explain where plot holes come from Aesthetic judgments will continue to be rendered by our regular film critic David Edelstein We were only kidding when we said you should forget them Forestry Byproducts Two

known for Liar s Poker his devastating 1990 memoir of the time he spent working as an investment banker Liar s Poker is largely credited with transforming the investment banking profession from the

been claimed by another Web site Krugman s column will henceforth be known as The Dismal Science a phrase too famous to be ownable by anyone except possibly British essayist Thomas Carlyle 1795 1881 who coined it Carlyle was inspired if that s the word by the writings of Thomas Malthus who predicted that population growth would always outpace economic growth keeping most people in perpetual poverty That was more than two centuries ago and remarkably it is the last time any economist made a faulty prediction Geoffrey Chaucer Live on Slate Followers of our weekly poem may have noticed that Slate poetry editor and U S poet laureate Robert Pinsky chose to run something by Ben Jonson last week It may seem remarkable that Jonson who died in 1637 is still submitting poems to magazines But poetry is a rough business requiring eternal optimism about the possibility of publication even if gloom is considered the Proper Poetical Stance on most other issues In the spirit of equal opportunity Pinsky has decided to cease discriminating against poets who suffer the ultimate disability of being deceased Preference will be given to poetry of the past that is especially suitable for reading aloud RealAudio has not yet perfected sound recordings from beyond the grave so poems by dead poets will be read by Pinsky himself rather than by the author Living poets will continue to be eligible as well The poem posted June 4 for example is by Joyce Carol Oates who is very much alive and reads it herself Look for Emily Dickinson s forthcoming poem All I Really Need to Know in Poetry I Learned at Microsoft Michael Kinsley
