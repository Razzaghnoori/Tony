 our community doesn t really have any organized recycling drive where do you live i live in San Antonio San Antonio um hum well um i live in Garland and we re just beginning to we we just built a real big recycling center um hum that recycles everything imaginable but as far as that um trash pick up and stuff that a lot of the communities are doing um hum they re testing that so they re really not full full force into it but they re trying so we re attempting it but i wish we could do more yeah there s there s been no emphasis on recycling at all in San Antonio i used to work for the power company here and there was discussion for a while about uh building a garbage burning um hum uh electric generation plant but it just wasn t cost effective at the time oh and there s there s a little recycling trucks and things throughout the city but there isn t any um advertising campaign there s just not any push to recycle i recycle my newspapers and uh aluminum my aluminum stuff huh right that s what i do but uh they make it as hard as possible it s not very convenient to do right where they put centers and stuff like that um hum yeah well we have those um which i think is one of the best things is those cash for cans i don t know if you all have those around yes and i really like that because that makes it real convenient because they re in almost every shopping center and you can just stop by now everything else like the trash um paper and plastic and stuff you still have to go to the centers but um hum but for aluminum that s real nice and i started doing that at work um i put out a a trash can and and for people to put their aluminum cans in um hum and that s really helped a lot i mean everybody s pitched in and yeah you know it doesn t bother them to walk little bit farther put their aluminum in a can rather than just throwing it in their trash can yeah so i really i really like that but people are really concerned it s just that sometimes it s not the right people yeah which is really really sad because i wish we would do more at work we started um all the recycling stuff they re really trying i think what started it at work was that planet earth thing we had last year yes and um that really started a lot of stuff off but you know sometimes it dwindles down yeah where i work now we recycle all the computer paper that s good but that s about the extent of it well that s well at least your trying something yeah yeah it s just yeah it would be nice if it could be more and i m sure that the uh driving factor for recycling the computer paper is that we get paid to do so we sell the paper back to oh do you really the uh to a paper manufacturing company well that s a neat idea well it it defrays the cost of buying the paper i think i not by much but it does defray it some uh huh right enough to make it worth our while to have several bins through out the building sure well that s that s really good i mean at least they re trying yeah yeah i know a lot of companies that waste so much that i m even trying you know that was one thing we noticed last week that we had some new people move into our building and you know the nice cardboard boxes that you move packing boxes yes and they were just used one time and thrown in the dumpster and i thought i don t understand this you know we re trying to cut cost and everything like that and and recycle and all that stuff and yeah and here we are wasting and i don t understand sometimes the way the thinking the logic behind it well the last time uh someone moved offices in my building and uh the uh properties people came in with all with the good cardboard boxes not the cheap ones of course and packed everything up and moved them and left them lying around uh huh i i took several home because i m moving pretty soon and they re good boxes and they were just going to throw them away that s exactly what i did that s exactly what i did exactly because i didn t want to waste that and it s hard enough to find good packing boxes though yeah hum um right and and these boxes are you can unfold them right so you know there they don t take up much storage space that s exactly right well that s very good yeah yeah i i felt a little guilty about taking the boxes for about two seconds until i realized they would be thrown away so uh right right i found about and i thought well i was doing them a favor by taking them i found about five um about nine of them that had not even been folded into boxes yeah that were in the dumpsters and i was like oh gosh so many people need so many people go to the grocery store and stuff and get those boxes um hum when you know these are perfect so yeah the ones at the grocery store half the time they ve pulled the lid off so you can t use it anyway right right right those and the real sturdy boxes that copy room paper comes in with the nice lids those get thrown away uh huh right and i am constantly scouting out the copy room for those boxes that s exactly what i do those are those are perfect boxes to put files in uh huh they re good for storage and stuff like that that s what i do with a lot of my daughter s things is i ll store her you know like her out dated cards or out of out of season clothes in them and they re just perfect what what i ve done in the past i don t have any now but i would buy some cheap wallpaper from somewhere and cover those nice boxes with the lids uh huh and you can stack them up and and leave them out and put things in them even and they look just as good that s a smart idea um hum yeah i think i have to that that s really cute yeah well you know it s cheaper than going and buying the kind at Target that are all ready with the little design on them or whatever and now they they re the exact same thing um hum that s all they are they just made them look fancy yep save you some money and you re recycling yes well that s neat well do you all have um we have places that um pay for paper to recycle i know you do yours at work but for newspaper um hum but ours are real hard to find that s the one thing that really discourages me i saved paper you know i recycle paper but they it s almost like they don t want the paper because they don t pay at all i mean they re real hard to find the places that pay and that s really discouraging i mean i just go ahead and take it to the the regular place where it s you know they just accept it uh huh but they um i think they should you know they want people to recycle i think it s a you know like the aluminum you know it gets people to uh doing it you know you might you don t have to pay them a lot yeah i live near a WalMart and there s a big uh uh huge dumpster looking thing sitting out front in fact i think there s two of them that have several openings um hum and it s for recycling and they have aluminum and newspaper and plastic and some other category i don t maybe there s two for aluminum uh uh huh and you don t get paid but it s real convenient just to chunk the newspapers in there well that s that s good yeah that s good i the one thing i don t like about the newspaper also is um like at work we have two different trash cans at your desk you have one for paper and one for just your normal trash but in uh um hum in the paper one you have to separate you have to make sure you don t throw away any of the slick paper like magazines um hum you can t throw any of that away and you can t throw certain file type things away and i just think it s such a hassle it seems like it would be be easy to take it all i don t know of course i don t know all that about um hum recycling so probably it is a hassle but i do get tired of having to separate paper you know we um hum it gets to be uh i guess you have to make it a habit i mean you have to get so used to doing it that it s a habit right right we had uh a write up in our paper uh this last time at work about um they come and empty your trash every other day they do your normal trash and every other day they do your recycling trash um hum and somebody was writing in complaining that the people had um dumped all the trash in the same bin oh and when they were questioned about it they said well we re running late or we didn t have time to do those bins or something and that s real discouraging thinking you re sitting there working to separate it and then they and someone else isn t going to take the time to put it in two separate bags right right so they re they re really trying to start keeping an eye out for those you know talking to the people again about you know separate them because that is discouraging when you when you do that it was hard to get used to those two different trash cans um hum but luckily that ll all get straightened out and and they ll they ll start separating them because i don t mind doing that i feel like i m doing uh doing something for the community when i m doing that yeah but anyway well i ve enjoyed talking to you you too well thank you bye bye bye
