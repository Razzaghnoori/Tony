 Amazon Con Amazon com calls itself Earth s Biggest Bookstore and the media online and off have accepted that claim uncritically The toast of cyberspace is the Economist s accurate characterization of this Internet book ordering service which was founded in 1995 Time rated Amazon one of the 10 best Web sites of 1996 The Washington Post called Amazon a megawarehouse The New Yorker pointedly compared Amazon s claimed inventory of 1 1 million books with the mere 170 000 titles available at a Barnes Noble superstore In fact Amazon s megawarehouse in downtown Seattle contains just 200 or so titles Any other book must be obtained from a wholesale distributor or the publisher This is exactly what any traditional bookstore does when it doesn t have a book in stock The difference is that traditional bookstores start out with a lot more than 200 titles in stock Earth s Biggest Bookstore More like Earth s Smallest How does Amazon get the books it doesn t have in its warehouse According to Jennifer Cast vice president for marketing it uses several big distributors including the Ingram Book Co one of the largest and sometimes it calls the book s publisher directly She says that in certain cases it has even called the authors And how do less advanced booksellers do it At Politics and Prose a small local bookstore in northwest Washington D C one employee told us We try Ingram first and then call the publishers At a northern Virginia outlet of Borders Books the superstore chain an employee said It s no secret we try Ingram If all that fails I guess we go to the publishers So why shop at Amazon Cast gives four reasons One we have a lower price Two we have a better selection Three we re probably much faster And we re definitely more convenient We conducted an experiment to test these claims On Dec 16 we ordered the same two books from Amazon Politics and Prose and Borders All three were told to gift wrap and ship each book as soon as possible One book was Scott Turow s newest novel The Laws of Our Fathers the kind of best seller that even Amazon actually has in stock The other was an obscure psychology text even Borders wouldn t carry chosen from the catalog of the State University of New York Press called The Ego and the Dynamic Ground A Transpersonal Theory of Human Development second edition by Michael Washburn How did the three booksellers compare by Amazon s own standards Selection We ve covered that If you define inventory as any book a store can special order for you as Amazon does then the selection is identical at almost every halfway decent bookstore in America At Amazon you can browse through all the titles and authors and through some descriptive material by computer At a conventional bookstore you can pick up and leaf through actual books but fewer of them Convenience For ordering Politics and Prose was by far the easiest Heidi answered the phone on the first ring She was chatty but professional The store had many many many copies of the Turow on hand and she promised to send one out right away tomorrow morning at the very very latest When asked about the psych text Heidi apologized sorry sorry for not carrying it and offered to order it Estimated time of arrival four weeks She took a name address credit card number The entire phone call took 2 minutes and 38 seconds Borders was slightly less helpful When asked to send the Turow Drew groaned at our lowbrow taste but quickly said he d send it the next day The second selection s obscurity didn t cheer him up Ugh can t do you the Washburn book When pressed he said it could be ordered but would probably take two weeks Borders system is that when the book arrives you are sent a postcard asking you to come to the store and pick it up Can t they just send the book We prefer people do it this way Drew said but then he gave in and agreed to send it Total phone time 9 minutes and 32 seconds After calling the stores we connected to Amazon using Netscape Navigator 3 0 and a 28 800 baud modem Amazon has a special page dedicated to the Turow book complete with a picture of the cover and some unenlightening amateur commentaries from other Amazon users The psychology text not surprisingly was listed with no description and no commentaries Amazon said it would take one to two weeks to order After clicking your purchases into a shopping cart you are directed to a secure Netscape server that will encrypt your credit card information After this is done you are told Finalizing Your Order Is Easy Nothing could be further from the truth Lower down in the verbiage Amazon concedes Though we have tried hard to make this form easy to use we know that it can be quite confusing the first time Amazon users have to page through screen after screen of details about shipping charges refund rules and disclaimers about availability and pricing Then you are told to allow between three and seven days for delivery after your book leaves Amazon s warehouse Upgrading to Next Day Air does NOT their emphasis mean you ll get your order the next day Total online time from when we accessed Amazon s home page to when we completed the book order 37 minutes and 12 seconds It would be shorter once you got the hang of it Speed Turow s book arrived in three days from both Borders and Politics and Prose in plenty of time before Christmas Politics and Prose wrapped the book perfectly Borders wrapped it attractively but left the receipt inside The Turow didn t arrive from Amazon until Dec 27 more than a week after the conventional stores Furthermore the wrapping looked as if it had been done by a fourth grader However it came bundled with the obscure psych book which still hadn t arrived from the conventional stores as of New Year s Day Eleven days for that one is pretty good As for the Turow we had checked a box asking that each book be sent separately as soon as possible so either Amazon ignored these instructions or it really needed the full 11 days to get the Turow to us By the way let s not forget that in a conventional bookstore you can also if you choose acquire books in zero days by going to the store in the pre Internet sense of actually going there Price Amazon and Borders both offered the Turow for 30 percent off the list price Politics and Prose offered 20 percent off All three wanted full price for the psych book Amazon charges 3 plus 95 cents per book for standard shipping Borders charged 4 to ship the Turow and Politics and Prose 3 50 Amazon charges 2 a book for gift wrapping which is free at the other two stores but Amazon accidentally charged only 2 for wrapping both books Finally stores with local outlets must charge sales tax on shipped items Amazon does not unless you live in Washington state In all the Turow cost 23 72 from Borders and 26 30 from Politics and Prose If Amazon had sent it separately as we had instructed it would have cost 24 82 Gift wrapped and sent separately the psych text would cost more at Amazon than at the other two unwrapped and bundled about the same There is a third category of books besides those that everyone has in stock and those that no one has in stock These are books that Amazon doesn t have in stock but a normal bookstore does Barnes Noble s 170 000 strong inventory sniffed at by The New Yorker is a good example This category is Amazon s greatest weakness It includes hardly obscure current books that aren t best sellers like The New Our Bodies Ourselves produced by the Boston Women s Heath Book Collective Borders had three copies on the premises Amazon needs two to three days to obtain this one plus between three and seven days to send it to you Likewise for a classic like the Penguin paperback of Charles Dickens A Tale of Two Cities which any Borders or Barnes Noble will have on hand Then there s a semiobscure book such as Robert Marr Wright s Dodge City The Cowboy Capital and the Great Southwest This hardcover book about cowboys is on Borders shelves At Amazon it is listed as a special order which means it might be available to be shipped in four to six weeks but our computer informs us PLEASE NOTE that it might not be available at all Publishers do not always notify the book community about changes in the availability of their titles Not available So much for the pretense that Amazon s list of 1 1 million books makes it Earth s Biggest Bookstore in even a metaphorical sense
