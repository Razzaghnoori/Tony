 Background The advent of microarray technology has enabled scientists to investigate biological questions in a more global fashion Instead of studying genes individually the expression of thousands of genes can be analyzed simultaneously using probes attached to the surface of a microscope slide 1 2 3 4 5 6 The cDNA microarray represents a popular array type in which double stranded PCR products amplified from expressed sequence tag EST clones are spotted onto glass slides 7 8 allowing gene expression profiles to be determined with high reproducibility and efficiency However construction of cDNA microarrays presents a number of challenges largely related to costs associated with clone validation tracking and maintenance The laborious and problematic tracking of cDNA clones and PCR amplicons may lead to 10 30 misidentification of clones 6 For all practical purposes sequence verification of array elements is an ongoing necessity Other limitations of cDNA microarrays are their difficulty because of cross hybridization in discriminating expression patterns of homologous genes alternative splice variants and antisense RNAs Alternatively microarrays can be composed of short oligonucleotides 25 bases synthesized directly onto a solid matrix using photolithographic technology Affymetrix 2 9 or constructed from long oligonucleotides 55 70 bases spotted onto glass slides 10 11 12 To mimic the Affymetrix design of freely moving probes tethered at one end onto a solid support in house manufactured or commercially available long oligonucleotides are modified by the addition of a 5 amino group for covalent attachment onto pre activated glass slides 5 10 This oligonucleotide design strategy has been widely viewed as a prerequisite for accurate gene expression measurements However there is no clear evidence that other covalent attachments do not form With oligonucleotide arrays problems related to clone tracking handling of glycerol stocks and failed PCR amplifications are avoided The completion of numerous microbial plant and eukaryotic genomes as well as extensive EST data provides sufficient sequence information to design unique oligonucleotides capable of distinguishing homologous genes and alternative splice variants As such oligonucleotide probes have an added flexibility over PCR amplicons Comprehensive studies comparing the Affymetrix approach with cDNA arrays have only recently appeared in the literature 13 14 Studies comparing long oligonucleotides to cDNA arrays have not been as forthcoming In the only example to date 5 amino modified 50 mers representing prokaryotic genes were compared to corresponding PCR amplicons 12 Analysis of the hybridization signals derived from these two probe types while providing important insights pertaining to sensitivity and specificity were limited in scope total of eight genes and design interrogation was carried out with complementary targets derived from synthetic RNA as opposed to cellular RNA A drawback to using modified oligonucleotides is the significant cost associated with the addition of the 5 amino linker An alternative strategy is to utilize unmodified oligonucleotides spotted onto glass slides where attachment is believed to be primarily ionic in nature 11 However a comparison of this approach to standard cDNA arrays has yet to be provided It is imperative that comparisons be carried out on all probe types in the light of conflicting reports regarding the correlation between Affymetrix and cDNA array based expression measurements 13 14 Whereas one study shows both approaches correctly identifying 16 out of 17 differentially regulated genes 13 a second study found a correlation of r 0 328 between matched results from the same two platforms 14 Discordant results were not resolved in the latter study Here we test the performance of unmodified 70 mers printed alongside PCR amplicons Using this unique study design both probe types can be simultaneously interrogated with a complex target composed of both cellular and synthetic RNA Results Optimal attachment parameters for 70 mers and PCR amplicons on the same slide The success of microarray assays requires stable binding and retention of probes throughout the entire printing blocking hybridization washing process Oligonucleotides were spotted alongside PCR amplicons onto TeleChem SuperAmine aminated slides and immobilized by ultraviolet UV cross linking To determine the optimal UV cross linking energy required for efficient oligonucleotide immobilization a series of spotted arrays from the same printing session were subjected to increasing UV energy 70 150 250 and 450 mJ cm 2 Deposition and retention of the probe onto aminated slides were assessed by staining with Vistra Green solution and subsequent fluorescence scanning at 532 nm and hybridization with Cy labeled targets derived from rat brain and heart RNA Using these two methods optimal retention of both oligonucleotide and PCR amplicon probes was determined to occur between 250 and 450 mJ cm 2as described below Directly following probe deposition UV cross linking at 250 mJ cm 2and Vistra Green staining the measured fluorescence intensity from oligonucleotide probes was typically higher than PCR amplicons Figure 1a The efficiency of the oligonucleotide immobilization strategy was tested by stringently washing the same slide overnight in 0 2 SDS at 42 C SSC absent in wash solution to remove Vistra Green and any loosely bound nucleic acids restained with Vistra Green and scanned Figure 1b There was essentially no change in the average median intensity values for either the oligonucleotide or PCR amplicon probes after incubation with detergent Figure 1c These results show that immobilization of unmodified 70 mer oligonucleotides to SuperAmine aminated slides by high UV cross linking energy is sufficient and comparable to PCR amplicons Clearly our oligonucleotide immobilization protocol should be sufficient to sustain routine microarray hybridization and wash procedures which are much less stringent than the overnight wash at 42 C with 0 2 SDS and no salt The importance of titrating UV cross linking energy for oligonucleotide immobilization is exemplified by a series of spotted arrays hybridized with Cy labeled targets derived from rat brain and heart RNA As seen in Figure 2 there was an increase in the appearance of hybridized spots and signal intensity as the energy of cross linking was increased At lower cross linking energies for example 70 and 150 mJ cm 2 it is apparent that oligonucleotide probes were not sufficiently attached to the surface of aminated slides In contrast PCR amplicons are sufficiently immobilized onto the aminated surface of glass slides at these intensities 15 On the basis of the hybridization experiments and in agreement with Vistra Green staining results optimal attachment of 70 mer oligonucleotides occurred between 250 and 450 mJ cm 2 An improvement in oligonucleotide retention onto aminated slides was not seen at intensities higher than 450 mJ cm 2 data not shown Of interest was the finding that different slide chemistries that is poly L lysine aldehyde aminosilane epoxide had different UV cross linking titration curves for optimal attachment of 70 mer oligonucleotides and increasing the cross linking intensity in some slide types actually decreased apparent probe deposition data not shown Even more surprising was the observation that slides with the same or similar slide chemistry from different vendors exhibited marked differences in the optimal UV cross linking energy for probe attachment Sensitivity of unmodified 70 mers on aminated slides Defining assay sensitivity is important as the ability to measure gene expression changes is desired not only for moderate and abundant mRNAs but also for rare transcripts One method for assessing the sensitivity of microarray assays is to use exogenous spiking controls These controls also help to identify systematic problems associated with target labeling slide hybridization and scanning For this purpose we developed a set of 10 Arabidopsis control cDNA plasmids Each of the 10 plasmids was used to synthesize cRNA in vitro cRNAs were quantitated and differentially spiked into heart and brain RNA samples at specific copy numbers based on the following assumptions 360 000 mRNA transcripts per cell 20 pg total RNA per cell and 1 pg mRNA transcript per cell hence 100 spike copies cell would be equivalent to about 0 14 ng spike transcript in 10 g total RNA 12 To normalize our array data we spiked five of the ten control cRNAs into the Cy3 and Cy5 labeling reactions at equal copy number ranging from 40 to 100 copies per cell The remaining five control cRNAs were spiked into the labeling reactions at concentrations ranging from 1 to 300 copies per cell We printed Arabidopsis 70 mers and PCR amplicons across six different sectors in order to measure intra slide variability Inter slide variability was evaluated across independent hybridizations and target labeling Figures 3aand 3bcompare the intra and inter slide variation of oligonucleotides to discern twofold changes in Arabidopsis targets Similar results were obtained for the detection of targets spiked at threefold ratios data not shown These data show that our oligonucleotide array platform was able to detect two and threefold changes in transcript number at a sensitivity of one to two copies per cell Comparing the sensitivity of oligonucleotide probes to PCR amplicons indicates that the two probe types perform equally well at consistently detecting twofold changes in rare transcript levels Figure 3c Arabidopsis probe elements serve as excellent negative controls when exogenous cRNA is not added to the labeling reaction In the absence of cRNA spiking cross hybridization of Cy labeled rat targets to Arabidopsis probe elements was negligible data not shown Concordance between probe types when measuring differential gene expression in biological samples To compare the accuracy of unmodified oligonucleotide arrays to conventional cDNA arrays we hybridized slides containing both probe types with equal amounts of Cy labeled target derived from rat heart and brain RNA Hybridization to 36 out of 38 antisense strand oligonucleotide probes was negligible to nonexistent under our incubation and wash protocols data not shown A positive hybridization signal threefold above background was obtained for 65 of the 75 sense strand oligonucleotide probes interrogated with labeled target Accordingly each of the corresponding 65 PCR amplicon probes had a positive hybridization signal threefold above background As the intra slide variation was low average standard deviation SD was around 0 07 and around 0 11 for log 2 transformed ratio values derived from PCR amplicon and 70 mer spots respectively ratio values from replicate spots within a slide were averaged Averaged ratios derived from independent experiments were plotted and regression analysis was performed to assess reproducibility of arrays containing oligonucleotide targets Figure 4a A similar comparison was performed on PCR amplicon probes Figure 4b Both oligonucleotide and PCR amplicon probes showed high reproducibility between replicate experiments that is different slides hybridized with targets generated from different batches of RNA samples with correlation coefficients r of 0 95 and 0 96 respectively Next we compared oligonucleotide derived ratios with those obtained from PCR amplicon probes Figure 4c A correlation coefficient of r 0 80 p 0 05 and a slope close to unity were obtained indicating that unmodified oligonucleotide and PCR amplicon probes gave comparable expression ratios Moreover there was agreement in the calculated average coefficient of variation 13 4 for the expression ratios computed from the two probe types Validation of microarray results with real time PCR Of the 65 represented genes that had a positive hybridization signal with both the oligonucleotide and PCR amplicon probe types 60 were in agreement of each other Figure 4c Real time PCR was used to test the accuracy of our microarray results Figure 5a Six genes exhibiting a range of expression differences in heart and brain were selected for validation These included histone H4 which did not exhibit differential expression in the two tissues log 2 ratio around 0 cytochrome oxidase IV kynurenine 3 hydroxylase serine threonine protein kinase and 14 3 3 protein gamma which exhibited two to threefold differences log 2 ratio 1 to 1 6 and desmin which was around 32 fold differentially expressed between the two tissues log 2 ratio approximately 5 In each case the expression ratios derived from oligonucleotide and PCR amplicon probes were in accord with real time PCR results There were five notable discrepancies between the two probe types as compared to the 60 that were in agreement A discrepancy was defined as a change equal to or greater than twofold measured with one probe type and no change or a change in the opposite direction measured with the other probe type The resolution of the discordant results for inositol 1 4 5 trisphosphate receptor H ATPase branched aminotransferase and epoxide hydrolase is presented in Figure 5b In each case real time PCR results were in agreement with the PCR amplicon derived expression ratios Interestingly each of the oligonucleotide derived expression ratios erroneously suggested that these genes were not differentially expressed in heart and brain tissues Effect of oligonucleotide probe concentration on signal intensity In our initial experiments unmodified 70 mer oligonucleotides were printed onto TeleChem slides at a relatively high concentration of 50 M By comparison the concentration for printing 5 amino linker modified 50 mer oligonucleotides was 20 m 12 To test the performance of unmodified oligonucleotides at lower printing concentrations seven rat 70 mer oligonucleotides were serially diluted from 50 25 12 5 to 6 25 M Each oligonucleotide was chosen on the basis of earlier microarray results showing that both oligonucleotide and cDNA probes could hybridize to heart and brain targets and that hybridization intensities associated with the seven different gene elements varied by at least an order in magnitude The selected probes included SCG10 and desmin which were highly differentially expressed in brain and heart respectively 14 3 3 gamma and profilin which were expressed at around twofold higher levels in brain and heart respectively and histone H4 14 3 3 theta and thymosin beta 4 which showed no difference in expression between brain and heart All diluted oligonucleotides along with their corresponding undiluted PCR amplicons approximately 100 200 nM were spotted onto the array at least four times A stained representative section of an array printed with different starting concentrations of oligonucleotides and a single concentration of the corresponding PCR amplicons is depicted in Figure 6 As the starting oligonucleotide concentration was decreased from 50 m to 6 25 M eightfold dilution DNA fluorescence decreased on average twofold for the oligonucleotides data not shown This suggests that the capacity of the slides to retain 70 mer oligonucleotides in a typical 100 m diameter spot approached saturation at the higher concentrations Arrays containing diluted oligonucleotides were hybridized with labeled targets derived from brain and heart RNA as before The median Cy3 and Cy5 hybridization intensities minus background were summed for each oligonucleotide concentration along with their corresponding cDNA probe Figure 7a A comparison of oligonucleotide and cDNA probes clearly demonstrates that the longer probe length of the latter does not necessarily translate to greater hybridization signal intensities While the PCR amplicon probes for 14 3 3 protein theta desmin and thymosin beta 4 generated higher signals than the corresponding oligonucleotide elements the converse was observed for 14 3 3 protein gamma histone H4 and profilin Moreover there was no correlation r 0 06 p 0 05 between the hybridization signal intensities acquired from PCR amplicon probes and the corresponding oligonucleotide probes Of interest was the apparent inverse correlation between oligonucleotide concentration and hybridization intensity Hybridization intensities actually increased with decreasing oligonucleotide concentration for 14 3 3 protein gamma desmin SCG10 and to a lesser extent thymosin beta 4 Figure 7a For the oligonucleotides corresponding to differentially expressed genes for example SCG10 desmin 14 3 3 gamma profilin the log 2 ratios from four independent hybridizations including flip dye experiments were averaged and plotted in Figure 7b The calculated ratios were highly reproducible and similar across the entire concentration range tested This suggests that an oligonucleotide concentration as low as 6 25 M is sufficient for accurate determination of relative expression differences As the absolute levels of these four transcripts in rat heart and brain are not known with certainty we repeated these experiments with known concentrations of synthetic Arabidopsis cRNA that were differentially spiked into rat heart and brain RNA Six Arabidopsis oligonucleotides were accordingly diluted and printed onto aminated slides to test their ability to discriminate twofold differences in synthetic cRNA concentrations ranging from 10 to 300 copies per cell Our data clearly show that an Arabidopsis oligonucleotide probe concentration as low as 6 25 M was sufficient to accurately determine twofold differences in cRNA species at a ratio of 20 10 copies per cell Figure 8 Discussion In the study reported here we systematically compared the performance of unmodified 70 mer oligonucleotides to traditional PCR amplicons both probe types printed and UV cross linked onto glass slides coated with primary amine groups Direct comparisons are best accomplished when both probes are printed alongside each other allowing for simultaneous interrogation with a complex target Hence analysis is not confounded by uneven aminosilane coating in different batches of slides inconsistencies in the array resulting from different print sessions differences in day to day label incorporation or variations in day to day hybridization and wash procedures A correlation coefficient r of 0 80 was obtained from our analysis indicating that the two probe types gave comparable expression ratios One variable that was not controlled for in our study was the number of cross links per DNA molecule Given a constant UV exposure many more cross links per molecule of cDNA probe are presumably formed compared to the shorter oligonucleotide probe It is possible that the correlation coefficient was not higher as a result of the differential reaction of the two probe types to UV irradiation We designed our arrays to contain 75 different probes corresponding to mammalian signal transduction genes with a wide range of expression levels In heart versus brain comparisons oligonucleotide probes like their cDNA probe counterparts could reproducibly discern differences in mRNA populations as low as twofold namely 14 3 3 protein gamma and as high as around 90 fold namely creatine kinase Hence the dynamic range of unmodified oligonucleotides is at least two orders of magnitude in fold change measurements In the course of our work we generated a resource of 10 Arabidopsis spiking control cRNAs along with their corresponding 70 mer oligonucleotide and PCR amplicon probes As part of our quality control procedures all microarray assays routinely incorporate the spiking controls These reagents will allow the microarray user to add specific concentrations of known transcripts into a complex mix of mammalian target RNA in order to assess for example hybridization kinetics intra slide variability inter slide variability sensitivity and effectiveness of normalization algorithms On the basis of experiments with the spiking controls unmodified oligonucleotides can be used to detect twofold changes in transcript number at a level of 2 20 mRNA copies per cell It is important to note that our protocol for generating first strand cDNA target involves the use of random primers At the outset the Arabidopsis cRNAs were engineered to contain a 3 poly A tail Hence alternative protocols using oligo dT to prime mRNA for the synthesis of labeled target 15 16 can still take advantage of our spiking control set In our initial assessment of cDNA and 70 mer oligonucleotide probe types the latter was printed at a concentration of 50 M Even at a printing concentration as low as 6 M oligonucleotide probes were capable of discerning twofold expression differences in complex cellular RNA mixtures and in synthetic spiked cRNAs In fact decreasing the oligonucleotide printing concentration from 50 to 6 M had the effect of increasing the hybridization signal around two to sixfold for a number of the probes Figure 7a The reason is unclear but it is possible that high density packing of an oligonucleotide probe within the confines of a small spot interferes with fluorescence emission of the target or hybridization efficiency Alternatively the higher spotting concentrations may favor cross linking of the oligonucleotide probes to each other following UV irradiation In either case this phenomenon appears to be sequence dependent as not all probes exhibited this behavior The present study also demonstrates that longer probes are not necessarily associated with higher hybridization signals as the hybridization signals from half of the 70 mer oligonucleotide probes were actually higher than or equivalent to their corresponding PCR amplicons which have an average length of 1 kilobase kb Taken together the combination of unmodified oligonucleotides and low printing concentrations has resulted in an approximately 16 fold reduction in reagent costs An issue not evaluated in the present study but one that has significant cost saving potential is the effect of reducing the length of unmodified oligonucleotides on microarray sensitivity Clearly this is an area for future investigation Of the five discordant results found between oligonucleotide and cDNA arrays real time PCR data validated the accuracy of the cDNA probe type in every case Figure 5b It seems likely that a failure in oligonucleotide probe design was responsible for the discordant data Analysis of the discordant oligonucleotide sequences that is inositol 1 4 5 trisphosphate receptor H ATPase branched aminotransferase and epoxide hydrolase did not reveal any obvious secondary structure that might interfere with hybridization Treatment of spotted arrays with UV light is thought to induce free radical based coupling between thymidine residues on the oligonucleotide and carbon atoms on the alkyl amine groups of coated glass slides Todd Martinsky TeleChem International personal communication The T content of concordant and discordant oligonucleotides was similar with average values of 26 and 29 respectively suggesting that UV cross linking was not preferentially disrupting hybridization specificity of discordant 70 mers Moreover there was a lack of correlation r 0 03 p 0 05 between T content of the oligonucleotides and corresponding hybridization signal intensities Of interest however was the finding that the discordant oligonucleotides had an average GC content of 57 compared to the concordant oligonucleotide average of 50 Accordingly the hybridization signal associated with the discordant oligonucleotides was around two to threefold higher than the concordant oligonucleotides suggesting that non specific Cy labeled targets were cross hybridizing with the discordant oligonucleotides This possibility is clearly illustrated for the H ATPase gene Figure 9 Within the H ATPase 70 mer sequence is a stretch of 20 contiguous nucleotides perfectly matching a region in the tumor endothelial marker 8 mRNA It has been shown previously that 15 contiguous nucleotides are sufficient for cross hybridization of non target species 12 There are two important points to note First the PCR amplicon for H ATPase also contains the same 20 contiguous nucleotides Figure 9 Regardless of this this particular probe was still able to distinguish differential expression of the H ATPase gene in heart and brain tissue We postulate that a large fraction of H ATPase specfic Cy labeled targets which on average should be 100 200 nucleotides long were available for hybridization to complementary sequences found on the longer PCR amplicon probe but absent on the shorter 70 mer probe for example sequences downstream of the 70 mer Second tumor endothelial marker 8 mRNA was identified in mouse The orthologous rat mRNA has not been cloned yet which is reflected by the more than 2 5 million mouse EST sequences present in dbEST compared to only 351 827 ESTs for the rat On the basis of BLAST searches of human and mouse sequences contiguous non target sequences could also be identified in the discordant oligonucleotides for inositol 1 4 5 trisphosphate receptor branched amino transferase and epoxide hydrolase Hence future oligonucleotide design considerations should include an analysis of mouse and human sequences because of the relatively small number of available rat sequence for expressed transcripts In addition the synthesis of redundant probe sets for example two 70 mers per gene might be warranted to help decrease false negatives by an order of magnitude The mechanism of the adherence of unmodified oligonucleotides to glass slides has been addressed 11 Attachment involves noncovalent interactions such as electrostatic interactions where the negatively charged phosphate backbone of the oligonucleotide is attracted to the positively charged surface of the glass slide for example a surface containing protonated alkyl amines Whereas noncovalent interactions appear to be the predominant mechanism for oligonucleotide attachment covalent linkage is likely to have an important supplementary role in UV irradiated microarrays This seems plausible as our stringent overnight washes in strong detergent did not appreciably detach unmodified oligonucleotides from the slide surface The importance of UV cross linking cannot be overemphasized Under irradiation of cDNA arrays is known to cause insufficient binding of DNA and over irradiation results in over nicking of DNA samples 17 A further complicating factor is our finding that oligonucleotides printed onto different slide chemistries or slides with similar chemistries from different vendors will have very different optimal UV titration curves In our hands optimal UV cross linking occurred at 450 and 70 mJ cm 2for oligonucleotides printed onto TeleChem SuperAmine and Corning GAP II slides respectively For TeleChem slides under irradiation 70 150 mJ cm 2 causes insufficient oligonucleotide attachment For Corning slides over irradiation 150 450 mJ cm 2 results in a decrease in the hybridization signal that may reflect excessive covalent attachment of oligonucleotides As UV cross linking may adversely affect oligonucleotide accessibility to labeled target during hybridization we cannot discount the possibility that alternative attachment strategies for example 5 amino modified oligonucleotides may provide greater sensitivity and specificity This issue needs to be explored in the future In summary the present study provides evidence that the performance of unmodified 70 mer oligonucleotides is comparable to cDNAs printed on glass slides Optimal conditions were identified for oligonucleotide attachment and hybridization wash conditions resulting in high assay sensitivity and reproducibility Our results show that unmodified oligonucleotides can provide an accurate reproducible and cost effective means to measure gene expression profiles Of interest is the fact that our hybridizations were successfully carried out on slides that simultaneously contained both PCR amplicons and oligonucleotides Hence future microarrays can be constructed in a modular fashion with oligonucleotide based elements being added to existing PCR amplicons as more genomic sequence information is gathered in the absence of readily available cDNA clones Lastly our findings have broader implications suggesting that the combination of expression measurements across different platforms for example Affymetrix and cDNA arrays unmodified long oligonucleotides and cDNA arrays within a single analysis maybe feasible 18 Materials and
