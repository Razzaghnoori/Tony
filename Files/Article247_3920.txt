 Dawn Powell s Second Act Dear Tim I m thrilled to speak to the undisputed president of the Dawn Powell Fan Club We Dawnites ought to stick together Sometimes a passion for Powell can still feel eccentric like owning a hairless cat When a first edition Powell book goes up for auction on eBay the same three or four of us bid I ve often thought we should join forces for some harmless price fixing Yet I ve been told that thanks to you the Dawn Powell revival is officially a done deal her place at the table of American Lit all nicely set So my first question for you How solid is the Powell revival I certainly didn t see anyone reading her at the beach this summer Nor do many of my academic colleagues know her work They ve heard of her though Which one should I read they ask suspiciously One of Powell s problems as she griped herself is that she wrote so damn much She failed to produce one Perfect Little Novel a Great Gatsby that college folk could plunk on their Greatest Books lists Her New York novels give Jane Austen a run for her money as social satire but then there are the elegaic Ohio books For a while reviewers tried to belittle her as a regionalist la Flannery O Connor Though Powell is incomparable we re already mired in comparisons You must get mighty sick of the Dorothy Parker analogy People like the idea of Dotty and Dawn mud wrestling for the title of Funniest Woman But I notice that in both the biography and your prefaces you shy away from any feminist indignation on Powell s behalf May I do so just for a sec The otherwise admiring review of the Letters in the daily New York Times complained that Powell failed to speak enough about the two world wars she lived through Same dart that was aimed at Austen who penned slight little parlor room dramas instead of addressing the Napoleonic Wars Aside from the fact that the accusation is simply false Powell strikes me as downright visionary about politics portraying the American involvement in World War II in A Time To Be Born as a media war much like Grenada it is yet another time honored way of dismissing women s work Ammo as we all know is important Diapers and dresses are not How I love listening to Powell mock Hemingway in her Letters There was the writers conference with Mr H pumping all the way up from Bimini on water wings Ernest gave a good speech if that s what you like and his sum total was war was pretty nice and a lot better than sitting around a hot hall and writers ought to all go to war and get killed and if they didn t they were a big sissy Then he went over to the Stork Club followed by a pack of foxes Hemingway lived large for the PR men But our myths of woman artists encourage living real small Sylvia Plath as we all know had to wake up at dawn to pen her verse before tending to her babies Austen O Connor and Emily Dickinson were classic spinsters They were so sexless they were as good as men Or as Powell would put it about a brilliant acquaintance She doesn t know she is female and if she should glance down in the shower and see a set of balls she would only think Dear dear how dusty things get in New York THIS DOES NOT MEAN I DO NOT ADMIRE HER MIND Powell on the other hand had a marriage a child lovers male and female loyal friends She actually did live and not just for the cameras She had illness and struggle too in spades but what amazes me is the hardiness of her optimism her resilience her delight in the exchange of ideas and her unshakable confidence in her own worth The feminist issues weren t her only hurdle There is the simple fact of her wit Nobody loves a wise ass As we know from the Oscars it s the sanctimonious stuff that gets rewarded Furthermore she wrote scathingly about class and Americans have never liked to hear about class All of the above None of the above The terrifying thing Powell noted is that it s the wind and the time and the tide that decide your luck Do you think it is that arbitrary A different turn of the magic wheel and it d be a Dawn Powell novel having sold 50 million copies in 385 languages including Swahili instead of The Old Man and the Sea Powell may be the patron saint of all writers laboring in obscurity That s partly what makes her revival so romantic Aside from Nathaniel West and The Day of the Locust though this is it right You re the 20 th Century Rediscovery Guy I wonder if you think this kind of archaeology could happen again to one of us nice mid list novelists in say the year 2039 or whether that possibility has been blockbustered conglomerized and Barnes Noble d right out of existence Best Lisa
