Oct 26 My own father died less than a year after I was born I never really knew him A career military officer he left my mother and his four children little in an economic sense but the mementos of his life including photographs his military decorations and the memories of those whose lives he touched are cherished to this day Even in the midst of his loss Mr Stein should be grateful to have enjoyed the company of his parents into their old age even if we don t realize it at the time each and every moment that we have with our loved ones should be considered and treated as a blessing To

his views on the estate tax are appalling At no point does he tell the reader the size of the initial exemption In fact estates must exceed at least 600 00 before ANY tax is applied It is my impression that only 1 percent to 2 percent of all estates are subject to any tax This is not class warfare This is sensible economic and public policy Many of the wealthy realized the benefits of disbursing wealth at death A Carnegie e g Ben Stein should know better than to make the occasion of his father s death into a political complaint To reply click here Subject Estates and the Public Good Re From Marshall C Sanders Date Tue Oct 26 I am in the business of estate tax planning With a modicum of planning Mr Stein s father could have seriously reduced or eliminated the amount of taxes that were payable by his estate It is also true that while Ben s mother certainly deserved to share in his father s largess Ben and any other siblings were merely members of the lucky sperm club We all take something out of society We all should put something back into society Mr Stein s father whom I disagreed with on a good many things did put something into society besides taxes But assume he had not should he or anyone else be allowed to accumulate substantial wealth or should it be filtered back into the society from whence it came and from whence it might do more public good I will leave that question for the philosophers and politicians To reply click here To read a Dialogue on estate taxes between former Sen Bob Packwood and economic journalist James Glassman click Subject Irish as Cultural Badge Re From varese layzer Date Tue Oct 19 Dennis Baron writes with reference to another minority language that c ultural loyalty movements like the class in Navajo tend to spring up when cultural preservation is in danger and their record of success is not impressive I would add that it depends on who starts the class Irish is a minority language closely associated with Irish culture and sometimes with Irish nationalism Some of the most positive Irish speakers are those who have acquired what they call prison Irish Not necessarily studied in prisons in Northern Ireland this is Irish learned on a need to know basis but a cultural need to know If these speakers don t fashion this connection to Irishness they feel otherwise culturally deprived to a greater or lesser degree The most enthusiastic speakers I have ever met are not native speakers who grow up in comfortable government subsidized Irish only neighborhoods in Galway but those who have clawed their way to a brand of cultural Irishness that they choose to mark by the use of language So I wonder if there isn t a proviso that cultural loyalty movements of language revival may be likely to fail if they are instituted by the government but perhaps more likely to succeed if they are instituted in spite of the government Because state supported Irish in the Republic of Ireland has a much more temperamental success rate Most Irish people there seem to feel that their culture is plenty intact without this old fashioned language dragging them further back behind the rest of Europe Is Irish a special language case To reply click here Subject Ebonics and the Techno Babble Re From Keter Tzadik Date Tue Oct 19 I and my co workers happen to be Ebonics speakers We are all young urban heads heads is ebonics for people who run a multimedia company We speak our own urbanized form of computer tech speak a lot of the time because we find that terms like information superhighway and surf the web are just not compatible with an urban lifestyle How many kids from Harlem have been surfing Naw meen I myself speak Ebonics so called Proper English some Hebrew some Spanish some Arabic and media techno babble I ve blended all of these together into my own urban Renaissance language I think that people need to communicate so there should be a shared mode of communication but acting like so called proper American English is more than a slang dialect itself is just wrong I mean we do NOT speak the Queen s English nor would we want to Further English itself is just a bastardized version of other languages like French German Latin and eventually Sanskrit So before the next time one of these language elitists rolls up into a 7 11 and talks trash about the Indian guy behind the counter speaking broken English he should instead thank the Indian guy because his precious English language was invented by the Indians ancestors Shalom To reply click here Subject Martha Architectural Digest for the Masses Re From Kathryn Ryder Date Fri Oct 22 Martha and her many imitators have taught us how to make our houses into homes Before Martha the many domestic arts and sciences were divided between homey but provincial cooking and Sears style decorating on the one hand and the haute cuisine of Julia Child and decorating by Architectural Digest on the other Martha taught the new educated and traveled middle class how to find a middle ground for decorating and cooking Her style remains essentially that If you disagree then compare Martha Stewart Living with Architectural Digest If the great unwashed wish to serve beer in bottles and an open bag of chips and Velveeta on triskits on the picnic table out back as opposed to Martha inspired delicacies crudit s and margaritas so what Why does she need to be so vociferously criticized Why do the hoi polloi feel so threatened by her and her style She never feels threatened by THEM and she has NEVER despite what the many parodies say preached

very name Martha is no accident Martha has represented domesticity for almost two millennia when she complained to their guest Jesus that her sister Mary was spending all her time listening at the feet of Jesus while she Martha had to work serving Jesus answer is classic Martha Martha thou art careful and troubled about many things But one thing is needful and Mary hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her Luke 10 38 42 Thus Mary represents intellect and devotion which trumps domestic chores But nowadays Mary won t get very far with an IPO To reply click here
