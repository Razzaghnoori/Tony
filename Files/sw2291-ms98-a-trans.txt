              uh   uh interestingly enough in my younger days i taught school for two years while my husband was getting his business established and i find the changes uh in the school system   umhum   i think a lot of them very positive uh since his retirement the first of January in nineteen ninety ive gone back to subbing and of course subbing is a very different endeavor than teaching uh   yes   its very difficult and ive after almost two years ive become a little bit disillusioned and im not real sure that im going to go back to it because uh of discipline uh although ive never had a problem with it i guess ive just gotten a little tired of fighting   yeah what what do you said you think therere some improvements what do you think the improvements have been   i think uh the quality of education in the high school system here is better i think the teachers that we have now are more professional and i think the students are more education minded than they were twenty years ago   umhum i think the problems that i see in the system uh are i i tend to see more in uh large inner city school districts that uh and ive ive noticed that uh suburban or rural schools tend to have much fewer problems at least what i from what i hear than than than the inside the city school districts   uhhuh uhhuh   and so i think the problem isnt so much the school system as in the things that go on around it   in the community itself that spill over so to speak   yeah umhum well my my personal opinion is that so many parents especially those parents who are in a lower income and have to spend more of their energy on work they say okay well i i dont have to teach my kids anything the schools going to do it for me and i think the school cant   uhhuh   do that the school can only exist as something to help the parents out not something to take the parents place   umhum i find that the school uses the parents as an excuse and the parents use the school as an excuse however   um that that can be yeah   were in uh as i said a small town in Indiana and its a WASP community with a student body of five hundred in the high school so the setting is very different than it would be in   umhum   Dallas or Chicago or even Indianapolis which is a couple hours south of us uh but to me the the more gifted or the higher intelligent children are more geared to learning than they were theyre more into the school system than they were twenty years ago and uh i find the Say No to Drugs campaign here   umhum   to be i think very effective unless i have my head in the sand   uhhuh yeah um that you know kind of goes along it it its a small enough school where people can know each other and and they can work together to thwart off problems when when youve got a high school with you know three or four thousand students   uhhuh   um theres just no its its very difficult to keep track of them all   uhhuh oh sure there are high schools as large as our community   yeah   which makes a totally different situation ive ive never felt that pouring more tax dollars in was the answer to solving any school problems or most of the school problems     yeah the i i find that i i havent seen any cases where thats been very effective and that seems to be what people want to do is just you know put more money into it and i just dont have a whole lot of confidence in that   uhhuh   i also you know i consider for example the the teachers the National Education Association you know they i would like to see them be more of a professional organization rather than a union because we need you know we need to we need to uh instead of worrying about saving jobs or raising salaries i think we need to worry about uh how well the jobs getting done   uhhuh isnt that the way with most groups though they become a selfprotection thing uh of saving jobs or getting more salary uh   umhum yes   i do i do find that the majority the majority of teachers in our group are very professional but then of course were a stable community and many of them have been in the system for twenty years which i just cant think youd find that in a large city school   yes umhum uh but you know back to the idea of parents i my my personal feelings is that parents need to be taking more responsibility i think the way i like to look at it you know a lot of people look at well whose job is it to teach the kids well its the schools job i think whose job is it to teach the kids well primarily its the parents job   uhhuh uhhuh   because the kids spend more time with the parents than they spend at school and the school is just there to help the parents   uhhuh uhhuh   so i think the the number one responsibility is on the heads of the parents and and we need to get to the idea well if the kids are are doing poorly in school then the parents need to take some sort of responsibility and and take some sort of action instead of just complaining about what the school is doing or not doing and sometimes if the parents dont like the way the school is being run the appropriate action is to have the choice to take that kid out of that school and put him in a different school   except we dont have another school   yeah thats in in small communities thats a difficult choice but then the small communities are the ones with fewer problems   uhhuh because they have fewer students   yeah its its the big cities that have these kind of problems and there i like to see that the parents be able to have a choice saying i dont like the way this school is being run i want to send my child to someplace where theyll be properly uh   uhhuh   properly taught and properly uh trained   you dont find that parents are getting more involved in your area   some parents are but some parents dont have the opportunity to do that as easily you know people that are working two jobs or single parents uh that sort of thing   umhum umhum uhhuh i think single parents probably contribute a lot of the problems in school systems because the systems really getting sixty percent of the students day if if the mother or the father certainly would have to work and theyre not getting home until probably five oclock at the very earliest and the students out at three   umhum   i think really uh the school does have more of that students time because eight hours of the time that the student is with the parent theyre going to be sleeping and certainly the parent needs some social life besides uh   yeah umhum and you know what it feels like to come home after a long day at work you you just you you want to rest for a little while and and maybe the children uh dont want you to rest   they might need to be dealt with yeah   yeah and its its a difficult problem and its one that well basically i think in in in large measure its its its up to the parents to take the responsibility for whats happening to their childrens education i think   uhhuh uhhuh And we did have we did recently have a a group here formed called Students for Academic Excellence that was formed by concerned parents and they see that these these kids are getting honor jackets and theyre getting certificates and theyre getting uh more access to scholarships uh on a par with the athletes which uh this was formed i think probably in the last three years and thats been a very positive thing for education itself because so often the emphasis is on   umhum   uh baseball basketball and football and it gets away from what the school is established for originally   umhum yes and here here in Texas if you dont like football y oure considered a heretic   uh well this is basketball in Indiana so   yes  that was going to be my guess   uhhuh We do all have our sport In fact weve been on a real high here because our basketball team won their regional for the first time in the history of the school So sport is uh has been really first and foremost here in the last month But we hope that education is first and foremost for the year nice talking to you   umhum alright well thank you for the call   uhhuh bye   bye
