 Background Obesity is rapidly becoming one of the most important medical and public health problems of our time Obesity is associated with a high rate of morbidity and early mortality if left untreated 1 2 3 4 Studies indicate that the presence of obesity increases the risk for developing cardiovascular diseases and diabetes 5 6 7 8 Its role as a health hazard in adults has been well recognized for some time 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 but little attention has been paid to childhood and adolescent obesity 14 15 16 17 The prevalence of obesity among US children is approximately of 22 30 and has increased at an accelerating rate in the past several years 18 19 20 the prevalence of obesity is 30 in some pediatric populations 20 21 Obesity in childhood is associated with obesity in adulthood 22 23 24 25 and is a predictor of all causes of obesity associated mortality during adulthood particularly mortality from cardiovascular diseases which are independent of adult weight 24 25 Epidemiologic evidence supports the theory that the relation between obesity and disease risk begins early in life For instance adolescents who died in accidents had fatty streaks in the coronary arteries and aorta that were found at autopsy and were associated with blood lipid profile blood pressure and obesity status obtained at one or more points antemortem 26 27 Moreover a recent longitudinal study indicated that the occurrence of overweight hypertension and dyslipidemia in young adults aged 19 32 y was associated with these same risk factors in childhood Data from the Children s Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati have shown that the incidence of type 2 diabetes among adolescents increased 10 fold from 1982 to 1994 and virtually all diagnosed cases of type 2 diabetes occurred in obese individuals 28 These observations are likely to reflect national trends and certainly deserve both confirmation and a sharper focus To test the hypothesis that being an overweight or obese adolescent is associated with early appearance of glucose and lipid profile abnormalities we performed a case control study quantifying the odds ratio of overweight and obesity on these abnormalities through different Tanner s stages The association between glucose and lipid profiles and the distribution of adipose tissue was also tested in this study The objective of the second study was to determine from a retrospective prospective longitudinal study of overweight and obese male and females having abnormal glucose and or lipid profiles at which age obesity in adolescence can be predictive of adult obesity and its obesity associated cardiovascular risk factors Methods Study 1 The first investigation was designed as a case control study and was performed in hospitals associated with Montreal and McGill Universities Many of the subjects were also directly recruited from nursery schools This study was conducted to determine the relationship between various indicators of adiposity and risk factors for cardiovascular diseases in Caucasian normal overweight and obese male and female adolescents The prevalence and odds ratio of being overweight or obese on glucose and lipid profiles was also determined Each Tanner stage is associated with important changes in genital development and sexual hormone profiles which could have an impact on adipose tissue distribution and glucose and lipid profiles Informed written consent was obtained from the parents and or of all participating subjects The participants were recruited from local and national advertising To be included in the study adolescents and adults had to meet the following criteria 1 be of Caucasian ethnicity 2 be free from diagnosed endocrine conditions that could lead to obesity and 3 not taking any medication affecting body weight They were selected for the study on the basis of their body mass index Standing height was measured with a wall mounted tape and weight was measured with the same standard balance scale Adolescents were classified according to BMI 85 thpercentile as overweight and 95 thpercentile for age and sex as obese 29 30 31 32 Recent workshops concluded that the BMI has been validated by studies on total body fat 32 The standards used to identify overweight and obesity in children and adolescents should agree with the standards used to identify grade 1 and grade 2 overweight BMI of 25 and 30 respectively in adults 33 Adolescents with a BMI 85 thpercentile were classified as controls Group 1 Group 2 were overweight BMI 85 thpercentile and 95 thpercentile and group 3 were obese BMI 95 thpercentile Adults with a BMI 25 were classified as controls between 25 and 30 as overweight and 30 as obese Sexes were grouped separately WC AC was calculated from the ratio of waist circumference to arm circumference and used as a measured of fat distribution analogous to waist to hip ratio on the assumption that a higher ratio of waist to arm circumference is an indicator of a more central pattern of adiposity We used this measure in preference to waist to hip ratio because a study which determined peripheral and abdominal adipose tissue content in children using magnetic resonance imaging found that WC AC correlated positively with intra abdominal adipose tissue r 0 63 P 0 001 while waist to hip ratio did not r 0 11 34 Two other indices of central adiposity were calculated from skinfolds Central peripheral CPR as subscapular skinfold suprailliac skinfold triceps skinfold thigh skinfold and ratio of subscapular to triceps skinfold STR STR is an index of relative distribution of central subcutaneous adiposity The sum of the four skinfolds SUM was calculated from triceps subscapular suprailliac and thigh skinfolds in the total sample The SUM provides a single measure of subcutaneous adiposity Anthropometric measurements were done by the same experienced evaluator to reduce variability which was measured at less than 0 5 Genital development was evaluated with the criteria of Tanner 35 and was performed with a questionnaire and physical exam by an experienced physician in which stage 1 is prepubertal stage 2 is initial development of the genitalia stages 3 and 4 are intermediate and stage 5 is mature Stage of sexual maturation in the girls was determined on the basis of a combination of menarcheal status and breast and pubic hair development 36 The stages of sexual maturation were performed with a questionnaire and physical exam done by an experienced physician as follow premenarcheal with no secondary sexual development stage 1 Premenarcheal with some secondary sexual development stage 2 premenarcheal at the time of study but attained menarche within 6 months stage 3 postmenarcheal with secondary sexual development not yet mature stage 4 and postmenarcheal with secondary sexual development stage 5 The subjects were instructed to arrive to the clinic at 8 00 AM after 12 hour overnight fast BMI was measured and a venous blood sample was taken followed by a breakfast Fasting blood samples were stored at 4C Serum glucose and insulin levels and lipid profile were determined They completed a questionnaire on risk factors for atherosclerosis including family history of coronopathy smoking high blood pressure personal history of coronopathy or myocardial infarct history of cerebrovascular disease or occlusive peripheral disease Most overweight and obese subjects had at least two risk factors for atherosclerosis The diagnostic criteria for glucose profile were those approved by the American Diabetes Association 37 Diabetes is defined as a fasting serum glucose equal or higher than 7 mmol L 126 mg dl and impaired fasting glucose with values between 6 0 and 7 0 mmol L Subjects with high fasting glucose levels were referred to their own physicians for further clinical evaluation Lipid profile was also performed on the fasting blood sample The blood lipid variables investigated were triglyceride TRG total cholesterol TC high density lipoprotein HDL cholesterol concentrations low density lipoproteins LDL cholesterol concentrations and the ratio of total HDL cholesterol T HDLC 38 All biochemical measurements were performed in an accredited hospital laboratory Study 2 The second investigation was designed as a retrospective prospective longitudinal study from 1974 to 2000 and was performed from hospitals associated with Montreal and McGill Universities This study was conducted to determine the age of apparition of abnormal glucose and lipid profiles in a group of overweight and obese young Caucasians adults presenting abnormal glucose and or lipid profiles The study was performed from chart review of participants 2000 charts were pre selected by the archivists To be included in the study young adults had to meet the following criteria 1 be of Caucasian ethnicity 2 be between the ages of 32 38 y 3 be free from diagnosed endocrine conditions that could have led to obesity 4 not having taken any medication affecting body weight 5 presenting a BMI 25 at adult age 6 presenting abnormal glucose and or lipid profiles 7 presenting at least 2 risk factors for cardiovascular diseases as explained earlier and having been seen by their physicians between 1974 to 2000 Among the 2000 charts only 128 males and 112 females were having pertinent data at the different 7 age groups permitting longitudinal study of all the subjects used in this study These charts were reviewed by 2 reviwers A sample of 20 charts were reviewed by the two reviewers to determine variability between reviewers The inter chart reviewer differences was less than 0 2 Data from the subjects were presented by specific age group which we think may approximate the criteria of Tanner 35 for genital development WC AC ratio was removed from the anthropometric measurements because the concept of waist circumference waist to hip ratio or waist circumference to arm circumference was unknown or not used to quantify central adiposity Statistical procedures SAS PROC MIXED version 6 11 SAS Institute Cary North Carolina was used to analyze longitudinal and correlated data The analyses were interpreted using P 0 01 as the level of significance An unpaired T test was used to analyze the difference between male and female for each variables measured at each Tanner stages Pearson correlations were computed to evaluate the relationship between specific continuous variables Odds ratios were used to quantify risk in our population Results Study 1 Table 1shows the main anthropometric measurements of our study population Pubertal status was appropriate for age in all subjects all girls over 14 y had reached menarche and all boys over 14 y had Tanner Stage grades of 3 or more The distribution of obese and overweight adolescents in our study did not differ from that expected in an average North American population As defined in methods WC AC ratio which is an indicator of central adiposity was significantly higher in both P 0 01 overweight and P 0 001 obese adolescents in comparison with controls either in adolescents of different Tanner s stages or adults of both sexes The CPR value which is representative of central peripheral obesity was also significantly higher P 0 01 in both overweight and P 0 001 obese adolescents The same is true for the STR and SUM values For all the anthropometric measurements there were no significant differences between sexes Table 2indicates that the prevalence of impaired glucose and lipid profiles were highest among those with a BMI above the 95 th The prevalence of impaired fasting glucose is already significant at Tanner stage 1 with percentage prevalence of 11 1 and 44 1 for overweight and obese subjects respectively The prevalence was significantly higher in both P 0 01 overweight and P 0 001 obese adolescents in comparison with controls either in adolescents of different Tanner s stages or adults of both sexes The prevalence of impaired fasting glucose did not differ significantly between adolescents and adults either in male or female Adolescents with BMI exceeding the 85 thpercentile are at increased risk of being classified as having diabetes or impaired fasting glucose Also the prevalence of lipid profile abnormalities was highest among those above the 95 thpercentile for BMI Adolescents with BMI exceeding the 85 thpercentile are at increased risk of having abnormal lipid profiles Again the difference between the three groups was already present at Tanner stage 1 The presence of an abnormal lipid profile was observed from Tanner stages III and above Sensitivity refers to the percentage of obese or overweight participants who were correctly predicted to be at risk for either glucose or lipid profiles abnormalities Specificity refers to the percentage of participants who were correctly predicted to be in the remaining groups BMI 85 thpercentile were chosen as cutoff point for identifying overweight adolescents and BMI 85 thpercentile were considered as normal subjects Table 3shows that the sensitivity and specificity to predict impaired fasting glucose at Tanner stages III and above were at least 60 and 80 respectively With use of this cutoff point the odds ratio of being at risk for impaired fasting glucose varied from 11 7 to 23 7 for males and females Table 4shows that the sensitivity and specificity to predict an impaired lipid profiles at Tanner stages III and above were from 47 5 to 83 males and from 84 8 to 91 2 females respectively Using a BMI at the 85 thpercentile as a cutoff point the odds ratio for impaired lipid profiles varied from 9 1 to 15 2 for males and females The associations between anthropometric measurements fasting glucose and insulin levels and lipid profiles at each Tanner stage are presented in Tables 5and 6respectively with P 0 01 and less for each group Regression analyses were not required to establish significance Study 2 Table 7shows the main anthropometric measurements of our study population at 7 different interval age groups from 9 to 38 years old The BMI adjusted for age and sex was appropriate at each interval age group CPR STR and SUM were significantly increased P 0 01 with age corresponding with a higher fat mass with growth For all the anthropometric measurements there were no significant gender differences Table 8presents the incidence of impaired glucose and lipid profile between age groups The incidences of impaired glucose and lipid profiles were already high at the first age group with incidences of approximately 30 for both The incidence increases progressively with age Fasting plasma glucose level results not shown HbA1c and fasting plasma insulin levels were significantly increased P 0 01 through puberty and growth There were no significant differences between sexes TRG TC LDL and T HDLC were also significantly increased P 0 01 with growth The reverse was observed for HDL BMI values at the 85 thpercentile for 13 15 year old group were chosen as cutoff points for identifying overweight at age 35 y The sensitivities were 77 7 and 83 3 and the specificities 80 0 and 80 0 for males and females respectively With use of the cutoff point of the 85 thpercentile at this age group the odds ratios for overweight at age 35 y were 12 8 for males and 20 0 for females Table 9 Table 10presents the sensitivity specificity and odds ratios for the selected cutoff point for predicting impaired fasting glucose IFG values at the 85 thpercentile at 13 15 year old group at age 35 The sensitivities were 77 8 and 71 4 and the specificities 76 4 and 77 6 for males and females respectively The odds ratios for abnormal IFG at age 35 y were 11 3 for males and 8 6 for females Table 11presents the sensitivity specificity and odds ratios for predicting impaired lipid profiles ILP at the 85 thpercentile at 13 15 year old group for age 35 The sensitivities were 80 0 and 75 and the specificities 77 7 and 79 2 for males and females respectively With use of the cutoff point of the 85 thpercentile at 13 15 year old group the odds ratios of ILP at age 35 y were 14 0 for males and 11 4 for females Discussion Study 1 The rationale underlying this part of the study is that the stage of sexual maturation is an important variable in applying anthropometric measurements as predictors of risk for cardiovascular diseases On average BMI seems to increase with stage of genital maturation in boys relative to fatness and then in contrast decreases in the later stages of maturation reflecting the rapid growth of fat free mass with puberty BMI in girls also increases with stage of sexual maturation but relative fatness is variable especially in girls who just attaining menarche stage III To obviate this bias we preselected our subjects according to their BMI For instance a BMI 85 thpercentile for age and sex was classified as being overweight and those with a BMI 95 thpercentile as obese 29 30 31 32 Recent workshops concluded that the BMI is an index of choice for evaluating obesity in adolescents because it has been validated by studies of total body fat 32 The criteria used to identify overweight and obesity in children and adolescents agree with those used for grade 1 and grade 2 overweight BMI of 25 and 30 respectively in adults 33 Using a representative sample from the general North American Caucasian population we demonstrate that the BMI is also a good indicator for obesity in adolescents however the readily measured WC AC CPR and STR indices of central obesity and SUM a single measure of subcutaneous adiposity are stronger predictor of both fasting glucose and insulin levels and lipid profiles than BMI We also demonstrated that each anthropometric variable taken separately can significantly predict fasting glucose and insulin levels and lipid profile in adolescents of both sexes with a probability of P 0 01 Our results are in accordance with others of children aged 5 and 16 in whom indicators of fatness such as weight for height BMI and skinfold thicknesses have been associated with higher total and LDL cholesterol lower HDL cholesterol and higher triglyceride concentrations 40 41 42 43 Our overweight and obese adolescents had higher fasting glucose and insulin levels for BMI than subjects with BMI in the healthy range Furtheremore the prevalence of obesity was comparable between boys and girls In both sexes the prevalence of diabetes and impaired fasting glucose increased relative to chronological age in both overweight P 0 01 and obese subjects P 0 001 Previous study in Aboriginal children recognized to be at high risk for type II diabetes has shown that obesity is associated with high fasting glucose and fasting insulin levels They also demonstrated that children with BMI exceeding the 85 thpercentile are at increased risk of diabetes or impaired fasting glucose odds ratio of 5 1 with 95 coefficient interval 1 5 17 0 39 With use of the cutoff point of the 85 thpercentile we demonstrated that adolescents of Tanner stage III and higher of both sexes are at increased risk of having impaired fasting glucose with odds ratios of 11 7 and higher Our overweight and obese adolescents had higher TC LDL TRG and lower HDL values which correlated with BMI and other measures of fatness In both sexes the prevalence of impaired lipid profile increased relative to chronological age in both overweight P 0 01 and obese subjects P 0 001 l Adolescents of both sexes with BMI 85 thare at increased risk of impaired fasting lipid profiles with odds ratios of 9 1 and higher Study 2 The goal of the second study was to determine the childhood age of abnormal glucose and lipid profiles from overweight adults By using a retrospective prospective longitudinal study design we were able to track BMI glucose and lipid profiles from late childhood and adolescent ages to adulthood in a white Caucasian populations Then we were able to correlate their subsequent risk of obesity and its associated impaired glucose and lipid profiles There is general agreement on the use of BMI with selected cutoff points as guidelines for desirable weight 44 45 46 47 48 This study provided a basis for prediction of overweight and obesity in adults from their 13 15 year old group suggesting that this simple measurement could be applied to the prediction of obesity in public health programs The results presented here were comparable to those observed in a previous study showing that with use of the cutoff point of the 60 thpercentile at age 18 y the odds ratios of overweight at age 35 y were of 15 for males and 27 for females with corresponding SEs of 1 9 and 3 5 respectively Previous data on 8 18 y olds in Project Heart Beat demonstrated that the odds ratio of overweight in adulthood for those with childhood BMI values at the 95 thpercentile were 2 6 and 1 5 to 5 times as great as for those with a BMI values at the 75 thpercentile for males and females respectively 49 The incidence of impaired glucose profile was comparable between boys and girls In both sexes the incidence of diabetes and impaired fasting glucose increased significantly P 0 001 relative to chronological age in comparison to adults The sensitivity of the selected cutoff point for BMI values at the 85 thpercentile at 13 15 years old for identifying impaired glucose profile at age 35 y was 76 4 and 77 6 for both male and female respectively Therefore at least 75 of male and female adolescents aged between 13 and 15 years old who were having a BMI 85 thwere correctly predicted to have impaired glucose profile at 35 y On the other hand 77 8 of male and 71 4 of female adolescents of this age group who were having a BMI 85 thwere correctly predicted to have normal glucose profile at 35 y As stated in the introduction obesity in childhood is associated with obesity in adulthood 22 23 24 25 and is a predictor of all cause of obesity associated mortality during adulthood particularly mortality from cardiovascular diseases which is independent of adult weight 24 25 The results of the present study agreed with a previous study 50 indicating that the metabolic alterations caused by excess body fat are expressed early in the natural history of obesity Such alterations seem clinically important even in children as evidenced by an increase in glucose profile abnormalities in obese adolescents These observations underscore the need for research efforts directed at the development of effective interventions for obese adolescents The incidence of impaired lipid profile was comparable between boys and girls In both sexes the incidence of impaired lipid profile increased significantly P 0 001 relative to chronological age in comparison to adults The sensitivity of the selected cutoff point for BMI values at the 85 thpercentile at 13 15 years old for identifying impaired lipid profile at age 35 y was 77 7 and 79 2 for both male and female respectively The specificity was 80 0 and 75 0 for both male and female respectively If we consider that most of the subjects having a BMI 85 thwere also presenting more than 2 risk factors for cardiovascular disease this means that they are at increased risk for developing cardiovascular diseases Few studies have examined the long term effects of adolescent obesity on adult disease Nonetheless obesity present in childhood or adolescence seems to increase the likelihood of adult morbidity and mortality 51 In the present study we demonstrated that in both men and women obese during adolescence risk of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes were increased These effects seems related both to the persistence of obesity and to the effects of childhood or adolescent obesity on the quantity and location of body fat distribution The risk factors for adult disease that are associated with obesity in children and adolescents persist into adulthood or increase in prevalence if weight gain occurs Although both total body fat and regional fat deposition could account for the association of childhood or adolescent obesity with adult disease no studies to date have examined cardiovascular risk factors and related them to visceral fat Conclusion The strengths of the study include the use of large samples of both genders a wide age range subjects representative of the population being studied precise measurements of body composition and the use of well accepted BMI classifications of overweight and obesity By using a retrospective prospective design in the second part of the study we were able to obtain the longitudinal data required to answer the questions addressed In conclusion our study confirms the hypothesis that overweight and obese adolescents have higher fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels and an abnormal lipid profile relative to their lean peers This study highlights the critical importance of early identification and intervention of adolescent obesity to avert the long term consequences of it and to protect adolescent against the risk of cardiovascular diseases There is an urgent need to follow cohorts at risks children and adolescents to investigate cofactors acting in concert with obesity that are responsible for the early onset of risk factors for cardiovascular diseases a phenomenon increasingly being observed in many populations Competing interests None declared
