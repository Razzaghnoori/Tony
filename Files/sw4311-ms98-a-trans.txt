                go ahead   oh okay yeah the uh subject is child care and how to determine child care and thats uh an interesting one for me to talk about since i have no children but i did run a child care facility for a while   hm   and uh have some   well you shouldve you should have some opinions on that then   i do have some thoughts on that yeah and its uh an interesting experience to be a surrogate parent for or a parent for a lot of people there and um  its also very interesting in terms of how people choose  the child care facilities   well i guess if i were going to choose i mean my first consideration would be safety   right   my second consideration would be uh um health   right   and uh i guess my third consideration would be uh warm environment warm personal environment   well right um in Texas we have to meet certain state standards in order to operate  on a at an institutional level and at a like a small home level so you meet the standards  but then after that theres theres a lot more i think its important as the safety and health and that kind of stuff is qualification of people who work there and in hiring people who would work at the uh day care the child care facility was very difficult to find qualified people um in terms of not just just because somebody has a child or uh likes children doesnt really mean that theyre qualified to give the child the kind of supervision and training that   oh absolutely  as a matter of fact i believe that the safety and and health uh issues uh depend in a very direct way on the people who are working with the children   that uh exactly and that was the most difficult thing of all to find the the right people the qualified people   and its the most difficult thing of all for a parent judge uh because a person can be very nice and warm and loving but if hes a space cadet and doesnt watch the children and be aware of what the safety hazards are   oh oh exactly and the other thing thats difficult in uh an institutional setting like a day care center is to find the right program of enrichment for the child because you dont wanna just warehouse the child and i didnt want to run an institution where that was the case where all we were doing were warehousing because the first four or five years are so important and you have to have the right kind of enrichment and that that includes uh an atmosphere in which the child is safe and and hes watched and his physical needs are cared for but also his uh developmental needs are cared for too   maybe the right thing to do is to um when a couple has a child then they should both take you say the first four or five years are the most important and i think i would agree with that they both take four or five years off and devote to parenting   that would be lovely   get rid of all these child care centers at least for young kids below the age of six   umhum   and then um and then of course to make up for that um the uh parents would have to work in their later years longer in in other words they probably would not work may not end may end up not working at all in the twenties oh   well thats an interesting thought because   but they may have to work from age thirty or or forty to age seventy or eighty or ninety   that would be okay  that would that would help on the other end too       in in terms of not warehousing people and letting people be productive for as long as they can be   right well you know the uh uh the world is changing from uh uh uh uh from institutional from uh industrial uh base to uh information base and so what that means is you dont have to be physically powerful to work   umhum thats exactly right   all you have to do is have a sharp mind and i believe that uh mental acuity is easy to sustain maintain if you just simply continue to exercise your mind   oh   so i think a person could work  uh into the seventies eighties even nineties for that matter if they didnt have to do a lot of physical uh labor they could maintain maintain uh a
