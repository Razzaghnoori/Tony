 Background An emerging pattern found in gene and protein phylogenies that include prokaryotes archaebacteria and eubacteria and eukaryotes is the variable position of eukaryotes In proteins involved in transcription and translation eukaryotes often cluster with archaebacteria whereas in metabolic proteins they often cluster with eubacteria 1 Among the latter proteins eukaryotes sometimes group with proteobacteria presumably reflecting the origin of mitochondria and plants sometimes cluster with cyanobacteria reflecting the origin of plastids These patterns have been interpreted as a general signature of the symbiotic origin of eukaryotes 2 3 and horizontal gene transfer HGT of symbiont genes to the nucleus 4 5 6 7 8 9 On the one hand this complexity resulting from HGT can obscure some aspects of evolutionary history 8 However HGT also can provide the means to investigate otherwise difficult questions such as inferring the number of symbiotic events and estimating the time of those events This is the approach that we take in this study The goal of this study is to estimate the timing of evolutionary events involved in the origin of eukaryotes Fig 1 including the related origin of oxygenic photosynthesis The latter is believed to have occurred only in cyanobacteria 10 and preceded the symbiotic event leading to the mitochondrion of eukaryotes The earliest biomarker evidence of eukaryotes is at 2 7 Ga 11 and the earliest fossils appear 2 1 Ga 12 The fossil record of cyanobacteria has been argued to extend to 3 5 Ga 13 but the biomarker evidence at 2 7 2 8 Ga 14 15 usually is considered to be the earliest record of cyanobacteria 10 However the 2 methylhopane biomarker of cyanobacteria has been detected in lower abundance in other prokaryotes and many taxa especially anaerobic species have not been examined for the biomarker 15 16 17 Also the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis may have occurred at some time later than the origin of cyanobacteria Geologic evidence bearing on the origin and rise in oxygen likewise has been debated 18 19 Although the existence of banded iron formations prior to 3 Ga sometimes has been used as evidence for the early evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis oxygen independent mechanisms of iron deposition are known 20 The use of sequence changes to estimate the time of these early events also has its assumptions and limitations 21 22 23 Nonetheless many proteins contain conserved regions of amino acid sequence throughout prokaryotes and eukaryotes that permit alignment and analysis The most extensive of these analyses have found that all major events related to the origin of eukaryotes occurred about 2 0 2 2 Ga 5 21 This includes the divergence of archaebacteria and archaebacterial proteins in eukaryotes the origin of cyanobacteria and the divergence of eubacteria and eubacterial proteins in eukaryotes the latter presumably reflecting symbiosis However these times were not adjusted for lineage specific rate differences that have been discovered subsequently 23 Here we estimate the time of these events with protein sequences from complete genomes and consideration of lineage specific rate variation Results Rate differences The shape parameter of the gamma distribution used to account for rate variation among sites was found to differ consistently between calibration taxa and the overall data set for each gene Fig 2 requiring a dual gamma approach see Methods Also eukaryotic protein sequences were found to have an increased rate of evolution compared with prokaryotic sequences regardless of their archaebacterial or eubacterial origin Fig 3A Average eukaryote rates were 1 37 AK 1 18 BK o and 1 38 BK m times the rate of the most closely related prokaryote in constant rate proteins 1 55 1 24 and 1 56 in all proteins respectively Besides this general pattern which may reflect fundamental differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes e g recombination there are further differences among eukaryotes In comparing rates of evolution in eukaryotic sequences derived independently from eubacteria and archaebacteria in the same protein those derived from eubacteria in all cases BK o were found to be evolving at roughly twice the rate as their archaebacteria derived counterparts Fig 3B The slope was 2 01 and the correlation coefficient was 0 54 n 14 comparisons in seven proteins Two other rate comparisons were limited by a small number of proteins eubacteria versus eukaryotes K A and eubacteria versus archaebacteria Only three proteins were available in the first comparison and all three showed a faster rate in eukaryotes 1 43 1 12 1 23 x 1 26 This result differs from that reported elsewhere 23 in which the two rates were not significantly different In the second case we found that archaebacteria are evolving at a slower rate than eubacteria as was noted elsewhere 23 In our case regression of archaebacterial branch length versus eubacterial branch length fixed through the origin resulted in a slope of 0 93 and correlation coefficient of 0 65 n 9 proteins However in both of these comparisons rate tests did not yield significant rate differences probably because of the short length of most proteins Sample size eight protein sets also was limited in the Kollman and Doolittle study 23 Taken together these data suggest the following relative order of rate differences archaebacteria eubacteria eukaryotes archaebacterial origin eukaryotes eubacterial origin As additional genomic data become available more proteins will be useful and greater precision in these rates and rate differences will be possible Phylogeny and time estimation It has been suggested that eukaryotic genes and proteins of archaebacterial origin are more closely related to one lineage of archaebacteria Crenarchaeota eocytes than the other major lineage Euryarchaeota 24 If true this would bear on our time estimate for the divergence of archaebacteria and eukaryotes Thus we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of 72 proteins containing representatives of the two major groups of archaebacteria eukaryotes and eubacteria At the 95 bootstrap significance level 19 proteins supported archaebacterial monophyly whereas none supported the eocyte hypothesis Crenarchaeota Eukaryota This indicates that the lineage of archaebacteria leading to the eukaryote nuclear genome diverged prior to the split between the Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota As noted previously 1 most in this case 21 out of 36 eukaryotic proteins with archaebacterial affinity are informational involved in transcription translation and related processes Among 41 eukaryotic proteins with eubacterial affinities Rickettsia is most closely related to eukaryotes in phylogenetic analyses of nine individual proteins This agrees with the genetic and cell biological evidence implicating an proteobacterium as progenitor of the mitochondrion 25 and supports the hypothesis that these nine eukaryotic proteins owe their origin to that symbiotic event 2 However the remaining 32 proteins do not show this pattern but instead identify other species or groups of eubacteria as closest relative Unlike Rickettsia no other single species appears as closest relative in more than three proteins but rather most 19 32 proteins identify groups of species as closest relative e g Fig 4A To further explore this question we combined sequences of all 11 proteins with a full representation of eubacterial taxa 11 species In the combined analysis eukaryotes fall significantly outside of the well defined clade containing and proteobacteria Fig 4B The relatively basal and unresolved position of eukaryotes is consistent with the preponderance of single proteins showing different groups of species as closest relative Three individual proteins showed significant bootstrap support for a Rickettsia eukaryote cluster in four taxon analyses rooted with an archaebacterium whereas four proteins significantly supported a Rickettsia Escherichia cluster that excluded the eukaryote Divergence time estimates from the multigene MG and average distance AD approaches are similar but rate adjusted times are older than unadjusted times Table 1 The time estimate for the AK divergence averages 4 0 Ga and the remaining times range from 1 8 to 2 7 Ga The time estimate for BK o 2 7 0 20 Ga was older than the estimate for BK m 1 8 0 20 Ga whereas the time estimate for the origin of Giardia 2 2 0 12 Ga was intermediate The BC time estimate was 2 6 0 26 Ga Discussion The purpose of this study was to examine the temporal relationship between the origin of eukaryotes and events in Earth history However some unexpected results required refinement in methodology These included finding greater among site rate variation in the calibration group and different rates of sequence change between prokaryotes and eukaryotes and between eukaryotes derived from different groups of prokaryotes By taking into account these variables the resulting time estimates are more robust and have fewer assumptions For example the time estimate for the origin of eukaryotes BK o is not based on a general assumption of rate constancy between prokaryotes or even eubacteria and eukaryotes because rates are adjusted for each protein and each comparison Also the calibration used for BK o is not a general eukaryotic calibration but one based exclusively on eukaryote sequences derived from eubacteria A tradeoff in these improved methods was a reduction in the number of proteins that could be used which increased the variance of the time estimates Nonetheless the phylogenies and time estimates obtained in this study have a bearing on current models for the evolution of eukaryotes Until about five years ago it was generally accepted that there was a prior period before mitochondria in the history of eukaryotes 2 26 The basal position of eukaryotes lacking mitochondria amitochondriate in phylogenetic trees 27 was consistent with this supposition as was evidence from sequence signatures 6 However molecular phylogenetic studies of several proteins in recent years have suggested that some or all amitochondriate eukaryotes once possessed mitochondria in the past 9 Based on this new evidence most current models for the origin of eukaryotes assume only a single symbiotic or fusion event between an archaebacterium and an proteobacterium 8 28 29 Under the single symbiosis model eukaryotes should cluster exclusively with an proteobacterium e g Rickettsia among eubacteria However our phylogenetic analyses Fig 4 instead indicate significantly that many eukaryotic proteins originated from one or more eubacterial lineages other than proteobacteria The reduced genome of Rickettsia 25 would not explain this result because Rickettsia possesses all of the proteins used in the combined analysis Fig 4B Protein function and location also are consistent with a premitochondrial origin Only one of the 32 BK o proteins is restricted to the mitochondrion whereas eight of the nine BK m proteins are restricted to that organelle Also all six of the proteins involved in cellular respiration are in the BK m group Based on the serial endosymbiosis theory the first symbiotic event involved a spirochete 3 On the other hand sequence signatures of the heat shock molecular chaperone protein HSP 70 and other evidence have indicated that the first symbiotic event involved a gram negative eubacterium 6 Our data are unable to distinguish between these two alternatives but agree with both in implicating an earlier premitochondrial event Predation by prokaryotes on early eukaryotes also may have led to HGT If two or more symbiotic events were involved this does not necessarily confirm that any of the living lineages of amitochondriate eukaryotes arose prior to the second mitochondrial event All may have once possessed mitochondria However because Giardia arose at an early time Table 1 and branches near the base of the eukaryote phylogeny the simplest explanation is that it never possessed mitochondria and is a primary not secondary amitochondriate Although the position of Giardia in some protein phylogenies 30 has been proposed as evidence that it is a secondary amitochondriate others have urged caution until additional more conclusive data become available 6 The number of symbiotic events was important for our primary concern of estimating a timescale for the early evolution of eukaryotes We find that the divergence between archaebacteria and the lineage leading to eukaryotes K A was quite early 4 Ga which is about the time of the earliest biomarker evidence of life 3 9 3 8 Ga 31 We interpret that divergence to be a speciation event between two lineages of archaebacteria with K A not becoming eukaryotic until the first symbiotic event at 2 7 Ga The remaining time estimates cluster around the mid life of Earth 1 8 2 7 Ga The order of those events falls in a logical sequence BK o BC and BK m For example the origin of mitochondria appears as the second not first symbiotic event and the origin of cyanobacteria comes before the oxygen utilizing organelles mitochondria Moreover the timing of these biological events is consistent with the timing of events in geologic and atmospheric history Fig 5 Cyanobacteria appear before the major undisputed evidence of the rise in oxygen 2 4 2 2 Ga and mitochondria appear after the rise in oxygen Also the estimates for the origin of cyanobacteria and eukaryotes are consistent within one SE with the earliest biomarker evidence for those two groups 2 7 Ga 11 15 Phylogenetic analyses of photosynthetic genes and sequence signatures also support a relatively late order of appearance of cyanobacteria among photosynthetic prokaryotes 32 33 Extensive glaciations occurred in the Paleoproterozoic 2 4 Ga and may have been global in extent 34 It has been proposed that a major rise in oxygen at this time lowered global temperatures and may have triggered the glaciations 35 If this is true and given the time estimates here the evolutionary innovation of oxygenic photosynthesis may have had a relatively rapid impact on the environment Moreover this innovation may have caused a mass extinction of prokaryotes at that time as a result of the toxic effects of oxygen as suggested by the virtual absence of lineages prior to 2 5 Ga and subsequent rapid radiation of lineages Figs 4 5 Conclusions Our analyses of prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomic sequence data support two symbiotic events in the origin of eukaryotes one premitochondrial 2 7 billion years ago Ga and a later mitochondrial event 1 8 Ga Our time estimate for the divergence of an early branching eukaryote Giardia that lacks mitochondria 2 2 Ga suggests that it is a primary and not secondary amitochondriate organism Our time estimate for the origin of cyanobacteria 2 6 Ga is more recent than expected and suggests that earlier fossils claimed to be of cyanobacteria are of other organisms or artifacts Moreover the appearance of cyanobacteria immediately prior to the earliest undisputed evidence for the presence of oxygen 2 4 2 2 Ga suggests that the innovation of oxygenic photosynthesis had a relatively rapid impact on the environment as it set the stage for further evolution of the eukaryotic cell Materials and Methods Sequence data and alignment We assembled and aligned protein sequences of all 467 potentially orthologous groups from complete genome databases and these were supplemented with additional eukaryote taxa from the sequence database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information http www ncbi nlm nih gov entrez Data from the following species were assembled into presumptive orthology groups hereafter proteins and aligned 36 Aquifex aeolicus Bacillus subtilis Borrelia burgdorferi Chlamydia trachomatis Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Helicobacter pylori Mycobacterium tuberculosis Mycoplasma genitalium Mycoplasma pneumoniae Rickettsia prowazekii Synechocystis sp and Treponema pallidum Eubacteria Archaeoglobus fulgidus Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum Methanococcus jannaschii Pyrococcus abyssi and P horikoshii Archaebacteria Euryarchaeota and Arabidopsis thaliana Caenorhabditis elegans Dictyostelium discoideum Drosophila melanogaster Gallus gallus Homo sapiens Mus musculus Oryza saticva Plasmodium falciparum Saccharomyces cerevisiae Schizosaccharomyces pombe Trypanosoma sp and Xenopus laevis Eukaryota The genome sequence of Aeropyrum pernix Archaebacteria Crenarchaeota became available during completion of study and was included in phylogenetic analyses only Global alignment algorithms differ from local alignment algorithms in that they sometimes align unrelated non homologous sites together with homologous sites Using a computational tool xcons 36 such unrelated sites were removed from these CLUSTALW 37 alignments to increase probability of site homology During construction of protein alignments using the WAT system 36 short fragmented sequences were manually removed Of the 204 proteins that could be calibrated for time estimation the orthology of roughly half 116 proteins was ambiguous for unknown reasons e g lateral gene transfer gene loss or poor phylogenetic resolution leaving 87 proteins for phylogeny and time estimation The seven shortest 75 amino acids of those were used only in phylogenetic analyses the remaining proteins averaged 196 amino acids each Where possible proteins were rooted by duplicate proteins duplicate genes otherwise they were midpoint rooted Separately for timing the origin of Giardia sequences of 17 proteins were obtained from the public databases and aligned 37 in which the following taxa were available Giardia and other eukaryotes including calibration taxa see below archaebacteria and eubacteria Correspondence and requests for materials should be addressed to S B H e mail sbh1 psu edu or see http www evogenomics org Publications data Eukaryotes for alignments and other information Time estimation Methods are described elsewhere 38 except as follows Our initial goal was to estimate divergence times for the last common ancestor LCA the divergence between archaebacteria and eukaryotes AK cyanobacteria and closest eubacterial relatives origin of cyanobacteria BC eubacteria and mitochondrial eukaryotes origin of mitochondria BK m and Giardia and other eukaryotes GK Fig 1 The importance of Giardia is its lack of mitochondria and basal location in many phylogenies of eukaryotes 27 39 However our initial phylogenetic analyses revealed that many eukaryotes did not cluster with Rickettsia the proteobacterium as predicted by current genomic models 8 25 Instead they typically formed a basal lineage among eubacteria in the tree This result was consistent with the serial endosymbiosis theory 3 and with other findings 6 and therefore we designated this divergence as BK o origin of eukaryotes Estimation of the divergence time of the origin of plastids BK p was not a goal of this study and the LCA was not estimated because of an insufficient number of duplicate proteins needed for reciprocal rooting 23 Thus five divergence times were studied AK BC BK o BK m and GK Eukaryotes derived from different prokaryotes are referred to herein as K A from AK K B o from BK o and K B m from BK m Because of the large amount of sequence conservation in these proteins it was not possible to calibrate directly by extrapolation from vertebrates 40 for which an extensive fossil record exists For example sequences often were identical among rodents primates and birds Instead multiple calibrations were used from older divergences among kingdoms plants animals fungi and animal phyla derived from analysis of 75 nuclear proteins calibrated with the vertebrate fossil record 38 This two step calibration reduced the error involved in extrapolation Two classes of time estimation methods were used and compared The multigene MG approach uses the mean or mode of many single gene time estimates 40 41 whereas the average distance AD approach 42 43 44 involves the combining of distances and rates among genes or proteins to yield a single time estimate For the AD approach we weight each single gene distance before combining by the length of the protein aligned amino acids Protein specific rates were estimated by regression fixed through the origin of these calibration points within eukaryotes arthropod chordate 0 993 Ga chordate nematode 1 177 Ga and plant animal fungi 1 576 Ga 38 During the course of the study it was discovered that the shape parameter of the gamma distribution used to account for rate variation among sites estimated by a likelihood method 45 differed consistently between calibration taxa average 1 99 and the overall data set 1 44 for each gene Fig 2 Therefore a dual gamma approach was taken whereby the eukaryote rate was estimated using the eukaryote gamma parameter and the time estimate involving prokaryotes was made using the overall gamma parameter There is insufficient evidence at present to determine whether or not this difference is biologically based related to the covarion model 46 or follows a simple scaling relationship with time or total protein distance If the relationship is scaled additional modification in methods may be necessary in the future We compared rates of change in archaebacterial versus eubacterial sequences using paralogous sequences those related by gene duplication as a root for relative rate tests 47 48 To examine rate differences between eukaryotic sequences and their closest prokaryote orthologs those representing the same gene we used the more distant prokaryote archaebacteria or eubacteria as root For examining rates in eukaryotic sequences derived from either archaebacteria or eubacteria we compared pairwise distances of the same taxa present in both locations e g one pair clustering with archaebacteria and the other with eubacteria in the same protein The discovery of rate differences among prokaryotes and eukaryotes required rate adjustments for all proteins and comparisons including those accepted in rate tests These adjustments were made by estimating time only with the eukaryote lineage or in the case of BC using a cyanobacterial rate adjusted by direct comparison of the cyanobacteria branch and eukaryote branch in rate tests For example the AK divergence time was estimated only with the K A calibration and the BC BK o and BK m divergence times were estimated only with the K B o calibration These restrictions further reduced the number of proteins available for time estimation to the following AK 36 total 21 constant rate BK o 25 16 BK m 7 5 BC 20 16 and Giardia eukaryotes 17 11 Modes were used in the MG approach as described previously 40 except with the BK m comparison where the median was used because of the small number of proteins The mode is preferred over the mean or median because it eliminates or reduces the effect of outliers e g unusually high estimates resulting from paralogous comparisons In this study a large number of overlapping bins was used initially to better define the distribution of time estimates followed by use of a smaller number of non overlapping bins and standard estimation of mode by interpolation This two step procedure was found to reduce the influence of bin size on mode estimation For the AD approach single gene distances and rates were weighted by sequence length and then combined distances were divided by combined rates Phylogeny estimation Phylogenetic trees 49 were constructed for each gene from amino acid data to assist in gene selection and interpretation A gamma distance was used for all trees with estimated from the entire data set 45 An analysis involving combined protein alignments was performed with maximum likelihood 50 neighbor joining 49 51 and maximum parsimony 51 using bootstrapping Bootstrap consensus trees show branch lengths estimated by ordinary least squares method 51 Bootstrap support 95 was considered significant
