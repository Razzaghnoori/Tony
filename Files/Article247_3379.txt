judges and other bureaucrats who ve gone months without The thin line being tightroped by the U N explains the paper is to assert its sole administrative authority without turning the KLA into an opponent In their shootings stories both the LAT and the WP make the near ritual it could have been worse point in this case because many of the children ordinarily at the center were off on a field trip The papers frame the episode with all the other mass shootings that have made news in the past year or so and report that President Clinton the governor of California and the mayor of L A did the
