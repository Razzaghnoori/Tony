 Background Identification of conserved protein domains that span a wide range of biological functions provide deep insights regarding the origin and evolution of complex biological systems These versatile conserved domains often have catalytic or structural roles that can be utilized with small variations in different contexts The P loop containing nucleotide phosphatase fold represents one such catalytic domain that is utilized in almost every conceivable biological system in all the three superkingdoms of life 1 2 Folds such as the SH3 like barrels the PAS like fold the OB fold the double stranded helix the propeller and rubredoxin like zinc ribbons are predominantly non catalytic domains that are widely represented in multiple functional contexts with roles such as small molecule binding nucleic acid binding and interaction with other proteins 3 4 5 see also the SCOP 6 and CATH 7 databases Versatile globular domains appear to have emerged fairly early in evolution in various fold classes such as the or mixed folds or the all and all folds 5 8 Comparative genomics and evolutionary studies indicate that many of these versatile folds probably emerged in contexts related to RNA binding in the ancient translation system and were subsequently re utilized in other biological systems 9 10 Of particular interest in this context are the small all folds that assume conformations such as barrels or helices 3 4 These structures have considerable potential for functional versatility because they are able either to accommodate small molecules within cavities formed by the curved sheets or to interact with various larger molecules especially nucleic acids or proteins via the external surfaces of the sheets A few ancient and widespread rich folds such as the SH3 like barrel and the OB fold appear to have colonized multiple functional niches early in evolution although their earliest versions may have had roles related to RNA metabolism 9 11 12 13 We were interested in identifying other such functionally versatile rich folds that could be traced back to the early stages of life s evolution The availability of extensive genome sequence data and advances in structure determination over recent years allow the successful application of comparative genomics sequence and structure comparisons to identify any such folds that may be somewhat less widely represented than the OB or SH3 like folds Here we identify one such barrel fold typified by the globular domain of the H subunit of the photosynthetic reaction center PRC H from purple proteobacteria such as Rhodopseudomonas viridis 14 15 The purple bacterial photosynthetic reaction center consists of three primary subunits of which PRC L and PRC M primarily bind the pigments involved in photochemistry whereas PRC H appears to be a key regulator of electron transfer between the quinones in photosynthetic reaction centers 16 So far homologs of the H subunit have only been found in photosynthetic proteobacteria 17 18 19 and the carboxy terminal globular domain of PRC H shows a distinct barrel fold that is structurally unrelated to other characterized barrels This raises the important question of the evolutionary provenance of this unique domain Here we use sequence profile analysis and comparative genomics to show that the barrel domain of PRC H defines a novel widespread superfamily of barrel domains that is represented in several bacterial plant and archaeal genomes We also show that this barrel domain is found in the conserved protein RimM which is involved in RNA processing and ribosomal assembly in the course of translation Thus we provide evidence for an unexpected evolutionary connection between RNA metabolism translation and the redox reactions in photosynthesis in the form of a shared functionally versatile barrel domain Results and discussion Identification of the PRC barrel domain The PRC H subunit is a membrane spanning protein with a single amino terminal transmembrane helix 14 15 Its crystal structure reveals a cytoplasmic region comprising a largely non globular segment followed by a barrel like structure The entire cytoplasmic region has been classified as a novel rich fold with no relatives in the SCOP database 6 However we observed that the most carboxy terminal part of the cytoplasmic region forms a distinct folding unit in the form of a six stranded barrel that could define a novel evolutionarily conserved domain Figure 1 A DALI search 20 of the PDB database with this barrel revealed no specific structural relationships with other folds such as the OB fold or the SH3 like barrel beyond the presence of curved sheets suggesting that it represents a domain with a distinct fold Figure 2 To further investigate its evolutionary relationships we used the sequence of this barrel unit from the PRC H protein gi 132177 residues 151 257 of Rhodopseudomonas viridis in a PSI BLAST 21 search of the non redundant NR database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information NCBI This search expect value e threshold for inclusion in profile 0 01 recovered in addition to the orthologs of the PRC H proteins from other purple proteobacteria several uncharacterized proteins from the cyanobacterium Anabaena for example all5315 and alr5332 iteration 2 e 10 6 10 4 non photosynthetic proteobacteria such as Mesorhizobium Sinorhizobium Brucella and Caulobacter for example SMc00885 iteration 4 e 10 4or CAC1676 iteration 5 e 10 6 several other assorted bacteria like Deinococcus Bacillus and Streptomyces for example YlmC iteration 4 e 10 5 and several archaea with completely sequenced genomes Interestingly in addition to these proteins this search also recovered the ribosome associated RimM protein from bacteria for example RimM Deinococcus radiodurans iteration 6 e 10 4 To establish the validity of these relationships we collected all the true positives detected in this search and clustered them on the basis of similarity obtained diverse representatives belonging to each cluster and seeded PSI BLAST searches with each of them The majority of these searches recovered approximately the same set of proteins with statistically significant e values For example a search started with the archaeal protein Ta0943 gi 10640258 whole length recovers RimM from Vibrio cholerae iteration 4 e 10 4 and the PRC H protein R viridis iteration 8 e 10 3 Although some of these searches converged prematurely they consistently recovered true positives detected in the other searches with at least borderline statistical significance e approximately 0 05 0 01 We prepared separate multiple sequence alignments of this region for all the major distinct clusters of the proteins detected in the above searches and predicted secondary structure for each of them The predicted secondary structure 22 corresponded perfectly with that of the barrel domain of the classic PRC H proteins Furthermore the smallest proteins with this region were detected in the Euryarchaea for example Ta0943 and their length of approximately 80 residues exactly corresponded to that of the barrel that forms a distinct folding unit seen in the PRC H subunit Consistent with this several proteins such as mll3685 from Mesorhizobium loti have duplications or triplications of this region which indicate that the boundaries of each repeat correspond perfectly to the barrel unit of PRC H These observations suggest that this region indeed defines a novel evolutionarily mobile domain of approximately 80 residues Figure 3 We named it the PRC barrel after the photosynthetic reaction center subunit H in which it was first observed Most of the sequence conservation in the PRC barrel is centered on the hydrophobic residues that stabilize the six strands of the domain Additionally there is a nearly invariant glycine Figure 3 that corresponds to the beginning of strand 2 and is likely to stabilize the first hairpin in the structure Beyond the conserved core there is considerable variability in the residues in the loops and these are likely to impart the specificity required for the diverse interactions of this superfamily Potential biological functions of the PRC barrels The experimentally characterized PRC barrel containing proteins possess diverse biological functions the PRC H subunits themselves are involved in photosynthesis in the purple bacteria 14 whereas RimM is a protein that associates with the 30S ribosomal subunit and is required for efficient translation and processing of 16S RNA 23 24 25 Gene disruption studies in Rhodobacter capsulatus indicate that loss of the PRC H subunit results in disruption of the reaction center and the light harvesting complex 1 and loss of photosynthetic growth 26 27 Biochemical studies have pointed out that the PRC barrel of the purple bacterial PRC H lies on the cytosolic face of the reaction center and directly affects the redox processes during the photosynthetic reaction 16 28 On photoactivation there is an electron transfer chain from the primary donor the bacteriochlorophyll molecules to the primary quinone and then to the secondary quinone A glutamate residue E173 in R viridis PRC H located in the loop between strand 2 and 3 of the PRC domain is in the vicinity of the secondary quinone of the reaction center The site directed mutagenesis of this glutamate severely retards the first and second electron transfers from the primary quinone that successively reduce the secondary quinone to semi quinone and quinol 16 The crystal structure of the reaction center reveals that this acidic residue of the PRC barrel is situated close to other acidic residues from the PRC L subunit which interact with the quinone 16 Thus the acidic residue in the loop between the PRC could act as a regulator of the electrostatic state of the reaction complex to potentiate electron transfer The multiple alignment Figure 3 of the PRC barrel reveals that this glutamate or an equivalent acidic residue is conserved in the majority of PRC barrels that are most closely related to the PRC H version In addition to the purple bacteria such versions are seen in the cyanobacteria proteobacteria such as rhizobia Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Brucella melitensis and Deinococcus radiodurans Figure 3 In the case of the cyanobacteria it is possible that some of the PRC H like proteins that contain an equivalent acidic residue might associate with their very distinct photosynthetic reaction centers 29 30 31 by analogy with their purple bacterial counterparts One of these proteins from Anabaena cylindrica is exclusively expressed in the spore like akinetes 32 though its actual function remains unknown The extensive spread of this version of the domain in non photosynthetic proteobacteria such as the rhizobia suggest that a similar mechanism of regulating electron transfers may perhaps be used in regulating non photosynthetic electron transfer reactions Many PRC barrels including those of the RimM family lack the acidic residue typical of those related to the PRC H subunit and required for redox regulation The crystal structure shows that the PRC barrel domain mediates a contact with the amino terminal cytoplasmic peptide of the PRC M subunit and also makes contacts with the other structurally less ordered regions of the PRC H polypeptide 14 15 Figure 1 This suggests that in addition to the specific electrostatic regulatory function the PRC barrel mediates specific interactions with other molecules through multiple surfaces These interactions are consistent with the foundational role postulated for the PRC H protein in the assembly of the reaction center 33 Such a protein protein interaction role in the assembly of complexes could be a potential function of the PRC barrels that do not possess the features suggestive of redox regulation Given that RimM specifically associates with the 30S ribosomal subunit rather than the fully assembled ribosome and participates in the maturation of the 16S rRNA 23 24 25 it is possible that the carboxy terminal PRC barrel could be used to bind RNA or proteins An acidic residue at the beginning of strand 3 and a patch of large and acidic residues at the extreme amino terminus of the PRC barrel that is specific to the RimM proteins are of particular interest in this regard Figure 3 On the basis of the structure of the PRC barrel it can be predicted that in RimM these residues are likely to line a cleft that may accommodate a peptide from an interacting protein Figures 1 3 Other surfaces of the PRC barrel in the RimM protein could interact with other proteins or alternatively interact with RNA The original report on the crystal structure of the photosynthetic reaction center suggested that the region corresponding to the PRC barrel of the PRC H subunit could bind a small molecule ligand 14 While the structure of the PRC barrels with a central aperture Figures 1 2 makes this a tempting possibility currently there is no evidence to support the possibility that these domains bind small molecule ligands Evolutionary history and diversification of the PRC barrels The phyletic patterns and relationships of the PRC barrels have a number of important implications including some for the evolution of the photosynthetic reaction center in bacteria Phylogenetic analysis and similarity based clustering show that these domains essentially form three large and distinct groups Figure 4 and at least two smaller clusters The PRC H subunits and their close relatives from cyanobacteria non photosynthetic proteobacteria and D radiodurans form the first of these groups They are represented in multiple copies in the proteomes of most proteobacteria In addition they are also seen in multiple copies in the cyanobacterium Anabaena the actinomycete Streptomyces coelicolor D radiodurans and the euryarchaeon Methanosarcina acetivorans In this group the PRC barrel occurs either linked to amino terminal transmembrane helices or as tandem repeats with up to three copies or linked to another helical repetitive domain also found in the Bacillus protein YsnF Figure 4 Most members of this group contain a negatively charged residue in the loop between strand 2 and 3 Figure 3 that could be implicated in electrostatic regulatory processes as in the case of PRC H proper The second major group is represented in all the euryarchaeal genomes available to date and is additionally found in a few Gram positive bacteria All proteins belonging to this class are the stand alone minimal version of the PRC barrel The third large group of these proteins comprises the RimM orthologs These are the most prevalent of all the PRC barrel proteins and are present in a single copy in all bacterial proteomes available to date and also in plants in the form of a chloroplast derived version The RimM proteins have an additional specific amino terminal strand rich domain with no detectable relationship to other domains In addition to these three major groups there is one small group that has representatives only in the cyanobacteria and plants Figures 2 4 and appears to contain more distant relatives of the PRC H like PRC barrels All members of this group contain two copies of the PRC barrel and in most cases one of these copies contains an acidic residue in the loop between strand 2 and 3 that might be equivalent to the classic PRC H like regulatory acidic residue The presence of a predicted amino terminal transit peptide in the plant proteins suggests that it probably functions in the chloroplast and that these proteins may in part have a regulatory function analogous to the PRC subunit The other small group typified by the Bacillus subtilis protein YrrD has so far been found only in the actinomycetes Gram positive bacteria and D radiodurans Figures 3 4 This group is most closely related to the above discussed plant cyanobacterial group and is ultimately a distant relative of the larger PRC H like group Most members of this group have duplicate copies of the PRC barrel domain and typically lack the acidic residue in the loop between strands 2 and 3 The phyletic pattern of RimM is reminiscent of proteins that for part of the ribosome or participate in RNA metabolism 9 Likewise the presence of the euryarchaeal type solo PRC barrels in every euryarchaeal genome despite the metabolic diversity of these euryarchaea suggests that these proteins probably have a core cellular function One likely possibility is that they function in RNA metabolism perhaps as the archaeal equivalents of RimM In contrast to these two groups of PRC barrels the PRC H like group and their more distant relatives have a phyletic distribution mainly limited to bacteria or archaea with large genomes and complex metabolism This suggests that they were perhaps derived later in bacteria evolution from a version involved in RNA metabolism The extensive presence of multiple copies of the PRC H like versions in diverse proteobacteria suggests that this particular form with the characteristic acidic residue was derived in their common ancestor A corollary to this is that these proteins probably functioned initially as regulators of electron transfer chains in non photosynthetic energy metabolism systems in the ancestral proteobacterium They were subsequently utilized in the photosynthetic reaction center after a subset of these bacteria acquired photosynthesis The phylogenetic tree supports a close relationship between some of the cyanobacterial PRC barrels and the PRC H proteins of the photosynthetic proteobacteria Figure 4 This implies that the cyanobacteria probably acquired these forms of the PRC barrel through lateral transfer from the purple bacteria and may have incorporated them as regulatory subunits into the organizationally distinct cyanobacterial photosystems 29 30 31 or into other uncharacterized electron transfer chains This is consistent with the previously observed case of horizontal transfer of proteobacterial reaction center genes including that for PRC H into the proteobacteria 34 Conclusions We show that the carboxy terminal barrel domain of the H subunit of the photosynthetic reaction center defines a novel all sheet fold representatives of which are widespread throughout the prokaryotic world Homologs of PRC H with a conserved acidic residue that has been shown to have a role in regulating electron transfer in the reduction of the secondary quinone of reaction centers are also found in non photosynthetic proteobacteria cyanobacteria D radiodurans and the archaeon M acetivorans It appears likely that the PRC H like version of the PRC barrels was first derived in the ancestral proteobacteria followed by dissemination into other lineages Probably these proteins originally functioned in non photosynthetic electron transfer chains and were subsequently incorporated into the photosynthetic apparatus after its emergence in the proteobacteria In addition this domain also appears to mediate specific protein protein interactions This is likely to be the principal role of versions of this domain present in the pan bacterial RimM proteins and other proteins widely distributed in bacteria and archaea A protein comprising only a stand alone copy of the PRC barrel is conserved in all the euryarchaeal proteomes available to date and by analogy with the RimM protein is predicted to function in RNA metabolism It seems possible that PRC barrels with a sporadic distribution and a regulatory function in energy metabolism or photosynthesis are likely to have been derived from more conserved and ancient versions that were probably involved in RNA metabolism The identification of this domain may help in the exploration of hitherto unexplored facets of diverse biological processes such as photosynthesis energy metabolism and RNA metabolism Materials and methods The non redundant NR database of protein sequences at NCBI was searched using the BLASTP program 21 Profile searches were conducted using the PSI BLAST program with either a single sequence or an alignment used as the query with a profile inclusion expectation E value threshold of e 0 01 and were iterated until convergence 21 35 Before use in PSI BLAST searches the PRC domain was evaluated for compositional bias using the SEG program 36 No such bias that could skew the statistics of sequence relationships in searches of the NR database was detected Accordingly to achieve maximum sensitivity all searches were run with the compositional bias based statistics turned off 37 Multiple alignments were constructed using the T_Coffee program 38 followed by manual correction based on the PSI BLAST results Structural manipulations were carried out using the Swiss PDB viewer program 39 and the ribbon diagrams were constructed with MOLSCRIPT 40 Searches of the PDB database with query structures was conducted using the program DALI 20 Protein secondary structure was predicted using a multiple alignment as the input for the program PHD 22 Signal peptides were predicted using SIGNALP 41 42 and the transmembrane regions were predicted using TOPRED 43 Phylogenetic analysis was carried out using the maximum likelihood neighbor joining and least squares methods 44 45 Briefly this involved the construction of a least squares tree using the FITCH program or a neighbor joining tree using the NEIGHBOR program both from the PHYLIP package 46 followed by local rearrangement using the Protml program of the Molphy package 42 to arrive at the maximum likelihood ML tree The statistical significance of various nodes of this ML tree was assessed using the relative estimate of logarithmic likelihood bootstrap Protml RELL BP with 10 000 replicates
