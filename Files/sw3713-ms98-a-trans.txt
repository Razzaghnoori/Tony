        okay       uh do you cook quite a bit   uh not really actually uh i live by myself and so most of my cooking is pretty basic you know just for myself but i cook when i go home my mom doesnt like to cook so i cook all my parents meals when i go home and thats about the only opportunity i like to but i just you know   thats good practice though   hard to get motivated to cook for yourself   i know when i was single it was uh i wouldnt cook much of anything i think one night i sauteed a pound of mushrooms and that was dinner   yeah   but uh well right now my husband and i live in uh uh subdivision that we have a dinner club thingy   oh   and what we do is once a month well meet at one house and the host will prepare the entree and provide the drinks and then every one else brings something   oh   and then it rotates from month to month you get together with four couples so you only host one time   thats pretty nice   it is really nice but uh   well what kind of things do you usually have i mean do you do you usually have like you know ethnic food do you try a different thing every time or   well we havent but i think thatd be great you know do Mexican one time or Chinese the next time thinking the next one we get into that ill do that but basically the host so far have just been picking you know what we have and then theyll let the people know and theyll uh uh ask people to bring something to compliment it but personally i like to prepare something that i could have done ahead of time   oh sure   because i cant talk and cook at the same time uh if i tried you know i i leave ingredients out  but uh   oh yeah   were suppose to be hosting next time im thinking of about having beef stroganoff because i can do that ahead of time   oh yeah my mom does that and freezes it a lot of times   and really   yeah   now now is this one of the dishes that you cook   huhuh         one of my moms bailiwick     its really simple so dont dont let it uh   i was going to say i kind of i do not know i do odd things i guess   what do you cook when you go home   um i guess last time i was home was at Christmas and i cooked um i bought some really good beef tenderloin at um Ralphs in Snider Plaza   umhum   and um i had i my parents have a deep freeze so i bought like oh God i want to say it was like four pounds and put it in the deep freeze and so i cooked one of them you know and basically have you ever used that DV sauce   no what is it   its like um a meat a beef enhancer or something like that   umhum   i mean it might not i i havent really looked at the ingredients and it may be one of those things where if if it may have MSG in it i really havent really looked i do not think it does but it might but   that doesnt bother me anyway so   uh you know i kind of like sprinkle some of that on it  and then take like you know pieces of cloves of garlic and sort of push them down into the meat   oh you sound like my husband hes a garlic freak too   and then yeah and then bake it you know and it it always turns out really good i mean course you know the better the the the quality of the meat the better it turns out but     umhum   you know and if you can leave it out on the counter for a little bit and you know to soak in the the garlic and everything you know that works pretty well but you know thats kind of thats kind of basic and i can do some Chinese and junk like that but   umhum do you uh stir fry   some sometimes um i had one but i loaned it to somebody and they never gave it back   do you have a wok well id call them up   so i kind of just use a skillet really   probably works just as well   oh yeah   thats something you know we dont do all that often and every time we do it i think why dont we cook this way more often because it is healthy you get a lot of vegetables and everything   sure and the easy see now that would be an easy thing to do for the dinner party because you could do that in advance you know you i would just get like um       you could use do chicken or beef either one and you know kind of chop it up into about inch cubes you know and the marinade i think that is like um   umhum   oh like a cup of water and maybe three tablespoons of   soy sauce   soy and one tablespoon of Lea and Perrins or Worcestershire Worcestershire sauce or whatever sauce i cant pronounce it   umhum uhhuh   i always call it Lea and Perrins because i cant say the name of it and uh garlic and chopped green onions and then you know chop up all of your meat like the night before and stick it in a tupperware dish with the     umhum   you know with the stuff and let it marinade over night and then just strain out you know the juice and um you know then then you know stir fry the meat and um you can get the cans of sliced water chestnuts and bamboo shoots and   umhum   you can put mushroom
