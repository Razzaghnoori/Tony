                     OK         This is the first interview for  with my step mom Linda Wentz                     Hello                                       Sorry um Linda grew up in a small town in WV called Buckhannon         Linda what did you like         think about living there         What did you think about living there         Sorry                     Well I when I was a little kid I didnt really think a whole lot about it except that was my home         I loved the house that I lived in when I was a little girl and it was very small and I lived on a street called Fayette St and it had a wonderful maple tree in the front and I liked to climb it I was a tomboy         So one of my favorite things do to was you know rollerskate and climb trees         I had a little I have three brothers at the time when I was smaller I only had two because my youngest brother Jimmy hadnt been born yet         So my younger brother Jimmy and I and the next door neighbors would play and I guess really Buckhannon was like a very wonderful town to grow up in because there wasnt a lot of crime it was just very safe a very safe place                     How long have you lived in Lincolnton NC                     Nine years                              OK         Um youre now married to the man that you dated in high school         How did you meet him in high school                     Well actually I met him in junior high         And I was in the seventh grade and he was in the ninth grade         And um at lunchtime what we did was we would go to the gym and everybody would eat their lunch in the gym on the bleachers and they would have they would play records and then the kids would dance         Of course you know I was very skinny I was cute but not the kind of girl that guys were looking at and I but I used to watch your dad dance with all the other girls and he was a wonderful dancer and I really liked him         Used to sit and look at the kids dance and Id listen to Beetles songs         I would look at Larry and I had picked him as the one Id always wanted to dance with and it wasnt until we got into high school that he noticed me         And I was in a         a talent show with my girlfriend and we did a modern dance to Pink Panther and after that my phone didnt stop ringing for awhile         And your dad called me and asked me if I wanted to go out with is best friend Tom Rigger and I said Never         This guy was not my type and so he said Would you like to go out with me         and I said Yes I would and so thats when we started dating                     Why did you like him         Besides the fact that he could dance                     Well he was very handsome and I um loved his smile had a beautiful smile         And he was you know just tall and thin and there was just something about him that I found very very attractive         And he was funny and I liked to laugh         Well we just I really fell kind of madly in love with him         at                      What do you miss most about not living in Buckhannon WV                     Nothing                  As a child I loved it but as I grew up there just really wasnt a whole lot that Buckhannon had to offer other than the fact that you know was where my memories of childhood are and my parents         And I like going home to visit my parents and seeing my friends but as far as wanting to live there I wouldnt                     OK I think yall have a phone call         Lets pause for a momentRECORDING PAUSED THEN RESUMED                     OK were back         What are some funny words that you first heard in NC that youd never heard before that made you laugh                     Well I guess the first funny world I heard was Hey         And I couldnt figure out what everyone was talking about         You know theyd say Hey how you doing          And you know we always say                       Hay is for horses                              Or hi or hello and so that that this was kind of funny to me         Another one of the things that everyone says here youll say something to them and theyll say Well         They say well a lot its just a I dont know what something that they use to say when they dont know what else to say                     Its a hesitation                     A hesitation         Yeah well and uh another interesting word was picking         I went right into the school system and I was teaching and um it was a little awkward at times and the kids were they would tease and instead of saying you know Im teasing they would say                       Hello baby                              They would say Mrs Wentz and a you know another thing theyd make syllables where there isnt even any syllables at all         They would they would make syllables for instance my name is Wentz         It was Mrs Wentz just picking Mrs Wentz         And ill to me that is when youre sick but people here say Well I was just really ill which means they were upset or angry or something like that                     OK what about Sundrop         Do you like it         Does         Is it a drink of your choice                                                               Lots of people around here seem to think it is         its a whats it called         drink of the gods                     Um well I you know I think its OK but its nothing that I was that I would want everyday         That or Cheery Cheerwine         Those those are two drinks that I dont crave                     OK Oh what do you think is uh         best movie of the century         Since its almost the year                                           Oh um The Sound of Music                     Why                     Why         Well I guess I well I love Julie Andrews and I like I really love the music thats in The Sound of Music         I like the whole background the plot         And everything         And um it just makes me feel good         In fact I watched it three times th this past Christmas because I hadnt seen it in awhile and I loved it so much that I had to watch it over and over again                     OK um since we are talking about a movie based in Europe         Where are your ancestral roots Linda                              Well my fathers family came from Germany         My last name is Stonicker         And um         one of my grandparents was also from France         So theres theres sort of a mixture there         And my mothers family her last name was Corley         And she was I think                                Irish                              Irish yeah so I guess it would be kind of a GermanIrish mix                     Do you miss your dad who lived in Buckhannon WV         And what are some special qualities about him that you can talk about                              Yeah I miss my dad         I miss my mom         But my mom is in heaven         My dad is a very very special man         He um he grew up in WV and he um played football when he was in high school and he went right into the service and he was in WWII he was a medic in the army         And he was over in Europe         In fact I was just talking to him this last Thanksgiving about some of the things that he went through when he was in the service and and traveling across the sea on these boats that had flat bottoms and they would go way up in the in the water and then smack down you know it was very rough         They left out of NY and went to Scotland         And um he said you would look out if you were up on deck and the waves the swells were way up higher than than the boat itself and looked like you were going to drown         But the Queen Mary was right beside to them         They were in a fleet         And the WACs were on the Queen Mary and you know they just had a smooth sailing trip when these poor guys in the army you know they were just so sick almost every day because of the the boats and everything         But I my dad is um hes just a very sweet man         You know my mothers been gone for four years         And he has hes  years old         And he takes care of the house wonderfully         When we came home for Thanksgiving dinner he had everything prepared had the turkey in the oven and everything ready         Hes just a really fine guy                                          Hes  years old                  Hes a retired driller         He drilled wells all of his life all over WV VA and KY                              OK         Thats nice                                                                        Um did         um where where did you go to college at         And why did you want to be an artist                     Well   I wanted to be an artist when I was little girl         The first painting that I did that I really remember was a finger painting that I did of one of my dolls         And it was just so exciting to me and I was probably only about five years old         But I propped my doll up and I had my finger paints and I looked at her and I did this portrait of her and it was just really good to me Im sure to anyone else it was like Yeah right         But I wanted that was just something that I really enjoyed doing         That and dancing         I wanted to be a ballerina         The ballerina part never came about but I I did go on to college and I um transferred a lot and ended up going to a lot of different colleges which was kind of fun         I went to Marshall University and I went to University of Pittsburgh and I ended up graduating from West Virginia University with a major in printmaking and a minor in art history and English literature                     Did you ever visit the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh         Because that is where he was he grew up         And do do you enjoy Andy Warhol                     Well you know thats really funny but I dont remember visiting the Andy Warhol Museum                     Did you know that was where he was from                     No         But I didnt I studied Andy Warhol briefly         I mean I didnt go an indepth study of him or that type of art                     I think he took his first art lessons at Carnegie Museum                       Carnegie Mellon                               Yeah whatever Carnegie                               Carnegie Mellon                              When he was a kid and thats how he got interested in art                     Umhmm                     But he I think that his         parents were Eastern European                     Umhmm                     And they were like lived in the nasty little section where all the mills were and stuff         But anyway         Um whos your favorite artist                     Well I really liked the Impressionists I liked Monet and Renoir Mary Cassatt I um loved studying all of the artists         I loved art history         I loved Michelangelos sculptures and his paintings and the Renaissance era                  Rembrandt did the etchings and you know that was interesting to me because you know thats what I ended up doing was printmaking         But I I like the light and the pastels colors that are in the Impressionists                              What do you think about the current trends in art modern art         Which some conservative people might consider offensive and disturbing         Especially the antireligious art                     Umhmm well art has always been controversial and has always reflected what is going on in the world         You know and um so you know having studied art history that doesnt it doesnt shock me or surprise me that much         And I you know I dont like it personally because         you know it does offend me what what I have seen and I dont like the idea that we are giving the money to create extremely offensive art but um again that thats you know is art reflects whats going on and art is is very spiritual regardless of whether its content says you know something about God or not there there has a very spiritual quality about it         Its very powerful                     Um OK         I watched a special on Norman Rockwell the other night on PBS and some consider him not an artist but just an illustrator         What are your comments on that                              Well that is a a statement that Ive heard used in art a lot         I personally I was accused of being an illustrator which its interesting that I would even use the word accuse because it seems like there is a lot of prejudice in art and of what people say is art with quotation marks around it         And uh Norman Rockwell was a tremendous artist         He was a he was a you know he was a realist         And regardless of whether someone calls it illustrative or not         It it is art and it is wonderful art and he has captured a whole era you know he captured people and and people that who you could look into their faces and you could tell everything about them         You know so people in my field in my experience when I was in college one of the things that I exp you know had to deal with was other peoples opinion of what art is and especially my instructors saying You need to be more cryptic or You need to be more esoteric your art is too transparent or too happy         You know well thats me                       All writers have to be suicidal in order to be considered brilliant Im so sick of that         Why does everyone have kill their selves or be moody just to be considered a good writer or artist                     Well one of the things the art world is looking for is you know um emotion         They want an emotion to be evoked you know when you look at something         Art art whether its writing or or um drama or visual or music you know theres a term that Shakespeare used         It was catharsis you know and people want to exper they want to experience something         And I guess even in writing um          theres so many unhappy people in the world and it seems like you know when they read something and can relate to it then they get some kind of release or relief in their emotions by identifying with it and that could be why there seems to be such a demand for that sort of thing         And uh but on the other hand theres the happy people you know and I am one of them         Im just a happy person and my art reflects that and I think that I you know love to read stories that are written and everything that also you know have a good moral background to them and something where you can learn something of value and virtue in it like Louisa May Alcott you know her work I love her work         So you know theres two sides to that coin         We just have to find the right audience                     OK thank you for your comments Linda         Again her names Linda Wentz and shes my step mom who lives a quick  minutes away from Charlotte in Lincolnton NC
