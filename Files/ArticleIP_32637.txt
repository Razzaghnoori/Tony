 Pope John Paul II In the early evening of Oct 16 1978 the newly elected Pope John Paul II appeared on the balcony of St Peter s Basilica and told the crowd that he had accepted election even though I was afraid in receiving the nomination If so it was the first and last time that the former Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Krakow had known fear Six days later when he was invested as pope John Paul II was commending the Christianity of courage Echoing the assurances of the angel who told Mary of Nazareth that she would conceive and bring forth the son of God the 58 year old pope told the throng in St Peter s Square Be not afraid John Paul II is not afraid of religion s cultured despisers of geopoliticians who find his near pacifism naive of liberal Catholics who accuse him of betraying the spirit of the Second Vatican Council Vatican II of feminists who suspect that he sees only two acceptable roles for women virgin and mother He is unafraid of his own infirmity caused by advancing age and by the residual effects of a 1981 assassination attempt Finally and perhaps most interesting John Paul II has intimated that he might be unafraid even of a downsizing of the papal authority his charisma has done so much to dramatize Born in 1920 to the wife of a Polish soldier the future pope was a precocious intellectual actor and poet who worked in a quarry and a chemical plant during World War II Imbued with the popular Catholicism of Poland marked by effusive devotion to the Virgin Mary an aspect of John Paul II s spirituality that discomfits Protestants and liberal Catholics Wojtyla began studies for the priesthood in 1942 in an underground seminary made necessary by the Nazi occupation After the war he studied in Rome boarding an ecclesiastical fast track auxiliary bishop of Krakow in 1958 archbishop in 1964 and cardinal in 1967 Though Communist officials regarded him as more pliable than other churchmen he proved unafraid to confront them in the cause of freedom for the Polish church When Wojtyla was elected pope after the 33 day reign of the Italian John Paul I the international press portrayed him as the darkest of dark horses In hindsight his ecclesiastical networking during and after Vatican II made him a logical candidate once it was clear no Italian cardinal could win election The rest is history from which liberal and conservative Catholics draw strikingly contrary conclusions The pope took the Gospel and his magnetic personality on the road forsaking the throne on which past popes were carried through St Peter s Basilica for the Popemobile The year after his election John Paul II returned to Poland for nine days and encountered a rhapsodic reception that more than one biographer credits with helping to sow the seeds of the Solidarity movement s later challenge to the Communist regime Elsewhere on his world tour which has passed through 119 countries he kept faith with his predecessors John XXIII and Paul VI in defending the dignity of workers and anathematizing the arms race He called for negotiations rather than the use of force in the Gulf War and in Bosnia and Kosovo He has been critical of international sanctions against Iraq and he hopes next year to visit the birthplace of the biblical patriarch Abraham there These and similar initiatives pleased political liberals inside and outside the church not so the Vatican s use of its quasigovernmental status to oppose population control initiatives that the pope feared would contribute to the culture of death The style of John Paul II s papacy has occasioned as much comment as its substance Past popes were remote and magisterial figures but capitalizing on his relative youth his actor s panache and a mastery of mass communications John Paul II changed all that unafraid of diluting the papal mystique through overexposure The pope s roadshow has never had an exclusively Catholic cast He has met with Rome s chief rabbi and has joined in worship with Lutheran bishops and in a historic 1982 ceremony in Canterbury Cathedral with the spiritual leader of the Church of England which broke with Rome in the 16 th century Some would dismiss this as photo op ecumenism and note that Anglicans are not invited to take Holy Communion in Roman Catholic churches despite agreements by an Anglican Roman Catholic theological commission on the meaning of that sacrament Anglicans were also dismayed when Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger the pope s doctrinal watchdog signed a document that seemed to rehabilitate a much criticized 1896 papal bull declaring the holy orders of Anglican clergy absolutely null and utterly void It isn t only in his policy toward other churches that John Paul II is accused of preaching reform and practicing reaction Vatican II gave rise to a less hierarchical and more outward looking Catholicism and set the stage for once unthinkable innovations like plainclothes nuns and the celebration of the Mass in English and other modern languages Liberal Catholics concede that John Paul II may follow the letter of the council s decrees but mindful that the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life 2 Corinthians 3 6 they see in Vatican II a trajectory of further change that this pope has frustrated John Paul II is not oblivious to these criticisms just contemptuous of them It is his duty he writes in Crossing the Threshold of Hope to interpret Vatican II correctly and defend it from tendentious interpretations It seems the pope enjoys confounding his critics He recalls that on one trip to Poland he offended local adherents of the enlightened agenda by emphasizing the Ten Commandments For such people he said the Pope becomes persona non grata when he tries to convince the world of human sin Much of the liberal Catholic case against the pope deals with sexuality It is even said that he has a woman problem which supposedly finds expression in his defense of church positions on an all male clergy contraception and abortion Yes abortion is anathema to John Paul II who is bemused by suggestions that he has an obsession with the subject but he condemns abortion because he sees it as not only anti life but also anti woman The pope has endorsed sexual equality in the workplace and in society but there is no doubt that he subscribes to a Christian version of difference feminism In a 1988 apostolic letter on the dignity and vocation of women the pope warned that in the name of liberation from male domination women must not appropriate to themselves male characteristics contrary to their own feminine originality What is so original about women In a 1962 retreat for university students in Krakow the future pope espousing what sounds like the Gospel According to Carol Gilligan told female participants that women are more feeling and intuitive people and become involved in things in a more sensitive and complete manner In separate remarks to male students Wojtyla argued that in men the intellect has a certain supremacy over the heart and this is why Christ entrusted responsibility for the Gospel as idea to them This view of sexual differences suggests that for John Paul II opposition to women priests is not simply a tradition inherited from his predecessors or even an emulation of Jesus decision to call only men as apostles For John Paul II as for Paul VI the male monopoly on priesthood is required by theological anthropology The pope has ratcheted up its importance by decreeing that the male monopoly on priesthood is an article of faith that must be definitively held by all the Church s faithful His obstinacy on the issue is cited as proof that John Paul II is indifferent to one of the major themes of Vatican II Christian reunion The picture is more complicated While the pope has warned the archbishop of Canterbury that the ordination of women as Anglican priests poses an increasingly serious obstacle to reconciliation between Rome and Canterbury he has indicated a surprising willingness to compromise on a seemingly more fundamental obstacle to reunion the papacy itself In a 1995 encyclical John Paul II broached the possibility that in the interests of Christian unity he or his successors might find a way of exercising the papal primacy which while in no way renouncing what is essential to its mission is nonetheless open to a new situation He went on to note that in the first 1 000 years of Christianity the bishop of Rome acted by common consent as moderator when Christians disagreed about belief or discipline This tantalizing suggestion of a scaled down papal office was seized on by the Anglican Roman Catholic International Commission this May in a report that suggested Anglicans should accept a circumscribed papal primacy as a gift to be shared The pope s suggestion also dovetails with a new interest among some Protestant theologians in a universal primate who would serve as a focus of unity for world Christianity What it does not comport with ironically is the papal role as John Paul II has so effectively enlarged it Would a tiebreaker bishop of Rome have any use for an airplane or a Popemobile Here is perhaps the ultimate example of John Paul II s fearlessness a willingness at least to consider some diminution in the scope of his office in exchange for an improvement on the current imperfect unity of Christendom But churches that ordain female clergy might have their own woman problem in accepting a scaled back papacy that came with theological strings attached The pope surely knows this which suggests that his target might not be the churches of the Reformation but the Orthodox and other ancient churches of the East Although estranged from Rome for hundreds of years these tradition rich churches long have fascinated John Paul II who comes from a part of the world where Latin and Byzantine Christianity overlap And one more thing The Eastern churches do not and likely never will ordain women
