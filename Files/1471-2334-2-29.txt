 Background Infection with the hepatitis C virus HCV occurs primarily through percutaneous exposure to contaminated blood or blood products Unlike most other viral hepatitis infections that tend to be acute hepatitis C infections are often chronic and persist for decades 1 2 3 The long term sequelae of chronic HCV infections include increased risks of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma 4 5 HCV infection is a major public health problem in Egypt 6 7 8 Blood bank and community based surveys conducted in Egypt have reported sero prevalence rates of HCV to be as high as 40 in some parts of the country 9 10 11 12 These rates are substantially higher in the Nile Delta region compared with the rest of the country 13 Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection transmitted to humans from snails that harbor the parasite Most rural and peri urban areas located in the Nile Delta are in close proximity to the distributaries of the Nile River or irrigation canals drawn from the Nile These slow flowing waters are infested with snails that serve as the vector for the schistosomal parasite Schistosomiasis infections in addition to HCV are hyperendemic in the Nile Delta region 14 In the 1960s 1970s and early 1980s mass campaigns were conducted to treat schistosomiasis infections in these areas during which individuals older than 5 years of age were treated with tartar emetic injections 15 Sero surveys conducted in the 1990 s in Egypt have reported positive associations between HCV infections and a history of schistosomiasis or a history of having received injections for the treatment of schistosomiasis 9 12 13 16 Based on this evidence the studies suggest that inadequately sterilized needles and syringes used during the campaign were probable causes for transmission of HCV in the region Since all the studies were conducted as cross sectional surveys it is not possible to know whether the HCV infections were pre existing at the time of the treatment campaigns or whether they were incident infections as a consequence of the campaigns The studies have also reported low prevalence rates in the younger age groups and high prevalence rates for the older ages suggesting that individuals infected between the 1960 s to the early 80 s are now older and more likely to be sero positive compared to those born after the campaigns A limitation of most of the published studies is the implicit assumption in their analyses that all the individuals in the survey are independent of each other and that infection rates are uniformly distributed both within and across all households in the community If the suggested nosocomial mechanism of transmission were true the assumption that infection rates are uniformly distributed would not be valid because HCV infections will tend to cluster within households that participated in the campaign compared to households that did not The uniform distribution assumption is further complicated by the existence of sub groups of high risk and low risk individuals within each house based on their date of birth If a household participated in the campaign and has an infected member there is a greater likelihood that another member who resided in the same house at the time of the campaign will be infected but a low likelihood that an individual born within the same house after the campaign period will be infected We postulate that an entire household was more likely to have participated in the campaign if at least one member of the household had a history of schistosomiasis and received treatment by injections compared to houses in which no member reported a past history and parenteral treatment for schistosomiasis Based on this premise we would expect clustering of HCV infection in households in which one or more members reported having received parenteral treatment for schistosomiasis if the underlying reason for the spread of HCV infection was in fact attributable to the treatment campaign Using the HCV infection status of individuals participating in a community based sero survey conducted in the Nile delta of rural Egypt we tested the following hypotheses to assess if the schistosomiasis treatment campaigns were associated with transmission of HCV i Participation by village residents in the schistosomiasis treatment campaigns were likely to cluster within houses with members of a house more likely to participate in the campaign if at least one member participated ii Clustering of HCV infections within houses is more likely among houses that participated in the treatment campaigns compared to those that did not Methods Site The study was conducted in Kalama a semi urban area in Qalyub District of the Qualyabia Governorate The village is located on the south east edge of the Nile River delta approximately 19 km north of Heliopolis Cairo Egypt Irrigated farmlands and canals surround the village a feature typical of the Nile delta The village has a population of approximately 17 000 residents living in about 2400 houses Agriculture is the primary occupation Residents live in small single story homes either as single nuclear families or extended families with multiple related nuclear families residing within the same house The median household size was 7 persons at the time of the study Population and sero survey Details of the study have been described elsewhere 16 Briefly after conducting a census in December 1994 the village was divided into 12 geographic sectors Every 15 thhouse was then systematically sampled for participation in a sero survey Of a total of 172 sampled houses 168 98 household heads agreed to participate Between January and June 1995 after obtaining written informed consent we conducted a sero survey and administered a questionnaire to the study participants soliciting medical and behavioral risk factors for liver disease History of schistosomiasis was obtained by interview in which participants were asked whether they had ever received a diagnosis of schistosomiasis Regardless of their histories all participants were further queried about past treatment for schistosomiasis and whether the treatment was with oral drugs injections or both Approximately 7 ml of blood was then obtained via a venipuncture from each participant Persons under 10 years of age were excluded from the sero survey because earlier work in Kalama demonstrated HCV infection to be rare in this age group 12 Baseline socio demographic information was collected at the time of the census Household socio economic status was classified as high medium or low according to a locally developed scale Details of the laboratory methods used to detect anti HCV antibodies have been described elsewhere 16 Briefly serum from the blood samples was screened for anti HCV antibodies by EIA Abbot Laboratories All EIA reactive sera were evaluated with either the second or third generation recombinant immunoblot assays Chiron Corporation as confirmatory tests Positive results by either of the immunoblot assays were considered to be HCV positive positive for anti HCV antibodies Statistical methods For baseline comparisons of the HCV positive and negative individuals we used the chi square test or Fisher s Exact test when there was sparse data for categorical variables For dimensional variables the t test was used to compare the two groups when the data was normally distributed and the Mann Whitney U test when assumptions of normality were not met To test for intra and inter class clustering of HCV infections we used a modified formulation of the Generalized Estimating Equations GEE The original formulation of GEE also referred to as GEE1 17 is used in the analysis of correlated data in which clustering is treated as a nuisance factor that needs to be taken into account at the analysis stage This approach uses a working correlation matrix to model the correlation between the repeated or related observations for an individual or a cluster while simultaneously adjusting for covariates in a generalized linear model With the new formulation also referred to as GEE2 or Alternating Logistic Regression ALR clustering can be treated as a parameter of interest on which we can perform hypothesis testing 18 19 20 Instead of specifying a correlation matrix an OR is computed for each cluster in this approach to detect clustering among related observations Since the outcome of our study is binary HCV positive or negative we describe the approach for binary outcomes For a family of size n if Y j is the HCV status 0 negative 1 positive of the j thindividual we define log Pr Y j 1 Pr Y j 0 0 1 x 1j 2 x 2j m x mj 1 where the x s are m covariates for the j thindividual For most analyses the x s are variables that describe the baseline characteristics or are confounding variables These variables could be specific to the j thindividual such as age and gender or could be common for the entire family e g race or socio economic status of the family The s are the regression parameters to be estimated We next define the odds ratio OR between the j thand k thmembers of the family as The odds ratio is a commonly used measure of association for categorical variables and assumes the values between zero and infinity An odds ratio equal to one suggests the lack of an association between individuals In equation 2 an OR 1 for each of the N C 2 number of ways in which we can select 2 out of N pairs of members within a house indicates the absence of clustering of disease within the family On the other hand an odds ratio greater than one will indicate clustering of disease within the families It should be noted that the OR defined in 2 is not the same OR that one conventionally uses to measure the association between exposure and disease in case control or observational studies The OR in 2 describes the odds of disease or no disease for another member in the same cluster given that a member is affected or unaffected We henceforth refer to this OR as OR for clustering Such ORs are commonly used to describe familial aggregation of disease in genetic studies 21 The OR can be modeled for subclasses or sub clusters within the main cluster as log OR jk z 3 Where z indicates the class membership of the j k pair within the house For example if we consider adults within a house to be members of class a and children to be members of class c then log OR jk aa cc or ac depending on whether the j k pair are adults children or an adult child pair From equation 3 we thus obtain two intra class ORs namely e aaand e ccfor adults and children respectively and one inter class OR namely e acbetween adults and children A significant aa or cc is suggestive of clustering within adults or within children whereas a significant ac is indicative of the existence of a correlation between adults and children When z 1 there is a single class and the equation models a constant log odds across all the clusters Estimates for s and s are obtained by simultaneous estimation of the parameters from equations 1 and 3 thereby adjusting the ORs for covariates introduced in 1 Further details on the formulation estimation methods features of the model and properties of the estimators have been published elsewhere 18 19 20 To model sub groups of high and low risk groups within houses we chose an age cutoff of 15 years based on an examination of the age specific prevalence within our study and based on reports stating that parenteral treatment of schistosomiasis was stopped between 1982 and 1986 with the introduction of praziquintal an oral drug used to treat the disease 22 Further children under 5 years of age were not eligible for receiving injections during the campaigns Since children born in 1981 would have been 14 years of age at the time of our 1995 HCV study it can be safely assumed that they were not present at the time of the schistosomiasis campaigns This age cutoff has also been used in other studies 13 We conducted our analysis using the ALR implementation of GEE in SAS V8 02 SAS Institute Inc Cary NC Since we assume that the parenteral treatment for schistosomiasis in the campaigns for the entire house occurred around the same time to model the correlation between the members of the house ordering of individuals within the house cluster is not relevant Hence to model the OR for clustering of schistosmiasis treatment in the house an exchangeable log odds ratio was assumed With an exchangeable log odds ratio a constant OR for clustering is assumed for all houses To estimate the degree of clustering of HCV infections a history of parenteral treatment of schistosomiasis in the house was considered to be a blocking factor Separate log odds ratios were estimated for each block with the assumption that the log odds ratios are constant within each block Results The study sample contained 910 age eligible individuals residing in 168 houses Of these 810 88 agreed to participate in the study and provided blood samples The number of participants within these houses ranged from 1 to 20 members with a median inter quartile range of 4 2 6 members Anti HCV antibodies were evaluated for 796 98 of the blood samples collected A total of 321 40 subjects were sero reactive to HCV Individuals positive for HCV were significantly older than those who were negative p 001 Other variables measured at baseline were comparable for the two groups Although not statistically significant HCV seropositive individuals were more frequently males and of low socio economic status table 1 Age specific HCV positive prevalence rates increase around 15 years of age suggesting the possibility of a cohort effect table 2 The sero prevalence of anti HCV antibodies was 11 95 CI 6 16 for children under 15 years of age compared to 47 95 CI 43 51 for those 15 years or older p 0001 Fifty adults reported receiving injections for the treatment of schistosomiasis Houses in which an adult member reported receiving parenteral treatment were more likely to have other adult members with histories of parenteral treatment for schistosomiasis The OR for clustering of individuals receiving parenteral treatment was 2 44 95 CI 1 47 4 06 p 0 001 suggesting that past participation in the treatment campaigns tended to cluster within houses Among the 746 individuals who reported no history of schistosomiasis or no parenteral treatment for diagnosed schistosomiasis the prevalence of HCV was 38 compared to 68 for the 50 individuals who reported receiving the treatment p 0001 Examination of the degree of clustering of HCV infections among houses with members that received parenteral treatment indicated that there was a significant degree of clustering of HCV infections in such houses After adjusting for individual level effects of age and gender and household characteristics such as socio economic status and risk group based on eligibility for participation in the schistosomiasis treatment campaigns all of which were significant confounding variables the OR for clustering of HCV infections was 1 76 95 CI 1 05 2 95 p 05 table 3 In contrast the OR for clustering of HCV infections among houses in which no member reported a history of parenteral treatment for a past schistosomiasis infection was 1 37 95 CI 0 92 2 05 p 0 12 If we inappropriately used logistic regression and treated all participants to be independent of each other the odds of HCV infection among members reporting previous parenteral schistosomiasis treatment compared to those who did not after adjusting for the same confounding variables was 1 55 95 CI 0 81 2 98 p 0 19 Discussion Our analysis reveals that there is significant amount of clustering of HCV infections within houses of the study village and that the infections are not distributed uniformly across the village We also demonstrate that some households were more likely to have participated in the schistosomiasis treatment campaigns compared to others and that the clustering of HCV infections were more likely among the households that participated in the treatment campaigns In the general population based on the time period during which the treatment campaigns were conducted and the ensuing age distribution of the HCV infections obtained from multiple cross sectional surveys a temporal and possible causal relationship between these two events has been suggested 13 Our study adds to this finding by studying these two events within the same population thus providing further evidence that the spread of HCV in the Nile Delta region was associated with the schistosomiasis treatment campaign The observation that households were more likely to have participated in the treatment campaign if any member within the house participated in the campaign is corroborated by the manner in which the treatment campaigns were conducted Unlike mass campaigns conducted for vaccinations where house to house visits are made and residents are immunized the treatment campaigns were conducted at centralized health care facilities such as hospitals and clinics In some instances these clinics were rolling clinics established temporarily at the villages This situation makes it likely that entire households rather than random individuals would have visited the clinics based on factors such as proximity risk of schistosomiasis infection to the household and socio economic status Indeed our analysis finds that socio economic status of a house was strongly predictive of whether an individual tests positive for HCV after adjusting for the effects of clustering Potential limitations of this study need to be mentioned Since reports of receiving injections for treatment of schistosomiasis were by recall it is possible that inaccuracies in the recall might have biased the results of the study Additionally it is possible that a report by one member of the family potentially influences the response of another family member during the interview process Such related responses will artificially tend to show clustering of participation in the treatment campaigns within the houses However since testing of sera for HCV antibodies for the members of the family was done without knowledge of which sera belonged to which family and since clustering of HCV infections was observed within families independent of the participation in the treatment campaigns it is unlikely that the clustering of the individuals participation in the treatment campaigns were solely due to biased reporting since there is an a priori reason to believe that such clustering is possible on the basis of the manner in which the campaigns were conducted It could be stated that familial clustering of HCV infections may be due to other factors or behaviors that are related to an increased risk of schistosomiasis as well as an increased risk of HCV infections Alternatively certain household behaviors such as health care practices or tendency to visit providers who use unsafe treatment methods could also result in clustering of HCV infections within the families If this were true and was the sole explanation for the clustering of HCV infections within the household we would expect to see HCV infections in the younger children too who were not present in the households at the time of the treatment campaigns within such families However our previous work in this village found HCV infections among children less than 10 years of age to be extremely rare thus making it less likely that unmeasured factors might be influencing this association Despite the use of oral drugs for the treatment of schistosomiasis during the past two decades HCV antibodies were detected in some children below 15 years of age Vertical transmission of HCV from infected mother to infant occurs in approximately 5 of HCV infected mothers and is reported to increase with increasing viral loads 23 Prospective studies could help determine the relative contribution of vertical and horizontal transmission of HCV infections observed in these children Most previous studies that have that have found associations between histories of schistosomiasis and HCV have either been designed as surveys or have used ecologic associations While ecologic associations are very useful for generating hypotheses one should be cautious in trying to make individual level inferences from population based observations because of the multiple sources of biases associated with such study designs 24 After using the appropriate analytic methods our results provide further evidence for an association between the parenteral schistosomiasis treatment campaigns and the transmission of HCV infections in Egypt Competing interests None declared Authors contributions MR conceptualized the problem wrote the manuscript and conducted the analysis MD and ND collected the
