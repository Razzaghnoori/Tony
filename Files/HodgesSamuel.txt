 Okay this is Paul Martini Ah it s ah April 14th at about six o clock on Friday and we re here with Sam Hodges and he s going to tell us a story he heard ah when you were a child is that right Yeah basically when I was a child And how old were you when you heard the story Umm I d say I was in actually Cub Scouts at the time so I guess that would put me about probably about about eight or nine Eight or nine that s So Pretty long time ago huh So this was this was in the mid um this was late late 1970s about 78 Cool And uh Sam ah is a resident of Charlotte for 11 years and he was born in Durham and he is um he s a Caucasian male banker who has education of BS in international business and um I think we re ready for the story now Okay good um Uh huh The story actually started out and I heard it first when when I was growing up as a kid but as I mentioned earlier Cub Scouts were actually out camping so it s definitely a story Uh huh It s a horror story no doubt so you have to picture the setting that it s around Uh huh Um I was about eight um um we were out camping in the back basically in the back of a friend of mine s house in Orange County Uh huh Which is the county right next to where I lived He basically they had basically woods outdoors and there were parents there with us but we were only eight so we re learning how to camp um we actually slept that night in a tee pee uh uh an original tee pee that uh were used by Native Americans at one time sort of as a historical artifact So we re getting ready for bed we ve eaten dinner we re around the campfire and the owner of the property it s Dwayne Hobgood I guess I can say his name Uh huh Um says Boys I ve got a story for you Now picture this There s about six or seven of us little kids eight years old this is a man that s going to be giving a good story Right And we ll take a little break here while we answer the cell phone Do you want to hear or do you want to keep Where was I before we were interrupted The uh you were uh Hobgood s property and OK A bunch of kids are listening and he s got boys I ve got a story for you now Eh boys I ve got a story for you and we re sitting around the campfire he goes Gentlemen let me tell you the story of Two Feathers He goes Two Feathers was and this time political correctness wasn t Right Wasn t par for the course wasn t nomenclature He said Boys I ve got this story about an Indian for you His name is ah Two Feathers He grew up in Orange County or what was Orange County it wasn t named Orange County at the time Um and act and he says Two Feathers was um once again was an Indian who uh lived there back before before it was settled by the Europeans He says Two Feathers grew up he hunted he fished bas basic the basic Indian life um until one day when he was about 20 25 he was out hunting and he was hunting a mountain lion He came across a mountain lion Uh huh And um they got into a tussle Uh huh He stabbed the mountain lion a few times the mountain lion bit him a few times Uh huh They struggled back and forth struggled back and forth Finally the mountain lion ripped off his arm his left arm Uh huh And uh takes off with it goes So he doesn t know but he he doesn t die he survives um and grows old becomes an old old an old Indian and um um becomes you know one of the leaders of the tribe but he s always got this one goal is to find that mountain lion that got his arm and really he doesn t really care that much about the mountain lion he wants his arm or somebody s arm Right So um time goes on and um he dies but he comes back as a ghost OK Um and what happens is as the settlers move in he actually finds um because he doesn t want to take people you know from his own tribe s arm but he needs an arm so he s spending all of eternity hunting for his arm and um as you know time comes on and the settlers start in the region settlers Uh huh Um one day one guy wakes up in the morning he s bleeding he felt like he doesn t have an arm and he sees this ghost of an Indian Uh huh He s got his arm and uh he s trying to put it on his body and it didn t fit and it s too short and it didn t look like his arm so he throws it aside and goes on Um this happens all throughout history and he was telling us how it keeps going on and on And you know as an adult it s not it s you know he it s a good story but as an eight year old kid you re worried about your arm That s right And because he usually catches people not in their house but when they re out camping or sleeping In a tee pee right In a tee pee yeah So He tells us his story he says you know You ve got to watch out for your arm Spend the night um you know because if he comes his name s Two Feathers but there s a chant um in regards to you know to getting him away and it goes something like Two Feathers be gone I want my arm Um and there s also other things you can do to deter him You can also um in front of your tee pee you have to stack stones in a certain manner in order to say Hey I m a friend and not a foe I d like to keep my arm So he proceeds to have us um build the stones and um you know learn the chant we re chanting and sends us off to bed Now we all spend the whole night staying awake listening for Two Feathers Two Feathers is coming Two Feathers is coming He would do that to us in the night Two Feathers is coming That s terrible Uh so you have eight scared boys that are Two Feathers Now I don t know if this actually applies as a story I heard sort of an embellishment on this story in regards to I give you the details but Uh a good campfire um It s a good campfire story um so it s I guess something to start with Yep that s good Um Yeah that s about 15 minutes I d say
