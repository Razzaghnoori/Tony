 The New York Times as Urban Planner Hello Walter The New York Times built a neighborhood again today A House Home section story announced that the previously indeterminate area between 23rd and 42nd streets on the East Side should now be referred to as NoMad for north of Madison Park In this town one sure mark of a commercial turned residential neighborhood is a syllabic acronym Soho stands for south of Houston Tribeca is the triangle below canal and Dumbo is down under the Manhattan Bridge The story does not reveal how many New Yorkers have rented or bought apartments in NoMad recently Instead it features a few fashion industry execs and designers who moved there in search of stately prewar buildings fantastic restaurants and affordable housing prices The fashion director of Elle magazine for example pays a mere 5 000 a month in rent The Times does this at least once a year Last year it instructed us to start calling a desolate stretch on the West Side TunJav the area is between the Lincoln Tunnel and the Jacob Javitz convention center The name never took off and neither did the neighborhood And when will the Times lay the Circuits section to rest When it stops bringing in so many ads I guess Today the Technology Journal section of the Wall Street Journal reports that Microsoft is trying to steal AOL s dial up business by offering the same service for little or no money AOL currently has 17 million customers and the 21 95 per month they pay for the service generates two thirds of AOL s revenue So AOL could soon join Lotus and Netscape in the Microsoft price cutting mausoleum In contrast Circuits prints stories on teenagers working in tech oriented summer jobs and on password proliferation OK so the section isn t devoted to hard tech news But it makes digital culture seem so dull that it s probably keeping a couple thousand Times subscribers offline I see I ve turned this message into a harangue against my beloved Times I feel guilty like I ve just publicly insulted my mother Until later Jodi
