 Background Heterotrimeric G proteins couple agonist activated heptahelical receptors to a variety of effector responses For the most part this signaling activity takes place at the plasma membranes of cells However G proteins have been detected at a variety of subcellular locations and have been implicated in numerous membrane trafficking activities 1 2 This suggests that distinct though not yet determined mechanisms exist to target G protein subunits to subcellular locations other than plasma membranes PM Furthermore post transcriptional or post translational modifications may play a role in directing a G protein subunit to a specific intracellular location Unique subcellular localization has been observed for a novel alternative spliced form of the G protein subunit G i2 3 This i2 splice variant termed s i2 contains a novel 35 amino acid sequence that replaces the C terminal 24 amino acids of i2 3 s i2 has been observed to localize to Golgi membranes and other intracellular membranes 3 4 in contrast wild type i2 is typically found at PM Based on this unique localization of s i2 a prominent role in membrane trafficking has been proposed for this subunit 3 However no report to date has supported a functional role for s i2 in vesicular transport although a variety of functional assays have implicated other G including s and i3 in vesicle trafficking pathways 1 2 In spite of its unknown functional significance s i2 provides a potential model for studying mechanisms of subcellular localization of G Clearly some aspect of the novel splicing is responsible for the difference in subcellular targeting of s i2 i e Golgi and intracellular membranes compared to wild type i2 i e PM To address the mechanism of subcellular localization of s i2 two hypotheses were tested herein First the possibility was tested that the novel 35 amino acid sequence found at the C terminus of s i2 functions as a specific Golgi or intracellular membrane targeting motif A second possibility was suggested by considering the location of the splice site Several studies have shown that deletions or amino acid substitutions in the extreme C terminal region of G creates a protein defective in guanine nucleotide binding 5 6 7 8 9 10 Rapid release of guanine nucleotides can result in an unstable G 9 10 This leads to the prediction that s i2 is also unstable due to a disruption in the structure of its C terminus caused by the novel splice sequence Thus the second possibility is that failure of s i2 to localize at the PM but instead localize at intracellular membranes is the result of a general defect in protein stability Results presented herein are consistent with this second hypothesis Results i2 and s i2 differ only at their extreme C termini Alternative splicing results in a novel 35 amino acids in s i2 that replace the C terminal 24 amino acids of i2 Figure 1 In the studies presented here both i2 and s i2 contain an internal EE epitope as used previously for i2 11 12 The use of the EE epitope allows the direct comparison of subcellular localization and expression of i2 and s i2 and facilitates immunoprecipitation of the two expressed proteins This is essential since suitable antibodies to detect and immuno isolate s i2 are not readily available Attempts to use a previously described polyclonal antibody directed against the C terminus of s i2 3 4 were unsatisfactory in our hands In particular attempts to detect endogenous s i2 by immunofluorescence failed due to faint detection that showed drastically different patterns of staining depending upon fixation technique The subcellular localization of expressed i2 and s i2 was compared in COS and BHK cells Figure 2 In both cell types i2 was detected at cellular plasma membranes as highlighted by bright staining at the cell periphery Figure 2Aand 2C In contrast s i2 was not detected at plasma membranes but instead typically displayed an intracellular and perinuclear staining pattern Figure 2Band 2D consistent with localization to intracellular membranes as previously described 3 4 The subcellular localization of s i2 showed overlap in immunofluorescent staining with the Golgi protein COP Figure 3Aand 3B and the endoplasmic reticulum protein PDI Figure 3Cand 3D localization of s i2 exclusively to Golgi was not observed even at the lowest levels of detection Subcellular fractionation confirmed that s i2 was localized at least partly to membranes Figure 2E After lysis of cells in hypotonic buffer followed by high speed centrifugation i2 was found predominantly in the particulate fraction from COS Figure 2E lanes 3 and 4 or BHK cells Figure 2E lanes 9 and 10 A majority of s i2 was also detected in the particulate fraction from both COS Figure 2E lanes 5 and 6 and BHK cells Figure 2E lanes 11 and 12 although some was also found in the soluble fraction As a comparison a non palmitoylated mutant of q in which cysteines 9 and 10 have been substituted with serines is found predominantly in the soluble fraction Figure 2E lanes 7 and 8 as described previously 13 Surprisingly in comparison to i2 s i2 was always detected in fewer cells by immunofluorescence analysis and showed lower levels of protein expression by western blot analysis of subcellular fractions Figure 2E or whole cell lysates not shown These expression differences suggested that s i2 was either less efficiently expressed or more rapidly degraded compared to i2 as described below The C terminal 35 amino acids of s i2 which replace the C terminal 24 amino acids of i2 Figure 1 have been proposed to function as a Golgi targeting signal 3 4 To test the potential importance of this C terminal region in localization of s i2 to intracellular membranes and prevention of s i2 from localizing to PM a deletion mutant of i2 was constructed consisting of amino acids 1 331 In s i2 the C terminal splice occurs just after amino acid 331 Figure 1 and thus the novel 35 amino acid splice sequence is removed in i2 1 331 Immunofluorescence microscopy indicates that i2 1 331 Figure 4B displays a subcellular localization pattern very similar to s i2 Figure 4A This result is consistent with the alternative hypothesis that a disruption of i2 at the C terminus creates a protein unable to localize at the PM If the unique C terminal 35 amino acid sequence of s i2 functions as a Golgi targeting signal it is important to test whether it is sufficient to target a heterologous protein to intracellular membranes When the 35 amino acid sequence was fused to the C terminus of GFP GFP s i2 35aa this unique s i2 sequence failed to direct GFP to intracellular membranes Figure 5B GFP s i2 35aa was diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus similar to what is observed for GFP alone Figure 5A On the other hand when the first ten amino acids of i2 are fused to GFP to create i2 1 10 GFP fluorescence is detected strongly at the PM Figure 5C indicating the N terminus of i2 which contains the sites for myristoylation and palmitoylation 14 can be sufficient for directing PM localization of a normally cytosolic protein In agreement with these results the s i2 C terminal sequence failed to redirect the localization of a secreted or a nuclear protein 4 Thus not only is the unique s i2 sequence unable to override other localization signals it is unable to target a cytoplasmic protein to intracellular membranes These results are consistent with a lack of a specific role for the s i2 sequence in Golgi membrane targeting The above experimental results failed to support the hypothesis that the unique 35 amino acid sequence from s i2 serves as a specific Golgi or intracellular membrane targeting motif Thus the following experiments concentrated on addressing the alternative hypothesis s i2 is unstable and rapidly degraded due to disruptions in the C terminus and such instability results in a failure of s i2 to reach its proper place at the PM The ability of i2 and s i2 to undergo N terminal lipid modifications was compared Myristoylation occurs co translationally at the extreme N terminal glycine while palmitoylation occurs post translationally at a cysteine immediately after the myristoylated glycine 15 The subcellular site where palmitoylation occurs has not been well defined although in one model palmitoylation occurs at the PM 16 Cells expressing i2 or s i2 were metabolically labeled with 3H palmitate or 3H myristate i2 and s i2 were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts and incorporation of radio label was analyzed by SDS PAGE followed by fluorography Figure 6A No palmitoylation of s i2 was detected Figure 6A lane 3 although i2 was strongly palmitoylated Figure 6A lane 2 In contrast both i2 and s i2 incorporated similar levels or myristate Figure 6A lanes 5 and 6 The similar level of myristoylation was particularly surprising since total s i2 protein was much lower than i2 as determined by immunoblotting of the immunoprecipitates Figure 6B compare lanes 5 and 6 Myristoylation is a co translational modification and levels of radio labeling should thus reflect synthesis of new protein Accordingly the myristoylation results Figure 6Aand 6B lanes 5 and 6 strongly suggested that i2 and s i2 are translated equally well as evidenced by similar levels of radiolabeled myristate incorporation during the labeling period but s i2 is more rapidly degraded as seen by reduced steady state levels of immunoprecipitated protein The lack of palmitoylation of s i2 is consistent with at least two not necessarily mutually exclusive possibilities s i2 may fail to undergo palmitoylation because it is not stable long enough for post translational palmitoylation to occur or because it fails to reach a PM site of palmitoylation Alternatively the novel C terminal sequence of s i2 may somehow prevent direct recognition by a palmitoyl transferase Cells expressing high levels of s i2 and to a much lesser extent i2 often displayed very bright intracellular accumulations of s i2 as visualized by immunofluorescence These large spots were reminiscent of recently described aggresomes accumulations of misfolded protein that are being targeted for proteasome dependent degradation 17 18 This observation suggested the possibility that intracellular localization of s i2 may reflect targeting to a proteasome dependent degradative pathway To test this idea further cells expressing i2 or s i2 were treated with the proteasome inhibitor acetyl leucyl leucyl norleucinal ALLN and changes in localization of the subunit were analyzed by immunofluorescence Figure 7 After 1h treatment with ALLN i2 localization is relatively unaffected Figure 7C but s i2 begins to show a slight increase in distinct intracellular accumulations Figure 7D At 4 h ALLN treatment many cells expressing i2 display a decrease in PM localization and an increase in intracellular staining Figure 7E i2 is typically seen in large bright spots and in a perinuclear intracellular membrane staining pattern after incubation of cells for 4 h with ALLN In fact the localization pattern of i2 after 4 h incubation with ALLN Figure 7E is similar to the observed localization of s i2 in the absence or presence of ALLN treatment Figure 7B 7D and 7F At 8 h treatment with ALLN both i2 Figure 7G and s i2 Figure 7H are detected almost exclusively as a large bright spot in each expressing cell Similar results were obtained using another proteasome inhibitor MG 132 Interestingly ALLN treatment was relatively ineffective at promoting accumulation of overexpressed s in aggresome like structures not shown Thus the results of Figure 7are consistent with the proposal that the intracellular localization of s i2 is due to its targeting to a degradative pathway a pathway shared by i2 The subcellular localization of s i2 was compared to i2 A327S This alanine to serine mutation in the C terminal region of i1 A326S and s A366S has been shown to greatly accelerate GDP release to accelerate irreversible inactivation in vitro and to cause rapid turnover of the subunit in cultured cells 9 10 Thus if the observed intracellular localization of s i2 is caused by instability of the protein due to disruptions at its C terminus then it follows that i2 A327S should show a similar pattern of localization Indeed immunofluorescence microscopy revealed a pronounced intracellular distribution for i2 A327S Figure 8E In addition to intracellular membrane localization similar to s i2 Figure 8C i2 A327S was detected weakly but consistently at the PM It seems likely that the C terminal disruption of s i2 replacing the 24 C terminal amino acids is a more severe disruption than the A327S substitution Thus the similarity in localization of s i2 and i2 A327S bolsters the idea that mislocalization of s i2 is caused by its inherent instability G protein subunits can stabilize wild type and alanine to serine mutant subunits in vitro 10 Thus the effect of co expression on subcellular localization of i2 A327S and s i2 was tested i2 localizes to the PM efficiently when expressed alone Figure 8A or when co expressed with Figure 8B s i2 shows a dramatic change in localization when co expressed with Figure 8D displaying strong PM staining Not only is s i2 targeted efficiently to the PM when co expressed with but co expression increases overall levels of transiently expressed s i2 and i2 as determined by immunoblotting Figure 8G and increases the number of cells expressing s i2 as observed by immunofluorescence microscopy not shown Similarly co expression of efficiently promotes PM localization of i2 A327S Figure 8F The analysis of the effect of was extended by examining the localization of i2 or s i2 after co transfection with and after treatment with ALLN In contrast to Figure 7 a marked difference was observed between i2 and s i2 after ALLN treatment When is co expressed with i2 PM localization of i2 is observed as shown in Figure 8B and incubation with ALLN for 8 h shows little effect on PM localization of i2 Figure 9A When is co expressed with s i2 PM localization of s i2 is observed as shown in Figure 8D but incubation with ALLN for 8 h causes an increase in bright intracellular accumulations of s i2 Figure 9B Taken together results with co expression are consistent with the ability of to promote PM targeting of G and further suggest that s i2 is less effectively stabilized than i2 by as evidenced by ALLN induced accumulation in intracellular aggregates Figure 9B Lastly 35S methionine pulse chase labeling studies directly confirmed that s i2 was more rapidly degraded than i2 Figure 10 After transient expression of the subunits cellular proteins were radiolabeled with a brief pulse of 35S methionine followed by a chase Immunoprecipitation of the subunit after increasing times of chase followed by SDS PAGE and fluorography revealed that radiolabeled s i2 was rapidly lost i2 consistently displayed a 3 4 fold longer half life compared to s i2 while i2 A327S was intermediate In the experiment presented in Figure 10 the t 1 2 was determined to be approximately 90 180 and 360 min for s i2 i2 A327S and i2 respectively Although this trend was consistent the exact t 1 2 showed some variability from experiment to experiment probably due to varying levels of transient overexpression It is likely that the difference in turnover of s i2 and i2 is even more profound when the proteins are expressed at lower levels Consistent with this idea s i2 was refractory to stable expression even though cells stably expressing i2 were easily selected not shown The inability to isolate cells stably expressing s i2 can be attributed to its rapid degradation Regardless 35S methionine pulse chase labeling studies Figure 10 demonstrate that s i2 is indeed more rapidly degraded than i2 Discussion In addition to their well characterized role at the PM in coupling activated GPCRs to effector proteins heterotrimeric G proteins have been implicated in a variety of other cellular functions including membrane trafficking pathways A splice variant of i2 termed s i2 has been proposed as a candidate to regulate vesicle transport due to its localization at intracellular membranes The studies described in this report were undertaken to define mechanisms that underlie subcellular localization of s i2 The novel 35 amino acids found in s i2 appear not to function as a specific Golgi or endoplasmic reticulum targeting sequence Instead the results in this study support the proposal that s i2 fails to target to the PM because it is an unstable protein The following results support this hypothesis 1 s i2 and i2 are equally labeled by a pulse of 3H myristate although much less s i2 protein is detected 2 s i2 displays a propensity to localize to potential aggresome like structures and this localization is greatly enhanced by proteasome inhibitor treatment 3 the i2 A327S mutant previously shown to be unstable and defective in guanine nucleotide binding shows a similar pattern of subcellular localization i e intracellular membranes rather than PM 4 over expression increases expression of s i2 and promotes PM localization of s i2 and i2 A327S but co expression does not prevent s i2 localization to potential aggresome like structures when cells are treated with proteasome inhibitors and 5 pulse chase analysis indicates that s i2 is rapidly degraded A number of reports have demonstrated that disruptions in the C termini of G cause reduced affinity for guanine nucleotides and protein instability The C terminal 30 amino acids of G consist of the 6 5 loop followed by the 5 helix and finally several amino acids of flexible structure Figure 1 19 20 21 The 6 5 loop stabilizes the guanine ring of bound GDP or GTP and mutations in this region affect guanine nucleotide binding The A326S mutation of i1 and A366S mutation of s cognate to the i2 A327S used in this study were shown to cause greatly decreased affinity for GDP 9 10 Defective binding of GDP leads to more G in the empty state no bound guanine nucleotide and this form of G is rapidly denatured in vitro as shown for s A366S and i1 A326S 9 10 Moreover s A366S was demonstrated to undergo rapid degradation t 1 2 1 h in stably transfected cells 9 The same mutation in t has also been shown to greatly decrease guanine nucleotide binding 5 22 Additional amino acids in the critical 6 5 loop are important for maintaining G integrity 7 Although the 5 helix Figure 1 does not directly contact the bound guanine nucleotide 19 20 21 it is clearly important for G structure and to maintain the proper orientation of the 6 5 loop A recent study identified a number of 5 helix residues in t that when changed to alanines increased rates of guanine nucleotide exchange i e decreased affinity for guanine nucleotides 5 Individual mutation of amino acids in t cognate to T330 N332 V333 F337 in i2 Figure 1 increased nucleotide exchange rates 5 Two of these critical amino acids N332 and V333 in i2 are in fact the first two amino acids that are replaced by the novel splicing in s i2 Figure 1 Thus one might speculate that the novel 35 amino acid sequence in s i2 would impair guanine nucleotide binding and result in a unstable protein Unfortunately initial attempts to directly show a defect in guanine nucleotide binding by s i2 using a GTP S dependent trypsin protection assay 23 were unsuccessful due at least in part to the inability to solubilize expressed s i2 from membranes using a mild detergent e g lubrol polyoxyethylene 10 lauryl ether The data in this report are consistent with a scenario in which intracellular Golgi ER localization of s i2 reflects its rapid degradation rather than specific targeting to a subcellular organelle Particularly compelling is the similarity in subcellular localization of i2 A327S and s i2 Figure 8 In addition the use of proteasome inhibitors Figures 7and 9 suggest that s i2 is degraded by a proteasome pathway The observed intracellular membrane ER localization and proteasome inhibitor induced juxtanuclear aggregate accumulation aggresome is consistent with that reported for other proteins being degraded by such a pathway 18 24 When treated with proteasome inhibitors overexpressed wild type i2 also accumulates in aggresome like structures Figure 7 suggesting that G may normally be degraded by a proteasome dependent pathway However over expression of prevents ALLN induced juxtanuclear accumulations of i2 but not s i2 Figure 9 Although little is known regarding degradative pathways for G proteins s i2 and other mutants e g i2 A327S may be valuable tools for defining such pathways The data presented here argue against a sequence specific Golgi membrane targeting function for the novel 35 amino acid sequence found in s i2 The novel sequence of s i2 is not sufficient to direct other proteins to Golgi ER membranes These 35 amino acids did not change the cytoplasmic localization of GFP Figure 5 Similarly a recent report showed that the s i2 35 amino acids were unable to retain a secreted protein in intracellular membranes and did not affect localization of a nuclear protein 4 However in addition to causing rapid degradation one cannot rule out that the 35 amino acid sequence of s i2 functions somehow as part of a Golgi targeting motif in the context of other regions of i2 as suggested 4 Other researchers have described a specific Golgi membrane localization of s i2 4 in contrast the results presented in this report always show a much more disperse subcellular localization of s i2 to intracellular membranes consistent with staining of both Golgi and ER The reason for this difference in localization is unclear Interestingly in the other study the authors found that deletion of a proline rich sequence corresponding to s i2 amino acids 348 359 Figure 1 changed localization of s i2 from Golgi membranes to a more diffuse localization throughout intracellular membranes 4 However mutation of proline residues to alanines failed to affect s i2 localization 4 Thus little evidence exists to support a specific membrane targeting role for the novel s i2 sequence was able to promote plasma membrane localization of s i2 Figure 8 prevents irreversible inactivation of i1 when measured in vitro at 37 C and slows the inactivation of i1 A326S 10 Thus may stabilize s i2 and i2 A327S allowing dependent 25 26 27 28 29 PM localization These results are also consistent with the possibility that the primary defect in s i2 is a reduced ability to interact with G containing mutations in known sites of contact with fail to localize to PM but over expression of can rescue their PM localization 28 29 However the crystal structures 30 31 show that the C terminal 6 5 loop 5 helix region does not directly contact Thus it is more likely that indeed s i2 is deficient in binding to but this effect is a consequence of its instability s i2 may exist in a state that does not interact well with simply because it is in the process of being irreversibly inactivated 9 10 Similarly i2 A327S appears not to be defective in its intrinsic ability to interact 10 and co expression of shifts i2 A327S like s i2 from intracellular to plasma membranes Figure 8 What is the cellular function of s i2 The ability of to promote PM localization of s i2 raises the possibility that endogenous s i2 is in fact localized to PM where it can interact with GPCRs and effectors Future studies will test the potential of s i2 when co expressed with to productively interact with receptors and effectors However this possibility is viewed as unlikely for several reasons First others have shown that in COS 7 cells endogenous s i2 is not detected at PM but only found intracellularly 3 4 although one cannot rule out that a small but functionally significant fraction of s i2 reaches the PM Second the extreme C termini of G are critical sites for interaction with GPCRs 32 and the novel C terminal sequence found in s i2 would be predicted to disrupt productive interactions with GPCRs Third even though can promote PM localization of s i2 in the overexpression system described here s i2 remains less stable than i2 Figure 9 suggesting that such instability may also impair productive interactions with GPCRs On the other hand unknown protein s may function to stabilize s i2 and help direct it to Golgi membranes A specific combination of and subtypes may play such a role however one thorough study showed a lack of on Golgi membranes of exocrine pancreatic cells even though a variety of G were readily detected in the Golgi 33 Other proteins that may specifically promote the intracellular targeting of G have not been identified It is possible that s i2 functions as a short lived protein regulating some aspect of membrane transport pathways however no experiments to directly support or refute this hypothesis have been reported Instead it is tempting to speculate that alternative splicing may be a mechanism to regulate cellular levels of i2 In this model certain conditions may favor the formation of s i2 compared to i2 and the resulting rapid degradation of s i2 would decrease the cellular content of i2 A precedent for such alternative splicing dependent regulation of expression has been described for H ras 34 Alternative splicing occurs in H ras and the alternative spliced form is predicted to encode an unstable transcript and a protein product that lacks the ability to oncogenically transform cells A mutation was identified that abolishes the alternatively spliced form and this mutation leads to an increase in H ras expression and transforming ability Thus it was demonstrated that alternative splicing is a mechanism that cells use to control expression of H ras 34 Alternative splicing may similarly play an important role in regulating expression of i2 Testing of this idea will require a comparison of s i2 and i2 transcript levels and an analysis of whether relative expression is affected in response to physiological changes such as extracellular stimuli or cell differentiation Conclusions In summary the results presented here demonstrate that s i2 a novel splice variant of i2 is rapidly degraded when expressed in cells Such instability is consistent with known structure function data regarding the importance of the C terminus of G subunits The observed intracellular localization of s i2 is due at least in part to its instability Moreover the data presented in this study argue against the novel C terminus of s i2 functioning as a specific Golgi targeting motif In addition similarly to s i2 an i2 mutant i2 A327S previously demonstrated to be unstable in vitro displays a defect in plasma membrane localization when expressed in cells
