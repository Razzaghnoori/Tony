 Wolf Cries Wolf Appearing on ABC s This Week last Sunday controversial Gore consultant Naomi Wolf argued against holding candidates responsible for the views of their advisers adding I was interested to see on Crossfire a few nights ago Mr Press pointed out that George Bush s advisers have views that were much more I would say disturbing than mine that were in fact I would say racist Who are these racist advisers A quick look at the Crossfire transcript reveals only one allegation that comes close to fitting Wolf s description an example offered by from the left co host Bill Press PRESS I just want to follow up again Because there s another adviser to George Bush by the name of Myron Magnet who says there are lots of jobs out there for blacks but blacks just don t go after them It reminds me of Ed Meese saying that the homeless are homeless by choice Now is that George Bush s position RNC Co Chair Pat HARRISON I have no idea who Myron is Whatever he said in that sense is ridiculous George W Bush does not believe that I called Magnet on Tuesday He hadn t heard he d been denounced as a racist on national television This was a Naomi Wolf angle so obscure only kausfiles was on the case Like every other conservative intellectual in America Magnet confessed that he was indeed a Bush adviser He d gotten the call from Austin a couple of years ago and Bush had told him that his 1993 book The Dream and the Nightmare had been a major influence In Dream Magnet is talking about the black underclass not as Press implied black society in general Magnet says only a minority of black Americans perhaps one in nine or ten belongs to the underclass One dysfunctional feature of underclass society Magnet argues is a failure to take available jobs Of course there are jobs out there Magnet told me sticking to his guns The success of welfare reform makes that abundantly clear Folks didn t have trouble going out and finding jobs Magnet s view is probably impolitic though maybe less so than Wolf and Press think In important ways it may not be right If every able bodied unemployed man and woman in the black underclass tried to get a job back in 1993 when Magnet s book came out could the labor market have readily absorbed them all I doubt it But it s not racist It is rather a simplified blame the 60s version of the standard culture of poverty argument one good working definition of a culture of poverty being a culture whose members do not take advantage of economic opportunities when they present themselves The argument is actually anti racist in the sense that Magnet thinks the black white economic gap is purely a cultural matter the result of bad messages coming from the larger culture read those privileged white hippies that have encouraged a weak family structure At the Manhattan Institute where he edits City Journal Magnet is known as an opponent of the Charles Murray Richard Herrnstein argument that genetics not culture is at the bottom of the black white divide Naomi Wolf didn t return my phone calls Readers should know that I used to work and play basketball with her husband David Shipley an editor at the New York Times who is a great guy How close a friend is he Check back with me tomorrow on that But regard for Shipley I suspect is giving Wolf a lot of protection when it comes to press coverage though it might not look that way If I were Al Gore I d want someone like Naomi Wolf around even if some of her ideas are quirky or wacky But the racism charge isn t quirky or wacky it s demagogy It coarsens and inflames dialogue in a way that tends to prevent exposure of which ideas are right and which are wrong It s just bullshit Magnet says It means we don t even want to have an argument with you Maybe Wolf was led astray by Press tendentious summary of Magnet s views But Press didn t call anyone a racist Wolf did She should apologize P S Another distinction between Wolf and Magnet is that Bush didn t pay Magnet anything for his advice while Gore valued Wolf s at 15 000 a month P P S Kausfiles is having lunch with Magnet tomorrow If he blurts out anything racist you ll be notified immediately Wolf did call after this item was posted but our conversation was off the record Clarence Page s hack fact The downside of the changing statistics and indeed a new figure came out this week showing unemployment down to what around around 4 percent the lowest it s been since 1970 is that the poverty rate hasn t changed Clarence Page on Washington Week in Review Nov 5 1999 Continued economic growth led to a significant reduction in poverty in 1998 as the poverty rate declined to 12 7 percent press release of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities Sept 30 1999 The poverty rate has fallen from 15 1 percent in 1993
