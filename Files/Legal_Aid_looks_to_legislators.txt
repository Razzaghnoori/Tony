 Legal Aid looks to legislators for help By Robyn L Minor Sunday January 26 2003 Still stinging from federal grant cuts Kentucky Legal Aid s director is hoping the General Assembly will help heal the wounds We found a sponsor for legislation Director Scott Crocker said Rep Charles Geveden has introduced legislation that will increase the Access to Justice supplement on court filing fees The legislation would increase that supplement on filing civil cases from 5 to 10 in district courts and from 10 to 20 in circuit courts Basic filing fees would then be 55 50 in district court and 118 in circuit The Access to Justice fees are sent to a foundation that provides money to legal aid services such as Bowling Green s Kentucky Legal Aid That office provides legal aid in non criminal cases to low income elderly or disabled residents in 35 counties The Kentucky Bar Association is supporting the legislation They felt the additional filing fee would not prevent people from being able to file lawsuits Crocker said In fact the additional fees will ensure wider access to the judicial system for Kentucky s poor said Geveden D Wickliffe I was pleased to sponsor the legislation because it will provide access to legal services to the poor and underprivileged in Kentucky that otherwise would have been denied them because of federal budget cuts and because of some reduction in funds because of state budget Geveden said Statewide legal aid budgets were cut 1 58 million The proposed legislation is expected to generate about 1 5 million Because of about 300 000 in cuts Kentucky Legal Aid in Bowling Green is in the process of closing its Hopkinsville office and already has closed and consolidated others A total of six full time positions and one part time position including attorneys and secretarial or clerical positions were eliminated If legislation passes and more funding comes in cuts in services would be re evaluated The Access to Justice money is distributed to legal aid agencies based on a poverty population formula About 21 percent of the fees would come to this Kentucky Legal Aid office Crocker said We have bipartisan support on this issue and it isn t a tax increase he said There is no one actively lobbying against it so we hope it would pass Geveden agrees that the bill s chances for passage are pretty reasonable And while he is pleased to have the endorsement of the bar association and others Geveden said The best endorsements come from people at home And I think they are doing a good job having people contacting legislators to encourage their support To track the proposed legislation HB 163 visit the Web site www lrc state ky us To leave a message for a legislator in support of the proposal call 800 372 7181
