 From Disco to Hip Hop Dear Chris Hmm Feedbag for Morons Isn t that a Dead Kennedys album I don t know maybe the great big arena rocking songs are masses opiating tools of social control but I really can t believe that everything in the pop marketplace is just numbly imbibed by a passive audience Also isn t pinning today s celebrity culture on rock letting the tabloids glossies talk shows Hollywood etc etc off a bit easy Maybe Elvis was the first modern superstar riding the emergent nexus of TV film and records to a new level of global acclaim but I hardly blame American Bandstand for O J and Princess Di As someone who routinely got his head pounded into school lockers by Led Zeppelin fans I m pretty aware of rock s role in fostering unthinking conformism Still I think Miller s somewhat overheated Dionysian riff does make an important point that even a music with the crassest commercial aims can have liberating transformative effects in the world At least on other musicians Had you heard Miller s anecdote about Dylan mishearing the Beatles before I really liked that one where he thought the line I can t hide I can t hide was I get high I get high and concluded it was a song about dope Not exactly Das Kapital I realize but the tale is suggestive of rock s power as charged volatile as they say open text If Dylan s ears weren t caught up by the Beatles sound first he never would have imbued the song with such possibilities which I have to believe were pretty subversive back in 1964 Whether or not rock still has such possibilities depends I think on your definitions of rock One thing that makes a popular music rock as a verb is its ability to take private but common feelings and put them into a shared public language This phenomenon gets more interesting as the culture splinters and technology creates new languages which is one of my main problems with Miller s critique As a critical theorist himself Miller must know how subjective his rock narrative is even the jump cut structure suggests it yet he still seems to present pop music as the product of the same shared single history I d say that construct breaks down near the end of his book While I don t mean to make too great a claim for disco I do think it represents a moment in which cultural forces that Miller doesn t account for realigned in a way that changed rock The polarizing Disco Sucks movement revealed a mass audience not just splintering but clashing along certain demographic lines Meanwhile the music s sound and technology was providing the sonic space and public rituals for hip hop as electrifying a pop form as I ve ever heard I d say NWA s Fuck Tha Police was every bit the protest song that The Times They Are A Changing was and way more fun I d also say similar if less broadly significant upheavals are happening in the worlds of house techno and other electronic music even now Musics that emphasize rhythm and texture over melody and lyrics aren t necessarily apolitical or content free but they do tend to occur on narrower bandwidths Some smart guy Cocteau I think said that style is a way of saying complicated things simply No I don t think Smashmouth is saying anything too complicated But others well within pop s debased commercialized 50 year old landscape Nas say or Beck or Pavement Radiohead P J Harvey often are Nowadays you just have to work a little harder to hear it Which Miller by his own admission stopped doing over a decade ago This raises a question we ve both evaded Is this book really necessary Is Miller s style or his point of view compelling enough to merit another go round on the rock history tour bus Yours Chris P S I don t think your sentiments are fogeyish or undiscriminating I must however give you kudos for being the first writer I ve ever seen limn Beck s Godley Creme influence
