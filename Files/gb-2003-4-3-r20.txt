 Background Plants respond to invasion by pathogens with an array of biochemical and genetic changes including the production of reactive oxygen species antimicrobial compounds antioxidants and signaling molecules such as salicylic acid SA and jasmonic acid JA They also respond by the localized activation of a cell death program designated the hypersensitive response HR and by the systemic activation of cellular and molecular defenses termed systemic acquired resistance SAR 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Second messengers that contribute to the development of the systemic response include reactive oxygen species ROS SA JA and ethylene 8 9 10 There is evidence for commonalities between plant responses to pathogens referred to as defense responses and environmental stresses referred to as stress responses 11 12 Despite similarities however a plant s response to each environmental challenge is unique and tailored to increasing the plant s ability to survive the inciting stress 13 14 15 16 A comprehensive understanding of the networks of genes proteins and small molecules that underlie plant stress and defense responses requires identification and characterization of the molecular components including the genes that respond both initially and as the physiological response to the stress or pathogen develops Several groups 17 18 have used existing expressed sequence tag EST collections to carry out microarray experiments in initial efforts to identify genes whose expression levels change in response to pathogens and various abiotic stresses However existing EST collections are not complete and most were derived from cDNA libraries made from plants grown under normal environmental conditions hence ESTs representing stress and pathogen induced transcripts are likely to be under represented in them To characterize the stress defense transcriptome of Arabidopsis more thoroughly we sought to identify genes whose expression levels change in response to abiotic stress known second messengers and bacterial and fungal pathogens We used the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae and the oomycete pathogen Peronospora parasitica to evoke the pathogen defense response The availability of both avirulent and virulent strains of these pathogens facilitates identification of genes that are important for resistance as well as those expressed during disease development 19 20 21 Moreover both of these pathogens cause severe damage to crops of economic importance such as tomato and crucifers 19 We also treated plants with SA and methyl jasmonate MJ because both are important signaling molecules implicated in plant responses to pathogens herbivory and wounding and they induce different aspects of the SAR 22 We used ozone as an abiotic stressor because the plant s response at the biochemical and molecular level shows extensive overlap with the pathogen defense response and includes the production of ROS as well as induction of HR and SAR 23 24 At the phenotypic level acute ozone exposure high dose for a short interval causes necrotic lesions similar to those caused by avirulent pathogen infections whereas chronic ozone exposure low dose for an extended period of time accelerates foliar senescence producing similar symptoms to those caused by virulent pathogen infections 25 26 There is evidence that elicitor evoked ROS production called the oxidative burst is an essential signaling component of the defense response 27 Moreover ozone is a component of photochemical smog and itself represents an oxidative stress to living organisms damaging crops and forests 28 There are several strategies for identifying differentially expressed transcripts including differential display DD representational difference analysis RDA serial analysis of gene expression SAGE enzymatic degradation subtraction and subtractive hybridization 29 30 31 32 33 We chose the PCR based suppression subtractive hybridization SSH procedure for several reasons it includes a normalization step it enriches for differentially expressed transcripts and it yields cDNA fragments that can be used directly for the construction of DNA microarrays We viewed the normalization step as particularly important because a few stress activated genes such as those encoding the pathogenesis related PR proteins are abundantly induced by a variety of stresses potentially obscuring important stress specific transcripts expressed at much lower levels The SSH procedure developed by Diatchenko et al 33 has the additional advantage that it exploits the suppression PCR effect eliminating the need for physical separation of single and double stranded cDNAs 34 We have cloned and sequenced cDNA fragments representing 1 058 stress induced genes from eight different SSH cDNA libraries We describe and discuss the stress defense induced genes we have identified many of which have either not previously been associated with stress responses or are not represented in existing cDNA libraries Results SSH cDNA library construction Plants of the Arabidopsis ecotype Col 0 show disease symptoms when infiltrated with virulent Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 or when sprayed with the oomycete Peronospora parasitica strain Ahco The avirulent bacterial strain of P syringae expressing the avrRpm1 gene elicits a marked HR in Col 0 plants whereas the P parasitica strain Emwa elicits a microscopic HR All treatments including pathogen infection and treatment with ozone SA and MJ were carried out on 3 4 week old plants All treatments affect foliar tissue which was the material used for library construction To capture a wide spectrum of differentially expressed genes leaf tissue was collected at different intervals after the treatment and pooled before RNA extraction Table 1 Leaves were harvested at 1 3 6 9 and 12 hours after acute ozone treatment and at 1 8 and 24 hours after bacterial infection and after MJ and SA treatments Because fungal spores take almost a day to germinate and penetrate the host cell samples were collected at 12 hours 2 and 3 days in the incompatible oomycete interaction In the case of the compatible interaction the host fails to recognize the pathogen early and mounts a response only when the pathogen has proliferated extensively 3 5 days Samples were therefore collected up to day 5 after inoculation For the chronic ozone treatment samples were harvested 2 4 and 6 days after exposure The efficiency of subtraction was evaluated by PCR amplification of a housekeeping gene that for gyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase G3PDH and one of several differentially expressed genes If subtraction is efficient transcripts of housekeeping genes should be reduced while those of differentially expressed genes should be substantially enriched in the population of cDNA fragments used for library construction Figure 1shows that the G3PDH fragment is barely detectable even after 30 cycles of amplification in the subtracted sample while it is clearly detectable in the unsubtracted sample after 20 cycles To test enrichment for differentially expressed genes we amplified the PR1 gene for the biotic stressors and SA treatment the plant defensin gene PDF1 2 for MJ treatment and the amino cyclopropane synthase gene ACS1 for the ozone treatments 9 19 35 The genes tested showed strong amplification in the subtracted samples after 15 cycles of PCR whereas in the unsubtracted samples the PCR product was seen only after 10 additional cycles Figure 1 On the basis of the number of PCR cycles required for equal amplification of the corresponding PCR products from the subtracted and unsubtracted cDNA samples we estimated that the subtracted libraries were 32 64 fold enriched for differentially expressed genes One of the main advantages of SSH is that it normalizes the cDNA abundance so that cDNAs encoded by genes that are expressed infrequently but nonetheless differentially can be identified readily 33 The efficiency of normalization is illustrated in Figure 2 The more uniform distribution of hybridization intensities obtained using the subtracted cDNA probe Figure 2c reflects the equalization in the concentrations of individual species present at markedly different concentrations in the initial unsubtracted cDNA populations Figure 2b Differential expression of genes identified by SSH cDNA clones for differentially expressed genes were identified by successively screening new clones first with the unsubtracted driver cDNA Figure 2a and tester Figure 2b cDNA pools as the probes then the forward subtracted Figure 2c and reverse subtracted Figure 2d cDNA pools as probes The first screen identifies cDNAs corresponding to only the most abundant differentially expressed genes while the second screen identifies genes that are expressed less abundantly but still differentially The results from the four hybridizations were recorded for each clone and those showing the most marked differential expression were selected for sequencing Although selecting clones that showed strong hybridization only with the forward subtracted pool was straightforward it was more difficult to select differentially expressed genes when signals were detected in both the forward subtracted and unsubtracted pools We endeavored to select those clones that showed 4 5 fold differential hybridization However as this was done by visual inspection such genes constitute a potential source of false positives After screening the first three libraries acute ozone SA and virulent oomycete infection we incorporated an additional procedure that permitted us to identify clones already represented in our collection This was necessary simply because there is significant overlap at the molecular level in plant responses to different stresses and cDNA fragments were being identified and sequenced redundantly We therefore pooled and labeled aliquots of DNA from sequenced clones using them to probe each new set of clones This procedure not only permitted identification of clones representing genes in previous libraries but also allowed us to monitor the completeness of screening of each library Figure 3shows that the yield of new clones decreased as the number of clones examined increased indicating that by the time several hundred clones had been examined few new genes remain to be identified in a given library As the libraries were both normalized and enriched for differentially expressed sequences it is likely that the recovery of cDNAs for differentially expressed genes is reasonably complete It should be noted however that because we screened each new library for clones we had already identified in previous libraries the libraries are not independent of each other This procedure might also lead us to miss highly homologous members of multigene families We cloned and sequenced the reverse subtracted cDNAs for just two libraries those prepared from ozone treated plants and those infected with a virulent strain of the oomycete pathogen Although we screened almost 600 clones in these two libraries we identified cDNAs for only 48 differentially expressed genes most of which encode proteins involved in photosynthesis Thus it appears that a relatively small number of genes is downregulated by stress and suggests that different kinds of stress downregulate the same genes Although differential expression of every gene has not yet been tested under every stress condition of the more than 700 genes tested to date roughly 90 have exhibited differential expression by either northern blotting or DNA microarray analysis see Additional data files each of which has different sensitivity limitations Some representative northern blots are shown in Figure 4 Because these tests have been carried out under a more limited set of conditions than those represented by the treatments used for library construction it appears likely that most of the cDNA clones described here represent differentially expressed genes Sequence analysis of stress ESTs We sequenced 1 461 clones selected for differential expression as described above from among more than 6 000 clones in the eight stress cDNA libraries On average 12 of the sequences in each library were redundant Table 2 The frequency with which identical cDNA fragments were isolated and sequenced was low approximately 2 in large part because of the prescreening to eliminate such redundancy Most of the redundancy within libraries 10 as well as between libraries 25 resulted from the use of Rsa I restricted cDNA fragments in the SSH procedure Because of the restriction step two or more different cloned cDNA fragments can represent a single transcript This type of redundancy was rapidly identified using coincidence of the Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences MIPS identifiers Thus the 1 461 different fragments sequenced identified a total of 1 058 different genes Table 2 With the information gathered from the MIPS Arabidopsis database 36 and InterPro protein domain searches 37 we were able to identify or assign putative functions to about three quarters 764 of the genes in the stress cDNA collection More than 290 SSH clones encoded proteins with insufficient similarity to proteins of known function to assign a function with confidence and we therefore classified them as being of unknown function The genes of known function were sorted into the 12 primary functional categories 38 The distribution of the genes with known or predicted functions is represented as a pie chart in Figure 5 The largest set of genes 15 was assigned to the metabolism category while genes involved in cell growth division constituted the smallest group comprising less than 2 of the genes Genes involved in signal transduction and protein destination storage formed the second 13 and third largest groups 12 respectively Genes implicated in stress defense response and genes involved in transcription together constituted 20 of the stress cDNA collection Figure 5 Digital northern analysis EST datasets have been used recently to extract information on gene expression levels 39 40 41 The underlying assumption of such a digital northern analysis is that the number of EST clones is proportional to the abundance of the mRNA used for constructing the library 42 Most Arabidopsis EST collections are derived from non normalized cDNA libraries making them useful for this purpose 43 We recorded the number of EST hits from the MIPS summary report link or by BLAST searches with the Arabidopsis EST database for each clone in our stress collection Using 1 20 000 as the definition of a rare message 44 45 46 and knowing that there are more than 100 000 Arabidopsis ESTs in GenBank we consider genes with fewer than six ESTs to represent rarely transcribed genes By the foregoing criteria 577 55 of the stress inducible genes are in the rarely transcribed category and 178 of these 17 are not represented by an EST in the Arabidopsis EST database Only 2 0 0018 of the genes in the stress cDNA collection are represented by more than 200 ESTs and can be classified as abundantly transcribed These are the Rubisco activase A0zUF12 At2g39730 and a polyubiquitin gene APP FD09 At5g05320 The remaining 479 45 cDNAs correspond to genes transcribed at moderate rate 7 200 ESTs in unstressed plants This analysis does not of course reflect the stress altered levels of these transcripts Nonetheless it reveals that a significant fraction of stress modulated genes is not represented in existing EST collections and that many are infrequently transcribed in normal plants underlining the need to construct specialized libraries Promoter analysis The number order and type of protein binding sequences present in promoters are major determinants of the differences in expression patterns of genes Because the transcript levels of the genes represented in the present collection change in response to stress protein binding motifs associated with stress inducibility should be over represented in the promoters of the stress collection when compared with the total complement of Arabidopsis promoters We compared the frequency of occurrence of 16 different stress related motifs in the total collection and in each library individually with their frequencies in the total population of Arabidopsis promoters see Materials and methods We found that six of the 16 stress related motifs analyzed were over represented in the promoter sequences of the stress collection as a whole Table 3a and four additional motifs were over represented in the promoters of at least one of the libraries Table 3b The ABRE like motif W box motif W box like motif SA inducible motif the G box and the TGA motifs were significantly over represented in the promoters of the stress collection as a whole compared with the total population of Arabidopsis promoters Table 3a The H box factor HBF motif was over represented in the promoters of genes represented in the virulent bacterial library heat shock element HSE and Myb4 motifs were over represented in the avirulent bacterial library and the Myc motif was over represented in the SA library Table 3b We also looked for combinations of motifs that had been reported to function together 47 The G box and H box motifs occur together in 31 promoters in our collection p 0 00587 Over all more than half of the tested stress motifs are over represented in the promoters of the genes in the stress cDNA collection reflecting its enrichment for stress responsive genes The two ethylene related motifs GCC box and EIN3 and the drought response element DRE AtMyb1 AtMyb2 and AtMyb3 motifs were not statistically significantly over represented in the promoters of genes identified by the stress cDNA collection Discussion Analysis of the total SSH library To assess the contribution of the present stress cDNA collection to characterizing the Arabiopsis stress transcriptome we examined five recent reports of Arabidopsis stress defense modulated genes that used either commercial or investigator constructed cDNA microarrays 7 17 18 48 49 Using the accession numbers provided in each publication we retrieved each sequence from the GenBank database We then used BLAST at the TAIR site to search the AGI genome database and identified the MIPS code for the differentially expressed genes reported in each of these studies Once the MIPS code had been identified we were able to estimate the number of genes differentially expressed in each of these studies and determine the overlap between each group and the stress cDNA collection Table 4 The extent of overlap between the stress cDNA collection and the subset of stress or defense modulated genes ranged from a low of 16 with the 308 genes identified by Maleck et al 7 to a high of 32 with the 507 genes reported by Schenk 17 Thus almost 70 of the genes in the stress cDNA collection have not previously been identified as stress defense modulated Conversely a significant number of genes reported to be induced or repressed in the stress defense response is not represented in the stress cDNA collection This may be attributable in part to the stringency of the differential expression criterion 4 5 fold difference between experimental and control expression levels we used in selecting clones to sequence As the criterion for differential expression in the microarray studies analyzed was 1 5 2 5 fold over control levels many genes identified as differentially expressed in these studies would not have been included in our libraries Although we do not have the information to determine all of the reasons for the limited overlap between previous studies and the present one we can identify several contributing factors A major factor is the ability of the SSH procedure to identify genes that are expressed differentially but at low levels As noted earlier more than half of the differentially expressed genes in the present collection can be classified as rarely transcribed on the basis of their representation by six or fewer ESTs among the more than 100 000 Arabidopsis ESTs sequenced Indeed almost 17 of the genes in our SSH collection are being entered in the Arabidopsis EST database for the first time as a result of the present work It seems unlikely that the genes represented on the EST arrays used by Maleck et al 7 and Desikan et al 18 comprise an unbiased sample of Arabidopsis genes as genes transcribed in normal plants and at moderate or high levels are more likely to be represented than the rarely but differentially transcribed genes that dominate the stress cDNA collection In addition there are differences in experimental conditions and in detection sensitivity that undoubtedly contribute but whose contribution to different outcomes is difficult to assess But it should also be noted that the overlap between microarray datasets generated using the same conditions and organisms in different laboratories can be surprisingly low particularly when different microarray technologies are used Enriched cDNA libraries such as the one we have constructed may therefore contribute to the characterization of the stress transcriptome through the construction of standardized specialized arrays Functional classification of genes represented in SSH libraries We were able to assign nearly three quarters of the genes to functional groups based on sequence similarities with known genes or motifs see Additional data files Although functional assignment based only on sequence homology needs experimental verification it nonetheless provides a measure of the diversity of the genes in the stress cDNA collection Genes from all the major functional categories are represented in the collection Figure 5 and see Additional data files Genes encoding proteins involved in stress defense signaling comprise 13 of the genes in the collection They include genes encoding proteins involved in signal perception several types of receptor kinases and signal transmission G proteins protein kinases protein phosphatases calcium binding proteins see Additional data files About 10 of the genes 79 in the collection were classified as stress defense response genes This includes genes encoding proteins of the antioxidant response GSTs peroxidases the SAR response pathogenesis related genes and cell rescue 50 Genes induced in response to other stresses such as drought 51 heat shock 52 dehydration 53 54 55 and elicitors such as Avr9 56 avrRpt2 57 and harpins 58 59 were also identified in the stress cDNA collection underscoring the overlap between the different stress responses Genes encoding proteins involved in moving modifying storing and degrading proteins constituted the third largest group 12 in the stress cDNA collection Nearly half of the genes 45 in this category 92 are involved in proteolysis see Additional data files Proteolysis of important regulatory proteins is a key aspect of cellular regulation in eukaryotes 60 61 and there is evidence that the ubiquitin proteasome pathway is important in implementation of the plant defense response 62 63 64 Proteosome subunit genes are induced in response to stresses 65 66 and several regulatory subunits were identified in the stress cDNA collection The F box containing proteins of the SCF complex constitute a family of E3 ligases key components of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway 67 as are many RING finger proteins 68 The RING finger motif is thought to mediate protein protein interactions and E3 ligase complex assembly Certain RING finger proteins are rapidly induced by elicitors in Arabidopsis and may be involved in the rapid degradation of regulatory proteins during early stages of pathogen attack 69 Four genes encoding proteins with an F box domain and seven different genes encoding RING RING H2 finger proteins including the elicitor induced ATL6 like gene 69 were identified in the stress cDNA collection In summary the stress cDNA collection comprises a broad repertoire of stress responsive genes encoding proteins that are involved in both the initial and subsequent stages of the physiological response to abiotic stress and pathogens Transcription factors and regulatory elements in the promoters of genes in the stress cDNA collection The WRKY transcription factors are involved in defense wounding senescence and plant development 7 16 70 71 72 73 There are 70 genes with a WRKY domain in the Arabidopsis genome and six of them WRKY15 25 33 46 62 70 are in the stress cDNA collection These WRKY transcription factors modulate gene expression by binding to W boxes and W box like motifs which are significantly over represented in the promoters of the genes in the stress cDNA collection Table 3a The bZIP transcription factors are important in the regulation of genes activated by light UV radiation pathogen attacks elicitors wounding abscisic acid ABA treatment and SA treatment 47 71 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 We identified two basic zipper bZIP transcription factors and basic helix loop helix bHLH transcription factors in the stress cDNA collection The promoters of a subset of genes in the stress cDNA collection are enriched in G box and TGA motifs suggesting that they may be regulated by these bZIP and bHLH transcription factors Identifying insertional knock outs or creating antisense lines for these transcription factor genes and using them for expression profiling with microarrays constructed from the stress cDNA collection will facilitate identification of the targets for these transcription factors Abscisic acid response elements ABREs are important during the plant s response to abiotic stresses such as dehydration salinity and cold all of which are ABA mediated 82 83 There is evidence that ROS are involved in ABA signaling 84 The enrichment of the ABRE motif in the promoter sequences of the genes in the stress cDNA collection may reflect crosstalk among stress signaling pathways mediated by common second messengers such as H 2 O 2 The over representation of the SA inducible element in the promoter sequences of the genes in the stress cDNA collection especially those in the SA library further validates the enrichment of the stressor specific genes using the SSH technique and suggests that these genes may be regulated by the changes in the levels of SA that occurs in stress responses 85 The motifs associated with the hormone ethylene GCC box and EIN3 were not significantly over represented in the promoters of genes represented in the stress cDNA collection A plausible reason is that SA and ethylene act antagonistically to each other 5 The over representation of the SA inducible genes in the collection may be correlated with the reduced representation of the ethylene responsive genes in the stress cDNA collection The Myb1 motif was identified in Antirrhinum 86 the Myb2 and Myb3 motifs in Petunia 87 These sequences have not been verified as valid Myb binding motifs in Arabidopsis The under representation of the DRE like element suggests that genes whose expression is modulated by pathogen attacks and oxidative stress signaling may have minimal overlap with genes involved in dehydration and cold responses There is evidence that the H box motif is involved in developmental regulation of flowering but there is no report of its involvement in stress defense responses 88 89 However a combination of the H box motif and the G box motif has been shown to be important for binding of bZIP transcription factors to rapidly induce defense related genes 47 90 91 The significant over representation of these two motifs together in the promoter sequences of the stress cDNA collection suggests that combinatorial interactions between these two cis elements may also be important in the regulation of stress responsive genes It is becoming increasingly evident that a major theme underlying eukaryotic transcriptional regulation is combinatorial control 92 Identifying the cis elements and the cognate transcription factors that bind to them during stress or defense responses is the first step towards characterization of higher order nucleoprotein complexes Materials and methods Plant materials and growth conditions A thaliana ecotype Col 0 plants were grown in soil Scotts Sierra Horticultural Products Company Marysville OH in 5 cm pots 50 per flat under fluorescent light 30 W m 2 s with a 14 h

the chronic ozone library RNA was isolated as described below Bacterial infections Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato Pst DC3000 which causes bacterial speck disease in Col 0 plants was used to infect plants for construction of the virulent bacterial library The Pst DC3000 expressing avrRpm1 gene induces hypersensitive cell death in Col 0 plants and was used to infect plants for constructing the avirulent bacterial library The bacteria were grown on King s agar plates at 28 C Bacterial cultures were prepared by resuspending the cells from overnight cultures in 10 mM MgCl 2 to the required optical density OD 600 0 05 1 OD 600 10 9colony forming units CFU ml A titer of 5 10 7CFU ml was used for infiltrations Leaves were infiltrated on the abaxial side using a 1 ml syringe The inoculated leaves were harvested 1 8 and 24 h after inoculation Equal amounts of tissue were pooled from each time point for library construction Inoculations with Peronospora parasitica The Ahco strain of P parasitica was maintained on Col 0 plants and the Emwa strain on Ws plants in a growth chamber with 10 h day at 16 C and 14 h dark period at 20 C Fresh spores were collected in water and the inoculum was adjusted to 2 10 4conidiosporangia per milliliter and applied as a fine mist to the seedlings using an airbrush sprayer Paasche Air Brush Company Harwood Heights IL The sprayed plants were placed in a tray containing water soaked paper towels covered with a lid sprayed on the inside with a fine mist of water and sealed using plastic wrap to maintain the humidity The sprayed plants were transferred to the growth chamber in which the pathogen is regularly maintained Control plants were sprayed with water using the airbrush sprayer and were maintained under the same conditions Seedlings were harvested 1 3 and 5 days after inoculation and pooled for RNA extraction and identification of genes induced in the compatible interaction between Col 0 plants and the Ahco strain of

Trizol 1 ml reagent 0 1 g fresh weight tissue then allowed to stand at room temperature for 5 10 min Chloroform isoamyl alcohol 24 1 was added using 0 2 ml ml Trizol Samples were mixed by vortexing and allowed to stand at room temperature for 2 5 minutes more then centrifuged for 15 min at 10 000 g The upper aqueous layer was removed to a clean tube and RNA was precipitated with an equal volume of isopropanol After 10 min at room temperature samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 10 000 g to pellet the RNA The pellet was washed with 75 ethanol and resuspended in RNase free water The typical yield of total RNA was 50 80 g 100 mg leaf tissue Poly A RNA was purified from total RNA using PolyTract oligo dT columns Promega Madison WI Suppression subtractive hybridization SSH SSH was carried out using the PCR Select Subtractive Hybridization kit Clontech Palo Alto CA Experimental and control samples for each treatment were processed simultaneously to reduce false positives We increased the amount of mRNA to 3 4 g from the 2 g recommended by the manufacturer to compensate for the loss of mRNA during the phenol chloroform extractions cDNA prepared from the treated samples was used as the tester and that from the control sample as driver for the forward subtraction to isolate fragments corresponding to genes whose expression level was increased following the treatment The reverse subtraction was carried out with the control sample as tester to isolate fragments corresponding to genes whose expression level decreased following the treatment The PCR based enrichment of differentially expressed sequences depends on the number of tester molecules with adaptors ligated to their ends If the fraction of tester cDNA with the adaptors was less than 25 ligations were repeated We designed plant specific glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase G3PDH primers to test the ligation efficiency as recommended by the manufacturer A G3PDH gene fragment of approximately 300

cloning Cloning and differential screening Secondary PCR products were cloned into the T A cloning vector pCR2 1TOPO Invitrogen acute O 3 library or the Advantage PCR cloning vector Clontech all the other libraries according to manufacturer s instructions About 500 1000 colonies were picked and grown in 96 well microtiter plates in LB medium with 100 mg 1 ampicillin The clones were amplified using the nested primers 1 and 2R Clontech manual to check for the presence and size of individual inserts The PCR products were run on high density agarose gels in duplicate 200 wells gel and transferred to nylon filters The membranes were hybridized under stringent conditions with equivalent amounts of 32P labeled probes generated from unsubtracted and subtracted cDNAs Sequencing and sequence analysis Cycle sequencing reactions were prepared using BigDye dye terminator modified for smaller reactions with Half term GenPak Stony Brook NY to conserve reagents Sequencing electrophoresis was carried out by the PSU Nucleic Acid Facility using the nested 1 or 2R adaptor primers Each sequence was edited to correct sequencing ambiguities and remove the primer sequence The edited sequences were used to query the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative AGI database using the BLAST sequence comparison algorithms at the TAIR website 93 Homologies exceeding 50 nucleotides that showed more than 90 identity to sequences in the database were considered significant Sequences that failed to show significant homologies were used to query the GenBank minus EST and BAC ends database using the BLAST algorithms The MIPS website 36 was searched for each sequence that exceeded the significance threshold to gather information including the genomic location of the clone the name of the gene and the number of ESTs The entire predicted protein coding sequence of each gene obtained from the MIPS website was then used to search the InterPro database 37 for identifying protein domains Northern blot analysis Total RNA was fractionated on a 1 2 agarose 0 4 M formaldehyde RNA gel and transferred to Hybond N nylon membrane Amersham Pharmacia UK Probes were made from PCR amplified fragments of selected clones using the ReadyPrime random primed DNA labeling kit Amersham Pharmacia with 32P ICN Biomedicals Irvine CA Blots were hybridized and washed according to standard procedures 94 Stress motifs for promoter analysis Sixteen stress related cis elements were selected on the basis of their identification in other studies on Arabidopsis stress defense modulated genes 7 16 71 The frequency of W box TTGACY and W box like BBWGACYT elements was tested as these are binding sites for plant specific WRKY transcription factors involved in plant development and plant responses to environmental stresses 7 16 70 71 72 73 G boxes CACGTG H boxes CCTACC and TGA motifs TGACG are binding sequences for bZIP transcription factors which have an important role in the regulation of genes activated by environmental cues 71 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 We also tested some of the well characterized stress hormone responsive motifs including the ABA response element BACGTGKM 95 SA inducible motif ACGTCA 96 two ethylene related motifs GCC box GCCGCC 97 and the EIN3 motif GGATGTA 98 The Arabidopsis Myc and Myb homologs are important in the plant s responses to pathogens low temperatures and dehydration 82 99 100 We tested for the frequency of occurrence of the Myc element CACATG and four different Myb motifs AtMyb1 MTCCWACC AtMyb2 TAACSGTT AtMyb3 TAACTAAC AtMyb4 AMCWAMC 71 101 in the promoters of genes identified by cDNAs in the stress collection We also tested the frequency of occurrence of two other known stress motifs the DRE DRCCGACNW 95 and the HSE CTNGAANNTTCNA 102 to determine the extent of overlap in genes activated during different stresses Probability and significance calculations for promoter analysis To determine whether a particular motif is over represented among the promoters of a given SSH library we first determined the frequency of each motif in the total complement of Arabidopsis promoters using the 1 000 bp upstream promoter files from TAIR 103 We then calculated the probability of finding m promoter regions having one or more motifs in the set of n promoters in each SSH library as well as in the total SSH library collection We considered a motif to be significantly over represented if this probability was less than 0 05 These calculations were implemented using Perl scripts that are available from the StresDB 104 Additional data files
