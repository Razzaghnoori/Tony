 Selling Seals of Approval Walk into any home improvement megastore find their wall o carbon monoxide detectors and you ll notice that only one product carries the American Lung Association seal on its box American Sensors Does this mean American Sensors CO detectors are the best Better than those made by First Alert Nighthawk or others Not exactly American Sensors ranked fourth in tests conducted by Consumer Reports last year Three of its models were deemed not acceptable by the magazine thanks to a design flaw since fixed that could have short circuited the device What the seal really tells you is that charities have found a new way to fatten their budgets by exclusive contracts with private companies The American Cancer Society recently sold its logo to the Florida Department of Citrus for 1 million a year It gets another million annually from SmithKline Beecham which puts the ACS logo on its Nicoderm brand nicotine patches Not to be outdone the makers of Nicotrol a competing patch product recently inked a two year deal with the ALA for 2 5 million The deals are exclusive but they re not endorsements The charities don t test the products or ensure that the highest quality ones get their logos Charities say they need the money Competition from thousands of other nonprofits makes fund raising difficult The ACS says its surveys show that the public supports such contracts so long as they raise plenty of money for the charity and don t conflict with its basic mission But getting in bed with corporate America carries sizable risks Charities selling their halos as some have put it risk damaging their reputations as sources of independent information And in some cases they seem to be skating close to the edge of propriety if not the law Take for example the sticky problem of the charities benefiting from what appears to be false advertising Companies wouldn t pony up the bucks for a charity s logo if they didn t think it gave them a competitive edge Why would they think that it would Because at least some consumers are going to be misled into thinking this is a special thing I think it s flat out misleading says Robert Lawry director of the Center for Professional Ethics at Case Western Reserve University Two deals have already fallen through because government officials concluded the same thing The American Heart Association dropped its HeartGuide Seal program in 1990 after federal regulatory agencies complained it would mislead consumers The program started in 1988 endorsed in exchange for a sizable fee food products that met certain standards The U S Department of Agriculture refused to let the AHA put its seal on any products it regulated Last year McNeil Consumer Products agreed to pay nearly 2 million to settle a complaint filed by 19 state attorneys general with regard to its Arthritis Foundation brand aspirin Ads for the pills claimed the drugs were somehow new although they were just plain old aspirin The ads said the Arthritis Foundation helped create the pills though it didn t McNeil dropped the product after the attorneys general complained even though a company spokesman says it exited the business because it wasn t achieving its goals McNeil he added still donates more than 1 million annually to the AF Companies admit that the logos help sales thanks to the appearance of an endorsement where none exists It definitely helps us sell our products says Peter Paris a spokesman for SmithKline Beecham maker of Nicoderm because it provides the consumer with a more credible resource behind this particular product Well not behind it per se The charities Paris adds don t endorse the product at all American Sensors has seen its detector sales skyrocket from under 1 million in 1993 to well over 60 million today Did the ALA logo help I certainly think it helped sales of our detectors says Mike Lupynec the company s president and CEO So how do the charities respond They say they try to make clear on the label that it reflects a partnership not a product endorsement But they admit that at least some consumers are being misled by the logo Is there an implied endorsement The answer to that has to be yes There is no way around it said American Cancer Society Vice President Steve Dickinson That s a gray area says John Kirkwood who is with the ALA of Metropolitan Chicago If you re standing there looking at the shelf you might say Hmm maybe I ll buy the product with the logo as opposed to the one that doesn t have any That s a reality Kirkwood was instrumental in putting the ALA American Sensors deal together He later served on American Sensors board but insists there was no quid pro quo Another land mine Can charities that cut lucrative deals with product makers be counted on to provide accurate information about health and safety issues related to those products Heightened fear about CO poisonings in the home might help sell detectors but only 400 people a year die this way according to the National Safety Council Nearly five times as many die of suffocation each year at home And CO deaths were falling steadily long before home detectors hit the market Is the ALA going to tell you about that Nicotine patches work only about 20 percent of the time True they often help hard core smokers quit when other systems have failed But the most effective way to quit is to save your money and go cold turkey Are the health charities going to advertise this fact Getting too cozy with corporate interests carries other risks as well The American Lung Association for instance has been attacked in the past for at least giving the appearance of lobbying on behalf of corporate interests that have opened their checkbooks Back in 1994 the ALA and some of its state affiliates started bashing the cement kiln industry which was trying to get permits to burn toxic waste The ALA complained that the practice was hazardous to people s health Fair enough But it happens that at the same time the charity was getting grants totaling more than 150 000 from the Association for Responsible Thermal Treatment which represented the kiln industry s direct competitor in the waste incineration business When officials from the Cement Kiln Recycling Coalition asked about this at a meeting ALA officials said that state chapters which are relatively autonomous ran the campaigns But one ALA official added that the charity would be happy to take money from the kiln industry too provided the grants came with no strings attached In January 1995 the kiln industry filed a complaint with the Internal Revenue Service charging that the ALA was being paid to lobby on behalf of a commercial interest a violation of its nonprofit tax status And in late 1994 the national ALA took out an ad in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette promoting a centralized auto emissions test program called E Check which used testing equipment made by Arizona based Envirotest Systems Corp over another kind of testing regime The advertisement generated a flood of phone calls to the ALA s Western Pennsylvania chapter from outraged donors said the state chapter s executive director It turns out that Envirotest had also been a generous donor to the national ALA giving a total of more than 100 000 to the charity between 94 and 95 according to tax filings Given these risks why pursue these relationships Some charities plead poverty You ve got something like 18 000 new nonprofits in the past 10 years says the ALA s Kirkwood And they re all competing for the same dollar But budgets for the big charities have seen healthy gains in recent years The ALA s national office saw its total revenues climb almost 30 percent in the four years before it signed its deal with American Sensors according to the charity s tax filings American Cancer Society revenues have climbed almost 40 percent so far in this decade More likely it s reluctance on the part of companies to part with money without seeing any direct benefit Nonprofits can t count on corporations to give millions of dollars just because they want to be good citizens says Paris who once worked at the ALA Now everything has to be linked to a stronger benefit
