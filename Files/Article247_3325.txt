 The Gilded and the Unvarnished Good morning Jodi What a glorious air conditioned day here in Washington Even though my Rotisserie baseball team the Nattering Nabobs is mired in the second division I began my reading rounds by checking the late West Coast box scores in USA Today My eyes then darted over to a comment by Seattle Mariners superstar Ken Griffey Jr in response to press comments reportedly made by his father baseball s original Ken Griffey Said Griffey the Younger My dad s been in baseball how many years He knows what to say and what not to say Griffey s remark conjured up the famous scene in Bull Durham in which Kevin Costner instructs a young pitcher in the art of answering all press questions with innocuous sports cliches These days as even toddlers learn how to practice spin virtually everyone quoted in the news knows what to say and what not to say That s why I m going to devote this morning missive to the handful of brave souls who dared to tell truth in today s papers Hats off to Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Dominici who is trying to put the brakes on the Republicans heedless zeal to pass a tax cut bill in order to provoke a presidential veto they can then use in the 2000 campaign As the Washington Post puts it Dominici is concerned that the GOP leadership may end up with an issue but no legislation That of course is exactly Trent Lott s game plan The danger lurking just offshore like a surplus eating shark is that Bill Clinton will ultimately agree to something like a 600 billion tax cut in order to clear the decks for some sort of grand compromise on Social Security and Medicare Buried inside the Post and the Times is the news that Al Gore s chief of staff Ron Klain has resigned to become a partner with O Melvany Myers It had long been rumored that Klain was about to take the fall for the snafus that have bedeviled Gore s campaign Kudos to Katharine Seelye who didn t pull any punches on the Klain ouster in her short piece in the Times She quotes Gore staffers who recounted that in a recent meeting Klain said he was like a milk carton and milk cartons have an expiration date But in his on the record comments Klain gave a full Bull Durham claiming that my heart said stay but my head told me it was time to move on I was deeply saddened to read of the death of Willie Morris someone I never met but long admired As a college student in the late 1960s I remember how I thrilled to read each issue of Harper s during Morris tenure as editor Peter Applebome who wrote the Times obit wins truth telling points for a paragraph that began Mr Morris drank too much bourbon and red wine smoked too many Viceroys stayed up too late and caroused too much Now for some unfinished business Jodi I awoke still feeling the stab marks from your last entry yesterday OK my sentence about day trading being emblematic of the glitz and greed 90s was not worthy of being included in my collected works But something weird is happening out there which makes the late 90s different from the junk bond era and the Las Vegas Strip The Metro section of today s Washington Post features a sad story about the money woes and vituperative divorce proceedings of local Congressman James Moran Court papers filed by attorneys for Mary Moran the congressman s estranged wife allege that the northern Virginia legislator had a history of wasting the family assets on his stock market gambling And the Wall Street Journal returning to the perils of day trading begins a Page 1 leader with the tale of Barbara Harkness a retired anthropology professor who was seduced by the new Gilded Age Harkness who used to safeguard her money in thrift accounts claims to have made money in the market But the Journal observes from cautious saver to citizen speculator in just a decade that s quite a trek across the spectrum of financial risk Anyway it s time for me to make a trek of my own off to a newsstand in quest of my very own inaugural issue of Talk Something tells me that it won t shimmer anything like Willie Morris Harper s Eagerly awaiting your epiphanies from the F train
