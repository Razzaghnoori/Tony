 Where to Go New Providence It s not the largest of the Bahamas islands and not the most stunningly beautiful yet when most people think of the Bahamas they first think of New Providence or its major town Nassau The island is only 80 square miles in size yet 180 000 of the 280 000 Bahamians lives here The town and its port and international airport are the hub for every activity in the Bahamas Government administration taxes and furniture shipments for new homes all start from here and radiate out to the other islands New Providence also attracts over 3 million visitors every year and Nassau is one of the main cruise ports of the Caribbean The island is a magnet for fun seekers and serious shoppers and it serves both very well Nassau Nassau town has a fine pedigree dating back through colonial times and the compact town center still has the feel of life under the English Out in the natural harbor which offered shelter to many a pirate ship is a major port that can accommodate 15 large cruise ships at one time This capacity was created in 1965 when public money was invested to dredge the port specifically to allow bigger ships to enter The huge vessels hundreds of feet high dwarf the towns buildings which regulations set at a maximum of three stories and create one of the most effective juxtapositions of modernity and history found anywhere in the world The cruise port at Prince George Wharf brings in by far the majority of visitors to the Bahamas Immediately in front of the cruise port you ll find a line of horse drawn surreys waiting to offer you a genteel tour along the historic streets The horses wait under the cooling shade for their next customers In the hot summer months the horses are not allowed to work from 2 4pm The horses trot slowly past all the sights in town but you can also easily stroll around yourself and see everything in a couple of hours if you re not seduced by the many shopping opportunities between the docks and the historic old town The first sight that will attract your attention is the Straw Market on Market Plaza which backs onto Woodes Rodgers Walk For many years this has been the showcase for Bahamian handicrafts Straw goods including baskets and mats are favorite souvenirs each island produces straw goods in its own style and patterns Bestsellers are hats dolls bags and baskets There is some exquisite work to be found but be aware that with a decline in basket making throughout the Bahamas an increasing number of articles are imported from the Far East most of these are at the cheaper end of the scale The ubiquitous modern souvenir the T shirt is also available with an almost limitless number of pictures patterns and slogans The ladies who run the stalls are easy going and seem to have limitless enthusiasm for the next sale You ll hear numerous calls of Hey honey come look for something nice here The straw market fronts onto Bay Street one of the leading duty free shopping capitals of the world Only a few years ago this street was the domain of the Bay Street Boys a small group of men who controlled all economic activity in the Bahamas now Bay Street seduces visitors with huge sparkling gems hundreds of ounces of gold and the smell of a thousand designer fragrances The fa ades of the pretty 18th century shops hide modern air conditioned shopping palaces piled high with luxury goods Many visitors especially those with only a few hours to spare go no farther than the shops of Nassau shopping for a bargain can be exhausting It would be a shame however not to explore what the rest of Nassau has to offer as there are a number of historic gems to be discovered in and around the town The Bahamian people appreciate and enjoy the many touches of colonial history retained from its days as part of the British Empire Rawson Square just in front of the entrance to Prince George Wharf is a good place to start your tour The tourist information office here can arm you with leaflets and maps that will help you make the most of your day Directly opposite Rawson Square across Bay Street are the Public Buildings of Parliament Square which have been in continuous use since 1812 They were modeled on the governmental complex in New Bern capital of the North Carolina colony two centuries ago A marble statue of a young seated Queen Victoria in front recalls the era of British rule The two chambers of the modern House of Assembly meet in the so called western building on the right side if you re facing from the square the public records office and government publications department are housed in the other historic buildings Behind them in modern edifices are the Law Courts Here you may find yourself in the middle of a parade to open parliament or convene the courts The smart uniforms and pomp are taken directly from British ceremonial activities but the ambiance is truly Bahamian Check with the Tourist Board for dates of ceremonial occasions all of which happen frequently Behind the modern law court complex is the Nassau Public Library interesting because it used to be the island s jail The octagonal structure on Shirley Street dates from 1797 and has a pretty exterior but the interior is more fascinating The old cells were retained when the structure became the library in 1873 and books line every wall replacing prisoners and creating private reading areas The library museum also has a collection of old maps and charts used to navigate the waters around the Bahamas If you re walking continue east along Shirley Street until you reach Elizabeth Avenue and turn right The land rises suddenly here This area behind the downtown area had been used to great strategic effect by the British Fort Fincastle was built atop the rise in 1793 to watch the shipping lanes and protect Nassau harbor The tiny fort is shaped like the prow of a ship though there is hardly enough room to fit a football team never mind a unit of the queen s soldiery To reach the fort you must climb the Queen s Staircase an artificial narrow gorge leading to 65 steps that climb a hillside Both the gorge and the staircase created to allow soldiers to reach or leave the fort quickly were hewn from the solid limestone by a contingent of slave workers At the top of the staircase and next to the fort the Water Tower offers a bird s eye view over Nassau Paradise Island and most of the rest of New Providence A small elevator in the concrete structure will carry you 125 ft 38 m to the top Don t forget your camera After a visit to the tower return to the compact town center Stroll along any street and you ll bump into fine historic buildings several date from the late 1700s and most are painted in pretty pastels that cheerfully reflect the bright Bahamian sunlight Pink and white Balcony House on Market Street is a particularly fine example The oldest wooden house on the island it was built by shipwrights around 1790 of American soft cedar it has been restored and is now a museum that offers a delightful view of life in well to do Nassau in the 18th century Once a private home visited by the likes of the Duke of Windsor and Winston Churchill Graycliff Mansion on West Hill Street is now a fine hotel with a well regarded menu and wine list Many of the original Georgian Colonial features have been retained and a collection of photographs provide guests and visitors with a glimpse into the building s genteel past Vendue House at the western end of Bay Street at the corner of George Street was once the site of the Nassau slave auction It now houses the Pompey Museum of Slavery and Emancipation The pale pink stone house is unassuming but the interior tells of the plight of slaves on the islands and of the positive work that was undertaken in the years following emancipation The Pirates of Nassau attraction at the corner of George and Marlborough Streets brings to life the dramatic and exciting world of the pirates The building itself dates from the 18th century the attraction inside recreates the Nassau quayside of the 17th century A three quarter size French corvette ship and quayside buildings have been stunningly brought to life As you walk along the dock costumed staff act out the roles of shipmate and pirate and regale you with tales of their everyday lives and deeds Visitors then step inside the 75 ft 23 m long vessel to examine the paraphernalia of the pirate s trade that line the corridors and decks Treasure chests mix with rum casks and pirates tell of their lives at sea in the lonely and dangerous times Listen to the groaning of injured pirates and witness the rudimentary and unsanitary surgical techniques that led to so many deaths the ship s carpenter doubled as surgeon Read about the crew s diet of salmagundi a stew of pickled herrings meat and eggs mixed with wine and vinegar which served to both preserve the protein and disguise the taste Battle scenes are vividly recreated and visitors find out the truth about what finally became of some of the most famous pirates The next street to the west is Blue Hill Road About 1 640 ft 500 m south of Shirley Street opposite Graycliff Mansion stands Government House the official residence of the Governor General painted in the same shade of pink as the buildings of Parliament Square At the north gate is a statue of Christopher Columbus in a rather dashing pose reminiscent of Errol Flynn in one of his swashbuckling films Once every two weeks there is a solemn Changing of the Guard parade similar to the one at Buckingham Palace in London performed to the accompaniment of the Police Band On the last Friday of the month from January to June all visitors to the island are invited to attend a huge tea party on the grounds Paradise Island Across Nassau Harbour north of the town is Paradise Island known until the 1940s as Hog Island For many centuries the island simply acted as a protective barrier against bad weather and attack from invaders Its recent history is fascinating In the 1930s it was owned by Swedish millionaire Axel Wenner Gren an arms manufacturer who was found to be a Nazi sympathizer He sold the island to Huntingdon Hartford who changed the name from Hog to Paradise and created a beautiful private retreat now the Ocean Club Hotel Later gangster Per Lansky began the process that transformed the island from a private sanctuary with magnificent homes into a playground for tourists The wonderful beaches such as Cabbage Beach on the northern coast were the focus of the development The first hotels began to appear in the 1960s when gambling was a lure to the rich and famous As Paradise Island saw owners Donald Trump and Merv Griffin come and go it went through a continuing series of developments and re developments Today Paradise Island may be close to fulfilling the dream of the perfect vacation playground It has many of the essential ingredients needed fine white sand beaches a protected marina a golf course a group of fine hotels and perhaps the biggest adult playground this side of Las Vegas The brainchild of the Sol Group Atlantis Paradise Island is a new concept in resorts it s a huge hotel with an amazing theme park and entertainment village all on one site The resort takes its name and inspiration from the lost city of Atlantis said by some to lie off the coast of Bimini This theme runs throughout the whole resort The vast open foyers and public areas of the hotel have high columns of cathedral like dimensions the walkways and outside terraces recall Mayan temples with large stones covering the fa ade Waterfalls literally or figuratively cascade to give a feeling of a city just having risen from the ocean Man made sheltered lagoons provide for safe swimming snorkeling and sunbathing The masterpiece of the whole Atlantis complex is the enormous Aquarium which can be viewed from almost any point in the resort from the rooms above in the towers from ground level and from below ground Within the Aquarium is an area called the Dig a spectacular underwater environment complete with sunken treasures vast stone columns fallen temples and godlike figures all intended to show what Atlantis might look like while being excavated The entire attraction has then been filled with sea water and a complete ecosystem of fish and crustaceans 100 000 in all Sharks and rays patrol the waterways eels and lobsters lurk in the crevices and fissures A truly awe inspiring sight The resort boasts 20 restaurants three shopping malls and a vast casino area Outside water slides nature trails and swimming pools indicate that no expense has been spared to create the ultimate playground for all age groups Many visitors to the Bahamas drop in just to marvel at the artistry and technical skill that was employed to create this complex Non guests must pay a fee to enjoy the resort facilities and an extra fee for a visit to the Dig At the eastern end of Paradise Island stands a much older structure that offers the opportunity for restful contemplation The Cloisters are the remains of a 14th century monastery that was bought in France by Huntingdon Hartford taken apart and rebuilt in the grounds of his home now the Ocean Club hotel Hartford set the small courtyard on a rise several hundred yards away from the house and created an elaborate garden to lead to the edifice The Versailles Gardens based on Louis XIV s formal palace gardens outside Paris have terraces fountains and statues that provide a soothing vista leading the eye from the house to the cloisters It is possible to visit the Cloisters during daylight hours they stand next to the only road that traverses the island but they are used regularly for wedding ceremonies so you might find them closed Paradise Island is connected to New Providence by two bridges that rise high into the air to allow boat traffic to pass beneath One bridge carries traffic on to the island the other takes traffic back to Nassau there is a small toll for vehicles At the foot of the bridges is a small quay where you can catch a ferry to Woodes Rogers Walk in Nassau port This is also the docking point for boats to Blue Lagoon and the Dolphin Experience A small cay just a 20 minute boat ride from Paradise Island Blue Lagoon is the site of a facility where you can swim with the dolphins or help the staff look after the animals for a day Boats leave several times a day No public buses jitneys are allowed over the toll bridge to Paradise Island You ll need to take a taxi to and from Nassau if you don t use the ferry Once on the island however you can use the public bus service which runs the length of the island linking the hotels with the quayside and the small shopping center Underneath the bridges in the harbor is a small island called Potter s Cay This is where fishing boats and mail boats dock and where real Bahamian life happens Stalls sell fresh conch salad and people sit and wait for the night s sailing The harbor master s office here can help you with mail boat schedules and prices Beyond Nassau There are a number of interesting attractions outside of Nassau that make it worthwhile to rent a car or hire a taxi for the day West of Nassau Head west out of Nassau and within a couple of minutes you ll encounter three very different attractions There s no missing the austere gray ramparts of Fort Charlotte which guards the western approaches to Nassau Harbour Built by Lord Dunmore in 1787 89 during the Napoleonic Wars and named after the wife of George III this is the largest fort in the Bahamas But not one shot was ever fired from here in anger the only volleys ever launched were part of ceremonial salutes Life must have been pretty boring for the soldiers as many had the time to carve their names in the stones along the battlements Guides escort visitors around the interior of the fort as well as through the dungeons which thankfully saw little torture In fact Fort Charlotte is well regarded by New Providence residents as a shelter during hurricanes Nearby is Ardastra Gardens Zoo and Conservation Centre a landscaped park famed for its pink flamingos which are paraded three times a day into a small enclosure to offer visitors a closer look These birds once common in certain Bahamian islands are now disappearing though the reasons for the decline are disputed Another endangered species the Bahamian Parrot is under threat from loss of habitat The Gardens is one of only a small number of centers that has developed a breeding program for this vocal and gregarious bird in the hope of replenishing colonies in the wild There are many more species of Caribbean mammals reptiles birds and fish to find as you explore the 51 2 acres of tropical parkland Head back to the main coast road and you will find two small cays lying immediately offshore The first is Arawak Cay home to the local fishing fleet A number of colorful shacks line the approach road where you can buy conch and fried fish always fresh and always delicious Weekends can be busy with local families Travel through Arawak Cay to reach Silver Cay where there is a small resort with a pretty beach Here you will find Crystal Cay site of a marine park where you can take a close look at the undersea world without getting wet A man made coral reef has been created on the sea bottom and you can watch all the marine activity from an underwater observatory The reef attracts many kinds of aquatic creatures that are free to come and go as they please The observatory looks decidedly futuristic and can be seen quite clearly from the road as you travel along the coast Other activities at Crystal Cay include a sea turtle environment a touch pool where you can stroke a sting ray or pet a conch and a snorkel trail if you want to get into the water yourself A little further west along the coast you will find Cable Beach the third main center of tourism on New Providence Several luxury hotels line the shore only 5 minutes by car from central Nassau The Nassau Marriott Resort Hotel attracts many visitors with its casino stage shows and restaurants The Cable Beach strip is under continual development and a number of private restaurants have opened recently to provide alternatives for guests staying at the resorts East of Nassau The territory east and southeast of Nassau has seen a great deal of development in the last twenty years many of the major residential areas that have sprung up hold little interest for visitors One legacy of the past is Blackbeard s Tower said to have been a lookout post for the famous pirate It is a little careworn and forlorn today and may be worth visiting only for its view of the harbor Guarding the eastern entrance to Nassau harbor is tiny Fort Montague least visited of the old colonial fortifications It now looks out towards the pleasure palaces of Paradise Island Grand Bahama Northwest of New Providence Grand Bahama Island was largely ignored through colonial history and was for a long time a comparative backwater That it is now the second most popular tourist destination in the Bahamas is all due to the forethought of one man and a great deal of investment made since 1955 The British had little interest in developing Grand Bahama but the island lies only 55 miles from the Florida coast and in the post World War II period it finally attracted the attention of developers As the economy of the US grew and Bahamian US trade increased a group of businessmen led by Wallace Groves saw the potential in the development of Grand Bahama In 1955 the British government signed the Hawksbill Agreement which gave Groves 50 000 acres 20 000 hectares of land and a concession to import duty free goods In return Groves agreed to build a deep water harbor and to encourage business development First there was boom then there was bust but a container port opened in the 1990s is breathing new life into the flagging commercial sector The opening of the first casino in 1964 sparked the tourist boom and since then Grand Bahama has been busy developing as a tourist mecca Its modernity and the close links with the US create a totally different atmosphere and style compared to what you ll find in New Providence and many visitors enjoy the more American feel Freeport Lucaya The main settlement on Grand Bahama Freeport Lucaya is in fact two separate towns that have now grown together In theory Freeport was the commercial center and Lucaya the coastal resort In reality the two towns now mix so successfully it is difficult to tell where the dividing line is Most of the island s 40 000 people live here and the towns continue to develop There are no historical attractions here but Freeport Lucaya is happy to offer the alternative of unashamed hedonistic pleasure and relaxation Not surprisingly for a duty free island shopping plays a large part in a trip to Grand Bahama International Bazaar in Freeport takes you on a shopping trip around the world Enter the bazaar through the red Japanese Torii or welcome gate and you can visit France Africa and India all within a few minutes Unusual offerings such as rare stamps can be found among the standard duty free shops that carry the most exclusive names in watches jewelry and perfume Behind the South American area you ll find the Perfume Factory where you can create your own personal fragrance Mix essential oils to balance with your skin and give a name to your exclusive product You can even record the recipe on computer so that you can re order the exact fragrance at a later date The factory is set in a pretty 18th century colonial mansion replica five minute tours take visitors into the small commercial production plant where some of the Factory s own signature perfumes are made Make your way past the Continental Pavilion at the back of the International Bazaar to reach Goombay Market Here you ll find an amazing range of straw work wooden carvings and other handicrafts There are over 100 stalls so it s a great place to barter for a bargain Next door to the International Bazaar is the Princess Casino with its distinctive Moorish domes You ll be able to play alongside the high rollers at the roulette or craps tables or put a few coins in the slot machines There is also a theater that hosts nightly dance show performances The casino is part of the complex of the Bahamas Princess Resort and Casino where you ll also find a country club and two excellent 18 hole golf courses Lucaya is set on a fine sandy beach and the expansive Port Lucaya marina gives the whole resort a very nautical feel A number of large hotels line the Lucayan Beach their massive fa ades softened by the hundreds of masts of the yachts moored on the inlet As of late 1999 the casinos and many of the hotels were being given a facelift and three of the larger hotels on the waterfront were being reconfigured into a single complex Port Lucaya Marketplace is the center of all activity for the town During the day the duty free shops in this Mediterranean style shopping village tempt shoppers with jewelry clothing and perfume colorful wooden huts house craft stalls selling straw work and carvings As the sun sinks people gather at the marketplace after a day on the beach or sailing offshore The streets come alive as bars and restaurants fill up and bands play live music at the Count Basie Bandstand in a square adjoining the marina On the south side of the marina accessible from the main beach road is the Underwater Explorers Society or UNEXSO The oldest diving organization in the Bahamas UNEXSO provides diving experience sessions and training courses The large square building contains a diving pool and decompression chamber those with no interest in actually practicing the sport can visit the museum which charts the development of diving to the modern SCUBA self contained underwater breathing apparatus method developed by Jacques Cousteau in the 1930s There is also a good restaurant on site the Brass Helmet A short boatride from Port Lucaya takes you to Sanctuary Bay and the UNEXSO Dolphin Experience A family of bottlenose dolphins have set up home here You can linger by the side of the bay and hope they come to you get in the water and swim with them or spend a day as an assistant trainer and help the staff care for these gentle creatures Just north of the Marina is the Lucayan Golf and Country Club which has some of the best groomed greens in the Bahamas and a very good restaurant for those who want to watch rather than play diners enjoy panoramic views over the driving range and several holes Freeport Lucaya may be a modern town of concrete and tarmac but within the city limits are two natural areas that could be a million miles away from the bustle of the shops and large hotels Rand Memorial Nature Centre on 100 acres of land on East Settlers Way to the east of Freeport is used as a resource for students on the island but there s nothing dry and academic about it Here you can learn about the plants native to the Bahamas and find out which ones were used for bush medicine and for what purpose A flock of flamingos and numerous other native bird species make their home here To the east of Lucaya on Midshipman Road is Parrot Jungle s Garden of the Groves This beautiful garden was created in tribute to Wallace Groves and his wife and the 11 acres 41 2 hectares contain more than 10 000 different plant species The landscaping is delightful with ponds waterfalls and shady places to sit and enjoy the view A pretty chapel atop a small hill offers a fine vantage point over the whole park For the child in all of us the small petting zoo is great fun Beyond Freeport Lucaya Grand Bahama is relatively easy to explore by car with only one major road running east to McLean s Town and another north to West End Eastern Grand Bahama As you head east out of town you ll soon leave the trappings of modernity behind and find yourself on a good road through acres of Bahamian forest The road crosses a number of canals and just off the south coast is Petersons Cay a tiny but beautiful coral cay with a beach a great spot for a day of swimming snorkeling sunbathing and picnicking After traveling approximately 10 miles on the main road you ll come to Lucaya National Park there s a small parking lot on your left The 40 acre 16 hectare park sits on both sides of the main road and protects a range of Bahamian ecosystems Inland trails lead to one of the largest surveyed cave systems in the world much of which lies underwater Ben s Cave also known as Bats Cave for reasons that will be obvious when you enter is the most accessible and in fact rather small It links to the larger caves through subterranean tunnels The pool in the bottom has layers of fresh water lying on top of salt water Remains of several Lucayan Indians that were found at the cave entrance are now being studied in Nassau The caves are also home to a rare species of crustacean spelonectes Lucayensis which is said to resemble a swimming centipede Ben s Cave is closed during June and July to protect the bats during the breeding season From the right hand side of the road well marked trails lead through the vegetation and out toward the coast just a few hundred meters away a line of casuarina trees marks the spot Wooden walkways lead you farther out over a tidal mangrove swamp to Gold Rock Beach One of the most beautiful beaches on the island Gold Rock must really be seen at low tide to appreciate its full glory At high tide a shallow layer of water only a couple of inches deep covers much of the beach leaving only a narrow arc of sand above the waterline This whole area can also be explored by bicycle or kayak or by taking an eco tour One of the companies that offers both eco and cultural tours of the area is East End Adventures Tel 373 6662 e mail safari batalnet bs Western Grand Bahama Heading west from Freeport Lucaya you ll first travel past the cruise port and container port Across from the entrance to the cruise port is Pier One Restaurant where you can enjoy wonderful food and feed the sharks that gather underneath the terraces in the evening Farther west at Deadman s Reef are the remains of an ancient Lucayan settlement discovered in 1996 The last settlement on the journey is West End the oldest town on the island and today home to conch fishermen Native Bahamians like to gather here on the weekends there s always a fish fry kind of like a large communal barbecue and plenty of Kalik beer for sale During the rest of the week the village takes on a sleepy air There s little evidence left of the bad old days of Prohibition when merchants and rum runners here made fortunes smuggling liquor into the United States The Out Islands The Bahamas has traditionally been divided into three entities New Providence Grand Bahama and all the rest of the islands brought together under the collective name of the Out Islands sometimes also referred to as the Family Islands Most of the Out Islands are sparsely populated and the traditional ways of island life are much more prevalent than they are on the two main islands The rhythm of life is slower communities are smaller and time seems to stand still What activity there is centers around the boats that continually move quietly in and out of the harbors The Abacos A vaguely boomerang shaped cluster of islands east of Grand Bahama the Abacos offer perfect waters to explore by boat Stretching for some 130 miles the Abaco group consists of mainland Little Abaco and Great Abaco and an attendant string of hundreds of cays and islets They are a sailor s paradise because the numerous safe anchorages and bays have been enhanced in modern times by comprehensive back up facilities for sailors The Abacos were settled by English Loyalists during and after the American Revolution who brought with them the distinctive architectural and decorative style of New England These new immigrants made a living from cotton production and collecting sponges but after several disastrous harvests and a fierce hurricane a group of Abaconians left to create a sister community on Key West off the southern tip of Florida The people of the Abacos remained staunchly pro British even into modern times and of all the Bahamians they were the ones who expressed the most apprehension about the bid for independence in 1973 Marsh Harbour in the center of Great Abaco Island is the proverbial heart of the Abacos The town has a large harbor and has grown into a major sailing center It is now the third largest settlement in the Bahamas after Nassau and Freeport Lucaya Ships chandlers and hardware stores provide everything needed for the boats and liquor stores and supermarkets have everything for the passengers and crew A number of restaurants in and around the wide marina and bay provide opportunities for intimate dining experiences or rowdier live music sing alongs Although it is difficult to get to all the outlying cays without a boat see page 98 for information about rentals Marsh Harbour makes a good base for trips to the central section of the Abacos cays A network of reliable ferry services runs to all the major cays most of them no more than 30 minutes offshore Elbow Cay southeast of Marsh Harbour is the most popular and its capital Hope Town is one of the most charming spots in the Bahamas Yachts at anchor clutter the nearly circular harbor beneath a candy striped lighthouse few photographers can resist Rising 120 ft 37 m above sea level the Hope Town Lighthouse can be seen from a distance of 17 miles 27 km When it was built in 1864 it helped drastically reduce the number of shipping accidents and shipwrecks but it was unpopular with the native people who relied on lucrative salvage activities to make a living It is one of only three manual lighthouses in the Bahamas and has to be turned throughout the day and night by a team of dedicated lighthouse workers Climb the 101 steps to the top for fantastic views over the whole of Elbow Cay A pretty little village of pastel colored clapboard houses Hope Town is full of friendly locals Kids run safely in the streets of the traffic free town center and along the Queens Highway only slightly wider than a sidewalk Shoes are optional in the bars at the water s edge and as the sun sets you ll hear a thousand stories here about the one that got away Watch out for the sign Tourists treated just like locals for you ll soon feel as though you ve lived here forever You ll be exchanging greetings and before you know it life stories The Wyannie Malone Historical Museum on Queens Highway is the place to find out more about these fascinating people and their home island To the northwest of Marsh Harbour is Man O War Cay a small island of only 300 inhabitants famous for its boatyards The dinghies and runabouts built here are hand crafted cotton is used to seal gaps between the wooden planks The boats are then sunk so that the wet cotton expands to make them watertight Man O War is unusual in that it has always been a dry cay no alcohol is sold anywhere Great Guana Cay northwest of Man O War has wonderful long lonely beaches that run for miles along the island s eastern rim A total of only 600 people live in the island s few small settlements and the chief activity seems to be sitting under the large fig tree on the harbor front and gossiping Sailors touring through the Bahamas love to anchor offshore here this serene spot is one of the best places to switch off the rest of the world Those who don t have their own transport can take one of the four ferries that run over every day from Marsh Harbour North of Marsh Harbour you ll see signs for Treasure Cay which is strictly speaking a peninsula rather than a cay The land here has been developed into one of the largest resort areas outside the two main islands A large marina and 18 hole golf course attract a mixed group of people but the initial lure and reason for the whole development is Treasure Beach one of the best in the whole Caribbean This 6 mile arc of soft sand was for many years a Bahamian secret An airport north of Treasure Cay serves the resort and the northern offshore cays A regular ferry service links with the flight times Twenty minutes offshore is Green Turtle Cay Much more lush than many of the other islands in the Bahamas this hilly 3 mile 5 km long cay is covered with pine woodland that camouflages many of its houses and resorts A Loyalist settlement dating from 1783 groups of colonists were evacuated from Savannah and Charleston along with black slaves who escaped their owners Green Turtle in recent years has become a getaway for the rich and famous The hotels here have all the luxuries you could ever need yet you might feel as if you re a million miles away from the worries of the world The cay is small enough to explore on foot but most people choose to rent a golf cart or bicycle your hotel can make the arrangements New Plymouth is the largest town on the cay It really has only one main route Parliament Street which is full of trim and brightly painted wooden homes with picket fences As you walk down the street you ll hear the sounds of daily activity floating through the open windows occasionally a radio station with news or maybe evangelical songs You can browse in the general stores and souvenir shops or visit one of the small art galleries that sell original works and prints by local artists On the left as you walk away from the harbor you ll find the Memorial Sculpture Garden dedicated to the brave settlers who founded New Plymouth A little farther along on the right the Albert Lowe Museum in an 18th century house is brim full of artifacts and knickknacks maps and newspaper articles that tell the story of New Plymouth Lowe was a sailor and prominent shipbuilder The house is now owned by Roland Alton Lowe a descendant of Albert and an acclaimed Bahamian painter his paintings and prints are sold at the museum Abaco Gold necklaces bracelets and rings including some with turtle and conch shell motifs are sold at the Sand Dollar Shoppe on Parliament Street Tel 365 4221 Eleuthera The longest unbroken island in the Bahamas slender Eleuthera pronounced e LOOTH ra extends 100 miles 160 km from north to south yet has many stretches that are barely half a mile 1 km wide Some of the wildest Bahamian landscapes are to be found on this island that seems to be more in touch with the moods of the sea than other islands are The rocky outcrops and sometimes towering waves on the east contrast with calm waters and sandy flats on the west In the northwest a series of cays and sand banks reach out to fill the 60 miles 96 km or so between Eleuthera and New Providence Modern Bahamian history began on this island in 1648 when the Eleutherian Adventurers led by William Sayle arrived from Britain and Bermuda and founded their shaky colony They landed near the site of Governor s Harbour on the middle of the island but after a period of feuding Sayle and some of his followers moved north to Harbour Island and Spanish Wells Their descendants still live there today Although they named the island Eleuthera you may find that the local people call the island Cigatoo its old Lucayan name Harbour Island called Briland by the locals sits off the northeastern corner of the main island You can reach it via a 15 minute ride on a small ferry taxis from North Eleuthera Airport run reliable service to the docks for a set price per person The island s main town Dunmore Town is a cluster of narrow streets lined by clapboard houses festooned with bougainvillea handsome roosters strut here and there in the undergrowth Boat building and sugar production used to be the main ways the inhabitants earned a living rum production also made the town popular with Americans during Prohibition Now tourism is the major industry Bay Street runs along the harbor front where you ll find a small straw market five or six colorful stalls hugging the beach and the tourist office at the end of the jetty Wandering around you can stroll over the entire island in a few hours you ll find the Loyalist Cottage a late 18th century settler s home as well as several simple churches including the oldest Anglican church in the Bahamas St John s A number of souvenir shops in the houses have some interesting Bahamian and European gifts The beautiful pink sand beach on the Atlantic side of the island is also a big draw The five miles of sand are a beautiful sight especially in the early morning or just before sunset when the color reflects more deeply Any of the several luxury hotels tucked just behind the dunes make a good base for the beach or the delights of the town only a few minutes walk away Just off the northern tip of Eleuthera is Spanish Wells In the 16th century the Spaniards sank a well here to supply their treasure fleets with fresh water for the long journey back across the Atlantic The people of Spanish Wells are noted seamen and farmers they were given land to farm on the main island in the 18th century many still make their living by fishing for crawfish grouper yellowtail and conch or by building boats though the best known local product is perhaps the wide brimmed Spanish Wells straw hat Not as much a tourist resort as Harbour Island this quiet settlement nevertheless attracts visitors with its beaches marina and miles of offshore reef particularly good for diving The Spanish Wells Museum open Mon Sat 10am 12pm and 1 3pm records the island s history and culture On the northern coast of Eleuthera Island is Preacher s Cave the spot where the original adventurers are said to have been shipwrecked It is cathedral like in its dimensions The settlers wrote their names in charcoal on the walls of the cavern and erected a stone altar for their services unfortunately the entrance to the cave is now littered with rubbish left by modern travelers Several deserted beaches nearby including Preacher s Cay Beach Bain Bay and Ridley Head offer opportunities for solitude or very good close to shore snorkeling A few miles south of North Eleuthera Airport the island narrows to a rocky ridge just 80 ft 24 m wide Over the millennia an arched hole had been created here by the pounding of the waves of the Atlantic known as the Glass Window this opening made it possible for sailors on the Exuma Sound to see through the island to the Atlantic The natural bridge that had been formed at the top of the arch collapsed years ago during a hurricane and today you pass over the still dramatic gap from north to central Eleuthera on the man made Glass Window Bridge The bridge requires continual maintenance because storms hurricanes high winds and heavy seas take a constant toll in turbulent weather the Atlantic rises in great waves pushing towards the still calm Caribbean The first settlement after Glass Window Bridge is Gregory Town a pretty hillside community of colorful houses overlooking a tiny harbor This is the capital of pineapple production in the Bahamas Try the fresh pies from Thompson s Bakery on the top of a hill east of the harbor Halfway down the island is Governor s Harbour a photogenic town set on the sheltered eastern coastline It is a major center for sailors who come here to stock up on all the essentials obtain spare parts and have repairs done Windermere Island just off the east coast was once the place to be in the Bahamas but its smart resort hotel is now closed Jacques Cousteau had a home here and used it as a base for exploring the seas around the other Bahamian islands Southern Eleuthera is served by an airport near the little town of Rock Sound which is famed for its blue hole which Jacques Cousteau spent time investigating Although it is only half a mile from the Caribbean side of the island it actually reaches out several miles to the Atlantic Ocean and has yet to be fully explored Andros Andros is the largest island of the Bahamas at a little over 100 miles 160 km long and 40 miles 64 km wide it s almost four times larger than any other island in the Commonwealth though much of its territory is covered by uninhabitable mangrove swamp and coral limestone escarpments divided by wide creeks The island is fringed by miles of shallow sand flats on the west and ringed by coral reef on the east Perhaps because of its vastness and rugged terrain Andros became a favorite of the pirate fleets one of its major settlements is called Morgan s Bluff after the pirate leader Henry Morgan who is said to have buried treasure on one of the beaches in the area In 1821 a group of Seminole Indians left their native Florida and settled on the northern tip of the island Their descendants still live around the town of Red Bays practicing the skills of basket weaving for which they are greatly admired Their work which is of extremely high quality is said to be so tightly woven that the baskets can hold water The family of Neville Chamberlain the British Prime Minister who attempted to negotiate with Hitler before World War II created a sisal farm on the island but the attempt failed miserably Andros is famed for its natural attractions It has the third longest barrier reef in the world lying just one mile 11 2 km offshore and stretching 140 miles 225 km down the east coast This makes it a popular destination with divers who come to explore the tidal shallows the reef and the deep reef walls which plunge 6 000 ft 1 829 m down into the Tongue of the Ocean the deep passage between Andros and New Providence Numerous species of sea life flourish at every level and contribute to the abundant variety of diving environments available for all ability levels Experienced divers also come to explore the numerous so called blue holes that dot the interior of the island Created by erosion of the limestone rock these holes have a layer of fresh water that lies on top and tidal sea water below sea water forced in through countless underground fissures causes their water levels to rise or fall with the tides Andros is awash with fresh water which is put to good use over 6 million gallons are pumped into tankers each day and shipped across to New Providence where fresh water is much in demand The miles of shallow flats that meet the mangrove swamps along the west coast are an ideal environment for bonefish and Andros lays claim to being the Bonefishing Capital of the World The fishing is extremely challenging either from boats off the island or by wading in the shallows just offshore Onshore Andros is a bird watcher s paradise hardwood forests of Bahamian mahogany and mangrove and smaller areas of pine offer a varied habitat to over 120 native and migratory species Most of the major settlements lie along the eastern side of the island They are widely scattered from Congo Town in the south through Andros Town to Nicholls Town in the north Getting around the island is time consuming and difficult because it is divided by wide creeks swamps and lakes but each of these main settlements is served by an airport At Andros Town known as Fresh Creek to local people there are a few facilities for visitors and a number of small hotels One of the most popular Bahamian souvenirs is produced nearby Androsia batik brightly colored cotton fabric with tropical fish turtle or fruit motifs is hand produced at a small factory just outside the capital You can watch the patterns being pressed in wax onto the white cotton fabric and view the skeins as they re allowed to dry naturally in the warm Bahamian sun The finished batik is then used to make clothing and other products in the small factory next door The products are available in shops all over the Bahamas but you can save a good deal by buying direct from the factory The Exumas Running in a 100 mile 160 km chain directly south of New Providence the Exumas have a cay for every day of the year though some of these tiny islands are only a few hundred square feet in size and most are uninhabited The breathtaking waters surrounding these islands ranging from turquoise blue to jade green are a sailor s delight and numerous yachts can be seen weaving around the sandy shallows and cutting through to deeper water The name Exuma is said to be a derivation of the two Lucayan Indian words that had been used for this group of islands yumey and suma The largest Exuma Cays were settled by British Loyalists following the American Revolution Chief among these was Dennis Rolle who brought over 100 slaves with him to start a cotton plantation This venture began to fail after only a few years but Dennis passed the land onto his son John In 1834 slavery was abolished and John Rolle freed his slaves and deeded the Rolle land on to them in commonage at his death This allowed only those directly related to the Rolle slaves to farm or build on the inherited land Today most of the native inhabitants of the Exumas bear the family name Rolle The Exumas are divided into three distinct sections Great Exuma Island Little Exuma Island and the Exhuma Cays which lie north of the main islands The capital George Town on Great Exuma Island is served by regular flights from Nassau and makes the most convenient base for non sailors It has a sleepy and laid back atmosphere and offers a couple of hotels and restaurants A compact straw and vegetable market sits at the main crossroads The town lies on the coast at Elizabeth Harbour a large sheltered stretch of water that is a popular stopping off point for sailors The quiet town comes to life every April when it hosts the Family Island Regatta Thousands of Bahamian working boats fill Elizabeth Harbour their crews vying for the right to call themselves champion of the regatta From George Town you can take the short ferry trip to nearby Stocking Cay The ten minute journey across the sound courtesy of the Club Peace and Plenty hotel takes you to an island of sublime beaches underwater caves to dive in and rocky inlets to explore by snorkel You can find sand dollars and starfish and spot rays and turtles The few holiday homes do nothing to spoil the natural beauty and you ll still be able to find a deserted beach in one of the many sheltered bays Much of Great Exuma is given over to agricultural production providing the island New Providence with a lot of its fresh produce Staples like onions as well as such exotics as avocados are grown in the interior The only other major settlement besides George Town is Rolle Town once part of the Rolle estate It is said that the original inhabitants of this town were the family s domestic slaves the plantation slaves made their home at Rolleville farther north A number of tombs in Rolle Town date from the earliest days of Loyalist settlement A little bridge links Great Exuma with Little Exuma in the south Until the bridge was opened in 1966 the only way to reach the island was by ferry boat and the first small settlement on the Little Exuma side is called appropriately The Ferry Here you can meet with the Shark Lady The first woman to captain a boat in the Family Regatta Gloria Patience was given her nickname because of the many sharks she has caught She has created a small museum in her home the only one of its kind in the Exumas to document and illustrate the history and lifestyle of the island s people Traveling north from George Town you ll pass Three Sisters Rock a formation that lies just offshore from a sandy beach the three rocks are said to represent three sisters who drowned in the waters here Gradually the island narrows and past Rolleville Great Exuma gives way to the Exuma Cays a ribbon of small islands of which only four are inhabited Stanial Cay offers accommodation as well as yachting supplies It also has an airfield with regular service from Fort Lauderdale on the Florida coast These cays are home to the endangered iguana along with numerous rare plant species A 22 mile 35 km stretch north of Conch Cut has been protected for future generations by the creation of the Exuma Cays Land and Sea Park 175 sq miles 453 sq km of land and sea that includes some of the best yet most remote beaches in the Bahamas The park is only accessible by boat except for the occasional powerboats bringing passengers over from Nassau for a day of snorkeling and picnics on the beach the only sounds you ll hear will be the wind whipping through the sails of yachts anchored offshore Bimini Two tiny islands only 9 sq miles 23 sq km in total area North and South Bimini lie just 50 miles 80 km east of Miami in the midst of some of the best sport fishing waters in the world Both have had an illustrious list of admirers Ponce de Leon searched for the Fountain of Youth here Ernest Hemingway spent a lot of time fishing and writing here photographs of this prominent visitor still adorn the walls of the Compleat Angler Hotel where he wrote To Have and Have Not American politician Adam Clayton Powell who was regularly seen at the marina of Alice Town the major settlement helped raise the profile of the place in the eyes of Americans The islands flourished during the years of American Prohibition when many came here to enjoy a shot or two of hard liquor Alice Town with its bars and hotels is still the center of the action A series of fishing competitions make up a season for the rich bright and beautiful who descend to fish during the day and enjoy the lively social scene after dark Although Bimini does not have the casinos and stage shows of Nassau and Grand Bahama the Hemingway legacy seems to keep the bars along the quay in a perpetual state of jovial excess Offshore in only 15 ft 41 2 m of water lies the famed ancient roadway said to be part of the lost city of Atlantis The Berry Islands This group of islands north of Andros and New Providence only 12 sq miles 41 2 sq km in all are known as the fishbowl of the Bahamas because of the rich seas around them They are a paradise for fishermen divers and snorkelers Scattered across some of the prettiest seas in the Bahamas with shallow sand banks and a thousand translucent hues of green and blue these cays can be seen quite clearly from the air on flights from Florida They can also be explored by boat anchoring in the sheltered waters provides outstanding opportunities for swimming and snorkeling Two of the Berry Islands offer tourist facilities Chub Cay nearest to Nassau is a favored sport fishing resort anglers sail out from here to the northern tip of the Tongue of the Ocean to catch marlin Scuba divers and snorkelers enjoy the shallow reefs close to the island The shallow coral reef off Mamma Rhoda Rock a brief motorboat ride from Chub Cay marina is an outstanding experience Great Harbour Cay covered with silver top palms and sea grape is a pretty island with a number of marvelous beaches At the impressive marina yachtsmen many visiting from the Florida coast park in slips beneath their townhouses Cat Island Cat Islanders can still be said to be living a little in the past For one thing they dispute nearby San Salvador s claim to be the landing place of Columbus they still feel as archaeologists and historians used to that the explorer first made landfall on their island The Cat Islanders also retain a powerful attachment to obeah the world of spirits and natural healing The island itself also has peculiarities that separate it from other Bahamian Islands It is the most undulating of the islands one could even call it hilly with the highest point of land in the Commonwealth Mount Alvernia rising to the heady heights of 216 ft 66m above sea level Many visitors come to this island named after an English sea captain called Catt for its beautiful quiet beaches Fernandez Bay with its arc of fine sand on the protected western side of the island is said to be the finest in the Bahamas and the nearby beach at Old Bight is not far behind in terms of beauty Though you can t go wrong anywhere on the western coast Mount Alvernia in the center of the island is not far from the airfield at New Bight This settlement originally served as a hermitage for Father Jerome an Anglican missionary who had converted to Catholicism and become an influential churchman on the Out Islands responsible for the erection of a number of Catholic Churches Father Jerome built a small Hermitage on the heights of Mount Alvernia that you ll see as you reach the summit a 15 minute walk from a rudimentary car park the missionary was buried in a small hilltop cave here upon his death in 1956 at the age of 80 A more recent famous Cat Islander is the actor Sidney Poitier who was born in Arthur s Town in the north He is now non resident Bahamian Ambassador to Japan San Salvador This tiny patch of land 63 sq miles in area is at the center of a momentous turning point in history for it was here that Christopher Columbus first made landfall in the New World on 12 October 1492 One can only imagine the relief of his crew and perhaps Columbus s own sense of satisfaction that his theories had proved to be correct though not entirely since he assumed he had found the Indian subcontinent Around the shoreline of San Salvador are four separate places that are purported to be the site of Columbus s landing No one will ever know for sure of course but the competition continues After the Spaniards went on to other islands in the Caribbean the island became a base for English pirate John Watling indeed until 1926 it was known as Watling s Island The interior of San Salvador is dotted with lakes there is a great deal of marshy land and only one major road Cockburn Town pronounced KOE burn is the capital Pride of place in the town goes to the small jail found by the main coast road It s now a museum because as one resident said we don t have no need for no jail The opening hours are irregular The main road leads around the circumference of the island Heading south from Cockburn Town you ll first come to Long Bay the official site of Columbus s landing It is marked by a plain white cross that sits bright and stark against the azure blue ocean on the seaward side of the road The area has been designated as Landfall Park Another monument to the 1968 Olympics in Mexico sits a little way from the cross This depiction of the Olympic rings on a circular plinth is here because the Olympic flame was brought to San Salvador on its way to Mexico At the northeastern corner of the island is Dixon Hill Lighthouse Built in 1856 but improved in subsequent years it is called the last hand operated kerosene powered lighthouse in the Bahamas Its beam can be seen for some 20 miles 32 km San Salvador has developed a reputation as one of the best places in the Bahamas for reef wall diving The walls off the western coast are almost vertical in places and schools of hammerheads can be seen regularly in the pristine waters The island has only two hotels but a well organized dive center runs a professional program for those who want to explore the seas off the island Long Island When Columbus sighted this island he stated that it was the most beautiful that he had ever seen He named it Fernandina in honor of the King of Spain but the English called it Long Island because of its appearance 66 miles 106 km long and no more than 4 miles 61 2 km in width The Spaniards wiped out the population of Lucayan Indians who lived here and the island remained unpopulated for over 200 years until it was settled by a number of Loyalist families from the American colonies They attempted to grow cotton in the thin layer of soil but were unsuccessful and at the announcement of emancipation they abandoned the island leaving their slaves behind Today excitement centers on the resort of Stella Maris in the north which was developed in the 1960s by a group of German businessmen One of the premier diving sites in the Bahamas the resort was one of the first to develop shark feeding programs at Shark Reef famous feeding grounds of these formidable creatures The waters sweep over dozens of pretty beaches and rocky outcrops provide ideal areas for snorkeling The finest beach is at the very northern tip of the island Cape Santa Maria named by Columbus after his own ship is a vast empty expanse of yellow sand and blue sea Long Island s one main road runs like a backbone down its length This highway creates an artificial divide between the two very different coastlines In the east the Atlantic Ocean crashes against cliffs of coral In the west the gentle seas lap shallow sand banks that stretch towards the southern Exumas Traveling south from Stella Maris you ll pass uninhabited mangrove swamps on the way to the small town of Simms an unhurried old settlement known for its distinctive straw work which craftswomen are delighted to show visitors At Deadman s Cay you ll find an extensive cave system with faded Lucayan rock drawings After passing small pineapple and banana plantations you ll reach attractive Clarence Town with its two large churches one Anglican the other Roman Catholic built by Cat Island hermit architect Father Jerome The blue hole at nearby Turtle Cove a half mile walk from the road over rough terrain provides a memorable diving experience though it s interesting even from the rim The hole is about 80 yards 73 m across and at least 600 ft 183 m deep you ll sometimes see large turtles and tarpon in the waters Crooked Island and Acklins Island These two islands lie 225 miles 360 km south of Nassau and are totally off the beaten path for most tourists today though they were often visited during the age of steam ships Columbus described them as the fragrant islands after the smell of cascarilla an indigenous tree the bark is a major ingredient in perfumes medicines and in the Italian aperitif Campari The Ocean Den marine cave system in the Bight of Acklins is one of the most impressive in the Bahamas The totally unspoiled long sandy beaches provide a rich environment for birds and animal life The area to the west of the two islands is a shallow sheltered lagoon where many small cays offer protection to a rare species of iguana Crooked Island has challenging diving sites particularly along the reef wall off its northern shore line Aklins has good bonefish flats with virgin fish shoals though there are few tourist facilities and as yet no major plans to expand facilities Mayaguana Island This island 75 miles 120 km east of Acklins Island is perhaps the least visited and least developed of all the inhabited Bahamas islands It has few telephones and electric power is only a recent development The settlement of Pirates Well harks back to the days when it was a safe outpost for ruthless gangs but today s population makes a living from fishing and farming Inagua Great Inagua and Little Inagua Islands are the most southerly of the Bahamas Great Inagua lies just 50 miles 80 km from the coast of Cuba The primary sources of employment are fishing and salt collection over 1 million tons of salt are exported each year There are few tourist facilities here and both islands are natural and unspoiled hosting many rare forms of wildlife Inagua National Park on Great Inagua has the largest breeding colony of the West Indian Flamingo left in the world the population of over 60 000 is found around Lake Windsor and Lake Rosa in the interior of the island The park also supports a turtle breeding ground and provides a home to wild boar and wild donkeys Excursions Outside the Bahamas Greater Miami Miami is America s youngest big city Development began only in 1896 when the Florida East Coast railroad was extended to the region In the 1920s the region began to attract wealthy Americans from the north who came to escape the cold winters Since Castro s revolution in Cuba greater Miami has welcomed millions of Cuban and other Latin American settlers The area has strong trading links with South and Central America and the Caribbean Today cruise ships yachts fishing boats and freighters

thunderous crescendo of dazzling spray From Downtown Miami take the MacArthur Causeway east to Miami Beach and the wonderful Art Deco District of South Beach or SoBe as the locals call it Many of the hotels and public buildings were built in the boom period of the 1920s and had been left to decay as Miami spread to the west and other areas became more popular Then in the 1980s as developers began to regain interest in the area a group of architects began a campaign to save the Art Deco masterpieces and South Beach was reborn Today it is one of the most fashionable places on earth supermodels and film stars mix with ordinary folks at the bars restaurants and hip boutiques The Art Deco District has been given a thorough facelift and the colorful imposing buildings now shine just as they did
