 Rationale Protein sequence based comparative analysis to infer biological function is important and familiar to most biologists Sequence profile methods such as PSI BLAST 1 or HMMER 2 are often used to detect distant homologs and resources such as Prosite 3 BLOCKS 4 and PFAM 5 are representative resources resulting from protein classification based on sequence patterns Protein structure also plays a crucial role in a full understanding of protein function as it is more conserved than sequence and hence exposes relationships not possible from sequence alone Many protein domains have less than 10 sequence identity and yet possess a similar fold and possibly related function One of the early insights gained from comparative genomics was domain accretion 6 From prokaryotes to eukaryotes the number of domains increases But in higher eukaryotes different combinations of domains are often observed in the same and different protein families From a structural point of view domains are discreet compact folding units PIR 7 classifies proteins into either a homeomorphic superfamily proteins containing similar domains in the same order or a homology domain superfamily proteins from different homeomorphic superfamilies sharing a common ancestral domain This modular nature of proteins necessitates a new approach to proteome annotation a structural domain based approach There already exist a number of automated or semi automated complete genome annotation systems For example GeneQuiz 8 and PEDANT 9 are two pipelines that are comprehensive and highly automated Table 1 Similarly there are several sites that provide protein structure annotations for various genomes Superfamily 10 uses a set of hidden Markov model HHM profiles based on SCOP superfamily members MatDB based on PEDANT analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana provides structural annotations using SCOP domain position specific scoring matrix PSSM profiles The National Center for Biotechnology Information NCBI maintains a Conserved Domain Database CDD that uses PFAM and SMART 11 domain PSSMs to detect possible structural homologs The 3D Genomics database 12 uses SCOP domain PSSMs from 3D PSSM 13 Gene3D uses the CATH domain classification to annotate genes and genomes 14 We have developed an automated integrative genome annotation pipeline iGAP initially to annotate the proteins of A thaliana and later all proteomes based on a comprehensive fold library Figure 1 In addition to the domains from SCOP we have included domains parsed using the protein domain parser PDP 15 full length Protein Data Bank PDB chains and chains not classified by SCOP but associated with SCOP using combinatorial extension CE a structural similarity search algorithm 16 The result is a comprehensive fold library FOLDLIB from which comparative and fold recognition models of three dimensional structure are derived As a step beyond PSI BLAST or PFAM profiles we have used 123D 17 18 which not only performs target template profile profile alignment but also uses secondary structure and contact capacity potential information for protein fold recognition Further the annotation pipeline provides a graded reliability index of functional prediction reliability ranging from A to E based on extensive benchmarking of selectivity versus sensitivity N N A I N S and P E B unpublished work Here we describe iGAP and the initial results on the analysis of A thaliana the first proteome processed using a combination of web interface and SQL queries Figure 2 Comparisons are made to other annotation schemes used to process Arabidopsis and to other proteomes processed with iGAP The iGAP is systematically being applied to more than 1 000 proteomes completely or partially sequenced and publicly available at NCBI 19 to develop a comparative proteomic resource Results and discussion Automated annotation pipelines are crucial to organize the deluge of genomic information Table 1compares features of iGAP with those of GeneQuiz and PEDANT two established genome annotation methodologies GeneQuiz focuses on homolog and function assignment through sequence similarity search PEDANT is a comprehensive analysis pipeline with emphasis on gene prediction secondary and tertiary structure assignment iGAP puts much more emphasis on fold recognition threading and to be released in the near future homology modeling Table 2compares the proteins of A thaliana PAT database to established databases of protein annotations They differ in both coverage and focus Again each of the resources has clear strengths in a number of areas but PAT stands out in terms of the amount of structural information it provides Whereas other resources are limited to what is present in PDB or SCOP PAT provides additional domains from PDP and genetic domains from Astral Moreover an important feature of iGAP is the benchmarking used to establish the reliability measures Such quality assurance is critical to the future development of these resources if they are to be used in a meaningful way by experimentalists Table 3aindicates the coverage of the Arabidopsis proteome provided by each methodology and associated resource It is clear that InterPro and iGAP represent two approaches that provide very high coverage of the Arabidopsis proteome based on sequence and structural information respectively A combination of InterProScan and iGAP is under active development to integrate sequence and structure based annotation Interestingly only 14 of the Arabidopsis Information Resource TAIR GO annotation is based on nonelectronic annotation This makes an even stronger argument for the integration of sequence and structure based annotation to reduce the possibility of error propagation in electronic annotation Table 3bhighlights some specific examples of results achieved by PAT over other means Whether these results are meaningful depends on the user s perspective For one user a few additional predictions with 90 certainty could be a distraction To another they might in connection with additional experimental evidence prove valuable A future challenge to those of us providing such resources is to minimize the pain and maximize the gain for the different types of user Again quality assurance and user interface design will prove important While we have made efforts to classify the reliability of our predictions they are still predictions and should be used where possible with associated experimental proof With regard to iGAP specifically we first looked at the overall coverage of the Arabidopsis proteome using iGAP Figure 3 We were able to assign nearly 70 of the Arabidopsis proteome to folds which had a reliability index C 90 confidence or better This compares to 56 of Arabidopsis proteins in the NCBI nonredundant NR protein database having an assigned function While fold assignment does not necessarily translate into functional assignment it provides a useful indicator Second PAT provides annotations not reported by other databases Some examples are listed in Table 4 For example the AP2 domain is a DNA binding transcription factor that controls flower and seed development 20 in Arabidopsis The structure of the AP2 domain is found in the PDB 1gcc 21 Standard BLAST using the 1gcc sequence provides 140 hits at p 0 1 a very weak threshold In PAT there are 143 hits of A or B reliability 99 confidence plus 12 of reliability C 90 99 confidence Another putative protein GI number 15228210 locus id At3g47660 has a previously undetected domain at the amino terminus which resembles the structure of the pleckstrin homology PH domain from phospholipase C delta PDB 1mai C prediction PH domains are commonly found in signaling proteins 22 Additional domains found in this protein also documented by TAIR as InterPro domains include FYVE PHD zinc finger and an RCC1 like domain a regulator of chromosome condensation with A and B reliabilities respectively TAIR also reported a sugar transporter signature for this protein from Prosite While the exact function of the protein remains to be determined experimentally the new finding of a putative PH domain could offer clues to its potential mechanism for signaling and intracellular targeting Third we surveyed a set of Arabidopsis proteins that have known protein structures confidence level A Table 4a For most of these structures PAT identifies a number of additional Arabidopsis proteins predicted to contain the same domain For example the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme which is important in protein degradation identifies 6 unknown proteins out of 12 with C or above confidence which contain similar domains In contrast no additional proteins were found to have TBP like TATA binding protein like domains Recent structures not found in FOLDLIB or SCOP release 1 55 were examined to see how well they were predicted by iGAP Table 4b For PDB structures 1gp4 and 1gp6 putative leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase NCBI NR database 17 October 2001 release 123D was able to correctly predict the fold to be similar to 1hig clavaminate synthase like SCOP superfamily WU BLAST only gave a number of low probability E reliability predictions Similarly PDB entry 1e6b putative glutathione S transferase NCBI NR database 17 October 2001 is a protein with an amino terminal thioredoxin like domain and a contiguous glutathione S transferase carboxy terminal domain Both WU BLAST and 123D correctly recognized the template structure 1fw1 glutathione transferase z maleylacetoacetate isomerase Both WU BLAST and 123D predicted the whole protein to be thioredoxin like with a reliability index of A However WU BLAST made two additional predictions both correct The pseudo SCOP entry by PAT is a novel domain parsed by PDP which at the time was not in SCOP release 1 55 It is classified as a separate domain in SCOP 1 59 This was recognized by WU BLAST Additionally WU BLAST also recognized the amino terminal thioredoxin like domain with correct boundaries Finally the SCOP classification of protein structures by fold Figure 4a and by family Figure 4b provides a convenient way to catalog the relative occurrences of structures in A thaliana With respect to folds the membrane all alpha fold alpha alpha superhelix and protein kinase like PK like fold ranked highest The TIM barrel and Rossman folds and seven bladed beta propeller folds are also among the top folds PK like proteins have the second highest occurrence at the superfamily level data not shown Not surprisingly serine threonine kinases and tyrosine kinases are among the most abundant families Conclusions The PAT database was initially developed as a joint development of academia and industry to serve the Arabidopsis and plant proteomics community through the provision of structure and functional assignment to all identified proteins in the Arabidopsis genome The underlying technology specifically iGAP and the associated reliability criteria is well suited for application to other proteomes and this processing is ongoing to provide a comparative proteomics resource With more of a focus on comparative proteomics the resource is being expanded in an effort we refer to as the Encyclopedia of Life EOL Details on EOL can be found at 23 Materials and methods Software and availability FOLDLIB SCOP domain sequences filtered at 90 identity 26 are downloaded from the Astral database 27 PDB chains are clustered at 90 identity and parsed with PDP 15 to provide additional domains including those not yet assigned by SCOP SCOP lags behind the PDB in terms of structures processed The sequences from SCOP PDB and PDP are then clustered at 90 identity to define the final structure template library Profile libraries for these templates are generated for use by 123D using PSI BLAST with a default E value of 1e 6 and three iterations The pipeline The first step of the pipeline uses a set of filter programs to determine the low complexity regions as well as transmembrane regions signal peptide sequences and coiled coils in a particular proteome The programs used include SEG 28 for low complexity region COILS 29 for coiled coils TMHMM 30 for transmembrane region PSORT 31 for subcellular location and signalP 32 for signal peptides The second step determines sequence similarity hits by pairwise sequence comparison using WU BLAST W Gish personal communication WU BLAST is used because it is fast and performed best in our benchmark studies The default E value used is 1e 5 The third step generates PSI BLAST profiles for each input protein sequence against the FOLDLIB sequences The default H value used is 1e 6 and three iterations for profile generation In the fourth step the program 123D is used to provide additional mapping to FOLDLIB using fold recognition 17 123D has been used successfully in CASP 33 competitions Reliability index The reliability of a prediction is calculated on the basis of a novel benchmarking procedure against SCOP and will be described elsewhere The index is expressed as percent certainty that a particular prediction is correct A 99 9 certainty B 99 certainty C 90 certainty D 50 certainty and E 10 certainty Database and user interface SCOP browser The use of SCOP classifications provides a hierarchical view of the data from a structure
