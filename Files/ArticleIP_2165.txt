 SLATE Update SLATE will not publish next week In the great tradition of political and cultural journalism the editors will spend the week lying on the beach perhaps reading the odd scrap of old fashioned print on paper and resting up for the election campaign and other ordeals ahead SLATE is proud to be launching this hoary custom of summer editorial sloth into cyberspace However our computers will be on the job They neglected to ask for the week off in their union contract And they will happily serve up the current issue plus a complete inventory of past articles and features in The Compost while we re gone New material will be posted beginning noon PDT Monday Aug 12 with a complete new issue by Friday Aug 16 SLATE s been online for over a month now and in general we re pleased with the reaction Claims about readership tend to be even more dubious in the online world than they are in the world of traditional paper magazines Counting Internet readers is an inexact science lending itself to exaggeration But here s our count as honest as we can make it Excluding our launch week when the numbers were much higher we ve been serving up about 100 000 pages a day That would be 10 000 readers a day or 70 000 a week reading an average of 10 pages each online Of course it could also be 100 000 people a day looking at one page each and turning away in disgust or it could be 50 of my aunts uncles and cousins busily inflating the numbers by clicking up 2 000 pages a day These figures don t include people who are printing out SLATE directly from the cover page or getting it by e mail From anecdotal evidence SLATE s special print out edition seems to be a popular option but we have no numbers on it Many people tell me they re downloading the print out file and reading it on screen but offline We never even thought of that Soon though we ll be offering an offline reading edition that retains some of the Web s interactivity and graphics that aren t in the print out file We ve recently reformatted the print out edition to make it more attractive and reduce the number of pages just 27 for the whole Thursday Aug 1 issue We ve also added an Adobe Acrobat version along with the Microsoft Word model Try it out if you haven t already Another surprise Monday is the most popular day for reading SLATE Readership declines through the week and is lowest on the weekends We have designed the magazine to be most current and timely Friday when we update The Week The Spin for example with the thought that people would like to read it over the weekend But maybe that s wrong In any event Monday is the day we update the Horse Race campaign pundits analysis and give you instant reviews of the Other Magazines that come out Monday morning Time Newsweek The New Yorker etc So Monday s not a bad day either Many people we hear from actually do seem to enjoy popping in every couple of days to see what s new which is a more gratifying surprise Another measure of readership though not necessarily of satisfied readership is response We ve been getting between 700 and 800 e mail comments from readers every week Our Everyday Economics columnist Steven Landsburg tells us he got 300 personal e mail messages about his first column When I called our Varnish Remover columnist Robert Shrum to tell him that some readers were complaining about having a self described Democrat analyzing both parties political commercials though I think he s doing a fine neutral job he said the only complaint he s gotten himself was from the White House In a couple of weeks we ll be launching our bulletin board The Fray where readers from the White House or any other house can bitch and moan to their hearts content though a kind word or two would also be appreciated But it s already clear that we have just the kind of active engaged readership we were hoping for We ll know more about who our readers are when free registration begins in two or three weeks We re planning to tell advertisers that you re all highly educated high income politically engaged and purchasers of vast quantities of automobiles designer clothing books records military aircraft and alcoholic beverages Please don t let us down This first month has been a learning process Warren Buffett America s second richest man after somebody whose name I ve forgotten has written that he s suspicious of anyone who talks of learning from his own mistakes The trick Buffett says is to learn from other people s mistakes Still if you re going to make mistakes you might as well learn from them SLATE s made a few Initially we were incompatible with too many browsers including early versions of Netscape We think we ve solved that And if we haven t please let us know at slatetech msn com We re still a bit slow to download compared with some other sites about 20 percent according to our resident tech gurus but we re working on that too Our original idea of a separate cover and contents page united by theme music has not in our view been a success and we ll be reworking that in the weeks ahead Meanwhile many folks seem to be missing the contents page completely thus missing many articles and features You can skip the cover and go directly to the contents page if you want at http www slate com TOC Current Contents asp or of course you can spare yourself the gibberish and bookmark it Amajor screw up to be honest has been our e mail delivery In theory it should be great a file delivered straight to your computer that you can print out or read on screen as the latest SLATE At last count more than 16 000 people had signed up We knew there d be some problems with many e mail systems in receiving this rather large file What we weren t prepared for was problems in sending it We apologize and hope that s starting to work right for you Last Friday s delivery went pretty well SLATE on Paper our monthly printed edition to be available by U S Mail and at Starbucks also has been pushed back a month But the first issue will be out by the end of August Call 800 555 4995 to subscribe Our cover feature a couple weeks ago Electric Chairs about designing a chair for reading an online magazine was one I was uncertain about It surprised me pleasantly by generating a large and entertaining response See a sample in last week s E Mail to the Editors For the next week though the staff of SLATE will be emphasizing comfort above all in our choices of where to sit And should these be places from where we can t read a computer screen that s OK too See you Aug 12 or soon thereafter we hope Previous Readme columns
