        what do you think on uh on a scale of one to ten where would you rate yourself on on gun control     uh one being maximum control or minimal control   most and ten being no restrictions at all   that well i guess  probably somewhere in the middle ive uh mixed feelings about it   umhum yeah i think id be be somewhere around a four or five myself and yeah it  it seems to me like theres theres   uh yeah   its not its not fair to just kind of do everything all the same with all guns because theyre not all the same you know   right   like hand guns and guns uh assault rifles i think are a little bit different than rifles and shotguns   yeah yeah   so   well um i ours my families from uh south Georgia and you know they hunt quite a bit so i i really dont you know guns just something that you have  down there and uh uh so i i tend to agree on that you know but uh assault rifles you know thats thats  made to       made to kill somebody you know   and you dont need three hundred rounds a minute to to get hold of a deer and   uh yeah so yeah i feel   and if you did it really wouldnt be worth eating so  you know   yeah right or cleaning   yeah   but uh i ive heard some uh talk about you know having like a three day waiting period or something uh if you to try to buy a firearm or something   umhum   and i dont i dont have a problem with that you know i think if youve got a if youve got a  history of uh of violent crimes or something then you certainly dont need a   yeah yeah that makes sense that that makes a lot of sense i dont see uh   hand gun   i mean its not like youre gonna go hey ill go hunting today   uh yeah   and and usually if youre gonna go hunting its pretty early in the morning anyway and the store is not gonna be open so   right   a three day waiting period makes perfect sense to me  i guess the only real questions then is um is gun control does it does it work i mean can you enforce it   yeah well  uh i think it it i mean if you can if youre gonna commit some violent crime and you go and you can get a gun at your leisure then uh to to restrict it would certainly cut down on on that but you know that people you can get a gun fairly easily i would think i mean i i feel like i could get a gun in an hour if i had to you know so uh obviously its not gonna   umhum   uh get rid of all all of your um illegal weapons out there or or dangerous you know get dangerous weapons out of peoples hands but  uh i think itd help some   yeah they dont i guess i mean the only thing that i worry i question is i mean i think if if it was really easy to enforce that it it would be great the only thing that uh that would worry me about it is that the only real way that i know to enforce it is if someone commits a crime while having a weapon thats not registered you can tag on a couple of extra years   yeah   but as it is now you put someone in prison and theyre out in you know one fifth the time they were sentenced to anyway   yeah no time right   so i mean theyre not theyre not even staying in prison without the extra years on there much less i dont think theyd be staying any longer with extra years tagged on there   yeah yeah yeah i dont i dont really think uh i mean i think gun control uh to some extent can could help crime situations but  uh i think i personally my personal belief is you know as you commit a crime you know you should be punished and and  and if you know you are not going to get punished or very little punishment then theres no reason not to   umhum i think you mightve had the i i guess i mean im thats got to be part of gun control but i like the idea of the uh the waiting period because i dont think that i mean i really think that if someone wants to get a gun to commit a crime theyre gonna get a gun but uh   yeah   if someone is just like all hot and bothered and and ready to go out and and and get someone just because theyre all charged up emotionally   right yeah   that a three day waiting period youre not gonna stay that angry for that long   yeah usually not   least im not   yeah i i i agree at least you have a little bit of time to think about it   yeah   and uh i think i dont know that accounts for at least some of the shootings that go on so in the heat of the moment just go out and buy a gun right then and   yeah
