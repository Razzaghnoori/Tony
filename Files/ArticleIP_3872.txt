Professor Krugman s interpretation of French elite thinking but I would quibble with one point Krugman mentions in passing that a unified European market and a common currency will do almost nothing to create jobs In fact one way or the other EMU matters a lot for jobs If policy makers stick to EMU s monetary and fiscal rules the policy stance will be on the tight side i e cyclical unemployment will go up or at least will not fall If in addition policy makers reduce rigidities particularly in the labor market the initial consequence will be a rise in unemployment followed by an improvement with a delay of a couple of years see New Zealand the U K and the Netherlands for example Should policy makers ignore EMU rules and take it easy once EMU has started cyclical unemployment may fall initially but at some stage higher inflation and a depreciating euro would force a course correction and unemployment would rise again Gunther Thumann London Paul Krugman replies A common currency per se has got nothing much to do with employment the rules of Maastricht which bear a dubious relationship to the actual requirements of such a currency are another matter Oxford Banal ytica Although Why Do the G 7 Bother by the anonymous folks at Oxford Analytica was just chock full of silly blather about globalization I was particularly struck by the vacuousness of this sentence The liberalization of trade also effectively prevents governments from erecting protective barriers to boost the domestic economy The liberalization of trade by definition is precisely the lack of protective barriers like tariffs and import quotas Although I m sure it s true that a lack of protective barriers leads inexorably to a lack of protective barriers this is hardly a profound insight At least I can be thankful that I m reading this for free in Slate rather than paying big bucks for the wisdom of these international consultants Scott Susin Berkeley Calif The Schneider Retort Please tell Jeffrey Goldberg News You Can t Use to log off He s obviously spending too much time online That s the only explanation I have for his weak attempt at reviewing satirizing the cable news wars Did this guy ever watch more than a minute or two of the programs he panned If he had he certainly would have noticed that the program I anchor and edit on Fox News Channel The Schneider Report is a serious news program We feature extensive coverage of the major issues each and every day and devote more time to international news than any of our evening competitors You can look it up Or better yet Mr Goldberg you could watch By the way if not showing up in gossip columns or fashion magazines makes me or my colleagues distinctly unfamous I ll wear that title proudly I m just a guy with 23 years of TV news experience 10 of them anchoring network programs like Weekend Today on NBC and Good Morning America news Who the hell is Jeffrey Goldberg anyway Mike SchneiderThe Schneider Report Fox News ChannelNew York City Prose and Cons In The Conintern Jacob Weisberg implies there is a rigid conservative orthodoxy that squelches dissent in movement publications under punishment of expulsion He must be reading different publications and attending different movement gatherings than I My colleagues and I at the Competitive Enterprise Institute have criticized Newt Gingrich in the pages of the Washington Times the Wall Street Journal and Human Events for years Yet we are still invited to Grover Norquist s Wednesday meetings and his frequent parties National Review has been scathing in its attacks on the GOP leadership yet it has yet to be ostracized The Wall Street Journal editorial page complains about William Jefferson Kasich and the budget deal yet no one is seeking to write Bob Bartley out of the movement And the idea that Bob Novak is an enforcer of the party line the same Bob Novak who splits with the conservative mainstream on Israel campaign finance reform and Jude Wanniski is absurd Novak is a fine investigative journalist but he is no secretary for Weisberg s imagined conservative politburo Jonathan H Adler Competitive Enterprise InstituteWashington Lima Zines It s amusing to see what L A or D C considers front page news but it would be truly eye opening to learn what Paris or Lima s or Jakarta s concerns are I hope you will consider widening the scope of Today s Papers Nancy Brooke Mandel New York City Schlock to the System Thanks to David Plotz for his humorous balanced and concise Assessment of Marilyn Manson and the forces working against him I take issue with one point in the article the issue of antecedents Plotz rightly lists Alice Cooper as a primary enabler of what Manson is doing now An even better case can be made however for the importance of G G Allin and the Murder Junkies as an influence antecedent G G Allin created the same kind of talentless disgusting yet strangely compelling schlock that Manson puts out and combined it with a stage show that would make Alice Cooper squeamish The difference here is image management Allin had huge contempt for fame He avoided the conventional spotlight all he could He died of a heroin overdose in relative obscurity Until recently Marilyn Manson had worked in obscurity as well with just a slightly larger cult following than G G Allin It was only when Manson acquiesced to the hype machine created by his record label that he started getting rich and the fundamentalists started getting angry Rich Armstrong Denver Rate Crimes In your June 25 Chatterbox you attack Newt Gingrich for telling a national radio audience that lower taxes mean less time at work and more free time when supply siders have for years been saying that cutting taxes would spur more not less work effort thereby speeding economic growth In criticizing Gingrich you state E conomic theory tells us lower taxes do have contradictory effects they prompt us to work harder because we net more from each hour of labor and to goof off because higher total take home pay means we can satisfy our needs more easily In fact economic theory says no such thing You have confused lower taxes with lower tax rates Lower tax rates have conflicting effects on the work effort of individuals for the reasons you stated Some tax cuts however do not raise the reward for work and therefore do not increase work effort The best example of this is the 500 per child tax credit the centerpiece of the Republican tax package Clearly this tax cut does not net more from each hour of labor Rather it is like winning the lottery it makes individuals with children better off or wealthier and therefore reduces the need to work In this regard Gingrich is correct Economic theory predicts that the centerpiece of the Republican tax cut will mean less time at work which in turn means a further reduction in tax revenues This may be good family politics but I believe it is bad economic policy Rich Hart Cincinnati Throw the Book at Him With regard to My Personal Trade Deficit I commend Steven Landsburg s use of personal experience with a Barnes Noble bookstore in the next town to effectively explain the mechanics of trade In the second part of his article however he passes judgment a more ambitious undertaking Further browsing perhaps in a different section of the bookstore may be in order His conclusions F oolishly excessive trade surpluses are a greater danger than foolishly excessive trade deficits That s because excessive trade deficits are self limiting If you run a trade deficit every year bankruptcy will eventually force you to stop But excessive trade surpluses can go on forever A perpetual trade surplus is likely to mean you re either working too hard or consuming too little either way you re not getting enough enjoyment out of life Really Bankruptcy is not harmless the debt is transferred to others customers suppliers taxpayers the rest of society and the damage can and often does multiply beyond the original foolishness The crash of 1929 and the depression that followed is only one dramatic example of such a domino effect The real kicker is the last line Enjoyment of life is reduced when one produces more than one consumes If Landsburg really has wandered over from the economics section to the philosophy section of his bookstore and thought about this I d like to hear his reasons Chris Noble Winchester Mass Address your e mail to the editors to letters slate com Please include your address and daytime phone number for confirmation only
