 It s Smart To Be Dumb Massa honey You know of course that the free floating envy we regular folk have for you political reporters is all about the post event kickback session in the hotel bar We imagine that the lubricated and informed nature of your skewering is just better than ours What political junkie wouldn t give anything to hear U S News and World Report say tell the Baltimore Sun that for a guy who s been marinated in money Dubya seems particularly beset by plural articles and singular verbs I really am waiting maybe the next debate for someone to ask him what caused World War II and for him to tell us it was Lust Avarice Sloth Happy and Doc Dean Acheson book or no Dean Acheson book the guy clearly doesn t know from history To show solidarity with you I watched the whole encounter larded up as it was with odd rules Even if they all meant what they said or even wrote it a president simply cannot do everything he wants and can t do anything by himself so who really cares what gets said there It s all just blah blah blah The only useful byproduct perhaps is that we get to see who s uncomfortable with concepts or who oughta be given a pulpit After a while I couldn t even make myself listen Do you think I have A D D McCain was the only one who came across as smart informed and seemingly unscripted though even he in the wrap up seemed a little bit on autopilot Maybe all candidates both parties could just stipulate that they plan to be good fair more better The impressions I came away with were that Keyes works the plantation metaphors for reasons unclear to me I already know he s black Bauer looks like a toy a doll whose name I cannot for the life of me remember And Bush well he just seems like some lucky sum bitch who was whisked out onto center stage no rehearsal necessary This is assuming of course one imagines it lucky to wind up in the presidential race Not to be fixated or anything but Bush finessed the Dean Acheson book challenge The problem is that I haven t read that book so I don t know if they caught him out or not And I want to know Do you know Maybe they could put a truth squad up there when these guys go at it Since I was invited into no bar after the debate I read the New Republic which strangely gave me an overview of some of what I had just seen In this election year it s smart to be dumb Anti intellectualism plays well and equates with character Oh brother Anyway come on out of that desert And don t forget orrinhatch com xxM
