 okay uh the topic is to discuss the uh sources where i receive news uh huh and uh for me that s uh mostly newspaper and radio i almost never watch television as a matter of course so i don t get news from television except during the war i watched a lot of CNN because it was so good uh huh well why was CNN the only of course i think Saddam Hussein only allowed CNN to broadcast it is that not true um it was unusual not to have the different sources you know of news coverage yeah um i don t know i guess uh i don t even know why i watch CNN i guess i just wanted more news it s one of the few times i wanted yeah well i know even if you watched ABC NBC or or the other you i mean what s the other one uh CBS they all were were tapped into CNN more news than CBS were they uh huh that s the only thing they broadcast and like you i listen to the radio on my job at work and all this week they ve been having this uh yeah uh huh a discussion about that is why uh why CNN was well i listen to a Christian radio station and they were saying that CNN is definitely a world uh news service and uh um hum that was you can t really be sure of the quality of what you got you know hm uh we had some uh some people from our church went to Israel uh just for a uh tour sort of thing um hum and i was watching on TV they they broadcast this terrible riot supposedly that was going on in Jerusalem so we got all fearful for our people come to find out they came back and said they weren t even aware of it right and so it really made me question as to what how do we know about you know uh if the news we re getting is any good so yeah i guess the news just focuses on major events that probably yeah don t affect ninety nine percent of the people who are right there when the news is being made right right but uh i can i m from California and i can remember being in uh in these earthquakes and i mean they were they were very minor kinds of things from my point of view and it seemed yeah you know from anyone else s point of view but they d get all blown up in the news uh huh uh well i it i find it depressing to watch or especially TV you know it s uh local news concentrates on murders and things like that i m from Dallas um hum and uh we have a lot of bad stuff it just really gets me depressed even to watch it um hum yeah so then you wake up one morning and you re in war with somebody you don t even know about it right so oh what newspaper uh do you read in Dallas uh we have the Dallas Times Herald and the Dallas Morning News but i don t i don t read newspapers don t you how come huh uh i have find it hard to uh follow from one page to another it s just something i ve never developed uh an interest in huh and i live in kind of a bad area where if i have the paper delivered it s stolen before i can get out and get it God that s uh that sounds pretty bad to me i mean who would steal a newspaper you d be surprised hm they just come by and pick them up even if it s just for the TV you know uh selections of the day i don t know it just wouldn t be there whenever i ve tried it i see yeah so you re right who would steal a newspaper but they do yeah what part of California are you from uh from Los Angeles but i live in Raleigh North Carolina right now that s where i m speaking to you from oh okay but i grew up in LA i work out here huh you work for TI no i don t i work for North Carolina State University huh but uh i know some people at TI and i have a couple of students who have graduated and gone to work for them so i m in the computer business yeah well i boy current events is not a good subject for me well i don t keep up with it that often let s see i ve i ve i ve never done this before i mean i ve never this is your first call this is my first call because i just got my password uh huh oh really so i don t know are we suppose to it seems to me it says you re supposed to talk for three minutes but i think we ve been talking for three minutes and nobody has interrupted yeah well i d i got into a conversation last night with a lady and they interrupt at ten minutes i see so if we ve done our three minutes let s just let the conversation end and say bye nice talking to you too bye bye uh huh well all right nice talking to you all right bye
