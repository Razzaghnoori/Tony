 What to Do Entertainment Although cultural activity has been under state control since the revolution and Havana no longer sizzles with the sleazy Mafia funded casinos and clubs of the 1950s both high culture and more down to earth nightlife thrive in Cuba Outside the resorts it can be hard to pin down what s going on where but informal musical performances are ubiquitous In the resorts nightlife is focused around hotels ranging from decent live bands dance and fashion shows to mimed Beatles sing a longs Live Music Performances Cubans crave live music and with the surge in international popularity of traditional Cuban music so do most visitors to Cuba You certainly won t have to go out of your way to hear music performances Roving groups of musicians can be found playing everywhere from airports to restaurants Merely wandering the streets of Havana Santiago or Trinidad you re likely to stumble across a party with a live band or even a back alley where some impromptu jamming is going on On Saturday nights in Camag ey the music spreads to the streets in a Noche Camag eya block party along Calle Rep blica All the styles of Cuba s delectable traditional music habaneras son boleros guarachas guajiras and more can be heard in every town s casa de la trova usually a fine old building on or near the main square Performances are amateur and professional take place afternoons and evenings and are free or have a minimal cover charge US 1 2 Especially in the evenings and on weekends when you ll encounter a vibrant mix of Cubans and foreigners the island s casas de la trova really swing The most famous is in Santiago de Cuba which has sprung many a star while those in towns like Trinidad Baracoa and Camag ey are especially charming Aside from traditional acoustic music Cuba revels in salsa and jazz Probably the best place for live jazz and salsa in the country is the rollicking Palacio de la Salsa in Havana s slightly dated Hotel Riviera Paseo y Malec n in Vedado Tel 33 4501 There from midnight on Cuba s very best salsa bands perform dancing is very much in order and jazz artists entertain drinkers in the adjacent bar from Thursday to Sunday from 9pm Other music hotspots include Havana Casa de la M sica salsa Avenida 35 and Calle 20 Miramar Casa de la Trova San L zaro between Gervasio and Belasco n Central Havana and El Zorro y el Cuevo jazz Calles 23 y O Vedado Trinidad Casa de la Trova Hern ndez Echerr 29 Casa de la M sica Calle M rquez La Canch nchara Calle Villena 70 and Casa Fisher Calle Lino P rez Santiago de Cuba Casa de la Trova Calle Heredia Casa de las Tradiciones Calle General Lacret Baracoa Casa de la Trova Jos Mart 149 and Casa de la Cultura Maceo 122 Cabaret A legacy of the high rolling casino days in Cuba cabarets have been kept alive and well as an outlet for tourist dollars Cavorting mulatta dancers in sparkling G strings and pairs of strategically placed stars may not be most peoples image of socialist doctrine but this is Caribbean communism While the best shows at the Tropicana clubs in both Havana and Santiago de Cuba are rather expensive by Cuban standards seeing at least one big song and dance production in the flesh so to speak is de riguer The Tropicana in Havana Calles 72 and 43 Marianao Tel 33 7507 founded in 1939 in a dazzling open air arena is indisputably the queen of cabarets The likes of Nat King Cole performed here in pre revolutionary times With a 32 piece orchestra and a cast of over 200 some parading in impossibly large headdresses the sheer scale of the spectacle will make your head spin The show regularly kicks off at 9 30pm and a shorter performance follows later there are also a restaurant and disco Reservations and transportation can be arranged at your hotel for US 60 You can always visit independently but the venue situated in the suburb of Marianao is tricky to find and you might arrive only to find no tickets remaining Havana s next best cabaret show smaller and less expensive is Cabaret Parisien at the Hotel Nacional Calles 21 and O Vedado Tel 30 3564 nightly at 10 30pm admission is US 35 The Tropicana in Santiago de Cuba Autopista Nacional km 1 5 with signs from Plaza de la Revoluci n Tel 4 3036 fills an enormous recently constructed complex on the city s northern outskirts It is no less impressive than Havana s but a bit less gaudy Admission is US 30 including a drink 27 if purchased from a travel agency In Varadero the Cabaret Continental at the Hotel Internacional shows nightly from 8 30pm to 3am pales in comparison with the former venues but is nonetheless an enjoyable and sometimes fairly raunchy song and dance extravaganza A fun show kind of Afro Cuban with a pirate theme followed by disco takes place in a cave at the Cueva del Pirata some 9 km 6 miles east of Varadero Autopista Sur km 11 nightly at 10 30pm until the wee hours There is also a cabaret at the Meli Varadero hotel Discos Discos pulsate to both Latin and Euro American rhythms The places to be are Habana Caf the disco in Havana s Hotel Meli Cohiba and the disco in Santiago s eponymous hotel These are glitzy affairs where foreigners get soaked and approached by hustlers of all stripes Also try El Gale n in a make believe pirate ship that sets sail from under Havana s La Caba a fortress The best in Varadero is La Bamba at the Hotel Tuxpan entrance US 10 15 Also try the open air Discoteca La Patana near the bridge into Varadero In Trinidad Motel Las Cuevas has a disco with live entertainment but it pales in comparison to the music halls in town In Guardalavaca head for open air La Roca set just above the beach Bars and Caf s Both bars and caf s are places to have a mojito daiquiri or shot of ron rum smoke a Cohiba and usually hear some live Cuban rhythms In Havana the bars not to miss are Hemingway haunts La Bodeguita del Medio and El Floridita Enjoyable caf bars in Havana include Caf de Paris Obispo and San Ignacio Caf O Reilly O Reilly and San Ignacio Montserrate Avenida de B lgica and Obrap a and El Patio Plaza de la Catedral Several hotels also have good bars including Hotel Sevilla made famous in Graham Greene s Our Man in Havana Hotel Inglaterra s rooftop bar and Hotel Havana Libre s Turquino with amazing views from the 25th floor In Varadero Bar Calle 13 on Avenida Primera is the place to meet the jinetera of your dreams In Santiago de Cuba the terrace bar on the 7th floor of the Hotel Casa Granda has splendid views and live music A good place for a cold beer paid in pesos is Taberna Dolores which usually has live music in its courtyard At the corner of Calle Calvario is Caf Isabelica a venerable 24 hour bohemian haunt in a house three centuries old It s the kind of place where tourists and Cubans seem to hook up in a matter of seconds Baracoa s Hotel Castillo has a bar with sensational views and frequent live music The Classical Repertoire The classical arts are greatly valued in Cuba and drama opera classical recitals and above all ballet can be enjoyed in theaters all around Cuba Opulent old fashioned theaters such as those in Cienfuegos Camag ey and Matanzas not to mention Havana s magnificent Gran Teatro are sights in their own right The best way to learn what s on is to visit the theater performances are frequently limited to weekends The Gran Teatro in Havana at Calles Prado and San Rafael Tel 61 2360 has two main concert halls and puts on a wide repertoire of entertainment from opera recitals to ballet It is home to the internationally renowned Ballet Nacional de Cuba if you hear that the company or the rather more innovative Ballet de Camag ey is performing be sure to snap up tickets Havana s International Ballet Festival is held during the last week of October and first week of November In Santiago de Cuba try to see the Ballet Folkl rico Cutumba a renowned troupe that delves into the world of Afro Cuban spirituality and ritual When in town they perform at several theaters Shopping Cuba has a reputation as a place where there s little worth buying You will see incredibly barren peso shops window displays with bottles of cooking oil shoe polish and a few plumbing parts But there are plenty of things for dollar wielding visitors to buy now that private enterprise is permitted on a limited scale Tops on most people s lists are Cuba s greatest achievements not including the national health care system cigars rum and music There is also an excellent selection of handicrafts available at excellent prices in towns and resorts frequented by tourists Tourist markets are now thriving in Cuba s major centers even if much of what you ll find is related to Che Guevara berets T shirts bearing his countenance and dolls among many other revolutionary items As for essentials hotel and dollar shops carry mineral water soap shampoo and toothpaste but many medicinal or cosmetic staples are hard to come by it s still best to bring all you need from home Tiendas Panamericanas are well stocked dollar stores but probably the most impressive dollar store in all Cuba is the Harris Bros Company a multistory it s got an escalator enterprise near the landmark Art Deco Bacard building and the capitol Cuban cities are now an uneasy mix of sad peso stores and bright dollar shops with an influx of goods most Cubans can only dream about indeed you ll see large crowds of people peering dreamily into shop windows The uneven divide between communist ideals and materialist longings is one of the great contradictions in contemporary Cuba Browsing along shopping streets proves endlessly fascinating though and provides profound insights into Cuba s arcane economy Souvenirs to Buy Cigars and rum The biggest bargain in Cuba is probably a coveted box of premium cigars which at home might cost four times more Cigar factories open to tourists have affiliated shops selling all brands of cigars the Partag s factory in Havana has a particularly good shop You can also purchase cigars at such Havana shops as Casa del Tabaco Calle Obispo and Bernaza and La Casa del Habano Calle Mercaderes 120 at hotels and at the airport You ll find Habanos shops in several other towns and resorts Trinidad s is on Lino P rez 296 Bottles of rum also offer big savings All tourist oriented and hotel shops sell rum whether aged from three to six years a ejo or low grade aguardiente from sugarcane alcohol with humorous labels Havana Club is the brand of choice Above El Floridita Havana s Casa del Ron has the island s most impressive selection of rums including hundred dollar vintages half a dozen national brands and rum flavored with grenadine peppermint or banana The dutyfree shop at the airport also has an extensive selection When buying cigars or rum bear in mind the customs limits in your home country see page 108 Music recordings Compact discs and cassettes of Cuban music are widely available and the selection is now much improved If you re in the market for Cuban recordings look for CDs on the EGREM label available in ARTEX stores as well as others across Cuba Most are US 15 each Recommended recordings include those by Trio Matamoros Benny Mor La Vieja Trova Santiaguero Los Zafiros El Cuarteto Patria Los Van Van and Pablo Milan s just to name a very few of Cuba s excellent roster of popular musicians who will help you keep the fire burning back home Musical instruments such as maracas clav s and bongos also make good presents Handicrafts Local arts and crafts vary from tacky figurines to pleasant drawings of street scenes and postmodernist portraits You ll also find evocative posters and black and white photos of Fidel Che and company Fine handmade lace and crochet are available principally in Trinidad Those nostalgic for the old days might want to pick up a guayabera the classic Cuban pleated four pocket shirt worn untucked occasionally you can even stumble across vintage linen versions Boutique Quitr n Obispo es San Ignacio in Old Havana has the nicest cotton versions of the original white guayabera Much of the silver plated jewelry is also a good buy but you should refrain from acquiring anything with black coral it s endangered and illegal to import in many countries There are more interesting things to buy in Old Havana than in the rest of Cuba put together A lively open air crafts market with provocative art Afro Cuban and santer a dolls exotic woodcarvings and hats made from stripped palm leaves is staged daily east of the cathedral plaza between Tac n and the canal Plaza de Armas is busy with second hand book vendors Intriguing hole in the wall arts and crafts shops are concentrated along Calle Obispo The excellent Palacio de la Artesan a at Calle Cuba 64 Pe a Pobre y Cuarteles in a 19th century mansion is a souvenir supermarket in a fine old mansion Outside Havana Trinidad has the best array of crafts shops in the country Several streets just south of the Plaza Mayor around the casa de la trova known as La Candonga stage a vibrant daily crafts market and you ll find a good government run crafts shops on Calle Sim n Bol var Santiago de Cuba s crafts mecca is among the shops and vendors along Calle Heredia The selection though is generally poorer than in Havana Sports Watersports Watersports enthusiasts are in luck in Cuba Virtually every resort offers windsurfing sailing jet skis and waterskiing As anywhere in the world motorized sports are expensive Watersports centers are almost always affiliated with a particular hotel but anyone may rent the equipment Diving is the area of greatest interest and growth Cuba claims to be surrounded by one of the world s largest coral reefs and more than 1 000 sunken wrecks There are so many tropical fish angel fish grouper parrot fish moray eels and sponges that it can feel like swimming in an aquarium Facilities are generally excellent and prices are the lowest in the Caribbean Nearly every resort has at least one professional diving center equipped with all the requisite equipment from oxygen tanks to wetsuits Most centers offer week long diving courses for an internationally recognized qualification such as CMAS or PADI as well as two day introductory courses Dozens of dive sites can be reached from resorts typically a half hour boat journey away The diving center at El Colony Hotel on the Isla de la Juventud offers the best facilities and diving but it isn t well suited to beginners There are 54 designated sites including caves wrecks and what is claimed to be the tallest coral column in the world Resorts catering to all levels of ability include Playa Santa Luc a Mar a la Gorda Cayo Largo Varadero Playa Gir n with good diving directly off the shore Playa Anc n Cayo Coco and Guardalavaca Deep sea fishing is one of Cuba s great attractions though as of yet not well known or over fished Trips leave from the island s resorts and Havana s Hemingway Marina in search of marlin wahoo and swordfish Playas del Este Varadero and Cayo Largo are other places that offer excellent fishing expeditions In addition there are offshore expeditions for smaller fry such as tarpon sea bass and mackerel For freshwater fishing Hanabanilla and Zaza near Sancti Sp ritus lakes both hold impressively big copious large mouth bass For information on fishing excursions contact Puertosol Calle Cobre 3404 Villa Marina Havana Tel 33 3510 Spectator Sports The national sport is baseball b isbol Cuban teams are among the best in the world and several stars have defected to the US major leagues While children improvise with a stick and a makeshift ball in every town s open spaces the main cities have vast stadiums It can be difficult to find out exactly when a game is taking place you should simply ask around Activities for Children At resorts water loving babies will be happy those ages ten and up will be able to join in many of the activities A few resort hotels such as those at Cayo Coco have children s clubs and top hotels can arrange babysitting Outside the resorts the facilities are limited transportation can be problematic and feeding fussy children might present difficulties But Cubans adore children and will certainly make a fuss over yours Traveling with young families in Cuba can be a remarkable and eye opening experience If you travel with very young children be sure to take all the diapers and baby food you require as these items are hard to find in Cuba If traveling by rental car you should also supply your own car seat
