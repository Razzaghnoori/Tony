                            In a compelling essay in this issue of         PLoS Medicine  Mike Clarke the director of the United Kingdom Cochrane        Centre lays down a challenge to clinical researchers and journal editors  He argues        that researchers should do a study only if there is a systematic review that shows that the        new study is needed If no review exists the researchers should do one themselves before        embarking on their research And journals he argues should publish a study only if an        updated systematic review is incorporated into the study or published alongside it or        shortly thereafter How should editors respond to his challenge        First we would argue that by the time a paper is sent to a journal it is surely too        late in the process to be insisting on systematic reviews If a clinical trial report meets        our criteria for originality importance and quality it makes little sense for us to        reject it just because the authors failed to systematically review the literature when        designing their study The time to mandate that researchers do a review is much        earlierwhen they apply for funding register their trial or seek ethics committee        approval        There is no doubt that the best research builds on previous knowledge But        unfortunately the current medical publishing system hides much of this knowledge behind        subscription or pay per view charges which discriminates against researchers who do not        work for wellfunded institutions A group of researchers in Indonesia for example        recently told a depressingly familiar story of trying to search the medical literature in        preparation for a research project  access barriers got in their way So our second        response to Clarkes challenge is that it will remain difficult for researchers        particularly in resourcepoor settings to do systematic reviews unless the medical        literature is made a freely available public resource        Many clinical trials especially negative ones remain unpublished which prevents        researchers from reviewing all the data on an important health issue There are two main        reasons why certain trials are not published one is that the pharmaceutical industry has a        long history of suppressing data that are commercially unfavorable and the second is that        medical journals and the popular media favor publication of positive over negative trials        after all negative trials do not make for a provocative newspaper headline While we        support the recent announcement on trial registration by the International Committee of        Medical Journal Editorsas a condition of considering a trial for publication member        journals will require registration of the trial in a public trials registry we believe        that this policy addresses only part of the problem        The scientific literature will remain biased unless the publishing industry changes its        practices and provides a place where the results from all registered trials can be        published         PLoS Medicine is committed to publishing highquality negative trials In        this issue for example we publish an important randomized controlled trial of a malaria        vaccine in  Gambian men which found that the vaccine was ineffective at reducing the        natural infection rate        The internet makes it possible for every single clinical trial to be publicly and        seamlessly tracked through three tiers The first tier is registration in a publicly        available database The second is the publication of a peerreviewed summary of every        trial regardless of its outcome in a traditional journal format with annotations and        critiques that help readers understand the trials implications The third is the        deposition of detailed trial data in a structured computable format that allows        sophisticated searching and analyses across trials This format will allow the development        of better tools to help clinicians apply trial results to their practice For trial data to        be as useful as possible all three tiers must be publicly accessible Assessment of each        trials validity is critical but should not stop crucial information about all trials        being placed in the public domain        Trial registries exist such as ClinicalTrialsgov and the International Standard        Randomised Controlled Trial Number registry Moreover many trials are registered in a        semipublic database maintained by the United States Food and Drug Administration and        there are compelling arguments which Turner articulates in an essay published online ahead        of our December issue  for making this a truly public resource Publicly accessible        trial databases such as the Trial Bank Project at httprctbankucsfedu are under        development And as a publisher committed to open access PLoS will provide the second        essential tierjournals capable of peer reviewing and publishing an annotated report of        every trial Traditional medical journals with their subscriptionbased model are        unlikely to be able to provide this service because in order to attract subscribers they        need to publish only the highestprofile trials We believe that an openaccess modelin        which the research funder pays a publication fee to recover the costs of peer review and        for hosting the report on a secure serveris the best mechanism for creating such venues        We are working to make that happen        Returning to Clarkes challenge our final response is to say that we have a bold vision        of a freely accessible online world of clinical trialsfrom registration to annotated        summaries to trial databases That world would be even richer if every systematic review        were made freely available We challenge the Cochrane Collaboration to put the full text of        all of its reviews into the public domain We hope the Cochrane Collaboration will join us        in the openaccess revolution
