 Zombie Teen Ninjas and Other Neglected Topics And so dear Mim Just one more cup of coffee for the road regrettably leaving so much I haven t mentioned Like how I fear every attempt at universal health care will be sandbagged by the insurance companies Like how an English doctor demonstrated that the pharmaceutical industry charges us up to 1 000 percent more than they do for the same medication in Europe Like how Kathie Lee and other sweatshop profiteers should thank those CIA sponsored death squads of the 80s and the taxpayers who footed the bill Like how pleased I was with the e mail on drug legalization Like campaign funding reform and the TV industry Like Dan Quayle on Letterman Like how come capitalism forgot the need for the worker consumer Like how the religious right is now gunning for American Airlines gay rights policy Like will Joey survive the second series of The Sopranos But I agree that k j who called us overpaid needs to be set straight This is the creative poor friends and neighbors just ask my landlord If it s any consolation a dissembling conflicted blowhard is also known as an artist where I come from I m also starting to suspect that pound the pundit is the other half of the collective game and goes with the territory It s like the sideshow bozo above the tank of water if they don t hurl the balls we don t have a show We ll see if they ask me back On the matter of armed overthrow of the government I don t think I can help you I believe I gave my word to the INS that I wouldn t do that kind of thing when I applied for my green card Since a gentleman s word must still be his bond the best I can offer is to stand romantically on a hill the breeze flapping my duster coat around my legs rolling a quarter across my knuckles and watching as crack assault units of Hello Kitty the Trenchcoat Mafia and zombie teen ninjas penetrate the Beltway That s only leaves me to thank you for making the suggestion Susan for spotting some useful news items and Slate for having me in for the ride Thank you Thank you very much Mick has left the table
