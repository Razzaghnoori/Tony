 Joe Eszterhas No profession embraces the brash and talentless more warmly than the movie industry and no one is better evidence of this than Joe Eszterhas Eszterhas is America s most famous or rather notorious screenwriter His career is dedicated to the principle that the 14 year old boy has something to say Eszterhas is the Shakespeare of the Jerry Springer crowd the eminence greasy of Hollywood Most film types get the chance to create only one disastrous flop in a lifetime After last week Eszterhas has two to his credit Eszterhas you may remember is the genius behind Showgirls The 1995 lap dancing epic is arguably the worst movie of the decade and inarguably the worst written movie of the decade Eszterhas dialogue delivered by bimbos painted and injected to a fare thee well is an unintentionally hilarious parody of porn Eszterhas latest movie a much anticipated much hyped Hollywood satire called An Alan Smithee Film Burn Hollywood Burn opened and closed last week The film s conceit always a good word to use around Eszterhas is that a director steals his own terrible movie to prevent its release If only the same fate had befallen Burn Hollywood Burn Critics have called it bilious ham handed a hapless display of groundless vanity a wretched fiasco Even Eric Idle the movie s star dismissed the film as not funny Burn Hollywood Burn cost 10 million and grossed approximately nothing Apart from his two megafailures Eszterhas has devoted his career to the artful composition of smut and violence Since the mid 1980s Eszterhas has been churning out more or less identical genre pictures Jagged Edge 1985 Betrayed 1988 Basic Instinct 1992 Sliver 1993 Jade 1995 Basic plot Hero heroine falls for weirdo Many sweaty breasts and bloody corpses later the weirdo turns out to be surprise a raving homicidal nut job Eszterhas not only recycles plot he recycles dialogue He even recycles his sex obsessions Sliver and Basic Instinct both devote inordinate amounts of attention to the fact that Sharon Stone is not wearing any underwear Eszterhas sex fixation is legendary and comical His original draft of One Night Stand 1997 opened with a 65 page description of a marathon sex session Eszterhas is not a hit maker at least not anymore Several of his 80s movies including Flashdance 1983 and Jagged Edge were moneymakers But his last real success was Basic Instinct back in 1992 Since then he s written six flops in a row Hollywood isn t deterred He s now being paid 4 5 million to script a movie about Russian mobsters This raises a question Why Eszterhas is probably not the worst screenwriter in Hollywood Jagged Edge and Basic Instinct are quite fun But Eszterhas is an object lesson in the perils of the Brand Name Economy By tradition Hollywood screenwriters are anonymous They re supposed to be heard but not seen Actors and directors are stars writers like composers cinematographers editors settle for a credit line and a chubby paycheck There have been only a handful of famous screenwriters all of them authors of magnificent movies Eszterhas essentially invented the celebrity screenwriter He s a run of the mill screenwriter who created a myth that he was an idiosyncratic rebel says Entertainment Weekly critic Owen Gleiberman Eszterhas has always been a masterful self promoter The child of Hungarian World War II refugees he started his career as a reporter for the Cleveland Plain Dealer He won fame by obtaining photographs of the My Lai massacre then caught the eye of Rolling Stone with his bold crime stories The magazine was in its days of high gonzo but even by that standard Eszterhas stood out At editorial meetings he would brandish a knife Hollywood beckoned in the late 70s Eszterhas first movie was F I S T 1978 a labor drama starring Sylvester Stallone When Stallone took credit for the script Eszterhas challenged him to a fistfight It was a sign of things to come Ever since he has used belligerence bravado and a gift for charming the media to make himself a star When Flashdance s director suggested rewriting the lead character Eszterhas bullied him out of the idea He did the same thing when the studio tried to change the ending of Jagged Edge Both incidents burnished his image In 1989 Eszterhas made headlines by challenging superagent Michael Ovitz then Hollywood s most powerful man Ovitz had threatened to destroy Eszterhas career if he switched to another agency Eszterhas leaked this to the press humiliating Ovitz He twice brought attention to himself by storming off the set of Basic Instinct Burn Hollywood Burn had its press getting Eszterhas stunt too He dumped his director and edited the film himself Eszterhas still presents himself as a radical tough He has long hair and a motorcycle gang beard the sort of hair that looks bad enough at age 33 and positively absurd at 53 He has been known to bring a wooden stick into meetings then smash it on the table when he s angry He has turned his private life into fodder for his myth In 1994 when Sharon Stone took up with a producer named Bill McDonald McDonald s wife Naomi Baka took refuge with Eszterhas and his wife of 24 years Eszterhas promptly left his wife and their two kids for Baka Then according to press reports he signed a contract with Vanity Fair to tell all about the sordid affair No piece ever ran Eszterhas posturing worked He became the celebrity he d always hoped to be brash appealing larger than life Moviegoers knew his name and his legendary audacity Producers fell hard for the schtick making him the most expensive writer in Hollywood He got 3 million for Basic Instinct then 2 5 million for a four page outline of Jade then 4 million for One Night Stand And thanks to his bullheadedness he exerts more control over production than almost any other screenwriter Directors alter his scripts at their peril There is a mysterious disconnect between Eszterhas self image and his work Eszterhas is a self promoter but not a cynic He honestly believes himself Hollywood s bravest outsider and he has written passionately about the need for screenwriters to stand up for artistic integrity He also honestly believes in his scripts One of the most endearing qualities of B movie makers such as Roger Corman is their self consciousness their recognition that they re making crass but fun junk That s absent in Eszterhas He s an Ed Wood for the 90s Eszterhas is delusional in the sense that he believes that everything he touches is serious says film critic and historian David Thomson In the publicity leading up to the release of Showgirls Eszterhas gave interview after interview about the importance of the movie of its deep moral message its serious purpose He even called it this T A sleazefest about a Vegas stripper a deeply religious experience Eszterhas is reminiscent of Playboy s Hugh Hefner They share the same exaggerated sense of importance the same pontificating humorlessness about their ridiculous jobs Hefner published pictures of naked women and believed himself a radical Eszterhas writes movies about naked women and believes himself an artist No surprise that Playboy s April issue publishes a long interview with Eszterhas Eszterhas career did not have to be this way He s capable of much more than he usually gives In 1990 he wrote The Music Box a movie about an American lawyer who defends her Hungarian immigrant father when he is accused of Nazi war crimes It is a beautiful sad little movie about betrayal It was glowingly reviewed But the actors and the movie drew most of the publicity Eszterhas didn t This is Eszterhas tragedy and the dark side of his celebrity When he writes sensationalist schlock he gets the attention he craves When he writes moving interesting drama he doesn t So schlock it will be
