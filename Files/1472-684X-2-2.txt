                    Background        Sedation in the final stage of life is a controversial        issue in palliative care with regard to medical and        nonmedical indications decisionmaking and ethical        implications It is widely agreed even though this is        controversial too that in patients with advanced cancer        and other terminal diseases the provision of sedation        leading to unconsciousness sometimes can be a necessary        therapeutic procedure of last resort for symptom relief            In the final stages of life symptoms may remain        refractory However there is much debate about where to        draw the borderline between sedation for refractory        symptoms that are of a mainly physicalsomatic nature and        for those psychological symptoms that are mainly due to        existential suffering Also some think that sedation        leading to unconsciousness should be an option or an        alternative for terminally ill patients with intolerable        suffering if they request euthanasia or physician assisted        suicide      or for those who just want to die in        sleep        The problems associated with sedation in endoflife        care and the different attitudes among clinicians and        palliative care experts are reflected in inconsistent        terminology     variation in techniques used to induce        maintain and monitor sedation     duration of and        frequency of application different concepts on the time of        administering sedation and on intentions     While the        ambiguous term terminal sedation TS     is used        most often other terms more clearly reflect the different        viewpoints sedation for intractable distress in the        imminently dying      endoflife sedation           sloweuthanasia     palliative sedation            total sedation     sedation in the final phase        palliative sedation therapy            Sedation in the terminal or final stages of life can be        defined as the use of sedative drugs usually        benzodiazepines with or without complementary opioids given        by the intravenous or by the subcutaneous route to reduce        the level of consciousness sufficiently deep to provide        comfort for the patient until death occurs According to        the EAPC Ethics Task Force terminal or palliative        sedation in those imminently dying must be distinguished        from euthanasia In terminal sedation the         intention is to relieve intolerable        suffering the         procedure is to use a sedating drug        for symptom control and the successful         outcome is the alleviation of        distress In euthanasia the         intention is to kill the patient the                procedure is to administer a lethal        drug and the successful         outcome is immediate death In        palliative care mild sedation may be used therapeutically        but in this situation it does not adversely affect the        patients conscious level or ability to communicate            The use of heavy sedation which leads to        unconsciousness may sometimes be necessary to achieve        identified therapeutic goals The intention is the relief        of otherwise intractable and refractory distress            Target symptoms include persisting pain delirium        dyspnoea nausea and vomiting massive haemorrhage        agitated anxiety and other forms of psychological distress        Sedation can be classified into mild to deep intermittent        to continuous primary to secondary sudden to slow            Controversies exist about the time limit and proximity to        death     the clinical implications eg the        withdrawal of nutrition and hydration      patient        monitoring the stage and circumstances of the illness in        which sedation can be offered or employed and the informed        consent process with patients and surrogates            Requests for sedation seem to become of increasing        relevance in advance directives but the ethical        implications may rise to conflicts between patients wishes        to hasten death and physicians intentions to provide the        best care and not to shorten life        In particular there is controversy on the issues of        dehydration in sedation for existential suffering            The increasing acceptance and use of terminal sedation           in endoflife care makes it necessary to scrutinize        guidelines which may help to continuously consider and        reconsider the needs and wishes of patients and surrogates        as well as intentions and concerns of caregivers        The use of sedation in terminally ill patients has been        investigated by a number of studies in recent years The        wide variations in frequency to choose sedation as an        procedure in endoflife care across different centres        suggest different attitudes of doctors and policies of        institutions rather than the patients preferences or needs            The purpose of this retrospective study was to        investigate reasons for the request and the application of        sedation in terminal situations in our palliative care unit        in the years  and the relevance of        guidelines                    Methods        We performed a systematic retrospective analysis of the        charts of all patients who received continuous or        intermittent sedation by the administration of        benzodiazepines intravenously within the last  hrs before        death in the Palliative Care Unit PCU of GK Havelhhe        between  and  During this period there was no        change in the medical staff of the unit Indications        decisionmaking and techniques were regulated according to        internal guidelines which were introduced after discussion        with the medical and nursing staff at the beginning of the        observation period Table  Indication and beginning of        sedation was documented in the medical records        The medical charts of all patients n  who died        during the observation period where investigated in order        to find out those who had sedation in the final stage of        their life A ranking of symptoms on admission during        treatment and in the last  hrs was made according to our        symptom assessment scale with the items pain        gastrointestinal nauseaemesisintestinal obstruction        dyspnoea anxietydepression fatiguecachexia cognitive        disorderdelirium drowsinessagitation bleeding skin        problems ulcerations oedema neurological and others        Data collection rating and analysis was made by a single        member of the medical staff Reduction of rating and        ranking errors in doubtful cases was achieved by        complementary interviews with those involved more        personally in the medical care of the patients In this        study the single rater method by the clinically most        experienced physician was preferred to reduce disagreement        on symptom definitions in trust on the experience and        accuracy of an individual point of view though recollection        of data sometimes was difficult to obtain Charts of        patients with sedation were reviewed and evaluated        systematically and discussed with those involved in the        decisionmaking on sedation in the terminal or final phase        A ranking was made to identify a single predominant        symptom which mainly lead to sedation and concomitant        others  predominant symptoms for sedation were        differentiated dyspnoea pain deliriumagitation        gastrointestinal bleeding anxietypsychological distress        The recorded indications for sedation were classified into        mainly physical when refractory physical symptoms        predominated and mainly psychological when intolerable        suffering by panic anxiety refractory insomnia or        affective decompensation persisted Agitated delirium was        separated due to the diagnostic uncertainty to relate this        symptom to a more physical or more psychological origin        retrospectively Attention was given to the stage of        disease at the time of admission prevalence of symptoms on        admission and in the final phase changes of symptoms        during treatment type and duration of sedation until        death survival time after administration of the sedatives        provision of concomitant therapy nutrition supply and        fluids state of consciousness and communication skills        Special interest was given to patients attitudes and        frequency of request for sedation in the final phase as        documented in the medical records or in advance directives        Patients characteristics were related to all patients        admitted        The data were analysed using SPSS Version         Chisquared tests were used to examine associations between        categorical data Metric data age duration of stay        duration of sedation were compared using Students ttest        for independent groups Comparisons between groups for        predominant symptoms were made using the MannWhitney        Utest and Wilcoxon ranksum test for paired comparison        within patients groups P   was considered        statistically significant On the base of these data a        critical evaluation for the decisions on sedation was made        comparing the periods between  and                     Results         Patients characteristics showed no significant        difference in the stage of disease on admission Table         But patients who finally received sedation were more likely        to have experienced pain dyspnoea and anxiety as the        predominant symptom on admission than those who did not        undergo sedation Table          Sedation in the last  hrs was performed in   n          of all patients who died in the PCU of GK Havelhoehe        n   with significantly increasing frequency in the        years     p   Figure          No difference was found in the duration of stay in our        unit until death between those patients who died with and        those who died without sedation Mean age of patients who        finally had sedation was less with  years vs  years in        those without sedation p   Students ttest         All patients had effective and sufficient pain        control but in those patients who were sedated in the last         hrs of life burdensome dyspnoea panicstricken anxiety        and agitated delirium had increased during the stay Figure                 The indications for performing sedation due to        predominant psychological distress anxiety refractory        insomnia decompensation and due to refractory symptoms        dyspnoea gastrointestinal pain did not differ        significantly during the two observational periods        Interestingly there was a tendency that the main        indications for sedation during the last three years        shifted more and more to psychological distress         Mean survival time after administration of sedation        was    hrs during the whole observation period In the        years  patients with more psychological distress        had a longer survival time than those with otherwise        resistant control of more physical symptoms Table          In the years  we noticed an increase in the        request for sedation in the final days of life from  to         by the patients themselves documented in personal        statements or advance directives In those patients in        which sedation was given also on request the mean        survival time was found to be slightly shorter           hrs in the years  but not in the years before        Table          In most cases sedation was performed with slowly        increasing doses of midazolam  mg   mgh iv aimed at        achieving effective symptom control When this was        obtained doses were reduced and sedation was continued        intermittently with the documentation of the level of        consciousness comfort eating drinking and communication        skills  patients had continuous sedation mean duration         hrs  intermittent mean duration  hrs In         patients  oral supply of fluids and in  patients        also oral nutrition intake during sedation was reported in        the records  patients  had no oral fluid or        nutrition supply after sedation was introduced either        because of the deepness of the sedation or because of        refusal of oral fluid and nutrition intake Infusion of        fluids was continued in all patients with regard on comfort        according to clinical signs of thirst with restriction of        volumes in cases of oedema ascites and pulmonary        congestion Special attention was given to establish a good        sleeping period at night and a more patient controlled        sedative state with communicative skills and reports of        comfort during the day         Abilities to communicate like asking for help or        answering questions on pain comfort thirst etc and        preserved forms of cooperation under sedation were reported        in  cases          The following case of a  yrs old hospice worker in        whom oropharyngeal cancer was diagnosed during pregnancy        may illustrate the procedure of sedation in our PCU but        also the difficulties associated with drawing the line in        consideration of patients needs personal intentions and        adequacy of sedative procedures for refractory symptom        control                  For several weeks she was treated for          panic attacks dyspnoea and dysphagia but relief of          symptoms only lasted a few days Her weakness increased          rapidly In her advance directives she had disclaimed          tracheotomy and antibiotics but pleaded for good pain          therapy and sedation to die in sleep In the final          phase she suffered from extensive mucositis exhausting          breathlessness and agitated anxiety by upper airway          obstruction due to local tumour progression pulmonary          and hepatic metastases and acute pneumonia She said I          think  now the time has come and requested for sedation          during the last hours of her life The clinical situation          was discussed with the nursing team according to our          internal guidelines Informed consent in presence of her          husband was obtained before  mg iv midazolam were          administered with good symptom relief Sedation was          continued with a dosage of  mgh on which the patient          insisted on comfort by the sedation and fear of recurring          distress Survival time was  hrs in a peaceful quiet          atmosphere without distress a light sedative state with          diminished communication skills oral fluid intake and          support by the presence of her husband                             Discussion        To balance between therapeutic sedation to reduce        burdensome distress in the terminal and dying phase and        sedation in patients who voluntary request sedation to die        in sleep is a difficult challenge This is particularly        important when anxiety physical distress and anxiety with        existential suffering appear together in the dying person        like in the illustrated case        The intention of this survey is to contribute to the        international discussion on sedation in endoflife        situations The analysis was primarily done to reconsider        our internal guidelines by reflecting our clinical practice        Certainly a survey like this suffers from the drawbacks of        a retrospective study Nevertheless our results can be        understood as a contribution to more transparency in this        difficult issue The increasing incidence and also the        finding that sedation was more often used in situations        with psychological distress and also requested by the        patients themselves may indicate an increasing awareness        and respect for the needs of the patients It also seems to        signify that in the care of patients with physical symptoms        and psychological distress in situations near death needs        and deficits exist for which sensitive medical strategies        must be combined and integrated with personal support        commitment and understanding In our guidelines we tried to        relate the possible benefits of sedation to the basic        concerns of palliative care by using it as a reversible        therapeutic procedure Concentrating on communicated        comfort as the main indicator for the value of this option        means also that in the care of the sedated patients        personal support played an important role        Our decisions for the administration of sedation were        restricted to terminal and final situations when the course        of the disease had so progressed that death due to the        underlying disease could be expected within the next  hrs        with or without this procedure Nevertheless mean survival        time after administration of sedation was  hrs It is in        general difficult to predict death in a particular patient        because of individual variations and since we do not know        the exact borderline between life and death     To a        certain extent the point in time to accept dying  at least        in medical institutions  depends on empirically based        decisions to abstain from potentially lifesustaining        interventions eg pharmacological technical or other        artificial support of organ function to prevent death at        least for limited moments of time      In our        internal guidelines we grouped patients according to the        staging system of JonenThielemann into rehabilitative        preterminal terminal and final phases     With        relation to intentions of care life expectancy according        to the progress of disease and empirical statistics        consideration on perhaps burdensome diagnostic and        therapeutic procedures and communication strategies with        patients and proxies a systematic staging of patients in        palliative care on expected outcome seems to be useful The        predominant classification into the preterminal stage of        most of our patients on admission signifies also the        diagnostic uncertainty and difficulty with such a staging        system with relationship to responsible decisionmaking and        consequences of care        We considered sedation as a an palliative therapeutic        option of last resort in the last stages of life Many        experts prefer the term palliative sedation instead of        terminal sedation Though the term palliative sedation        seems to be more appropriate it must be distinguished from        those situations in other phases of palliative care when        palliative sedation is used for burdensome diagnostic or        painful therapeutic procedures eg wound debridement and        dressing of exulcerating tumours insertion of catheters        and usually does not exceed the time in which the procedure        is undertaken Among the most controversial discussed        issues of terminal sedation are the questions of when and        for which forms of intractable suffering sedation may be        indicated Another central point refers to the question of        how to distinguish clearly the crucial intention of relief        providing sedation from slow euthanasia by the        application of lethal doses of sedatives            In our study we found that dyspnoea delirium and        anxiety increased during the treatment period in those        patients who finally had sedation while pain was        significantly reduced by adequate treatment during the        progressing course of the disease Figure  This finding        is in confirmation with other studies in which besides        acute bleeding and gastrointestinal symptoms distressing        dyspnoea delirium and agitated anxiety also where found to        be the main reasons for sedation in endoflife care            The adequate treatment and care of patients of patients        with otherwise refractory symptoms certainly is a great        challenge in palliative care and improvement in this field        is needed urgently Our target in sedation is calming and        comfort without lowering the level of consciousness deep        enough to loose communication This also means that        sedation cannot compensate personal palliative support and        care  it must be combined Our study indicates also that        psychosocial distress contributed to the decision making        especially when patients had made an advance directive with        requests for sedation in the last phase of life In our        study the shorter survival time after administration of        sedation in patients who had made an request for sedation        might be due to the fact that in those patients the medical        indications and preconditions were considered more        intensively while the underlying disease progressed        The ethical dilemmas and the possibilities to abuse        sedation by turning it in a form of medicalised killing            are important aspects that seem to restrict the        administration of sedatives in terminally ill patients In        studies on survival time of patients with and without        sedation no significant differences were found              Certainly also the cultural background determines        attitudes and view points to the goals of care and in which        situations of intolerable suffering sedation is ethically        acceptable     In several retrospective and        prospective surveys the reported frequency of sedation due        to intractable symptoms in different palliative care        settings ranged from  with increasing incidence        especially for existential suffering              Diagnostic criteria and clinical preconditions for the        consideration of sedation in patients with far advanced        disease have been described by several authors              but aims targets types of sedation and decision making        remain conflicting issues        In modern Western culture the elements of a good        death include besides freedom of pain death at home with        the family members being around amongst others also the        element of awareness However the technical        possibilities of palliative care with concentration on        quality of life also brought about a diminished emphasis        on the good death     Consequently the increasing        requests of patients to die in sleep by terminal sedation        could be an comprehensible alternative to euthanasia or        physicianassisted suicide and must be reflected in the        discussion on the value of sedation in endoflife care        Though we could not make a clear differentiation between        primary when patients want to be sedated approaching the        moment of death and secondary sedation when sedation        results as a sideeffect in otherwise refractory symptom        control     it must be clear to all that the        intention of sedation in the terminal and final phase is        not a concealed form of euthanasia     Under ethical        aspects the requests for sedation to reduce consciousness        to a state of unawareness need an individual and balanced        approach especially when the wish for sedation is not        connected with the intolerability of physical or        psychological distress This makes it necessary to discuss        the problem of terminal sedation like other forms of        therapeutic and existential support with patients and        family members at an early stage in palliative care        Sedation should be restricted as a reversible therapeutic        option to otherwise refractory suffering by burdensome        symptoms in the terminal and final phase which may but        should not intentionally hasten death With regard to        symptom relief the level of sedation must not necessarily        need deep sleep or bring about unconsciousness The        recent consensus guidelines for dying intensive care        patients released in Canada provide a clear but certainly        also problematic definition of terminal sedation which        distinguishes between real terminal sedation for        therapeutic intentions and terminal sedation as a possible        form of euthanasia by lethal doses of sedatives The        Canadian guidelines define Terminal Sedation as sedation        with continuous IV narcotics andor sedatives until the        patient becomes unconscious and death ensues from the        underlying illness Emphasis is added that the balance        between possible euthanasia and inadequate palliative care        is achieved by titrating the dosage of sedatives so that        one avoids over or under medication to allow death to        result from the underlying disease in a state of continuing        unconsciousness            According to our guidelines after the intended provision        of relief and symptom alleviation initially our approach in        most cases was to reach a state of conscious sedation by        reducing the dosages of sedatives to a level of        communication that revalidation of the clinical situation        could be achieved This form of a patient controlled        sedative state was explained to the patients and family        members before induction of sedation  especially to those        who had a request for sedation in their advance directives        No objection to this procedure was mentioned except in one        case where a female patient requested for sedation after        an emergency operation for intestinal obstruction in case        that it would not bring the expected result The intention        on comfort in the terminal and final phase should be the        main concern in finding ethically acceptable criteria for        the use of sedation in endoflife care and to avoid misuse        of terminal sedation                    Conclusions        The results of our study indicate that sedation in        endoflife care seems to become an increasing ethical        problem with attention to patients wishes and needs and        physicians integrity This is not only a problem for those        involved in palliative and hospice care Since terminal        sedation may arguably make the detection of        euthanasiaassisted suicide more difficult the intent of        the physician is the most crucial distinction     But        beside intention the adequacy of what is done must also be        taken into account The concentration on comfort and        symptom alleviation by titrating the sedative medication to        a level that allows assessment and communication are        important aspects which should be considered in the ongoing        discussion on sedation in the last stages of life        Ethically acceptable criteria and guidelines for decision        making with regard to the nature of refractory and        intolerable symptoms patients needs aims of sedation and        informed consent are needed     Based on these        prospective clinical studies with systematic documentation        of cases transparency and critical communication with        regard to indications intentions procedures        alternatives results and adverse effects would help to        locate the appropriate place of sedation in endoflife        care and diminish misuse or moral prejudices                    Competing interests        None declared                    Authors contributions
