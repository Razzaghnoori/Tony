 More Minutes of the Media Conspiracy The central committee of the media conspiracy met again today Click here for last month s minutes We were all supposed to be in Iowa to cover tonight s Democratic debate but given the cold weather and a series of interesting honoraria being given by the American Enterprise Institute we decided to gather instead for lunch at the Palm Restaurant in Washington D C All the usual luminaries were there with the exception of the incredibly dedicated David Broder who video conferenced in from Winterset Iowa Broder was out there wrapping up a marathon outdoor focus group with Methodists expected to attend next week s caucuses It was a bit difficult to hear him through his balaclava but I m pretty sure Broder s point was that Bradley and McCain were peaking too early He wanted to know what we should do to ensure the longest possible primary season Gerald Seib of the Wall Street Journal made the first suggestion Why not just continue to sprinkle McCain and Bradley with adoring coverage Gerry said he was planning to publish a column about how McCain was winning admiration in Washington for his maverick stance on campaign finance reform He added that every time he ran this column he got a nice note from Fred Wertheimer Sam and Cokie could barely control their sniggering It fell to Rick Berke of the New York Times to explain to Gerry why this wouldn t work For one thing the story had to change we journalists couldn t very well keep writing that McCain and Bradley were on the rise What s more Rick pointed out reporters were already flirting with EOB in favor of McCain EOB Al Hunt explained to me stands for extreme overt bias and it s a violation of the conspiracy s bylaws Howard Fineman of Newsweek offered an alternative to Seib s idea Why not offer a round of seemingly harsh but actually harmless stories about Bradley and McCain This would create the appearance of media fair play without doing either of our favorites much damage Howard pointed to McCain s letters to the FCC as an example though he noted that this kind of story always has the potential to get out of hand The meeting dissolved into laughter when Howard joked that he nearly had to sit down and read the 500 letters McCain released last week Syndicated columnist Steve Roberts said he thought a barrage of mild criticism was a nifty idea because it would allow for two CWRs conventional wisdom reversals according to Hunt between now and the New Hampshire primary McCain and Bradley could sag next week and then surge the following week achieving come from behind victories in New Hampshire The beauty of the plan Steve said was that it was possible without any actual candidate movement in the polls Seib loved the idea He even offered to write the first draft of a column about how McCain had a highly conservative voting record While appearing critical this story could help McCain by putting distance between him and the liberal media Seib said Roberts apologized for raining on Gerry s parade but said he thought the McCain as closet conservative story would be more effective if it weren t written by a columnist He suggested handing the idea off to some shoe leather guys at the Los Angeles Times Johnny Apple jumped in at this point to complain that shoe leather was what he was eating for lunch Shouting for the gar on he complained that his T bone steak was overcooked and that he had powerful friends at the Bureau of Weights and Measures who might be interested in checking to see whether it really was 40 ounces as advertised The waiter apologetically took the bone back to the kitchen and quickly brought Mr Apple another Fineman then raised a new concern Wouldn t it be unfair to McCain to criticize him for being too conservative According to conspiracy rules all politicians were supposed to receive credit new respect for turning more liberal But this problem was quickly resolved when McCain who was attending the lunch as a guest of U S News World Report Time Newsweek Slate and The New Yorker said he wouldn t mind the criticism a bit What of Bradley Lance Morrow of AOL Time Warner asked Sam Cokie proposed that Bradley be charged with general arrogance since he wouldn t say publicly what his favorite movie was while acknowledging off the record to reporters that it was Look Who s Talking II Fineman added that McCain could also be charged with hypocrisy since Mr Sharp Elbows wasn t living up to his own elevated standard of positive campaigning Willis Hortoo Willis Hortoo Jack Germond exclaimed perhaps referring to a recent interview in which Bradley castigated Gore for discovering Willie Horton in the 1988 campaign Martini Morrow said Bradley s arrogance and hypocrisy were both fine issues and that the newsmagazines would work out the details of these criticisms at their usual Friday planning session He reminded Fineman that it was Newsweek s turn to put together this week s outline The Dean who by this point was mostly covered in a snowdrift was impatient to bring the meeting to a close He wished everyone a lively campaign and reminded us to dress warmly for his toboggan party in Dixville Notch He said I could bring the hot cocoa
