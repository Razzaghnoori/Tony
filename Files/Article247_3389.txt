 The San Francisco Examiner Death Watch Hi Jim I too am enjoying the We Are the World eclipse coverage This from Reuters Druids danced Muslims prayed Hindus bathed and Europeans stopped work and took to the streets as an eerie twilight followed by darkness covered their capitals at about noon Just as we Americans expected Those Europeans will use any occasion as an excuse to stop working They probably all went right home and took naps afterwards too If the eclipse had happened here of course we would have just taken our cell phones and other gadgets outside and kept right on multitasking But since you re tired of all this technology talk nature boy back to my original obsession of the week the morbid San Francisco Examiner death watch Here s one more reason to frown at the prospect of losing the city s other daily Today s Examiner carries a front page investigative piece that s the latest installment in their ongoing coverage of an FBI probe into city contracting abuses involving real estate development At the center of the action is Charlie Walker a local truck driver and longtime friend and supporter of Mayor Willie Brown who is seeking re election Incidentally in a troubling sign of the times for journalism Charlie Walker refuses to be interviewed by the Examiner unless they agree to pay him 250 000 if he s misquoted He s clearly ever the smart business man Anyway today s Examiner piece reveals that the FBI has now expanded to investigate various potential developments on the San Francisco waterfront What s so hysterical about this piece of gritty city reporting the kind of thing that makes true blue newspaper types bluster with civic pride is that on the very same day the Wall Street Journal carries a puff piece about the development of the self same waterfront In San Francisco Great Views and a Ferry In the Examiner story port director Doug Wong appears scheduling a hearing about one of Charlie Walker s crony s development projects which is apparently now under investigation In the Wall Street Journal the same official Doug Wong demures that port administrators offices won t be housed in the newly renovated Ferry Building because the real estate is just too valuable 60 per square foot and they ll settle for lesser waterfront views down the road 46 per square foot How modest While the local paper chases a story involving the Mayor the FBI and the waterfront the Wall Street Journal finds in the same waterfront a tale of a city re inventing itself through heroic redevelopment It s tragicomic KM
