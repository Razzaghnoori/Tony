 Background The organization of chromatin within the eukaryotic nucleus has been a subject of great interest as it is likely to impact on important processes such as recombination 1 and epigenetic mechanisms of gene control 2 Early observations by Rabl cited by 3 in plants suggested a preferential polarization of chromosomes with their centromeres clustered at one end of the nuclear envelope the apical side and the telomeres at the opposite end the basal side More recently evidence from fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH studies in different systems has suggested that various genomic loci can be found consistently in specific regions of the nucleus 4 and that subnuclear location can be correlated with gene activity 5 Together with results from real time measurements with living cells 6 these studies argue for a structured organization of chromosomes The present model we have of chromatin organization within the nucleus is a dynamic one with territories for each chromosome defined by their relative location to each other 7 During the mitotic cycle chromosomes are duplicated in the S phase and pulled to the two daughter cells during M phase Chromosome territories are re established after cell division and once the cell is arrested in a long interphase chromosome movement becomes restricted again 8 Some nucleus to nucleus variations in the exact position of each locus relative to the rest of the genome can be expected 9 As some random organization within each territory is possible 10 there is also likely to be time dependent positional differences in the relative coordinates of each locus within a single nucleus 11 These predicted nucleus to nucleus variations and the mobility of the established territories within the nuclei of various cell types in eukaryotes remain poorly defined in most systems So far most in situ studies of gene positioning and changes in higher order chromatin architecture have been carried out using FISH This method can produce artifacts however because it requires the fixation and permeabilization of cells and denaturation of chromatin before hybridization with labeled single strand probes 12 It is also very difficult to perform kinetic studies with FISH to track the dynamics of chromatin movement in a single nucleus Recent advances in the application of green fluorescent protein GFP as an in vivo tag of specific chromosomal regions promises to revolutionize our ability to observe chromatin based processes in near real time 13 This technique first established by Andrew Belmont and collaborators 14 entails the construction of a fusion protein between GFP and the DNA binding domain DBD of a known heterologous transcription factor The binding site for the DBD is multimerized into a concatameric array which is then inserted into the genome of animal or yeast cells Expression of the GFP DBD fusion protein results in fluorescent tagging of the concatamer in situ This provides a beacon that allows one to track the position of this region in the genome with high specificity and sensitivity In yeast and animal cells a single concatamer insert can be visualized with high resolution and fidelity and the application of this technique has provided new insights on chromosome behavior 15 16 17 These findings might however be true only for the few cell types and yeast strains studied so far and may not be generally applicable to all eukaryotic cells For example even though chromosome territories showed only small movements during an observation period of several hours 6 they may show larger movements over longer time periods such as days Also the degree of nuclear order appears to depend on the particular cell type 18 Earlier application of this technology in multicellular organisms involved extrachromosomal arrays of the lac operator created in C elegans by co injecting plasmids containing the operator array and GFP sequences along with other constructs 19 The samples were fixed for immunological detection and the sizes as well as stability of the arrays studied remain undefined Thus application of that technique to study chromatin behavior may be rather limited Very recently Vazquez et al 20 applied this technology in dissected Drosophila spermatocytes from animals that have integrated the lac operator arrays at cytogenetically defined genomic loci Real time monitoring of chromosome movement in this specialized cell type indicated that progression through G2 dramatically restricts the slower long range component of chromatin movement This study provided the first direct evidence for cell cycle control of chromatin movement and elegantly illustrated the power of this technology in transgenic organisms to facilitate the understanding of chromosome behavior in a developmental context The model plant Arabidopsis offers an excellent system in which to apply this new technology for the study of chromatin organization and dynamics Aside from being easily transformable and having a well characterized genome 21 it is relatively easy to track cell types and individual cells One can easily distinguish one cell from another and individual cells can be tracked for a week or more 22 In the present work we have successfully adapted the GFP beacon approach to create the necessary tools and transgenic lines for visualizing stably inserted concatameric sites in the genome in live Arabidopsis plants This material and technology should open up new opportunities for characterizing the physical organization and movement of chromosomes in the nuclei of Arabidopsis Results and discussion Vector construction and molecular characterization of transgenic Arabidopsis To control accumulation of lac repressor LacI proteins in plant nuclei a glucocorticoid inducible gene expression system pTA7002 was used for vector construction 23 A gene encoding a plant optimized GFP variant mGFP5 24 was placed in frame with a LacI SV40 nuclear localization signal fusion GFP LacI NLS 25 and then subcloned into the vector pTA7002 under the control of the glucocorticoid receptor GR responsive promoter near the left border The resulting plasmid is designated as pEL700 At the other end of the pTA7002 vector we inserted 256 copies of the lac operator sequence LacOs 10 1 kb and designated this second vector pEL702 Figure 1a The entire plasmid of pEL702 encompasses about 25 kilobases kb and the size of the integrating region flanked by the right and left borders of the Ti plasmid is about 17 kb The plasmid was designed such that the DNA between the right and left borders can be transferred into plant nuclei via Agrobacterium 26 Thus when stable transgenic Arabidopsis plants are treated with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone Dex the expressed fusion proteins would be able to localize to the integrated loci by association with LacOs This inducible expression system allows controlled expression of a small amount of GFP LacI NLS protein for optimal signal to noise and to prevent aggregation of GFP fusion proteins in the nuclei as a result of high protein concentrations As Belmont and co workers 14 25 reported that the LacOs is unstable in a recombination competent bacterial strain we are concerned with the stability of LacOs in the Agrobacterium strain that is used to transform Arabidopsis Thus we examined the stability of LacOs in the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 MP90 by Southern blot analysis after transformation We found that the LacOs may be unstable in Agrobacterium initially as many colonies examined turned out to contain truncated arrays that are less than 10 1 kb the size of the original LacOs in pEL702 Figure 1b lanes 1 and 2 We found however that colonies that do show the proper size array can be maintained for at least 2 days at 28 C in liquid culture without a significant reduction of the array size Figure 1b lane 3 Thus we first monitored the size of LacOs in our Agrobacterium culture before transforming Arabidopsis with colonies carrying full length or near full length LacOs We observed low transformation efficiency of Arabidopsis with Agrobacterium carrying pEL702 under our transformation conditions 10 of that with pEL700 data not shown We speculate that a large T DNA region approximately 17 kb and or the presence of a large number of tandem repeats of LacOs in the T DNA region may contribute to the low efficiency of gene transfer After we obtained several independent lines that grew on selection plates containing hygromycin we used Southern blot analysis to determine the size of the LacOs and the relative copy number of the inserted T DNAs in the transformed lines Pst I digestion of genomic DNA from the transgenic lines which should release the full length LacOs 10 1 kb from the integrated T DNA inserts was hybridized with a probe consisting of 40 copies of the lac operator sequence Thus in this analysis each fragment should correspond to the size of an integrated lac operator array We detected several bands of different apparent sizes on the Southern blot Figure 2 indicating that arrays with different numbers of lac operator sequences were integrated into the genome in each of the lines examined Figure 2shows data from analysis of two independently transformed lines One line is designated EL702C and showed hybridizing bands with apparent sizes of approximately 10 9 and 7 kb The second is designated EL702E and DNA from this line showed a single band of approximately 4 5 kb that hybridized with the lac operator probe Southern analysis with homozygous plants from the fifth generation progenies of both lines also showed similar signal s data not shown These results indicated that the LacOs could be truncated before or during integration into the Arabidopsis genome but the integrated genes were subsequently stable in the plant genome For simplicity we will refer to the integration site as a tagged locus The copy numbers of insertions in these lines were estimated with restriction digests of genomic DNA using Bgl II and Hind III in addition to Pst I followed by Southern blot analysis using the LacI NLS fragment as a probe Figures 1 2 Using this probe we should detect fragments generated by enzymatic cleavage upstream of the LacI NLS sequence in the inserts as well as restriction sites present at variable distances in the genomic DNA neighboring the left border of the insertions Thus each fragment detected in the Southern blot probably corresponds to a distinct copy of the transferred DNA that has integrated into the genome Clustered integrations will however be more difficult to analyze in cases where a large number of insertions are present in the particular transgenic line and digestions with multiple restriction enzymes will be necessary to ascertain the structure of the insertion loci Our results from digestions with three different restriction enzymes suggest that there are three insertions in the EL702C line and a single insertion in the EL702E line per haploid genome consistent with the data obtained with the lac operator probe Figure 2 Dexamethasone inducible expression of GFP fusion protein Western blot analysis with anti GFP polyclonal antibodies Clonetech was used to test inducibility of GFP LacI NLS in transgenic plants We analyzed homozygous transgenic plants from two independent lines EL702C and EL702E as well as a line from our control vector EL700S This latter was transformed with pEL700 which is identical to pEL702 except for the absence of LacOs As pEL700 does not contain the LacOs the transgenic line EL700S can be used as a negative control for specific association of GFP LacI NLS with the LacOs in our experimental system In this line we expect the accumulation of GFP LacI NLS proteins in the nuclei after induction but specific binding of the fusion protein to chromatin should be absent We treated transgenic seedlings with an excess concentration of Dex 30 M in 10 ml water to achieve uniform induction Samples were collected at 0 6 12 24 48 72 and 96 hours after the treatment and proteins were extracted in sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS containing buffer for immunological detection of GFP fusion proteins We found that boiling the plant material in the extraction buffer resulted in loss of all GFP signals on our western blots This appears to be a result of aggregation of GFP LacI NLS fusion proteins with some insoluble materials in plant cells as we do not encounter this problem with recombinant GFP LacI NLS produced in bacteria data not shown To circumvent this problem we omitted the heating step in our protein sample preparation and anti GFP cross reacting proteins can be readily detected in our assay Western blot signals were first detected 6 hours after the addition of Dex and increased over time in all three lines Figure 3 After 48 hours the detection levels did not change significantly and comparison between the three lines revealed that the Dex inducible system in each line performed similarly with and without truncated LacOs and minimal leakiness of the promoter was observed before induction Although the predicted size of GFP LacI NLS fusion protein is 67 kDa we detected several signals between 70 to 30 kDa in addition to a major species of around 81 kDa on our blots for all lines over time after 24 hours The cause of this size heterogeneity of our GFP fusion protein is unclear at present In situdetection of the tagged loci in transgenic plants We then examined nucleus labeling by GFP after Dex treatment in homozygous transgenic plants from lines EL702C and E with LacOs and line EL700S without LacOs by fluorescence microscopy Each line was collected at the same time points as for the western blot analysis and GFP fluorescence was observed with appropriate filters All lines examined showed fluorescence in nuclei 6 hours after the treatment Figure 4 rows A The intensities of GFP fluorescence in nuclei were increased by 48 hours and stabilized after 48 hours in all lines These responses were correlated with the results of the western blot analysis Both western blot analysis and microscopy studies confirmed that the LacOs does not interfere with glucocorticoid inducible expression To investigate the response of the tagged loci we observed each nucleus with three dimensional fluorescence microscopy If the system functions properly we should be able to detect the tagged loci as bright spots above the GFP background signals in nuclei of the lines EL702C and E and should not detect any spot in line EL700S because of the absence of LacOs Bright spots were clearly observed above the diffused GFP fluorescence in nuclei observed 24 h after induction in lines EL702C and E whereas significant fluorescence spots above the diffuse background signals were not observed in EL700S Figure 4 rows B The spots were detected with similar signal to background ratios until the end of the time course 96 h after induction for lines EL702C and E whereas line EL700S did not show any spots during this time course The study also revealed that an array of about 120 copies of the lac operator sequence is sufficient to visualize LacOs in planta via GFP as the size of the LacOs in the single inserted locus in line EL702E is approximately 4 5 kb Figure 2 Inhibition of chimeric GFP LacI NLS protein binding in situto LacOsby IPTG To verify if the spots in nuclei correspond to the tagged loci we examined whether the detected subnuclear localization of the expressed GFP LacI NLS fusion protein is sensitive to isopropyl D thiogalactoside IPTG As the lac repressor variant that we used binds to the operator sites as dimers we should be able to inhibit its binding to the LacOs of the tagged loci by adding IPTG 27 If the binding is specific to the LacOs inserted in the genome the observed fluorescence spots should be suppressed by the addition of IPTG We used homozygous plants from line EL702C which carries three copies of the T DNA insert for this experiment Forty microliters of solution containing 0 3 M of Dex and 100 mM IPTG were dropped on each seedling on the culture plates Guard cells in the stomata of cotyledons were observed 12 hours after induction in the presence or absence of IPTG and the results from observed nuclei were tabulated Figure 5a b Without IPTG we detected one spot in 15 two spots in 65 and three spots in 20 of total observed nuclei n 25 among three seedlings With IPTG we detected no spots in 70 and one spot in 30 of total observed nuclei n 25 in three seedlings We also tested protein accumulation levels in the specimens examined by western blot analysis Similar levels of signals were detected with and without IPTG Figure 5c thus indicating that lac repressor binding is inhibited by IPTG without change in protein accumulation levels This study shows that the observed fluorescence spots in lines EL702C and E indeed correspond to specific binding of the induced GFP LacI NLS fusion protein to the tagged loci However the relationship between the spot numbers and tagged loci is unclear at this point For this purpose we are currently determining the precise genomic location of the tagged loci and collecting the statistics of spot numbers for homozygous and heterozygous plants of line EL702C Detection and relational mapping of tagged loci configuration As plants contain chloroplasts in leaf and stem cells and many autofluorescent compounds are localized in cell walls a signal to background ratio for GFP detection is probably lower than in animal systems Thus higher levels of accumulation of GFP LacI NLS may be required to detect the loci in our system Under this condition we found that we could obtain spatial information for subnuclear structures with excess unbound GFP LacI NLS fusion proteins The nuclear contour as well as the shape of the nucleolus for which GFP LacI NLS has relatively low accessibility and which thus appears as an opaque object within the nucleus can be captured along with the tagged loci positions by single channel excitation A guard cell nucleus from homozygous plants of line EL702C is shown Figure 6 The data can be converted to a three dimensional model shown for the detected spots shown as red objects and the nucleolus shown as a blue object within the nucleus outline shown in green wire frame Figure 6b The distance between the three spots can also be easily determined with the existing program of our system Figure 6c Comparison of tagged loci between guard cells and root epidermal cells Plant organs are composed of ordered collections of various cell types that differ in their shape size function and DNA content The positive correlation observed in most cells between cell volume and the degree of polyploidy indicates that the nuclear DNA content may have a key role in controlling cell growth 28 In Arabidopsis the ploidy level varies from 2C guard cells sepal and petal epidermal cells to 64C leaf trichomes 29 However the mechanism of endocycle control in plants remains poorly understood As an application of our chromatin tagging system we show here that cell specific polyploidy can be observed directly with this technology without measuring nuclear DNA content We used the homozygous plants of line EL702E which contain a single tagged locus for this experiment GFP signals observed in a cotyledon guard cell Figure 7a and an elongated root epidermal cell Figure 7b of a 10 day old seedling were compared using three dimensional projections of their nuclei after Dex induction In the guard cell where the shape of its nucleus is usually flat or spherical we often detected one spot which suggests that the tagged site is frequently paired with its homolog In contrast in the elongated root epidermal cells where the nucleus usually elongates at the two opposite sides we often detected multiple fluorescence spots five spots for the root nucleus shown in Figure 7 which indicates the polyploid nature of the observed nuclei Upon further refinement of this technology one may be able to study the dynamics and regulation of endoreduplication in plant cells that contribute to cell specific ploidy differences Conclusions We have established transgenic plants that enable us to observe specific tagged genomic loci together with the nucleolar location in cells of a living plant without any fixation Using this system we have visualized GFP tagged chromatin in different cell types in living Arabidopsis plants GFP tagged chromosome observation has been applied in several studies involving yeast cultured animal cells and more recently transgenic Drosophila spermatocytes These studies have revealed new principles of chromosome dynamics and organization However the relationship between chromatin structure and cell types and developmental stages is an important question that remains unanswered The intact Arabidopsis seedlings that were used for microscopy under our conditions remain viable after transplanting to soil from the slides Thus it should be possible to monitor the same plants continuously for up to several weeks In future by marking individual cells with visual tags it should be possible to follow changes in nuclear shape as well as relative subnuclear position of the nucleolus and specific tagged genomic loci over long times scales of the order of weeks These types of studies may reveal new aspects of chromatin organization in relationship to developmental timing Materials and
