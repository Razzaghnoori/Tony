 Los Angeles and Its People Los Angeles perhaps more than any other place on earth is preceded by its reputation Here is a city teeming with movie stars exorbitant wealth sunny beaches palm trees and beautiful people But L A is also linked with adventure and maybe even danger complete with earthquakes floods crime and scandals of O J Simpson proportions Because the world is watching it s a town eternally destined to make a spectacle of itself whether on screen or in real life The result is a modern day wild West meshed with everyday life where image is reality poverty clashes with wealth and fame is acquired overnight all publicized to the hilt around the globe The world s perception however hardly reflects the real Los Angeles The city is not merely beautiful coastlines hit TV shows opulent mansions in the hills and the latest in celebrity gossip Los Angeles County is a collection of 88 separate incorporated cities packed between the Pacific Ocean and Orange and San Bernardino counties Many of these towns have their own city halls police forces and fire brigades The result is that L A is a place without a geographic heart but with lots of soul If its soul is superficial flighty and playful well this is the entertainment capital of the world Los Angeles encompasses a huge variety of American life within its borders In fact the cultural and economic lifestyles of more than 91 2 million county residents vary so enormously from area to area that visiting Los Angeles is like visiting half a dozen destinations at once You can go casual and carefree with the beach scene blow the bank on a ritzy Beverly Hills shopping excursion retreat to nature on a mountain hike opt for the global by touring the ethnic neighborhoods flee to fantasy at any number of amusement parks or simply entertain yourself with an exploration into the entertainment world and Hollywood exotica Whatever you do you ll experience in your face L A because its eccentricities are abundant wherever you go The one attribute that suffuses everything in Los Angeles is its lively energy Even on your first visit there s no denying the feeling that something somewhere is about to happen It might be catching the eye of your favorite celebrity scurrying into a movie theater watching a production company shoot a scene from the next big blockbuster movie attempting to keep up with the freeway s pedal to the metal drivers or simply scanning the twinkling evening skyline from the heights of the Griffith Observatory In a town where the fast lane is the norm and Hollywood isn t a place but a state of being you can t help feeling part of something exciting and unpredictable Much of this energy can be attributed to the residents themselves Nowhere on earth is there a place that attracts such a diverse population The fertile basin edged by mountains and sea and blessed with year round sunshine attracts all kinds with its ideal combination of urban and beach living Then there s the enormous international community surrounding the entertainment industry You ll also discover L A s large groups of Americans of Chinese African Korean Middle Eastern and Japanese descent Hispanic Americans comprise the largest ethnic group of all with numbers fast approaching 40 percent of the population With so many people packed into such a condensed area Angelenos are constantly struggling to create unique identities for themselves which would be more of a challenge if the town didn t have such an anything goes attitude The results are often amusing if not outrageous and can be seen in everything from clothing styles and choice of car to how Angelenos spend their time and money No matter what they expect to see in Los Angeles visitors invariably discover sites and experiences that surprise amuse shock or excite them And isn t that the reason to come here With the region s size and never ending maze of freeways it s no surprise that the car is king in L A You must join the masses traveling the streets and freeways to get the feel of the place Leave it to Angelenos to make driving an experience in itself Here you are what you drive which explains the number of expensive cars beside you on the road You will also notice that people don t let traffic time stop their productivity many drivers have their cellular phone attached to their ear Finding your way from one place to another is a major part of being here there are attractions scattered from Malibu to Disneyland Fortunately much of what you ll want to see is accessible through your car window because you ll likely be spending a lot of time driving from one site to another The nation s ten busiest freeways are all in the L A vicinity Highway 101 the busiest of all handles over half a million cars every day Strict emission controls for cars and industry have considerably reduced L A s notorious smog but air quality can still be poor To combat highway congestion and pollution L A is now building a much needed light rail network Whatever improvements have been made to the county s transportation system they are not going to make you feel any better when you re stuck in that unavoidable traffic jam The good news however is that freeway exits and visitor sites are well marked and you re bound to discover an unexpected attraction to get you off the road and back to the excitement that is Los Angeles
