 Introduction Asthma is a common condition in general medical practice accounting for about 1 of all ambulatory visits in the USA 1 The mortality rate from asthma has risen sharply since the late 1970s which may reflect increasing disease severity 2 The hospitalization rate another population level marker of asthma severity remains substantial 2 generating nearly one half of all US health care costs for asthma 3 Hospitalization rates for asthma have actually increased in some demographic subgroups such as young adults 2 and the urban poor 4 despite recent therapeutic advances Understanding the factors underlying hospitalization for asthma could help elucidate the recent rise in asthma morbidity Previous studies have identified several factors that contribute to increased hospitalization risk among adults with asthma Demographic characteristics such as poverty low educational attainment female gender and African American race have been associated with a greater risk of hospitalization for asthma 2 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Poor health care access and inadequate preventive asthma care have also been frequently cited as contributing factors 5 12 13 14 15 In these studies however separating the independent effects of demographic characteristics health care access and disease severity has been difficult For instance the association between low income or non white race and greater asthma hospitalization risk is potentially confounded by inadequate health care access Because many studies rely on ecologic socioeconomic and hospitalization data individual level factors especially asthma severity cannot be adequately examined 4 5 6 7 8 15 16 17 18 Other studies have not yet provided prospective follow up 9 10 19 20 or have not simultaneously considered both demographic and clinical variables 21 22 In this article using a prospective cohort study of adults with asthma we delineate the relative impact of demographic characteristics and asthma severity on subsequent hospitalization for asthma Since study subjects were recruited from a random sample of physician practices they all had access to health care for asthma As a result we could evaluate the effects of gender race income and asthma severity on hospitalization independent of health care access Materials and methods Subject recruitment and retention We used data collected during a prospective longitudinal cohort study of adults with asthma recruited from physician practices in Northern California Details of the study design have been previously reported 23 24 25 26 Each subject underwent a structured computer assisted telephone interview covering demographic characteristics smoking history asthma history symptoms and treatment health status health care utilization for asthma and insurance for asthma care Physicians registered 669 eligible patients After initial data collection at baseline n 601 and 18 month follow up interviews n 539 we later restricted the data set to 371 of the baseline cohort 55 of total registry and 242 of the follow up subjects 65 of restricted baseline cohort We restricted the data set to eliminate all interviews potentially compromised by faulty data collection or documentation by a single survey interviewer 26 27 This restricted data set excluded 24 baseline subjects who were found to be outside the study age range and 206 baseline subjects with inconsistent data during subsequent re interview Of the 371 baseline subjects the present study excludes an additional 129 subjects at 18 month follow up interview who had inconsistent data at later interviews or did not complete follow up leaving 242 follow up interviews 18 month These exclusions had no significant effect on study findings Demographic data for comparison of the baseline cohort n 371 with registered subjects n 669 are not available Compared with subjects who participated in both baseline and follow up interviews n 242 subjects without complete follow up interviews n 129 were younger 36 6 years versus 40 5 years and less likely to have white race ethnicity 62 versus 71 P 0 001 and P 0 10 respectively There were no statistical differences in history of ever smoking 43 of participants in both interviews versus 37 of non participants at follow up female gender 73 versus 66 atopic history 82 versus 83 or severity of asthma scores 11 0 versus 10 6 P 0 15 in all cases Hospitalization for asthma The primary study outcome was self reported hospitalization for asthma during the 18 month prospective follow up period Subjects were asked at 18 month follow up interviews whether they had been hospitalized for asthma during the previous 18 months Although subjects could indicate more than one positive response we analyzed the binary outcome of one or more hospitalization for asthma Risk factor variables All demographic variables were based on baseline subject interview responses Current and prior cigarette smoking history was assessed using questions adapted from the National Health Interview Survey 28 We previously developed and validated a 13 item disease specific severity of asthma score with four subscales frequency of current asthma symptoms daytime or nocturnal use of systemic corticosteroids use of other asthma medications besides systemic corticosteroids and history of hospitalizations and intubations 23 24 25 Possible total scores range from 0 to 28 with higher scores reflecting more severe asthma To examine the relative impact of recent and remote hospitalization on further hospitalization for asthma over longitudinal follow up we removed hospitalization from the established severity score and defined two new variables recent hospitalization during the 12 months prior to baseline interview or remote hospitalization past hospitalization not meeting the previous definition of recent As a result the hospitalization and intubation subscale now reflects only prior history of intubation Several other clinical aspects of asthma were assessed We defined asthma onset as the subject reported age of first asthma symptoms Atopic history was defined by a reported history of allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis Because prior work suggests an unexpectedly high prevalence of aspirin intolerance in persons with near fatal asthma 29 we ascertained any history of aspirin sensitivity at baseline interview Since gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD may exacerbate asthma symptoms 30 we evaluated whether subjects were taking H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors as surrogates for GERD and related conditions We furthermore determined whether subjects possessed a peak flow meter for home usage Generic health status was measured using the Medical Outcomes Study SF 36 questionnaire 31 32 We assessed several indicators of health care access for asthma care including whether subjects had a regular site for asthma care a principal care provider for asthma medical insurance for outpatient asthma care and an annual deduction for outpatient medical care We also identified subjects who appeared to rely on emergency department ED services for urgent asthma care We defined reliance on ED care as one or more self reported ED visits during the interview interval but no urgent outpatient clinic or office visits for asthma either to regular or alternate sources of asthma care Statistical analysis In a previous analysis of pulmonary and allergy specialist care the severity of asthma score was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization at 18 month follow up 25 The current study evaluates other risk factors for asthma related hospitalization taking baseline asthma severity into account Because asthma severity may act on the causal pathway between a risk factor and subsequent hospitalization for asthma we present multivariate models both including and excluding baseline asthma severity and generic health status For example low education could increase the risk of hospitalization either directly through poor self management strategies or indirectly if poorly educated persons have greater asthma severity for other reasons We also delineate the components of asthma severity respiratory symptoms systemic corticosteroid use other asthma medication use past intubations and previous hospitalizations that are most strongly predictive of subsequent hospitalization Interview data were analyzed using SAS 6 12 software SAS Institute Cary NC USA We evaluated the association between baseline characteristics and the risk of hospitalization for asthma during the ensuing 18 month follow up period reported at the 18 month interview We use the data set restricted to 242 subjects with verified baseline and follow up interviews for all analyses Bivariate relationships were examined using logistic regression analysis with separate models for each predictor variable We used multiple logistic regression analysis to elucidate the independent association between each baseline variable and the prospective risk of hospitalization In constructing the multivariate model all predictor variables whose bivariate odds ratio and 95 confidence interval suggested a possible association with hospitalization were entered into the final model All variables deemed important on an a priori basis such as age were also included Results Health care access Reflecting the sampling method employed all subjects identified a regular source of asthma care and a primary medical provider for asthma care at baseline interview The majority of participants 97 also reported having health insurance covering outpatient visits for asthma Approximately one third of subjects indicated having annual insurance deductible for physician visits 31 The majority of subjects continued to report health insurance coverage 96 and ongoing primary asthma care 99 at 18 month follow up Despite apparent access to outpatient medical care a substantial proportion 16 appeared to rely on the ED for urgent asthma care Demographic factors and the risk of hospitalization bivariate analysis Table 1shows that the mean baseline age was 40 5 years and the majority of subjects were female 73 A substantial proportion reported ever smoking cigarettes 43 with fewer indicating current smoking 7 The majority of subjects indicated white non Hispanic race ethnicity 71 Thirty nine subjects 16 reported at least one hospitalization for asthma during the prospective 18 month follow up period Of the baseline characteristics non white race OR 2 1 95 CI 1 1 4 0 and lower income OR 1 3 95 CI 1 1 1 5 were associated with a greater risk of hospitalization for asthma during the 18 month follow up Table 1 Current smokers had an increased likelihood of hospitalization although the confidence interval did not exclude no association Greater educational attainment was related to a lower risk of hospitalization OR 0 8 per year of education 95 CI 0 70 0 96 Clinical risk factors for hospitalization bivariate analysis A greater severity of asthma score excluding its hospitalization component was associated with a higher risk of subsequent hospitalization for asthma OR 4 7 per 5 point score increment 95 CI 2 9 7 7 Table 2 Although remote asthma hospitalization did not appear related to risk of ensuing hospitalization more recent hospitalization was strongly associated with increased risk OR 11 6 95 CI 5 3 25 2 Other clinical variables that may reflect exacerbating factors such as aspirin allergy and use of gastric acid suppression medication were also associated with a greater risk of asthma hospitalization Better baseline generic physical health status SF 36 was associated with a slightly decreased risk of subsequent hospitalization 6 reduction in odds per 1 point score increment 95 CI 3 9 Table 2 Mental health status was furthermore associated with a 4 reduction in the risk of hospitalization per 1 point 95 CI 0 7 Reliance on emergency department care was finally related to a greater risk of hospitalization OR 2 5 95 CI 1 1 5 5 Risk of hospitalization multivariate analysis We examined the independent impact of selected covariates on the prospective risk of hospitalization for asthma using multiple logistic regression analysis Table 3 Of the demographic characteristics non white race was associated with a greater risk of subsequent asthma hospitalization OR 3 1 95 CI 1 1 8 8 after controlling for asthma severity and the other covariates shown Lower household income was also related to a greater risk of hospitalization OR 1 1 per 10 000 decrement although the 95 confidence interval did not exclude no relation to hospitalization 0 9 1 3 Controlling for demographic and other variables greater severity of asthma score OR 3 4 per 5 point increment 95 CI 1 7 6 8 and recent hospitalization for asthma OR 8 3 95 CI 2 1 33 4 were strongly associated with an increased risk of hospitalization Reliance on ED for urgent asthma care was also related to greater risk We examined the relation between race and hospitalization in more detail African American race was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for asthma compared with white non Hispanic persons after controlling for covariates OR 10 2 95 CI 1 8 58 4 Hispanic race ethnicity also appeared related to hospitalization OR 4 0 95 CI 0 9 18 0 There was no apparent relation between Asian race and risk of hospital admission OR 2 0 95 CI 0 4 10 9 To further examine the association between asthma severity and hospitalization we repeated the multivariate analysis dividing the overall severity of asthma score into its four subscales The systemic corticosteroid score OR 1 7 per 5 point score increment 95 CI 1 3 2 3 and recent hospitalization for asthma OR 9 7 95 CI 2 2 43 0 were significantly associated with an increased risk of asthma hospitalization after controlling for covariates There was conversely no statistical relationship between other asthma medications OR 1 1 95 CI 0 8 1 6 or asthma symptom scores OR 1 2 95 CI 0 7 1 9 and the ensuing risk of hospitalization Systemic corticosteroid use and recent asthma hospitalization then appear to drive the relationship between asthma severity and hospitalization for asthma Because asthma severity could act as a causal intermediate between a risk factor and the risk of hospitalization we repeated the multivariate analysis excluding asthma severity and generic health status from the model Table 3 In this analysis low income was more strongly related to a greater risk of hospitalization for asthma OR 1 2 95 CI 1 02 1 4 Use of gastric acid suppression therapy was also associated with increased risk OR 2 2 95 CI 1 0 4 9 Although other point estimates and confidence intervals changed slightly there were no other notable changes compared with the model controlling for asthma severity To examine whether subjects without baseline health insurance coverage 3 were affecting study results we repeated the multivariate analysis excluding these subjects Only one of the 39 subjects hospitalized at follow up had no baseline health insurance There was no meaningful impact on the results in all multivariate analyses For example the estimate for lower income in the model without asthma severity was nearly unchanged OR 1 2 95 CI 1 03 1 4 Discussion Asthma related morbidity and mortality have risen sharply in the USA since the late 1970s 2 Hospitalization for asthma a potentially avoidable outcome is an important population level marker of asthma severity In this prospective study of adults with continued access to medical care for asthma we identified two demographic factors low income and non white race that were associated with a greater risk of hospitalization for asthma Reliance on the emergency department for urgent asthma care was also associated with a greater risk of subsequent hospitalization Greater asthma severity as indicated by recent asthma hospitalization and systemic corticosteroid use was related to an increased likelihood of hospitalization Ecologic studies based on US census data have demonstrated a strong inverse relationship between median household income and hospitalization rates for asthma 4 5 6 15 16 Adults with asthma who live in lower income geographic regions have higher rates of asthma hospitalization even after accounting for race and urbanicity 5 Investigators have also observed a similar association between community income level and mortality from adult asthma 33 34 35 Since these studies lack individual level income data investigators have urged cautious interpretation 6 The present study using individual level data supports the association between lower household income and a greater risk of hospitalization The relationship between lower income and hospitalization is less strong in the model including asthma severity and health status suggesting that greater asthma severity may mediate this association The relationship between low income and asthma hospitalization has many potential explanations including inadequate health care access Low income persons in a population based survey were approximately three times more likely to report difficulty paying for physician bills or prescription drugs than those persons with higher income 36 Among adults hospitalized for asthma at a single institution nearly one third of low income subjects indicated no usual source of outpatient asthma care at 3 month follow up 14 In the present study however nearly all subjects reported health insurance and access to ambulatory care for asthma making this an unlikely explanation Moreover excluding subjects without baseline health insurance coverage had no appreciable affect on the results Beyond health care access the process of asthma care may be less adequate among low income persons Haas et al found that after admission to the hospital for asthma low income patients received lower intensity asthma management than those patients with higher income 14 Another study demonstrated an association between a surrogate marker of low income unemployment and high daily beta agonist use 20 which is an established risk factor for asthma hospitalization 37 In a managed care setting which should ensure health care access low income asthma patients were less likely to visit an asthma specialist 10 Low income may alternatively be a marker for other exacerbating factors such as cockroach antigen exposure 6 38 cigarette smoking secondhand smoke exposure 39 or viral upper respiratory infections African American race has been associated with higher hospitalization rates for asthma in both population based 2 and ecologic studies 4 5 6 7 15 16 Socioeconomic status and health care access however may confound the relationship between race and hospitalization Several small area analyses found higher asthma hospitalizations rates among African Americans after statistically controlling for income 4 5 15 Other analyses have found no effect of race after taking income into account 11 In children with access to health care through Medicaid investigators still observed higher hospitalization rates for African Americans with asthma 13 African American asthma patients similarly had a greater risk of hospitalization for asthma in managed care settings with access to primary care 10 20 Even after taking insurance status into account a national survey found a higher proportion of African Americans reporting difficulty affording medical care than that of whites 36 Our study suggests that the increased risk of hospitalization for asthma among African Americans is not entirely explained by income education or health care access which were controlled by design or analysis We also discovered a suggestion that persons of Hispanic race or ethnicity had a higher risk of hospitalization for asthma compared with white non Hispanic adults Previous studies focusing on Hispanic persons have provided inconsistent findings Studies from New York City and Boston indicate that Hispanic persons are hospitalized more frequently for asthma 4 6 whereas previous data from California have not found an increased risk 5 Other studies have demonstrated a decreased morbidity and mortality from asthma among Hispanic adults 40 41 42 The heterogeneity of persons of Hispanic race or ethnicity may explain these variable results Higher severity of asthma scores were associated with a greater risk of hospitalization for asthma On examining disease specific severity in more detail we found that recent asthma hospitalizations and systemic corticosteroid use accounted for most of this increased risk whereas recent respiratory symptoms and other asthma medication use were not predictive In a recent analysis of adult health maintenance organization members with asthma systemic steroid use and previous hospitalization were also associated with greater risk of hospitalization 21 A study of hospitalized asthma patients similarly found that both factors were related to rehospitalization 43 Neither study however controlled for sociodemographic characteristics such as low income that are associated with hospitalization risk In the present study disease specific severity was associated with a greater risk of hospitalization controlling for other demographic clinical and health care access factors Our findings differ from previous studies that found female gender and current smoking as risk factors for asthma hospitalization 9 39 Female gender has not consistently been related to hospitalization for asthma 44 The lack of association with smoking could be explained by the healthy smoker effect 45 According to this principle persons who develop smoking related respiratory symptoms quit smoking resulting in current smokers who are less susceptible to acute effects of smoking Previous studies evaluating the effect of GERD on asthma morbidity have provided mixed results 46 47 In the present study use of gastric acid suppression therapy a potential surrogate for GERD was associated with a greater risk of asthma hospitalization only in multivariate analysis that did not control for asthma severity This suggests that increased asthma severity may function as a causal intermediate between GERD or related conditions and the increased likelihood of hospitalization for asthma Consistent with this finding Levin et al found that treatment of GERD with omeprazole improved asthma specific quality of life 30 Because adults with asthma treated by specialists usually have more severe asthma than those treated by generalist physicians 25 our study results should be generalized to the overall population of asthmatic persons with caution Although our sampling method attenuates confounding by access to medical care for asthma the results may not fully apply to populations without health care access Also reflecting the sampling from specialty practices study subjects had a higher median household income and educational attainment than the general population Even so low income was a risk factor for asthma hospitalization suggesting that our findings may be more broadly applicable The present study has additional limitations including the reliance on self reported health care utilization Socioeconomic differences in recall or reporting of hospitalization for instance could influence the risk model Although we were able to simultaneously consider demographic clinical and severity related covariates the current study does not fully elucidate the causal intermediates between predictors eg income or race and the risk of hospitalization Finally our use of self reported health insurance status and source of regular asthma care may not fully ascertain other more subtle barriers to effective asthma care Previous work has demonstrated that health insurance status does not fully explain health care related financial problems 36 Transportation difficulties work related demands and regional differences in health care quality may also have impeded access to efficacious asthma care Despite these limitations we believe the present study results may be generalized to persons with moderate to severe asthma Conclusion Although the morbidity and mortality from asthma are increasing in the USA and around the world the minority of adults with asthma will experience hospitalization or death from asthma Targeted interventions could potentially benefit high risk individuals in a cost effective manner Our results suggest that simple demographic and clinical features especially low income non white race previous hospitalization history systemic corticosteroid use and reliance on emergency department for urgent asthma care can identify such high risk patients for more intensive therapy Supplementary material Subject recruitment and retention In brief we recruited a random sample of certified American Board of Medical Specialty pulmonary specialists and allergy immunology specialists The participating physicians maintained a registry of persons aged 18 50 years with outpatient visits for asthma over a prospective 4 week period Each person registered by a participating physician was contacted to arrange a telephone interview Risk factor variables We ascertained household income as a series of increments less than 5000 5001 10 000 10 000 increments up to 50 000 50 001 75 000 and above 75 000 To convert to specific income levels the mid increment value was applied except for the highest category where we used a value of 87 500 The severity of asthma score systemic corticosteroid sub scale includes items for any past corticosteroid use use during the past 12 months and steroid dependency The asthma medication subscale incorporates current use of inhaled corticosteroids inhaled non steroidal anti inflammatory agents inhaled bronchodilators oral beta agonists and theophylline containing medications nasal medications antihistamines decongestants and topical corticosteroids and home nebulizer use In this subscale one point is assigned for each medication used during the past 2 weeks with one additional point for frequent inhaled beta agonist or corticosteroid use We measured generic health status using the Medical Outcomes Study SF 36 questionnaire Previous work demonstrates the SF 36 instrument s validity in adult asthma 31 The physical and mental component summary scores have been defined from the eight SF 36 subscales by factor analysis 32 which measure physical and mental dimensions of health respectively Each summary score in the general US population has a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 Higher scores reflect more favorable health states
