and Ninja Turtles Like Beanie Babies Pok mon exploits kids instinct to collect From baseball cards to dolls to stamps preteens are collectors by nature They are learning to recognize patterns and organize their world Pok mon allows them to indulge this in the most elaborate way The motto of Pok mon is Gotta catch em all You have to get every Pok mon card and play the video games till you capture all 151 Pok mon Ninja Turtles or Power Rangers lacked this collecting aspect This acquisitiveness has turned Pok mon into an economics lesson Kids spend hours bartering cards and figuring out what exactly a particular Pok mon is worth Pok mon marries collecting to pop cultural obsession catering to the interests of preteen boys There are dinosaur snake and dragon Pok mon Several were created by DNA experiments gone awry Some practice martial arts One is made out of computer code don t ask Pok mon softens its violence with sweetness Like Ninja Turtles and Power Rangers Pok mon is

cards the manufacturer is encouraging kids to buy Pok mon cards like lottery tickets Kids buy again and again in hopes of finding that rare holographic Pikachu TV watchdogs complain about the cartoon s violence The TV show it must be said is far less interesting and sophisticated than the games And Pok mon has spawned the usual fundamentalist protests One Colorado preacher made kids in his congregation watch as he torched Pok mon cards and chopped a Pok mon toy with a sword But critics can rest assured that Pok mon won t last The market will saturate Kids will tire of the 151 creatures and even the 100 new ones on the way from Japan Sure as the Backstreet Boys will meet a bad end you can be certain that the Pok mon generation will age out of the game and into sullen teendom The
