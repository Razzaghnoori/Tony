 Is Harry the Savior of English Literature Dear Polly Thanks for the tip about Sylvia Townsend Warner I ll check the library for Kingdoms of Elfin which sounds marvelously creepy And imagine confusing a succubus with a lamia I m so ashamed Five points from Gryffindor I see that the question I lobbed casually in your direction on Monday has bounced back like a bludger or do I mean a quaffle I m still a novice at Quidditch to knock me off my rhetorical broomstick Why Harry why now An obvious answer which we ve gestured toward in various ways this week is just that the books are a lot of fun to read Your analysis of their narrative structure by the way was incisive The sonnet sequence analogy is inspired With each book you become newly aware of the tight structural constraints Rowling is working in and freshly amazed at the dazzling variations she manages Each time for instance I m sure that Snape is the link to Voldemort and each time I m stunned when he turns out to be nothing more than a garden variety classroom sadist And yet I know I ll fall for this trick again and again and that the moment I don t will be the moment his true evil or his unsuspected goodness is revealed I m impressed with how effortlessly Rowling balances the genre requirements of predictability Harry will prevail the school year will end Voldemort will be foiled but only temporarily and surprise But as we know a book s quality and its success are two different things Some of the hype about Harry Potter seems a bit wild You d think reading newspaper stories about these books that they had single handedly rescued literacy in the English speaking world and also bridged the gulf between parents and children Talk about magic Nearly every article I ve seen quotes a parent or teacher saying something to the effect of My kid never showed any interest in reading until Harry Potter came along with the implication that the kid will now trade Pokemon for The Illiad and our civilization will be saved from the forces of darkness The jacket flap of the British edition of Prisoner of Azkaban sports a handwritten letter from an 8 year old begging Rowling to write more books It s a bit much really Adults who have children partake of a great deal of kid culture voluntarily or not and inevitably develop tastes and interests of their own I m as obsessed with Arthur as I used to be with Seinfeld My wife who is a schoolteacher has developed an insatiable appetite for young adult historical fiction quite independent of the professional requirements of keeping up with what her students are reading finding new texts to assign and so forth Part of the fun of having or teaching children is the vicarious reliving of one s own childhood reading the stories aloud that you remember having read to you renting videotapes of the movies that enchanted you or gave you nightmares reconnecting with Ernie and Bert That Rowling s books which are so smart and so bracingly British I think you re right to keep bringing up P L Travers as a reference point she and Rowling both manage to be at once subversive and starchy anarchic and commonsensical have resonated with parents is no surprise She quite cannily sets Harry s adventures in an England whose culture and geography are entirely literary This is not the England of Tony Blair or Princess Di or Martin Amis but the England we remember from other children s books an England somehow perpetually Edwardian notwithstanding certain concessions to modernity like telephones and coeducation In an earlier posting you speculated that our enthusiasm for Harry Potter may arise from our anxiety about technology and it s striking this is something my wife called to my attention after she read the first two books how technologically underdeveloped the muggle world is in these books in particular with respect to information technology No e mail no faxes not really any television or movies And of course the wizard world is a world of artisanal handicraft ancient wisdom and small local businesses Hogwarts pupils don t buy their textbooks from Amazon com or a Barnes Noble superstore but from a quaint old bookshop on Diagon Alley called Flourish and Blotts They don t have e mail they have owls They don t play Nintendo they practice spells They do however collect famous wizard trading cards which move just as all wizard photographs do But curiously wizard photography seems to be exclusively black and white So there is a double nostalgia involved in reading these books nostalgia for one s own childhood and nostalgia for the timeless realm of classic children s fiction Rowling has cleverly and subtly modernized these realms with respect to matters like gender equality and multiculturalism not that she makes a big fuss about such things Of course this being children s book England there s still a servant class But though there s plenty of cruelty corporal punishment has fallen from favor The death penalty seems to be reserved for wayward magical beasts Of course none of this explains why these books have crossed over not only from children to their parents but also to adults who don t have children This seems genuinely unprecedented and it may be one of those inexplicable phenomena the culture likes to toss our way every now and then Our seeker ducks the bludger and sprints for the golden snitch Or it may be a symptom of our present obsession with childhood and children the simultaneous detonation of the postwar baby boom and the fin de si cle baby boom All I know is I haven t had such a purely escapist reading experience in a long time As much fun as it was to read these books it s been even more fun discussing them with you I m quite dazzled by your insight and erudition bewitched in fact All best Tony
