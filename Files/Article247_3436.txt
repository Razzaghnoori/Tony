 America s Fear of Teen agers This is my summer schedule which is basically no schedule at all my daughter who s 15 is away at camp the two of us are rattling around the house with no classes meetings etc to worry about closest thing to nirvana except for places like the McDowell Colony where they give you meals and bring lunch to your studio door On Columbine before I forget I don t in general buy as a sufficient explanation for media obsessions that it s all about ratings and selling papers for two reasons First because you have to ask why huge numbers of people are so interested that they watch the TV shows and buy the papers And second because the money explanation assumes a detached cynicism or a totally mechanical subservience to their bosses interests on the part of the reporters editors producers etc who are responsible for the actual coverage when in fact journalists are caught up in the same fears and fantasies as their audience As I see it Columbine hit more of a cultural chord than the Atlanta murders because Americans are in turmoil about children and teen agers On the one hand everyone s political agenda is rationalized as protecting children whether it s censorship and drug testing or welfare and gun control on the other adults are fearful of young people feel that they re out of control and at the same time guilty about the many ways kids are being shortchanged in this enormously pressured work obsessed and uptight environment Speaking of drug testing according to today s Times the ACLU has taken on the case of high school kids in a small rural town in Oklahoma who are forced to take urine tests if they want to participate in extracurricular activities or take the classes that are in some cases connected with these activities Aside from the travesty against the Fourth Amendment this is just another example of the paranoia and contempt aimed at teen agers Treat them all like presumptive criminals who deserve no autonomy and respect and then wonder why some actually fulfill your expectations On the hate crime issue it s true you can t execute someone twice but most such crimes are assault or rape or lesser degrees of homicide not capital crimes For the record I m basically against the death penalty on the grounds that its application is discriminatory mistaken executions of innocent people are inevitable keeping people on death row for years during the appeal process amounts to cruel and unusual punishment yet limiting appeals is even worse there s no evidence that executions have any practical deterrent effect and emotional catharsis is not a good enough reason for the state to kill people But I m not an absolutist on the subject For instance there s a legitimate question to be raised about what you do about someone who s already serving life without parole who kills an inmate or guard how to deter a murderer who shoots the cop trying to arrest him figuring he has nothing to lose and other such situations And then there s the issue of whether politically motivated mass murder like the Oklahoma City bombing should be in a special category Which leads back to the issue of why we ought to create a special category for what I m calling intimidation or political terrorism because these crimes are more deleterious to the social fabric than ordinary crimes I disagree with you about Matthew Shepard I believe it was a lynching Those guys were out to teach him and by extension all gay men a lesson This is already too long so later for Maureen Dowd What do you think of the Village Voice redesign And what s the NYPress in house culture like
