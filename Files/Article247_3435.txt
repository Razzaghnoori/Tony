 Oldies but Goodies Dear Chris Yes I loved the anecdote about Bob Dylan s mishearing I can t hide as I get high And you re right about how easy it is to get caught up in the sound and supply your own meanings Rock can be almost pure Keatsian negative capability For weeks in 1985 I thought the big Tears for Fears song was Everybody Wants To Live Alone And for a good two decades until about six months ago in fact I listened to one of my favorite Tom Waits songs I Wish I Was in New Orleans In the Ninth Ward thinking the Ninth Ward was a wing of Bellevue rather than a neighborhood in New Orleans All this time I knew what the Ninth Ward was and the song is about New Orleans But my Will to Narrative as Nietzsche might have called it was stronger than my ear My favorite such story often told in the drug dimmed dorm rooms of my youth was that Ralf Hutter of Kraftwerk wrote Wir fahren fahren fahren auf der Autobahn after mishearing the Beach Boys Fun Fun Fun as She ll have fahren fahren fahren till her daddy takes her T Bird away I have always assumed it to be totally apocryphal On the other hand it makes perfect sense The Dylan anecdote reminds me that the book is chock a block with excellent tidbits some familiar most not and it would be unfair to let the week pass without sharing a few favorites Carl Perkins wrote Blue Suede Shoes never having seen the word suede in print Blue Swaed Shoes he called it Listen to the mere stage names of the overproduced Liverpudlian rock studs who preceded the Beatles Tommy Steele Marty Wilde Billy Fury Rory Storm Dick Clark had no particular interest in the rock he was promoting or in music whatsoever When shortly before appearing on Edward R Murrow s Person to Person he was told that Murrow would want to ask about a record collection he had to borrow one He didn t have a record collection I m still trying to figure out what Miller means when he talks about rock as a force for nostalgia I m convinced that this is largely a personal project There s much in the elegiac tone of this book that reminds me of Philip Larkin s collection All What Jazz Larkin to whom jazz meant everything you could hear in war depleted Oxford basically Kid Ory and Bix Beiderbecke and King Oliver was turned loose as contemporary jazz critic for the Daily Telegraph a quarter century later having not listened to any jazz in the interim He heard a lot of Mingus and Coltrane and Monk and threw up his hands as if to say What s this crap While Miller can t write like Larkin his nostalgia project is a more responsible one He gives us a history of the term oldies but goodies and mentions In the Still of the Night scarcely noticed when it came out in 1956 but by 1959 a staple of the oldies circuit In my own life I remember Al Green as a serious but secondary musician in the mid 1970s if the air time on oldies stations is any indication of his ultimate stature he s one of the giants Similarly I remember that on the Pretenders debut album Talk of the Town and Stop Your Sobbing got the most play but only on alternative stations The album didn t have any hits Today no matter what town you re listening to the Classic Rock station in it s Brass in Pocket maybe the edgiest least mainstream thing on the whole album that gets all the airplay Ahem after writing that sentence I looked in a rock reference book and found that Brass in Pocket hit No 14 stateside But I think I ll leave it as evidence that it s my memory that s failing Perhaps rock history is like retrospective politics If you poll people on how they voted in 1960 80 percent say they backed Kennedy even though Nixon got 50 percent of the vote And if you ask people what they were listening to in the mid to late 60s they ll tell you Oh you know a lot of Velvet Underground a lot of Hendrix But I don t believe it Best Chris
