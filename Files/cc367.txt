 Introduction Postoperative morbidity and mortality after hepatobiliary operations especially in cancer patients has traditionally been perceived as being high Prior reports however have failed to identify a predominant class of complications such that interventions could be undertaken that might be able to reduce the incidence of these complications Prior reports have focused on subgroups of operations within the family of all hepatobiliary procedures such as hepatic resection 1 2 3 4 5 proximal bile duct resection 6 7 pancreatic resection 8 9 and biliary enteric bypass 10 There are no prior reports on the utilization and outcomes of critical care services required in the management of all patients who experience complications after hepatobiliary surgery at a single institution This paper reviews the complications leading to the utilization of critical care services after all hepatobiliary procedures performed over a 23 month period by a team of specialized surgeons nurses anesthesiologists and internists who comprise the Hepatobiliary Disease Management Team of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Materials and methods Statistical analysis Results are expressed as the mean standard deviation median range or as the number and percentage of the total number of patients forcategoric variables One way analysis of variance was used for comparison ofall continuous variables Pearson s 2analysis orFisher s exact test when appropriate were used for univariatecomparisons for all categoric variables analyzed When multiple categoricvariables were determined to be statistically significant by univariateanalysis they were then entered into a logistic regression model formultivariate analysis to determine independent predictors of outcome Thesoftware program SPSS for Windows version 8 0 SPSS Incorporated Chicago Illinois USA was utilized for all statistical analyses P 0 05 was considered statistically significant Results Study population Between February 2 1994 and December 28 1995 1048 patients wereadmitted to the Hepatobiliary Surgical Service admitting physicians LHB andYF at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Of these 32 out of 537 patients 6 0

and upper gastrointestinal bleeding n 1 Tenpatients required readmission to the SCU after being transferred to floor care five because of upper gastrointestinal bleeding five because of respiratoryfailures four patients required a third SCU admission all because ofrespiratory failures and two patients requiring a fourth SCU admission bothbecause of intra abdominal abscesses sepsis A comprehensive list of allpostoperative complications seen is shown in Table 3 High and low postoperative laboratory values Mean high and low postoperative laboratory values of the 32 patientsadmitted to the SCU in the postoperative period and the mean days on which theyoccurred were as follows lowest albumin value 2 1 0 4 g dl on day 13 25 days highest prothrombin time 16 7 3 0s on day 13 28days

Postoperative mortality The overall postoperative mortality of all patients operated on bythe Hepatobiliary Surgical Service was 3 2 17 out of 537 patients Twelve ofthe 32 patients 37 5 admitted to the SCU during their postoperative coursedied compared with five out of 505 1 0 patients never admitted to the SCUduring their postoperative course P 0 001 Neither thepreoperative diagnosis Table 1 nor the operationperformed Table 2 appear to be associated with an increased risk of SCUdeath At the time of death eight out of the 12 patients 67 had respiratoryfailure five patients 42 had hepatic failure and three patients 25 hadacute renal failure Additionally five out of the 12 patients 42 wereseptic two patients 17 had persistent coagulopathy and ongoing uppergastrointestinal bleeding and two patients 17 died of acute cardiopulmonaryarrest of undetermined etiology Overall three out of the 12 patients 25 had multiple organ system failure Mean total postoperative duration of stay in the SCU wassignificantly longer P 0 035 for nonsurvivors 20 0 23 8days than for survivors 6 2 10 2 days Univariate analysisdemonstrated that mortality was significantly increased for patients who hadmedian total postoperative duration of stay in the SCU that was greater thanthe overall median duration of stay of 4 5 days P 0 009 and forpatients who had more than two SCU admissions during their hospitalization P 0 014 However multivariate analysis of these variablessuggested that only a median total postoperative duration of stay in the SCU ofgreater than the median total duration of stay of 4 5 days was an independentpredictor of postoperative mortality P 0 041 Postoperativemortality did not depend on the total postoperative duration of stay or on thenumber of times a patient was taken to the operating room Preoperative and intraoperative variables were analyzed Table 4as potential predictors of postoperative mortalityamong patients admitted to the SCU A history of viral hepatitis P 0 044 was determined to be significantly associated withpostoperative mortality among patients admitted to the SCU by univariateanalysis By univariate analysis the association of history ofcirrhosis portal hypertension with postoperative mortality was determined toapproach statistical significance P 0 053 among patients admitted tothe SCU Multivariate analysis of those two variables revealed that neither ahistory of viral hepatitis and a history of cirrhosis portal hypertension wasan independent predictor of postoperative mortality among patients admitted tothe SCU Preoperative and postoperative laboratory values mean standard deviation in survivors n 20 and non survivors n 12 were analyzed as potential predictors of postoperative mortality amongpatients admitted to the SCU Table 5 In nonsurvivorspreoperative prothrombin time was significantly higher preoperative albuminwas nearly significantly lower P 0 056 postoperative prothrombintime was significantly higher P 0 021 postoperative albumin levelswere nearly significantly lower P 0 055 and postoperative whiteblood cell count was significantly higher P 0 020 Postoperative variables were analyzed as potential predictors ofpostoperative mortality among patients admitted to the SCU Table 6 By univariate analysis a patient with postoperativepneumonia P 0 002 hepatic failure P 0 004 orrespiratory failure P 0 009 was statistically more likely to diethan patients with other complications However multivariate analysis of thesethree postoperative complications failed to disclose any independent predictorof postoperative mortality Discussion There is relatively incomplete information available within the literature as to the causes and outcomes of utilization of critical care services for patients undergoing hepatobiliary surgery In the present paper we have reviewed the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center experience during the period of February 2 1994 to December 28 1995 Firstly this study was initiated to help to determine the causes of major morbidity and mortality after hepatobiliary surgery such that we might alter our patient care in order to avoid similar complications in the future Secondly this study was initiated to help to evaluate possible predictors of survival once a major complication had arisen such that guidance could be given to clinicians caring for such patients in determining the likelihood of ultimate survival of such events Over a 23 month period 6 0 of patients operated upon by the Hepatobiliary Surgical Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center required critical care services Information on similar critical care services utilized by comparable hepatobiliary services at other institutions is not available in the surgical literature however this appears to be an appropriate level of care because the mortality of patients treated postoperatively with floor care alone was only 1 five out of 505 patients The fact that the mortality of hepatobiliary patients once admitted to the SCU was 37 5 12 out of 32 patients may be taken to suggest that patients might have been kept for inappropriately long periods on floor care before being admitted to a critical care setting or that the problems that arose were poorly treated in the critical care setting or that the problems that arose were beyond the ability of critical care medicine to salvage The latter explanation seems to be the most probable The causes for admission to a critical care setting were varied Three findings from the present results appear to be worth further discussing however First more than 50 of the patients requiring a SCU admission suffered respiratory failure It is possible that instituting an improved preoperative evaluation of pulmonary function as well as instituting a pulmonary rehabilitation program might help to reduce this excessive rate of respiratory failure Second the intraoperative blood loss among patients requiring a SCU admission was approximately 2000cm 3and the intraoperative blood transfusion requirement among patients requiring a SCU admission was 3 4 units of packed red blood cells Both of these values are well above the median values of 645 cm 3of intraoperative blood loss and less than one unit of packed red blood cells for intraoperative blood transfusion recorded for 496 patients undergoing hepatic resection at our own institution 11 Third 10 out of 32 patients requiring a SCU admission underwent preoperative biliary drainage procedures which is above the rate for all patients undergoing hepatobiliary surgery Our own institutional data have shown that previously drained patients with tumors causing proximal or distal obstruction of the biliary tree who undergo surgical resection or surgical bypass suffer increased intraoperative blood loss 12 as well as increased postoperative infectious complications 13 14 15 16 Those organisms responsible for the postoperative infectious complications were the same as those organisms isolated from intraoperative bile cultures 14 16 17 18 This suggests that the potential benefit of preoperative drainage of the biliary tree before surgical resection is questionable and needs to be evaluated further On univariate analysis we found an association of a history of viral hepatitis with postoperative mortality P 0 044 and a near association of a history of cirrhosis with or without portal hypertension with postoperative mortality P 0 053 These findings confirm the prior reports of Bozzetti et al 1 and Lehnert and Herfarth 19 Likewise we found that preoperative prothrombin time was significantly P 0 025 higher in the nonsurviving patients versus the surviving patients who required postoperative critical care utilization and preoperative albumin was nearly significantly P 0 056 lower in the nonsurviving patients versus the surviving patients who required postoperative critical care utilization These findings confirm the prior reports of Nagino et al 6 Su et al 7 and Lehnert and Herfarth 19 Although these associations were not independent predictors of postoperative mortality on multivariate analysis these associations suggest the importance of hepatic function and hepatic reserve in pre operative patient selection for hepatobiliary surgery as has been previously established by the Child Turcotte Pugh grading system for severity of liver disease 20 21 None of the thirty two patients requiring postoperative SCU admission had ascites or were encephalopathic preoperatively Therefore preoperative prothrombin time and preoperative albumin as well as a history of viral hepatitis and or a history of cirrhosis with or without portal hypertension may be taken to indicate a need for heightened alertness to the possibility of the need for critical care services after significant hepatobiliary surgery Once admitted to the critical care unit postoperative mortality increased with increasing duration of stay with patients whose SCU stays exceeded 4 5 days doing significantly worse Beyond this association of survival and duration of SCU stay we were unable to establish any distinct individual markers to help determine the appropriateness of continuing aggressive care of critically ill patients However if markers could be identified then the determination of the time at which aggressive critical care becomes futile could be established This would ultimately better assist the critical care staff in advising the patient or proxy as to when survival is unlikely and all subsequent decisions about pursuing further aggressive interventions could be made with this in mind
