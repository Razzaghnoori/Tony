                            Acquired resistance to chemotherapy is a major obstacle to successful cancer treatment        Understanding the mechanisms by which tumors become resistant to a particular agent is key        to identifying new drugs or combination regimens        Kinases are signaling molecules that control many aspects of cell behavior including        cell proliferation ie whether and how fast cells divide Abnormally active kinases        promoting tumor growth are found in many cancers and are a focus of rational cancer drug        design One target for kinase inhibitors is the epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR        Two EGFR inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib showed therapeutic benefits in a subset of        patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer Recent work has helped us understand why some        patients respond and some dont responsive tumors usually harbor activating mutations in        the EGFR gene which somehow make the tumors sensitive to treatment Nearly all patients        whose tumors initially respond to EGFR inhibitors however eventually become resistant to        the drugs and progress despite continued therapy        William Pao and colleagues examined tumors from six patients with nonsmall cell lung        cancer who initially responded to gefitinib or erlotinib but subsequently relapsed Tumors        from all six patients carried activating mutations in the EGFR gene In addition in three        out of the six cases the resistant tumor cells carried an identical second mutation in the        EGFR gene Whereas the activating mutation was present in tumor cells before treatment with        erlotinib or gefitinib the second mutation was not found in pretreatment biopsies from        these patients nor in over  lung cancer samples from patients who had not been treated        with either drug Additional cell culture studies supported the notion that the secondary        mutation causes resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib It is clear though that this is        only one mechanism of resistance because in the three other cases resistance occurred in        the absence of the second mutation What caused the resistance in those tumors is not        known        All kinases share some common features and a resistance mutation very similar to the        one identified here has also been found in other kinase genes from tumors with acquired        resistance to imatinib another kinase inhibitor As Gary Gilliland and colleagues point        out in an accompanying Perspective DOI journalpmed the initial        identification three years ago of resistance mutations against imatinib led to the rapid        development of alternative kinase inhibitors that work even against tumors with the        resistance mutation Similarly the results by Pao and colleagues should help researchers        develop second generation drugs for lung cancer
