big man And he s like talking all fast he s on a cell phone Uh huh AF I need you to do something for me Um You need to call Ramona at Concord mind you she s at an office actually she s in a client all the way across town we re in Monroe she s in Concord You need to call Ramona She can help you she s done this for me before There s some cash flow projections on my desk and um uh it s for such and such Cutty that s the client s name He s buying a new business and it s four million in inventory and 12 million in fixed assets and so they can have 12 million in debt and four million in equity and mind you I m writing this down He s like just spitting everything out And um so I m writing all this down and he s like Ramona did such and such at the office she did this for me she did the same thing for me she can tell you what you know she can help you out whatever Hang up the phone with him I ll call you back in about an hour he says Hang up with him and I m like Aw damn all that information you know and I don t know if I remembered everything I tried to jot everything down So then I look up I find out where Ramona s at and I call her over there She s like Well I did that for him like at least two years ago And I m like Damn great She s like But you need to look here look here she s gives me like three different places to look in the computer Uh huh And um it s different like under each client is all their files Like whatever we ve done for them it s in there So I have to go she gave me like three or four clients to look up and then under each one of those I have to like open up all like the Excel spreadsheets and I don t even know what I m looking for I m just trying to have an idea of what it kind of looks like So it took me like an hour to two hours just to find what I needed Then I get it and I m like great What do I do with it It s like one file with a whole bunch of tabs of different you know each tab has like a different spreadsheet on it What s up Angelina We re talking about my Recording me Yeah it s recording So finally I get the thing and it has like eight different parts to it and I m just there trying to figure how the thing goes together how one number flows to another sheet and how that goes you know Everything is linked and gosh I don t even know how long I was just there just trying to figure it out Then I was spinning my wheel for about I don t know it seemed like all day that day It wasn t till like 11 30 or 12 00 that I actually got to start on the on the project And I um I didn t know how much detail he wanted I didn t know you know when he needed it by He acted like he needed it soon but the way she had everything done I would have had to I would have had to start from the very beginning and most of it was just like data entry to start off with And then once you get everything entered you can go on from there Well the rest of the day I was just entering entering entering entering information It wasn t until like before 5 00 that I had finished entering something and I was able to look and see OK where do I go from here now that I have this done where do these totals go to on another sheet So I m like OK he hasn t called back or anything so I m figuring I can do it on Monday Well I get there this morning and um I forget how I think either I asked a question and he came in there or whatever Anyhow he tells me Well I need it by today because such and such is coming coming in and we need to take it to the bank And I m like Oh I m like I know how far I ve gotten So anyhow I call Ramona back because I had a question about I was like All right let me hurry up on with it and I had a question about something I was doing Well she tells me she s like That doesn t sound right She was like um you know because the company she gave me was different from the company that I had there were little things different slight different things with it like one didn t have the same kind of inventory as the other one Little things like that made a big difference in what I was trying to do So she s like Well look look up this in such and such company And I did Now what does that look like And how about it looks like exactly what I m trying to do It s like more simplified like the one that she had given me was all detailed and complicated and the second one is all simple So here I am now I have the thing that I m supposed to have and he wants it today and I wasted all that time on Friday just wasted time because I was doing the wrong thing So now here it is he wants it today I didn t have time to enter in all kinds of whatever So I just had to take the totals and try and figure it like that Well I get to a certain point where I m like confused I don t have enough information So I go in there and I haven t even told him yet that I had to start from the very beginning because I was like I didn t want to tell him So and let me tell you I got to the point today where I was about to quit I was like That s it I m getting up I m leaving because when he had come in it was like he was short with me and I m asking him a question and he s not answering it and he s his final thing was Well I need it by such and such meeting so just telling me I don t give a damn that you re having trouble I don t care how you get it done he just wants it Well there s nobody there to help me The girl that can help me is all the way across town So with that I was I was frustrated I was spinning my wheels trying to figure out how I can make it work If there was anything I could do Lana came over and sat with me for a little bit but she didn t know what to do and um you just get to the point where you know you re like you know you re slamming things down and you re just I was pissed I was really upset and um got to the point where I just wanted to cry and but I didn t want to get that upset because you know if anybody came in there or I knew I had to tell him that I would I might not be able to finish it today or you know I have to start from the beginning but then again I didn t know how much detail I still didn t know how much detail you know I talked to him early in the day it s like you talk to him and it s like he completely avoided my questions So anyhow I think I spoke to Ramona again No it was just that one time in the morning and she said that she was going to come back to the office Well I wasn t even thinking about that but I was so frustrated and I ended up talking to him again Again he didn t answer my question but at least I got a little bit out of him He told me what exactly he needed and that he did need it by today He didn t say a time again so he just got me over there stressing out and I really don t even know when it s needed But I was like forget it I m going to eat lunch I was hungry Usually you feel like you have to work through like you just have to keep working because he needs it even though it wasn t your fault that he gave it to you at the very last minute you know I was like and then Lana calls me in the kitchen telling me Ramona had gotten here and I didn t even know she was coming for sure This time I wasn t even happy that she was there because I was so stressed out I was like OK well that s good you know like that Well anyway I went back to my my desk I ate real quick as fast as I could and then she came in there and she ended up helping me with it It was like a little bit close to five when she came in there and um I had two companies that I had to do the same thing for so once I was finished with the whole first company then I had to do the second one and it was like 5 00 and he hadn t asked for it or anything so um I e mailed him because he s always on the phone And I asked him you know could I do it um Do you need me to stay and do it tonight or I could have it done by lunchtime tomorrow if that s OK Well what happens the client walks through the door that needs it So I m like Oh my gosh and Ramona was standing there She was still in there I didn t ask him till after she left but anyhow um um she told me that he had come in she basically um no that was after Anyhow the man comes in She had gone already and she told me just don t worry about it She s like Don t worry about it you know just take your time Whatever Yeah well the guy s here He e mails me back Bruce is here I need it now And I only had one of them done and I just kept on doing what I was doing because I heard them talking or whatever and I kept on doing what I was doing I don t know how he did it but he basically told him that he didn t have it right now or whatever And then I heard him leave so I m still finishing what I had to do And here I am thinking he s going come in there and be like you know just have it out with me you know just tell me off like how could I not have this done Even though I don t see how he could have expected me to have it done I already told him I tried to explain to him that I was frustrated I didn t have all the information I needed But he didn t care I spoke to him twice that day and it was like So anyway um he ended up coming in there and he was like How s it coming along And I was like I m almost done He was like All right well I m going go out and run some errands and um just put it up on my shelf and um if I have any review notes I ll give them to you in the morning And I was like OK and that was it So all that stressing and I mean I had every reason to stress today it was like you re giving something you don t know how to do and it s like here do it I don t care how you do it I don t care how you get it done I don t care if you don t know anything about it And it makes you feel just awful Anyhow so I finished came home at 6 30 today and that was my day That was my messed up Boss he was like with split personality man One minute he s banging on the desk the next he s OK have it on my desk dah dah dah dah dah That s my story I didn t talk long Is it like that all the time Yep whenever he there um which he s not there he s there most of the time but he is gone a lot but whenever he is there and especially if he gives you something to do it s like you don t even want it because you know it s going to be that way and it s like other people hesitate to come through because they don t want to have said something wrong and then you go back to him well like you know such and such helped me and it s not like you re ratting anybody out you re just saying you know such and such helped me and that s how I got to this number but it s like people are hesitating basically and it s really frustrating So what is it that they wanted you to do We were doing um we were doing today it was um projections it was financial statement like balance sheet and income statement projections for a company that um this guy was looking to buy well he gave us the information that he had projected numbers for 2002 2003 and we had to put those numbers into financial statements basically saying they are going to have this much um this many assets and liabilities at the end of 2002 going to have 2003 and then going to have so much income and you know like that
