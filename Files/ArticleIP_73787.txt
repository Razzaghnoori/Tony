 Bill Bradley s SAT Scores The papers of the late Kingman Brewster Jr who was president of Yale in the 60s and 70s include a letter from one E Alden Dunham III a former director of admissions at Princeton Dunham argued that Ivy League universities were overemphasizing the importance of SAT scores For example Dunham wrote consider a recent Princeton graduate named Bill Bradley Here is a guy who graduated Magna Cum Laude in history the greatest basketball player in the Ivy Colleges Rhodes Scholar probably a governor of Missouri someday and all with a 485 verbal SAT Bill Bradley the thinking presidential candidate scored a 485 verbal on his SAT That s lower than George W Bush the allegedly slow witted presidential candidate As reported recently in The New Yorker Bush got an SAT verbal score of 566 So what conclusions should we draw The important conclusions aren t about whether Bradley is really smart or Bush is really dumb They re about ways in which these two are actually similar Above all both of them are beneficiaries of affirmative action A 566 verbal would not have gotten you into the Yale Class of 1968 especially with mediocre prep school grades if you weren t also the son and grandson for good measure of a Yale alumnus Likewise a 485 verbal wouldn t get you into the Princeton Class of 1965 if you weren t also a star basketball player By the time Bradley applied to college in the early 60s selective schools such as Princeton and Yale viewed themselves as intellectual training grounds not the clubby enclaves of previous times In this new era a score below 500 on either the verbal or math section of the SAT normally meant rejection A 1960 New Yorker article described the case of an African American applicant to Yale who was valedictorian and president of his high school class and a stellar athlete to boot His application was rejected because his 488 SAT average would certainly be the lowest in the entire Yale class But the cutoff point was more flexible for top athletes for alumni legacies and starting in the late 60s for blacks and other minorities This leads to the following non multiple choice question for Bradley and Bush If you got into an Ivy League college for reasons other than qualifications narrowly defined as grades and test scores what is so terrible about bending the same rules on behalf of African Americans Bradley would probably have an easier time with this question than Bush because as a Democrat he is not required to believe that reverse discrimination is necessarily a terrible thing and because athletic talent can plausibly be seen as a legitimate aspect of merit while choosing a father who went to Yale cannot But both examples undercut the argument against affirmative action The examples of Bradley and Bush also illustrate the fallacy of taking the SAT as a measure of intelligence or much of anything else let alone of qualification to be president of the United States This is not because Bradley scored worse than Bush but because both have led successful lives and are patently better qualified for the presidency than many citizens with higher scores Of course any analysis of individual SAT results must be taken with a grain of salt Bradley and Bush sat for the test in the days before score raising courses like Kaplan and Princeton Review The SAT has been recentered in recent years boosting overall scores by up to a hundred points Bradley knowing he would be offered athletic scholarships at dozens of non Ivy schools may not have taken the test seriously And in any case Bush and Bradley actually scored quite respectably when considered apart from the lofty standards of Ivy Leaguers Both were probably in the top third of all test takers and would have been in the top quarter at least if the SAT had been administered to all high school seniors All the SAT even purports to measure is likely first year college grades Indeed the test admirably predicted the freshman year academic difficulties of both Bradley and Bush While Bush remained mired in a Gentleman s C groove for the duration of his undergraduate years Bradley was able to pull himself out of his first year struggles by dint of hard effort and went on to an honors degree and a Rhodes scholarship Judging from their undergraduate careers alone you might well argue that the examples of Bill Bradley and George W Bush illustrate a subtler point about affirmative action than mere thumbs up or thumbs down That is affirmative action is more likely to succeed when it takes into account personal qualities like drive and motivation which may not be captured on the SAT Affirmative action is likely to fail when it is merely a special preference bestowed upon those who have the right parents whether right means educational pedigree or skin color Even four decades later Bradley s appeal as a presidential candidate contrary to some of his own campaign slogans is not that he was ever the epitome of effortless cerebral and athletic superiority but that he has made the most of his talents No test whether it takes the form of the SAT or a pop quiz on foreign affairs is conclusive proof of a person s potential Scores alone cannot be the sole basis for making decisions about college admissions hiring decisions or presidential elections Affirmative action even for athletes and preppies sometimes has a place in this land of second chances where anyone can grow up to be president Bill Bradley and George W Bush ought to know
