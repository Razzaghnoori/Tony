 I Gingrich By Jacob Weisberg And you think you re busy Consider the plight of the poor speaker of the House Item No 1 on his list of things to do for June 30 1993 was to articulate the vision of civilizing humanity and recivilizing all Americans That task completed he intended to define plan and begin to organize the movement for civilization and the effort to transform the welfare state into an opportunity society to help people achieve productivity responsibility and safety so they can achieve prosperity and freedom so they can pursue happiness Perhaps anticipating some slight feeling of exhaustion after completing such tasks Gingrich also reminded himself No 6 about diet exercise recreational renewal with Marianne Oh and Newt don t forget to pick up a gallon of milk on your way home This personal agenda is but one of many treasures to be found in a huge paperbound tome with the sexless title In the Matter of Representative Newt Gingrich Exhibits to Draft Report of the Select Committee on Ethics Published as an evidentiary annex to the much shorter and duller House Ethics Committee report itself the volume contains notes memos doodles cancelled checks and other Newt ephemera from 1990 to 1994 Many pages are reproduced in Gingrich s own open this parcel at your own risk don t mind the protruding wires scrawl And though it came with a bill to the author for 300 000 instead of a 4 5 million advance In the Matter is a book that unlike To Renew America captures the essence of what the Chinese might call Newt Gingrich Thought In the spirit of recreational renewal then let us delve There is some tough sledding before you get to the fun part In working out plans for his various front groups and fronts within fronts Gingrich speaks in a language consisting almost exclusively of acronyms COS PFF GOPAC ALOF AOW ACT RAC and CONET among others and abstract nouns opportunity responsibility civilization vision organization analysis dissemination etc These nouns are often grouped in motivational quadruplets Gingrich never asks anyone to listen he admonishes them to Listen Learn Help and Lead He organizes his activities according to Visions Strategies Projects and Tactics At another point he suggests that Republicans consider the application of Wedges Magnets Shields and Turf Failing that he recommends Message Mechanism Method and Team Building to advance the goals of Freedom Self Government Safety and Prosperity In his heart the speaker is a modules man In developing the course materials for his college course Renewing American Civilization he suggests the need for a Core Doctrine Module He does not wish to neglect however The Flying Upside Down Module meaning not explained the We Are a Majority Module or the Quality Module Modules are not to be confused with models such as the Tory Franchise Model a plan for conservatives to capture marginal districts Nor are they synonymous with paradigms as in the Vision Implementation Paradigm described in Exhibit 98 As he flies around like George Jetson in his upside down module Gingrich is ever counting He offers two reasons why we must replace the welfare state three steps toward success Four Great Truths of our Generation five Pillars of Freedom and Progress seven aspects of committing ourselves to real change nine zones of invention and creativity 10 steps toward Renewing American Civilization 13 Renewing America Strategies 14 steps to replacing the welfare state with an opportunity society and 17 key factors in a House victory These are easier to remember if you sing them On the fifth day of Gingrich my true love gave to me five pillars of freedom and progress four great truths of our generation three steps toward success two reasons we must replace the welfare state and a 501 c 3 Newt often resorts to visual aids as well In one sketch of a private cosmology detailed in the speaker s Unabomber style of random capitalization NEWT action is at the center hurling arrows in every direction To the left lie build up preparAtion and attention Focusing On the right FOllOW through diSSEMINATion and consolidAtion then improved EVAluAtion and improved preparation For Future action In another picture perhaps the speaker s most fluid and evocative rendering stick figures representing Newt and Marianne recreate renewingly at the center of their solar system Radiating out are HOUSE and other GOP members NAtionAl Whip technology quality Olympics the rest OF Georgia GOP 6 th District MiliTary Foreign policy Speeches C SPAN Other GOP recreation MiSSion MOVement planning development health Teach write books and something that looks like write eMoos You would be hard pressed to argue that Gingrich wants a positive self image In Exhibit 42 he scribbles out what he sees as his own primary Mission Advocate of civilization definer of civilizAtion Teacher of the rules of civilization arouser of those who Form civilizAtion Organizer of the pro civilization activists leader possibly of the civilizing Forces Only possibly This pang of modesty soon passes Before long Gingrich is writing to his colleagues who are helping to plan his college course Our goal is education and not immediate profit Together we are going to make history as well as teach it In another ransom note style memo he breaks down his list of things to do into two categories 1993 2018 and 2018 onward In the first 25 years he will write a SerIEs oF booKs The history of Freedom prosperity and safety In the second category he will create A body of rules and EXamples that is a doctrine of Freedom self government safety and prosperity Finally there is Newt s deep dada mode I keep reminding my friends we ve entered the decade of the teenage mutant ninja turtle he offers in one speech draft Who are these friends Why do they need constant reminders Have they suggested that he see somebody We are in the business of transforming the United States from a welfare state into an opportunity society the opportunity society is based on the basic principles of 11 he scribbles in another memo Is this a Fermat s Last Theorem type joke There is no 11 In the agenda for a meeting to
