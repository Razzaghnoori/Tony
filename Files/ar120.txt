 Synopsis Introduction In RA large numbers of CD4 memory T cells infiltrate the inflamed synovium 1 2 3 The accumulated CD4 memory T cells in the RA synovium appear to be activated because they express cytokines and activation markers 4 5 6 7 8 Expressed cytokines and activation markers should play important roles in the pathogenesis of RA However the frequency of cytokine expression by RA synovial CD4 T cells has not been analyzed accurately Recently the roles of chemokine and chemokine receptor interactions in T cell migration have been intensively examined Interactions of chemokine and chemokine receptors might therefore be important in the accumulation of the CD4 T cells in the RA synovium Accordingly correlation of cytokine and chemokine receptor expression might be important in delineating the function and potential means of accumulation of individual CD4 memory T cells in the RA synovium In the present study we analyzed cytokine IL 2 IL 4 IL 6 IL 10 IL 13 IFN TNF and LT activation marker CD154 CD40 ligand and TRANCE also called receptor activator of nuclear factor B ligand RANKL or osteoclast differentiation factor ODF and chemokine receptor expression by individual CD4 memory T cells isolated from rheumatoid synovium and blood To achieve this we employed a single cell reverse transcription RT polymerase chain reaction PCR technique This technique made it possible to correlate mRNAs expressed by individual CD4 memory T cells in the synovium and blood Materials and method Synovial tissues from three RA patients and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from two RA patients and a normal donor were analyzed Cytokine IL 2 IL 4 IL 6 IL 10 IL 13 IFN TNF and LT and activation marker CD154 and TRANCE expression by individual CD4 CD45RO T cells from RA synovium or blood were analyzed using a single cell RT PCR In brief single CD4 CD45RO T cells was sorted into each well of a 96 well PCR plate using a flow cytometer cDNA from individual cells was prepared and then the cDNA was nonspecifically amplified The product was then amplified by PCR using gene specific primers to analyze cytokine and activation marker expression Results Cytokine and activation marker expression by individual CD4 CD45RO T cells from RA synovial tissues was analyzed using a single cell RT PCR method Expression of mRNAs was analyzed in 152 individual synovial tissue CD4 CD45RO T cells sorted from three RA patients in which T cell receptor TCR C mRNA was detected Frequencies of CD4 memory T cells expressing cytokine and activation marker mRNA in RA synovium are shown in Table 1 IL 2 IL 4 and IL 6 were not expressed by the synovial tissue CD4 CD45RO T cells whereas 2 20 of cells expressed the other cytokine mRNAs Few correlations between cytokine and activation marker mRNAs were observed Notably no cells contained both IFN and LT mRNAs cytokines that are thought to define the T helper Th 1 phenotype 9 However the frequency of TRANCE positive cells in IL 10 positive cells was significantly higher than that in IL 10 negative cells Table 2 Moreover the frequency of TRANCE positive cells in TNF positive cells was also significantly higher than that in TNF negative cells Varying percentages of CD4 memory T cells expressed CC and CXC chemokine receptors The frequency of CCR5 positive cells in IFN positive cells was significantly higher than that in IFN negative cells whereas the frequency of CCR6 positive cells in LT positive cells was significantly higher than that in LT negative cells and the frequency of CCR7 positive cells in IL 10 positive cells was significantly higher than that in IL 10 negative cells Furthermore the frequency of CXCR4 positive cells in TRANCE positive cells was significantly higher than that in TRANCE negative cells Expression of cytokine and activation marker mRNAs was also analyzed in 48 individual peripheral blood CD4 CD45RO T cells from two RA patients IL 2 IL 4 IL 6 and LT were not expressed by the peripheral CD4 CD45RO T cells whereas 4 17 of cells expressed the other markers The most striking difference between synovial tissue and peripheral blood CD4 memory T cells was the presence of LT expression in the former but not in the latter IFN and TNF were not expressed by normal peripheral blood CD4 memory T cells although they were expressed by RA peripheral blood CD4 memory T cells Discussion The present study employed a single cell PCR technology to analyze cytokine expression by unstimulated RA synovial tissue CD4 memory T cells immediately after isolation without in vitro manipulation The results confirm the Th1 nature of rheumatoid inflammation It is noteworthy that no individual synovial CD4 memory T cells expressed both IFN and LT mRNAs even though these are the prototypic Th1 cytokines 9 These results imply that in the synovium regulation of IFN and LT must vary in individual cells even though both Th1 cytokines can be produced The present data showed that CCR5 expression correlated with IFN but not with LT expression by synovial CD4 memory T cells It has been reported that CCR5 expression is upregulated in RA synovial fluid and synovial tissue T cells 10 11 12 and that CCR5 32 deletion may have an influence on clinical manifestations of RA 13 suggesting that CCR5 might play an important role in RA Recently it has been claimed that CCR5 was preferentially expressed by Th1 cell lines 14 15 However in the present study CCR5 was not expressed by all IFN expressing cells Moreover CCR5 expression did not correlate with expression of LT by RA synovial CD4 memory T cells Therefore it is unclear whether CCR5 is a marker of Th1 cells in RA synovium IL 10 expression correlated with CCR7 expression by RA synovial CD4 memory T cells Recently it was reported 16 that in the blood CCR7 CD4 memory T cells express lymph node homing receptors and lack immediate effector function but efficiently stimulate dendritic cells These cells may play a unique role in the synovium as opposed to in the blood By producing IL 10 they might have an immunoregulatory function In addition IL 10 expression also correlated with expression of TRANCE Although it is possible that IL 10 produced by these cells inhibited T cell activation in the synovium TRANCE expressed by these same cells might function to activate dendritic cells and indirectly stimulate T cells mediating inflammation in the synovium These results imply that individual T cells in the synovium might have different and sometimes opposite functional activities LT expression correlated with CCR6 expression by synovial CD4 memory T cells It has been reported that CCR6 is expressed by resting peripheral memory T cells 17 whereas LT expression is associated with the presence of lymphocytic aggregates in synovial tissue 7 The correlation between the expression of these two markers therefore suggests the possibility that CCR6 may play a role in the development of aggregates of CD4 T cells that are characteristically found in rheumatoid synovium TRANCE is known to be expressed by activated T cells and can stimulate dendritic cells and osteoclasts 18 Of note TRANCE mediated activation of osteoclasts has recently been shown 19 to play an important role in the damage to bone that is found in experimental models of inflammatory arthritis It is therefore of interest that TRANCE was expressed by 3 16 of the RA synovial CD4 memory T cells Of note 67 of TNF positive cells expressed TRANCE In concert TNF and TRANCE expressed by this subset of CD4 memory T cells might make them particularly important in mediating the bony erosions that are characteristic of RA Interestingly there was a correlation between expression of IFN and IL 10 in RA peripheral blood CD4 memory T cells In RA peripheral blood CD154 expression correlated with that of CXCR3 by CD4 memory T cells It has been claimed 15 that CXCR3 is preferentially expressed by in vitro generated Th1 cells However in the present study CXCR3 did not correlate with IFN expression Although IFN and TNF mRNAs were expressed in vivo by peripheral blood CD4 T cells from RA patients LT mRNA was not detected whereas IFN TNF and LT were not detected in samples from healthy donors These findings indicate that RA peripheral blood CD4 memory T cells are stimulated in vivo although they do not express LT mRNA The present studies indicate that the frequencies of CD4 memory T cells that expressed IFN in the blood and in the synovium are comparable These results imply that activated CD4 memory T cells migrate between blood and synovium although the direction of the trafficking is unknown The presence of LT mRNA in synovium but not in blood indicates that CD4 memory cells are further activated in the synovium and that these activated CD4 memory T cells are retained in the synovium until LT mRNA decreases In conclusion CD4 memory T cells are biased toward Th1 cells in RA synovium and peripheral blood In the synovium IFN and LT were produced by individual cells whereas in the rheumatoid blood no LT producing cells were detected Furthermore there were modest correlations between individual cells that expressed particular cytokines such as IL 10 and certain chemokine receptor mRNAs Introduction In RA large numbers of CD4 memory T cells infiltrate the inflamed synovium 1 2 3 The accumulated CD4

correlation of cytokine and chemokine receptor expression might be important in delineating the function and potential means of accumulation of individual CD4 memory T cells in the RA synovium In order to analyze cytokine activation marker and chemokine receptor expression by individual CD4 memory T cells we used a single cell RT PCR technique The method made it possible to analyze cytokine and chemokine receptor expression by individual RA synovial CD4 memory T cells without in vitro stimulation and to correlate cytokine and chemokine receptor expression Using this technique we analyzed cytokine IL 2 IL 4 IL 6 IL 10 IL 13 IFN TNF and LT activation marker CD154 CD40 ligand and TRANCE also called receptor activator of nuclear factor B ligand RANKL or osteoclast differentiation factor ODF and chemokine receptor expression by individual CD4 memory T cells isolated from rheumatoid synovium and blood The results indicate that CD4 memory T cells are biased toward Th1 cells in RA synovium although individual cells produced IFN or LT but not both A similar pattern of cytokine production was observed with CD4 memory T cells from RA blood with the exception that no cells expressing LT were detected There were modest correlations between individual cells that expressed particular cytokine and chemokine receptor mRNAs Materials and method Specimens Synovial tissues were

hypaque gradient centrifugation from two RA patients and a normal donor Single cell sorting and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction The method for construction of cDNA libraries from single cells was similar to previously reported techniques 21 22 RA synovial tissue T cells were analyzed without in vitro culture or stimulation by staining synovium mononuclear cells with FITC

To confirm that the PCR products were amplified from the corresponding genes the nucleotide sequences of the PCR products were analyzed More than five PCR products of each cytokine from a total of two or three donors were sequenced All the sequences of the PCR products were identical to the previously published sequences data not shown To confirm that each well contained only one cell after sorting TCR V mRNA was analyzed by single cell RT PCR using V family specific primers In the wells analyzed only one TCR V was detected data not shown Statistical analyses To analyze correlations between cytokines and chemokine receptor expressions and to compare frequencies of chemokine receptor expressing cells between different T cell subsets Fisher s exact probability test was used Results Cytokine and activation marker expression by individual rheumatoid synovial tissue CD4 memory T cells Cytokine and activation marker expressions by individual CD4 CD45RO T cells from RA synovial tissues were analyzed by employing a single cell RT PCR method Expressions of mRNAs were analyzed in 152 individual synovial tissue CD4 CD45RO T cells sorted from three RA patients in which TCR C mRNA was detected Cytokine and activation marker expressions by 50 synovial tissue CD4 CD45RO T cells RA1 are shown in Fig 1 Frequencies of CD4 memory T cells that expressed cytokine and activation marker mRNA in RA synovium are shown in Table 1 IL 2 IL 4 and IL 6 were not expressed by the synovial tissue CD4 CD45RO T cells whereas 2 20 of cells expressed the other mRNAs Correlation of the expression of cytokines by rheumatoid synovial tissue CD4 memory T cells Few correlations between cytokine and activation marker mRNAs were observed Notably no cells contained mRNAs for both IFN and LT cytokines that are thought to define the Th1 phenotype 9 However the frequency of TRANCE positive cells in IL 10 positive cells was significantly higher than that in IL 10 negative cells Table 2 Moreover the frequency of TRANCE positive cells in TNF positive cells was also significantly higher than that in TNF negative cells Correlation of cytokine and chemokine receptor expression by RA synovial tissue CD4 memory T cells Varying percentages of CD4 memory T cells expressed CC and CXC chemokine receptors as shown in Tables 4and 5 Thus for example 21 of RA synovial CD4 memory T cells expressed CCR5 39 CCRb and 19 CCR7 mRNAs whereas 16 expressed CXCR3 and 76 expressed CXCR4 mRNAs The frequency of CCR5 positive cells in IFN positive cells was significantly higher than that in IFN negative cells Table 4 whereas the frequency of CCR6 positive cells in LT positive cells was significantly higher than that in LT negative cells and the frequency of CCR7 positive cells in IL 10 positive cells was significantly higher than that in IL 10 negative cells Furthermore the frequency of CXCR4 positive cells in TRANCE positive cells was significantly higher than that in TRANCE negative cells Table 5 Cytokine and activation marker expression by peripheral blood CD4 memory T cells from RA patients and a normal donor Expressions of cytokine and activation marker mRNAs was also analyzed in 48 individual peripheral blood CD4 CD45RO T cells sorted from two RA patients and in 33 individual peripheral blood CD4 CD45RO T cells sorted from a normal donor Frequencies of CD4 memory T cells that expressed cytokine and activation marker mRNA are shown in Table 6 IL 2 IL 4 IL 6 and LT were not expressed by the RA peripheral blood CD4 CD45RO T cells whereas 4 17 of cells expressed the other markers The most striking difference between RA synovial tissue and peripheral blood CD4 memory T cells was the presence of LT expression in the former but not in the latter IFN and TNF were not expressed by normal peripheral blood CD4 memory T cells although they were expressed by RA peripheral blood CD4 memory T cells Variable frequencies of RA peripheral CD4 memory T cells expressed chemokine receptor mRNAs Except for significantly decreased expressions of CCR5 and CXCR4 there were no differences between chemokine receptor expressions by synovial tissue and peripheral blood CD4 memory T cells In peripheral blood CD4 memory T cells there was a significant correlation between IFN and IL 10 expressions and IFN and CCR6 expressions P 0 05 Table 7 In addition CD154 and CXCR3 expressions correlated P 0 005 No other correlations were detected data not shown Discussion The present study employed single cell PCR technology to analyze cytokine mRNA expressions by unstimulated RA synovial tissue CD4 memory T cells immediately after isolation without in vitro manipulation The results are consistent with the Th1 nature of rheumatoid inflammation These data showed that 6 22 of RA synovial CD4 memory T cells produced IFN mRNA Previous studies 4 5 6 reported that 1 10 of RA synovial T cells expressed IFN protein by immunohistologic analysis Although there is some variation in the results obtained with the different methodologies both results are consistent with the conclusion that there is a Th1 bias in RA 3 23 It is noteworthy that no individual synovial CD4 memory T cells expressed both IFN and LT mRNA even though these are the prototypic Th1 cytokines 9 These results imply that in the synovium regulation of IFN and LT must vary in individual cells even though both Th1 cytokine mRNAs can be expressed The present data showed that CCR5 expression correlated with IFN but not with LT expression by synovial CD4 memory T cells It has been reported that CCR5

Moreover CCR5 expression did not correlate with expression of LT by RA synovial CD4 memory T cells although it correlated with IFN Therefore it is unclear whether CCR5 is a marker of Th1 cells in RA synovium Of RA synovial CD4 T cells 6 14 expressed IL 10 and the expression correlated with CCR7 expression It has been reported that approximately 1 5 of synovial T cells express IL 10 by immunohistochemistry 5 and that 4 of synovial CD4 T cells have the potential to express IL 10 3 Recently it was reported 16 that in the blood CCR7 CD4 memory T cells express lymph node homing receptors and lack immediate effector function but efficiently stimulate dendritic cells However because 19 of RA tissue CD4 memory T cells expressed CCR7 and there was a correlation between IL 10 production and CCR7 expression these cells may play a unique role in the synovium as opposed to in the blood By producing IL 10 they may exert an immunoregulatory function In addition it is interesting to note that IL 10 expression also correlated with expression of TRANCE Although it is possible that IL 10 produced by these cells inhibited T cell activation in the synovium TRANCE expressed by these same cells might function to activate dendritic cells and indirectly stimulate T cells mediating inflammation in the synovium These results imply that individual T cells in the synovium might have different and sometimes opposite functional activities LT was expressed by 3 12 of the synovial CD4 memory T cells and the expression correlated with CCR6 expression which is expressed by 39 of the synovial CD4 memory T cells However there were no LT expressing CD4 T cells that also produced IFN although synovial CD4 memory T cells that produced each cytokine were found in abundance It has been reported that CCR6 is expressed by resting peripheral memory T cells 17 whereas LT expression is associated with the presence of lymphocytic aggregates in synovial tissue 7 The correlation between the expression of these two markers therefore suggests the possibility that CCR6 might play a role in the development of aggregates of CD4 T cells that are characteristically found

shown 19 to play an important role in the damage to bone found in experimental models of inflammatory arthritis Recently the presence of TRANCE in rheumatoid synovium was reported 24 25 It is therefore of interest that TRANCE was expressed by 3 16 of the RA synovial CD4 memory T cells Of note TRANCE expression correlated with IL 10 TNF and CXCR4 expressions Especially noteworthy was that 67 of TNF positive cells expressed TRANCE In concert TNF and TRANCE expressed by this subset of CD4 memory T cells might make them particularly important in mediating the bony erosions that are characteristic of RA Interestingly there was a correlation between expression of IFN and IL 10 in RA peripheral blood CD4 memory T cells Production of IL 10 in humans differs from that in the mouse in that IL 10 production does not appear to be restricted to Th2 cells 9 As noted here RA peripheral CD4 T cells could express both IFN and IL 10 In RA peripheral blood CD154 expression correlated with CXCR3 by CD4 memory T cells It has been claimed 15 that CXCR3 was preferentially expressed by in vitro generated Th1 cells However in the present study CXCR3 did not correlate with IFN expression Although IFN and TNF mRNAs were expressed in vivo by peripheral blood CD4 T cells from RA patients LT mRNA was not detected whereas IFN TNF and LT were not detected from healthy donors These findings indicate that RA peripheral blood CD4 memory T cells are stimulated in vivo but that they do not express LT mRNA Previous studies have documented the presence of IFN and IL 10 mRNA in circulating T cells of RA patients 26 27 The present studies indicate that the frequency of CD4 memory T cells that express IFN in the blood and synovium is comparable although the percentages that secrete IFN are not known These results imply that activated CD4 memory T cells migrate between blood and synovium although the direction of the trafficking is unknown The presence of LT mRNA in synovium but not in
