 Big Sister Anna Quindlen Culturebox never dreamed when New York Times Op Ed columnist and suburban mom Anna Quindlen abandoned journalism for fiction writing five years ago that it would be nice to have her back But consider the hole she left behind her in the pundit universe The columns of her successor at the Times Maureen Dowd consist of Heathers like pronunciamentos upon the coolness of this politician and the uncoolness of that one each punctuated by a saucy flounce Quindlen s predecessor in the slot at Newsweek she began to fill this week the late Meg Greenfield issued closely argued bulletins from somewhere deep inside a Washington dinner party Quindlen is neither saucy nor one step ahead of the conventional wisdom but her virtues are ones that Culturebox suspects it s unhealthy to do without She s substantive and stern she s loyal to husband and kids she makes peace not war she favors old fashioned horse sense over brilliance To see ourselves as others see us was the line my grandmother would always throw out when she was crabby and I was full of myself is the sort of thing she s wont to declare wisely self deprecatingly and only somewhat preachily Culturebox would count herself lucky to have Anna Quindlen as a big sister though she d probably throttle the girl after a year or two Let s clear up another common misconception while we re at it Big sister ish though she may be Quindlen s is not the voice of feminism in our time It s easy to mistake it for that and her critics generally do making her a springboard for an attack on feminism in general She draws on her own experience thereby making the personal political and was for a long time the only female voice on the white male Times Op Ed page She favors what one critic Karen Lehrman calls motherhood politics she s for stuff that s good for kids and against stuff that s bad for them But feminism is an ideology which is to say a relatively coherent intellectual position a set of arguments attached to a political objective So weighty an agenda demands a consistency Quindlen has not so far evinced Insofar as she s a feminist she s a pop feminist an Oprah or Lifetime feminist a cheerleader for women in all their travails But we read Quindlen if we do for her peppy style and that emerges out of another tradition entirely not the reformist rhetoric of Susan B Anthony and Betty Friedan but the homespun folksy and often surprisingly liberal tones of an earlier era in American journalism when newspaper editorialists and magazine editors and advice columnists elevated the anecdote of daily life to the status of gospel and did more than just about anyone else to invent our 20 th century idea of everydayness In short Quindlen is a sentimentalist which is not an insult in Culturebox s book since to harden one s heart to sentimentalism is to take oneself beyond the reach of much of American culture Some of those whose sensibility Quindlen shares happen be female Ann Landers Dear Abby and Mary Worth the well coiffed well born newspaper comic strip heroine who has been dispensing sage advice to her less well adapted neighbors since 1938 But others are male such as the author and illustrator who create Mary Worth anew every day or George Horace Lorimer an editor of the old magazine the Saturday Evening Post and an aphorist whose nuggets of wisdom sound uncannily Quindlenesque Education is about the only thing lying around loose in the world and it s about the only thing a fellow can have as much of he s willing to haul away is one of his more famous ones Another Quindlen like figure was William Allen White the great turn of the century editor of the Emporia Kansas Gazette who deployed his aw shucks tone to attack heartland know nothingism and populism but whose greatest column is widely acknowledged to be his elegy to his daughter who died after she ran into a low hanging branch while riding a horse Ann Landers and her sister believe in good behavior White believed in the importance of humor dignity and not being provincial what does Quindlen feel strongly about Editorials are supposed to be the literature of opinion but for the key to Quindlen s core beliefs you must turn to her novels These are as morally instructive in their way as the works of another far greater sentimentalist Harriet Beecher Stowe author of Uncle Tom s Cabin Quindlen s first novel Object Lessons is a coming of age story about the perils of letting others tell you what to do in life The homily is provided by who else the heroine s best friend s smart and unusually poised big sister Just remember that sometimes you drift into things and then you can t get out of them the sister advises the novel s protagonist Not to decide is to decide One True Thing the story of a woman who comes home to take care of her dying mother and winds up accused of euthanasia echoes that lesson but ups the ante If you re passive enough to let your parents dump their problems on you they can darn near destroy your life Quindlen s latest novel Black and Blue makes the consequences of letting someone else tell you what to do even more horrifyingly explicit It s the movie of the week type saga of woman on the run from her abusive husband Quindlen s message is clear You have to figure out who you are think for yourself take some responsibility for crying out loud As convictions go it s not the most original around but it s not a terrible one either Quindlen s first column in Newsweek is more of the same This time the den mother persona is underscored by the photograph that accompanies the piece of Quindlen with sensibly cropped hair The editorial is a sigh of disgust at the whole Brooklyn Museum mess It s slightly smarter than most on this subject with more of a sense of history she tosses the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice into the mix But ah yes here comes the grandmotherly language Oh for pity s sake here we go again Here s the liberal common sense I n other news cops are being accused of savagery priests of impropriety and thousands of children are failing in the New York City schools And civic leaders both political and religious are using their bully pulpits for this So what if Quindlen s about a week late to the story The point is she s right as she usually is It wouldn t hurt us to eat our fiber when she tells us to or to grow up either
