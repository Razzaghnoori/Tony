                    Background        Providing information tailored to the specific needs of        a patient permits informed decisionmaking    However        patient participation in health care decisionmaking may be        compromised if physicians rely solely on verbal        communication to inform patients Patients may forget or        misunderstand spoken information Or they may not get all        their questions answered leaving them less able to make an        informed decision And there may be substantial variation        in the quantity and nature of information given to patients        preoperatively           Patient wellbeing may be improved by providing an        educational pamphlet video or audiotape preoperatively            The Internet has become an increasingly important        medium for patients seeking a wide variety of health        information      Even though the quality of the        information on the Web needs to improve medical        information on a web site can be updated at low cost             Alternatively patients can be sent customized        educational information via email        The value of the Internet to deliver medical information        to patients having surgery would especially increase if a        lot of variability existed in the questions that patients        want answered preoperatively This is because unlike        traditional patient information tools such as a brochure        or a video where only a limited amount of preoperative        information can be provided a Web site could be        structured to address the particular questions an        individual patient might have        Our hypothesis was that a small group of questions is        not sufficient to meet all the preoperative information        needs of a particular surgical patient We chose to study        patients considering undergoing total hip arthroplasty        THA or total knee arthroplasty TKA because we are        formalizing a patient education program for these patients        THA and TKA also deserve study as they are commonly        performed and provide substantial improvements in quality        of life due to reduced pain and greater mobility                     To date however there are few data on the particular        information needs of patients considering joint replacement        surgery and which of these needs deserves highest        priority    A study of a broad range of patient and        procedures found that preoperative concerns include pain        they might experience afterwards  of patients whether        the surgery would improve their condition  and        whether they would fully recover from the surgery            For TKA or THA semistructured interviews of German        patients found that they were more interested in        information about the operation and recovery  each        than about risks            The goal of this study was to have patients considering        undergoing either total hip THA or TKA rate the importance        of different questions concerning their care Then the        optimal method of communicating these information needs can        be studied                    Methods                  Generation of question items for survey          instrument          We assembled an initial list of questions that might          be important to patients having joint replacement surgery          through informal discussions between the lead author and           patients scheduled to have THA  patients scheduled to          have TKA  health care researchers and  orthopaedic          surgeons The list produced by these individuals was          augmented by analyzing the results of a computerized          literature search MEDLINE for  using the          following terms patient information information needs          TKA THA This search yielded  relevant published          articles a sample of these studies is included in the          references which were read by the lead author to          generate other potential questions patients might have          For example one study found that pain immediately after          surgery length of recovery ability to walk and ability          to return to recreational activities were the  most          important concerns of patients undergoing THA or TKA                      The authors then qualitatively edited eg similar          questions were eliminated the list to a total of           items The two main criteria used to determine this final          list were to ensure that significant elements of care          were included and to keep the number of questions low          enough so as not to make the survey take longer than           minutes to complete Each question expressed one idea and          no question was phrased in a negative tense ie not or          neither The survey instrument was written at a sixth          grade reading level as assessed by the FleschKincaid          method          The final written questionnaire instrument was          organized in three parts The first was the informed          consent The second asked for basic demographic data The          third part instructed patients to judge the importance of          addressing each of  questions with a  point Likert          scale from  least important   most important          Study participants were given the following          instructions            Please rate how important it is to you          that these questions be answered fully  The          questionnaire also allowed patients to write in any other          questions that they might have Pilot testing suggested          that completion of the survey required less than           minutes of the patients time The actual survey is          available from the authors                          Patients          SUMC is a  bed university affiliated tertiary          care medical center with  surgical casesyear          Patients greater than  years of age seen by two          orthopaedic surgeons in the Stanford Orthopedic Clinic          for evaluation for hip or knee replacement surgery were          eligible to participate Patients unable to speak or read          English or with cognitive disabilities were excluded          During a twomonth period  patients four patients          refused to participate considering undergoing joint          replacement surgery were selected randomly by          computergenerated tables No announcements or fliers          were used to recruit patients After the patients          regularly scheduled office consultation a trained          research assistant approached the eligible patient          described the study and asked if the patient was          interested in participating          If the patient agreed he or she was asked to complete          the written questionnaire Subjects provided consent by          returning the completed survey The identity of the          patient was not recorded and no data was collected from          medical records billing records or any clinical or          research databases The research assistant was available          to assist patients completing the survey          In order to increase sample size we also obtained          survey data from  knee replacement surgery patients           refused to participate and  hip replacement surgery          patients  refused to participate seen by one          orthopedic surgeon at a community practice clinic in          Southern California                          Data analysis          Since the question importance data were not normally          distributed a questions importance was ranked based on          medians          We also quantified agreement or disagreement in          responses by determining the percentage of respondents          that answered each question similarly For example lets          assume that  patients answered a question with           possible answers  least important   most          important If  patients answered  and  patient          answered  and  patient answered  and  patients          answered  the agreement percentage equaled            To quantify variability in answers we also          computed the percentage of answers that were  or more          units different than the overall median for that          question In the example above this would equal                                       Results        Patient characteristics from the two clinics were        similar Table         The survey results from the  clinic locations were        combined because a for  of the questions the median        scores were equal between the  sites b the difference in        medians equaled  on  of the questions and c the        difference in medians equaled  for the remaining  of        questions        The following  questions were rated as most important        with a median score of  by TKA and THA patients at both        sites Will the surgery affect my abilities to care for        myself Am I going to need physical therapy How mobile        will I be after my surgery When will I be able to walk        normally again Table         However overall there was disagreement on question        importance For example the mean percentage disagreement        among all  questions was  for TKR patients and  for        the THA patients        Some questions that overall had high median scores for        importance were rated by a few patients to be of low        importance and vice a versa Tables and         For example of the  questions rated highest with a        median of  by the THA group there was at least one        patient total of  patients for  of the  questions        that rated it a  or less Overall for the THA group         of all the questions answered N   questions multiplied        by  THA patients were  or more units different than the        overall median for that question        For the TKA group  of all the questions answered N          questions multiplied by  patients were  or more        units different than the overall median for that question        For example of the  questions rated the lowest median        score of  or less there was a mean of  range         patients for each question that rated it a         Patients studied were also asked to list other questions        that they might want answered besides those on the        questionnaire No single question was suggested by more        than one respondent Table                     Discussion        We found that there was enough agreement to define a        core set of questions that should be addressed with most        patients considering undergoing either TKA or THA These        questions rated to be of high concern related to whether        the surgery affected the patients ability to care for        themselves whether they would need physical therapy and        how mobile ie able to walk again they would be after        surgery        However each of the remaining questions in our survey        was also judged to be of highest importance to some of the        patients Some patients wrote on the questionnaire other        questions they wanted answered This finding of variability        in patient preferences is similar to other studies For        example although avoiding nauseavomiting and incision        pain are high priorities for most patients after surgery        there is important variability on how patients rate        different postoperative outcomes           The difficulty in finding homogeneity in information        needs suggests that the database of information required        for education of patients undergoing joint replacement        surgery cannot be reduced because each piece of        information was necessary to some Providing core        information to all patients plus education tailored to an        individual patients requests may be a way to address        variability in patient information needs        Perhaps this is one reason that Web sites have become        available to deliver information to patients           Increasingly more patients have Internet access One        European study of cancer screening found that  of        patients had home Internet access and a further  had web        access from other sources    Fiftysix percent of        orthopedic patients in London had access to the web           US studies have found similar rates of Internet access                   A single Web site is part of a larger net of information        so that a topic not covered by one Web page may be covered        by another via links    Future studies need to be        designed to determine if indepth and evidencebased        educational information available via a web site is better        at accommodating preoperative patient education than paper        media or videos given out in the waiting room prior to the        patient seeing a surgeon Importantly physicians in a        group would have to reach consensus on the content of easy        to understand answers for each question Some of the        questions may be difficult to address due to lack of clear        evidence        As in most studies in health care our subject sample        depended on patients willingness to participate and the        types of patients seen in the two clinics studied The        potential for selection bias was minimized to the extent        possible by sampling a group of patients of various ages        gender ethnicities and education levels Since our sample        were patients that were in the final decision making period        about undergoing surgery information about risks was not        included in the list presented to the patients although it        did come up in the additional questions suggested by        patients Patients who are not sure whether or not they        wish to undergo these treatments are likely to be more        interested in knowing about the risks than those who have        already made the decision For example some patients        mentioned a need to know about infection rates and the        surgeons qualifications and previous experience with        performing this procedure This additional information        would likely be needed for patients deciding whether or not        to have surgery                    Conclusions        The content and relative importance of information that        patients undergoing TKA or THA need is unclear Since the        trend is for more Internet based education we wanted to        know what questions to address on our web site to provide        better individualized information to patients before        surgery We found that although there was enough agreement        to define a core set of questions that should be addressed        with most patients deemed suitable for the procedure by the        surgeon some of the remaining questions were also        considered highly important by some patients The core set        of information therefore would not be adequate to satisfy        any one patients essential information needs It may be        that the Web offers a flexible medium for informing        patients and accommodating their variety of needs
