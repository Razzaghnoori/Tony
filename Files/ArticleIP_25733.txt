 American Guns Stun Europeans The school massacre near Denver supplanted Kosovo as the lead story in the late editions of almost all the British newspapers which carried the usual expressions of European bewilderment over the lack of serious gun control in the United States In an editorial Wednesday the London Evening Standard said that even the mass murder at Columbine High School was unlikely to lead to any change in the law S o extravagant is the American concept of freedom and so deep rooted is the pollution of firearms of all kinds throughout the country that there is little prospect that even this latest monstrosity will provoke a meaningful shift in public attitudes the paper said It noted that President Clinton had mouthed the necessary words of horror and condolence but commented that it was hard for the rest of the world to take these entirely seriously when repetition seems almost inevitable The Evening Standard splashed the story on its front page with the headline They Did It for Hitler s Birthday The Times of London observed in a report from Washington that Americans are frankly disbelieving when told how Britain outlawed hand guns in the wake of a school massacre in Dunblane Scotland They argue rightly that no such sweeping legislation could be passed in America it said The Times also noted that the National Rifle Association faced the considerable embarrassment of holding its annual convention next week in Denver very close to the scene of the tragedy NATO s war with Yugoslavia remains the other main story around the world Wednesday s coverage included an interview with Italy s La Repubblica by Shimon Peres the former Israeli prime minister to mark his arrival in Rome for the first informal annual meeting of past winners of the Nobel Peace Prize He wrote that he had been asked to be available to mediate in the Kosovo conflict but had replied that he would only do so if and when the parties are truly determined to seek a political solution He said It doesn t seem to me that this is the mood at the moment but it might be very soon Peres called the war an absurd one that should never have started but added One can t deny that its purpose is fundamentally of a moral character It is not a political or a power game The civilized world is simply tired of racism discrimination and atrocities In an interview in Corriere della Sera of Milan Italian Prime Minister Massimo D Alema offered rather qualified praise of Clinton He is an intelligent leader D Alema said but I don t know if he saw all the traps that had been set for him in the war The prime minister whose coalition government is divided about Kosovo said that once the war was over there should be reflection about the criteria for NATO intervention The right of humanitarian interference is legitimate but we must ask ourselves about its limits Turin s L a Stampa led its front page with an appeal for peace in Belgrade by the Russian Orthodox Patriarch Alexis II It said the patriarch has criticized NATO but has asked the leaders of Yugoslavia like those of the Atlantic alliance to halt military operations Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has expressed the hope that the efforts of Russia and its Orthodox hierarchy may lead to peace and the end of aggression Die Welt complained Wednesday in its main front page story that in western Europe only Germany is keeping its promises toward Albanian refugees Of the 13 824 refugees who had arrived in Europe by Monday morning 9 937 more than two thirds of the total have come to Germany it said In an accompanying front page comment the paper said Typically German Two weeks ago the federal government said it would take 10 000 Kosovo refugees and today they are here German generosity German efficiency Or stupidity a continuing feeling of anticipated guilt that other countries quietly smile at and exploit In France Wednesday Le Monde led its front page with a question A month of war with what results Its answer in summary was that the offensive has weakened Serbia s military potential but has failed to deter Milosevic or prevent ethnic cleansing in Kosovo A third of the population has been driven out and diplomatic initiatives are at a dead end it said The British press focused again on the prospects of a ground war with the conservative tabloid the Daily Mail splashing the claim that Prime Minister Tony Blair is now planning for one It said that for the first time since the bombing began Blair and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook held out the prospect of British soldiers going into Kosovo before a ceasefire has been agreed with Belgrade But it added the rider that this will only happen when the back of Serb resistance has been broken by Nato s air power The Times of India Wednesday condemned the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia for its ecological effects The paper said in an editorial There is nothing humanitarian or liberating about the intense bombing of Yugoslavia which has created even more refugees and resulted in widespread ecocide The paper devoted its second editorial to the diplomatic significance of Madeleine Albright s jewelry Under the headline Lapel Diplomacy the paper said that her sparklers the brooches she wears while negotiating knotty issues of geo politics are as much a statement as the press releases after various meetings with say the Iraqis Serbs Russians or Israelis It went on The American eagle brooch says without a word being exchanged that she is in hawkish combative mood the cherub brooch betokens the spirit of innocent accommodation and the red and gold balloon brooch denotes a festive moment On all other counts Ms Albright is thought prone to tough talk but her brooches seem to tell a different more nuanced story
