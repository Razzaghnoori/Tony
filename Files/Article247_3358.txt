 Front Page vs Home Page Dear Katharine I don t know anything about your reading habits but these days a lot of my newspaper consumption is online There are a number of reasons for this a nomadic office life over the last year which left me without a reliable physical address contributing to Media Grok an e mail newsletter that thrives on Web links and the sheer amount of time I spend staring at my laptop screen Although I find the convenience of online newspapers compelling I m also first to acknowledge that there are things you miss when not touching the actual pulp Take today s New York Times Like most political mammals I am drawn to Adam Clymer s front page story on the 25th anniversary of Nixon s resignation The piece itself is tame and perfunctory but when you open the paper to Page A12 where it continues your eye travels immediately to the continuation of another front page story headlined G O P Asking Top Donors To Contribute 1 Million Forgive me but if you ve listened to those famous Watergate tapes you can t help but hear Nixon s voice echoing on how to get a million dollars of hush money to the plumbers We could get that I love that both stories end up as it were on the same page One could slyly infer from the A12 juxtaposition that with the GOP seeking all top donors to give 1 million apiece Watergate style abuses will inevitably reoccur A facile assumption of the left Sure But at least that would counter the right s facile assumption that Nixon s crimes were not substantially different from those of his predecessors the tack taken by David Frum in a National Public Radio commentary this morning My fascination here is not that one must take any particular meaning from the play of the two stories but that as with a work of art one can The jump of front page news stories is a necessity borne of spatial limitation which the Web theoretically does not have But working around those limitations and indeed manipulating them for narrative advantage is one of the great moments of the newspaper craft Headline writing in a narrow space is another On the other hand the Washington Post which I m reading today online displays one of the Web s great counterstrengths You can click on today s front page and get a reproduction of the Post s front page coverage from August 9 1974 the Web as microfiche The Post spoils the effect somewhat by calling its project immodestly The Washington Post Century and running only excerpts of the original front page stories Still the historian in me applauds the widespread availability of primary documents and the media critic in me notes that the New York Times has no interest in calling attention to the way that it covered or rather didn t cover the Watergate saga Sorry for the East Coast obsessions Jim
