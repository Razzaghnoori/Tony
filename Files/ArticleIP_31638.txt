 Free Shows Please send your questions for publication to prudence slate com Dear Prudence s disgusting letter concerning meal and gift parity along with her psychotically misguided ideas of the whys and wherefores of giving gifts are a great deal more than alarming I found myself deeply troubled by her fantastical notions and saddened by the possibility that her children might be taught these same ideas Needless to say I thought your response to RS was absolutely correct Nevertheless I must take issue with your slander of mercenaries A mercenary makes it clear he she is fighting for money not attempting to hide the expectation of booty behind a wedding invitation Cordially ML III in Hong Kong Dear M Prudie thanks you for your support and regrets that she may have insulted official mercenaries If RS our bride with the tally sheet is by any chance reading this week s Prudie she may be interested to know that there was much mail essentially calling her a woman with a cash register where her heart ought to be Prudie assuredly Dear Prudence As a young man approaching 40 I am confused about how I am supposed to react to women s fashions At a recent conference of professionals we were seated around a U shaped table glass with no tablecloth Several of these professional women across from me were wearing Ally McBeal skirts They spent the entire meeting pulling their skirts down so their lingerie preferences were not so obvious Am I supposed to look at the ceiling the entire meeting steal the occasional glance or just assume it s a 90s thing Along these same lines I was recently in a retail store and the clerk had on a summer dress As she leaned over the counter to hand me my purchase it became clear that her lingerie preference was none at all I didn t know whether to stare at the ceiling pretend I saw nothing or thank her for the free show In both instances these women had to know that everyone was getting an eyeful I missed the era of free love while in grade school and am wondering if we are now in the era of free looks Somewhat Dazed and Confused Dear Some You have nicely named our new era Fashion is deep into spandex and see through with the off one shoulder style occasionally revealing a stray boob Alas the 90s motto Let it all hang out has moved from emotions to body parts Clothing is meant to cover or reveal The look at me outfits say just that As for your particular question about Ally McBeal skirts and ladies minus underwear Prudie feels these people do not purchase their clothes in the dark so whatever is able to be seen is fair game for whatever response feels natural You may even stare if you like Prudie gives you permission Prudie permissively Dear Prudence Maybe you can help with this problem My wife and I have a subscription to our city s symphony orchestra Sometimes things come up that prevent us from using our tickets When this happens we give them to friends who are also classical music fans We have made it clear to this couple we expect nothing in return as we have already paid for the tickets that would go to waste if they didn t use them However being polite people and good friends this other couple has as a gesture of thanks invited us to be their guests at a minor league baseball game My wife and I are not enthusiastic about this especially since getting there requires a drive of close to an hour But we don t want to appear ungrateful to our friends or hurt their feelings We can t use the We re busy excuse because they ve given us four different dates to choose from Is there a graceful way of declining or have you some suggestions for handling this dilemma In Need of Help in Ohio Dear In Prudie sympathizes with your feelings of ix nay on the ballgame she herself having been briefly shown on national TV reading the New Republic at a World Series game and the Sunday papers at the Rose Bowl It is best to be upfront both to handle the matter truthfully as well as to scotch baseball invitations on into the next century Prudie therefore suggests you tell your friends 1 you are most appreciative that they wish to reciprocate 2 neither you nor your wife is a sports fan 3 long car rides hurt your behinds and 4 a leisurely dinner just the four of you would be much more to your liking Prudie believes there are certain occasions when one plays along in order to spare someone s feelings This is not one of them Prudie decidedly Hello Prudie The tone of about that geezer Hugh Hefner rather surprises me Really Confused seems to want to criticize Mr Hefner because he is no longer a young man under 30 yet he still manages to attract the attentions of three young attractive women Would Really Confused be less confused if Mr Hefner were a Gen Xer Would you be less critical of the three women if Mr Hefner were under 30 In other words it appears that numbers are driving the argument here and I can t tell if it s the number 3 any number over 30 or an interaction effect Quantitatively Questioning the Quality of Life a k a SB B Dear Quant Prudie can t speak for Really Confused so she will speak for herself If Mr Hefner were under 30 the three uh companions would no doubt be an implied tribute to his attractiveness At the age of 70 something however this trio has about it the barest whiff of self serving motives Without the mansion the money the famous friends and the publicity Prudie thinks the object of their affections would be just another eccentric old guy who stays in his pajamas As Prudie has wondered in the past in other publications why do geezers with young girlfriends not know that they might as well glue an American Express Gold Card to their foreheads Oh well As for the Viagra component let s not go there as the kids say Prudie appropriately
