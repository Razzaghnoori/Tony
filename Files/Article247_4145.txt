 Lily White House Everybody leads with the decision by Israel and Syria to resume peace talks probably starting next week after a lapse of nearly four years The Washington Post New York Times and Los Angeles Times fronts feature a picture of President Clinton at his press conference yesterday where he announced the development The WP calls the talks a major foreign policy victory for President Clinton The coverage makes it clear that one major issue Israel and Syria have to sort out is what to do about the Golan Heights which Israel occupied during the 1967 Six Day War and which has served as a key security buffer for it ever since The WP is the clearest about another what to do about the 35 000 troops Syria maintains in Lebanon and about its support for anti Israeli operations there conducted by the militant Islamic group Hezbollah The coverage is largely upbeat with only the LAT including the following 1 Although Yasser Arafat publicly supports the talks privately the Palestinians were stunned by them and fear that they will have an adverse affect on their own dealings with the Israelis 2 the political opposition in Israel is not pleased with one right wing party viewing the talks as a complete surrender to Syria and 3 there is much bitterness too from Golan Heights residents who fear losing their homes Everybody runs stories about President Clinton s press conference yesterday and all of these mention a question near the end that seemed to have caught him somewhat flat footed a question about why most top White House jobs in his administration have gone to whites But all of these stories run inside and none dwell at length on the issue the question raises With the exception that is of USA Today which serves up a 1 900 word pass at the topic on its front page The story highlights the basic fact raised and not denied by Clinton at the press conference While Clinton has presided over a historically diverse Cabinet all 26 people who ve held the top seven White House jobs under him have been white and 21 of them have been men The story garners two quotes from Clintonites that are sure to give the topic some media life Current Press Secretary Joe Lockhart is quoted as saying that when it comes to crucial White House decisions women and minorities still have to fight for a seat at the table And former Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers says The rule is still that when the big decisions get made it s not as diverse a group as the overall administration And I m putting it nicely The story tries to suggest important examples where this alleged ethnic skew hurt The most convincing The United States slow response to the 1994 civil war and genocide in Rwanda The NYT fronts an exclusive from the New York Senate campaign trenches At a private fund raiser organized by gay and lesbian supporters Hillary Clinton said that the Don t Ask Don t Tell policy crafted by her husband to govern gays in the military was a failure and that if elected she would work to overturn it The Times points out that HRC s likely opponent Rudy Giuliani also opposes the policy The paper further reports that at the event the first lady also supported full rights for same sex unions even though notes the NYT in 1996 she supported along with her husband a bill passed by Congress that effectively banned gay marriages The Times runs the story next to pictures of the killer and the killed in the case of an Army private convicted yesterday of murdering a fellow soldier he d harassed for being gay An LAT front pager reveals that one of the suspects in the 1997 shooting of rap star Notorious B I G is a former LAPD officer now in prison on unrelated bank robbery charges A theory being pursued by investigators says the paper is that the officer conspired with Death Row Records founder Marion Suge Knight to arrange a contract killing of the rapper On this theory the actual shooter was a college friend of the then cop Everybody reports inside that a Memphis civil jury decided in a lawsuit brought by the family of Martin Luther King that a retired local cafe owner was part of a conspiracy involving governmental agencies in the 1968 King murder This means explains the coverage that the jury does not believe the man convicted of the crime James Earl Ray was the real shooter The NYT runs a story inside about an execution conducted last night with possible political ramifications Monday morning a man scheduled to be executed in Texas was found unconscious from a drug overdose Nevertheless the state decided not to issue a stay of execution for the man and instead put him to death on time Although George W Bush was out of the state during all this and so technically not in on the decision the paper reports that a Bush spokeswoman confirms he agreed with it Wackiest detail reported by the Times Because Long s doctor deemed such a move risky state officials used an airplane staffed by medical personnel to ensure that he arrived in good health after the 25 minute trip Some quality control problems noted at the WP 1 A story about trials of an experimental anti autism drug is slugged by the paper Treatment Counters Autism even though the story goes on to explain that the drug worked no better in the studies than placebos given to the control group 2 an AP story the paper runs about a credit card scam targeting senior military officers fails to mention that the Wall Street Journal broke the news yesterday 3 over a heart wrenching story about a 9 year old boy who concealed the accidental death of his mother
