 The Best of Most Possible Worlds Dear Jim It s Day 3 of our Book Clubbing which means it s time for us to crawl back out of the little tunnel we ve excavated and return to our day jobs But before I surrender this space let me hit a couple of points Rosen wants journalists who he mistakenly thinks have lost touch to drop what they re doing and create a debate society for citizens who he thinks are alienated in hopes that the Big Palaver will convince them to join together and take a crack at solving society s problems Body check me if I m being unfair but actually solving problems takes a backseat to process in the Rosen universe To invoke a computer industry clich process is a strange metric to judge the success of a piece of journalism If an article doesn t encourage the masses to meet and cogitate it s a failure As I finished his book I couldn t help but think Wouldn t Rosen be a lot happier working as a union organizer or ward heeler than as a press critic Like the 80s activists who used the phrase economic democracy as their euphemism for socialism Rosen cribs the word democracy to serve as a vague stand in for the Deweyan utopia he wants us to build Please include me out Or give me a better idea of what this Deweyan democracy will look like Rereading my previous entries I blushed at my Panglossian take on American journalism but when my blood pressure stablized I felt vindicated Whereas 95 percent of American journalism used to be crap Sturgeon s Law I personally reckon that only 85 percent of it is now What strides we ve made So if Rosen really wants to frame his debate and his call to arms around some imagined crisis in American journalism let him make a better case about how awful things are Parenthetically I agree with your Monday correlation of the late 80s recession and the cuts in newsroom budgets with public journalism s boom Those were dark times for journalists and I fear that some of them went grasping at straws Journalism ain t broke and Rosen isn t the man to fix it even if it is For the time being I ll put my trust in that the rollicking goulash of advocacy journalism public interest lobbying scientific inquiry straight up news reporting first person confessional government documents academic findings rumors and innuendo that finds its way into print and into the wires Regards Jack
