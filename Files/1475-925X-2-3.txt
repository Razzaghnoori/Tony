 Background The force produced by a muscle under voluntary contraction is based on two mechanisms the firing frequency and the recruitment of the motor units The motor unit MU is a functional entity consisting of a motor neuron and the whole set of muscular fibers it innervates Increasing either the firing frequency or the number of recruited MUs contributes to increasing the muscle force The smoothness of the force output of a muscle is enhanced by the firing rate recruitment interaction within the MU pool 1 and the mechanical filtering effect of the tissue compensating for the discrete nature of the process which builds up the actual muscle force from individual muscle fiber twitches The variation of the firing rates of the motor units occurs simultaneously for all the motor units within a muscle and even in different muscles acting on the same joint according to the phenomenon of common drive 2 Accordingly small variations of the output force acquired via a force transducer can be noticed Also the control loops involving Ia Ib afferents are responsible for the occurrence of certain peaks within the output force in the isometric exercise and others are due to the activation from higher levels 3 Sustained muscular contractions externally associated with not being able to maintain a certain force lead to physiological fatigue tremor or pain localized in the specific muscle localized muscular fatigue Fatigue is defined as any reduction in the force generating capacity measured by MVC regardless of the task performed 4 The fatigued muscle develops tetanic tension more slowly than normal and prolongs the relaxation phase simultaneously with inner chemical changes The failure in maintaining the motor task defines the endurance limit and endurance time is the total duration of the task up to the endurance limit The myoelectric activity detected with surface electrodes SEMG may be considered as the summation of the electrical signals generated by a number of motor units active within the same motor territory in the proximity of the electrodes The SEMG signal is a convenient mean to study the muscle behavior under fatiguing exercise as it proves time dependent changes provided care is taken to prevent cross talk from adjacent muscles Fatigue is associated with a compression of the PSD of the SEMG toward lower frequencies from the very beginning of the voluntary contraction 5 This is due to the reduction in the conduction velocity in direct relation with the muscular fiber membrane excitability and with neural adaptations resulting in an increase of the lower frequency content of the signal Fatigue is also associated with higher amplitudes of the SEMG signal toward the end of the exercise 3 5 6 It has been shown that in sustained motor tasks changes at different levels including motoneural discharge behaviour develop before an endurance limit is reached phenomenon called central fatigue 7 8 Central and peripheral fatigue develop together and have to be seen not as a result but as complementary elements of a complex strategy striving to insure the optimality of the motor behavior within the framework of available resources Under muscular contraction mechanical vibrations occur due to three main processes i the inner muscular vibrations which are the intrinsic components of the muscle contraction 9 ii oscillations of the human motor system e g tremor and clonus 10 and iii artefacts They are located in specific frequency ranges with a certain overlapping the artefacts due to large movements show the lowest frequencies possible tremor contributions are below 10 Hz in healthy subjects usually between 5 85 and 8 8 Hz 11 and the mechanical inner vibrations affect the range between 10 and 40 Hz The MMG may be considered to reflect the mechanical muscle vibrations generated by the spatio temporal summation of the individual muscle fiber twitches which are evoked through MU activation by the motor neurons MMG recording is useful in experimental situations when SEMG usage is not feasible such as in complex working environments and in areas with heavy electromagnetic pollution The MMG was recorded with acceleration or sound transducers 10 11 12 13 14 The technique of recording MMG was refined using piezoresistive silicon accelerometers in a surface mount package 15 16 17 to provide a reliable acquisition of MMG 15 16 Preliminary results showed the potential of the MMG signal to monitor the muscle fatigue 15 The EMG and MMG recorded simultaneously from the same muscle seem to have similar behavior 3 15 16 i e the MF of SEMG and MMG decrease from the very beginning of the contraction and their RMS values increase The actual study addresses another extensive comparison of the MMG and SEMG in monitoring the muscle fatigue aiming to appreciate whether the MMG alone may be used to monitor the muscle behavior under fatiguing contraction We are hypothesizing that MMG can indicate the degree of muscle activation and therefore can be used to monitor the development of the muscle fatigue in the same way the SEMG has been proved to do Methods Parameters PSD The PSD of a stationary random process x n is estimated via the discrete time Fourier transform PSD FFT x n 2 1 where FFT is the Fourier transform of the specific sequence Computed in this form this estimation is called the periodogram Because using windows other than the rectangular ones does not necessarily improve the estimate 18 a rectangular window has been used RMS The RMS of the SEMG signal is considered the most reliable parameter in the time domain 19 An increase of the SEMG RMS with advancing fatigue has been reported in many cases 20 21 RMS is claimed to be not affected by the cancellation due to the motor unit action potential train superposition which affects other processing techniques involving rectification 19 It is also related to the power of the signal via the Parseval s relation 22 thus providing a direct connection with the frequency domain where PSD i i th PSD component n the number of spectral components From 2 it follows that the overall average activity observed through the PSD of a certain SEMG segment is expressed by the RMS value computed on the same specific SEMG segment of data The PSD and the RMS values were computed for all the signals SEMG MMG both muscles in all subjects The evolution of the PSD with time is shown in contour plots computed to display at 15 levels the isolines of the matrix containing the succession of the spectra from the beginning to the end of the contraction MF MF is the frequency value separating the power spectrum into two equal surface regions SEMG MF has been proved to be a reliable descriptor of the muscle fatigue evolution 3 5 6

using T test two sample assuming unequal variances were performed significance level 0 05 The null hypothesis H0 assumed the equality of the compared parameters mean values In all cases Figure 9 SEMG and MMG both muscles the average slope a1 of the MF evolution is negative The MMG MF regression slopes are closer to each other between men and women Biceps 1 55 Brachioradialis 13 2 than are the SEMG MF slopes Biceps 25 32 Brachioradialis 17 72 this shows a smaller inter sex variability for the MMG vs SEMG In all cases Figure 11 SEMG Figure 13 MMG both muscles the average slope a1 of the RMS evolution is positive The analysis of the RMS shows comparable slopes a1 in women and men for the SEMG signal Figure 11 between the two muscles while for the MMG Figure 13 they are comparable in men between the Biceps and Brachioradialis but different in women Discussion The local variations in the MF and the RMS are due to small local variations in the activation of the muscle That is why areas of higher activation strips can be noticed in the contour plots Figures 3 5 The mechanical resultant of the reinforcements in the activation better illustrated by the RMS peaks leads to oscillations of the output force around its average Meanwhile there is a progressive spreading up of the higher frequency activity within the PSD This may be generated by progressive recruitment of new motor units in the both muscles A larger frequency range toward the end of the task may also witness an increased activity of the controlling neural loops and modulating subsystems as fatigue develops The amplitude of the MMG RMS progressively increases Figure 8 with developing fatigue This reflects increased twitch potentiation An increase in the activation possibly due to progressively higher number of active motor units together with a more synchronous firing may also play a role in the RMS increase The same increase is shown by the SEMG Figures 3 7 this demonstrates that not only peripheral mechanisms are responsible for the MMG RMS increase MF decreases in all cases both SEMG and MMG both muscles all subjects from the very beginning of the muscle contraction This proves the central intervention in modulating the activation with increasing fatigue central fatigue The MF decrease may be the effect of the centrally generated progressive alteration of the activation of individual MNs as the relaxation time increases this may be explained by the withdrawal of the tonic fusimotor driven spindle support via the fusimotor loop 23 As the muscle afferents provide up to 30 excitation to the MN it seems that this mechanism stays as an important provision of intervention The presynaptic inhibition may also contribute to reducing the fusimotor support with advancing fatigue and affects the Ia and Ib afferents More Ib inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in MNs also decline in sustained muscular contractions and the gain of force feedback loop is reduced The group II non spindle muscle afferents have increased discharge rates with increasing fatigue also contributing to the inhibitory effect Meanwhile the alpha MNs are centrally inhibited by group III and IV muscle afferents activated by the accumulation of metabolites in the fatiguing muscle but this is expected to come into action later than from the beginning to further accelerate the process This may be witnessed by the nonlinear spreading up of the frequency range and increase in RMS The above discussion shows the intimate link between the EMG and the MMG as functionally related signals they both witness the neural activation of the muscular fibers and its mechanical effect respectively This functional link helps explaining the difference between the MF intercept points in SEMG and MMG Figure 10 The MMG itself results as a spatio temporal fused effect of the muscle fiber twitches Hence the MMG frequency spectrum is located lower than the SEMG spectrum on the frequency scale This effect is further enhanced by the filtering effect of the tissue between the contraction site and the transducer This mechanical filtering effect may also explain smaller inter sex variability shown by the MF slope for the MMG compared to the SEMG The MMG MF slopes Figure 9 are statistically different between the Biceps and Brachioradialis muscles in women men and total In the isometric contraction addressed by this work this muscle shows a decrease of the MF with fatigue less accentuated than the Biceps muscle shows Even if the both muscles Biceps and Brachioradialis are intensively worked out they are differently loaded relative to their individual MVCs This may influence the balance between the centrally modulated activation and the peripheral phenomena in each of them and may explain the difference The above explanation may also address the significant difference in MMG RMS slopes Figure 13 between Biceps and Brachioradialis muscles A study 24 brought results in agreement with our results regarding the evolution of the PSD and RMS The study 24 mentions that the SEMG and MMG give information on the localized fatigue Our results show that both the SEMG and MMG demonstrate the central component of the fatigue the decrease in MF from the very beginning of the contraction That is why the MMG is as valuable as SEMG in exploring not only peripheral fatigue but also sensorimotor interaction and central intervention in the development of the muscular fatigue Conclusion This study addresses a quantitative comparison MF RMS of accelerometer based MMG and SEMG It brings additional evidence on the central fatigue and provides means of quantifying the fatigue development in the isometric exercise According to this study the MMG signal can be used for indication of the degree of muscle activation and for monitoring the muscle fatigue development in the isometric contraction The study also advocates the use of the integrated accelerometer based MMG acquisition An accelerometer based MMG transducer is selective not dependent of the environmental acoustical and electrical noise and it also provides positional information on motor unit territory The transducer can be incorporated into a miniature stand alone radio frequency powered device which can be chronically implanted in the muscle As such it has multi faceted potential for future research in movement neuroscience in adverse environments when it is not feasible to use the SEMG complex working environments and situations wherein the SEMG signal is contaminated by electrical noise The work also encourages further research on the use of MMG in dynamic contraction Authors contributions MTT conceived the study conceived and developed the macro model for the MMG transducer conceived and
