 ASK PRUDENCE Prudence drawing on her rich experience of life will answer questions submitted by readers She will respond to questions about manners personal relations politics economics and other subjects Questions should be sent to Prudence slate com They should not exceed 200 words in length Please indicate how you wish your letter to be signed preferably including your location Dear Prudence Once I have asked the how do I tell Alan Greenspan how much I love the way he screws me question what other questions are there that deal with love etiquette AND macroeconomic policy Nit pickingly Perry Nelson Dear Nit pickingly I m sure a person as clever as you can find many questions that meet the standard you have read into our instructions Here s one How should a capital gains tax cut be dressed up to make it seem an act of lovingkindness to people who have no capital Many people who read our instructions were not deterred by the defect you discovered and have sent us heartfelt questions on a number of subjects Unrelenting attention to syntax can be an obstacle to communication Prudence inexactly My dear Prudence This year my wife is dragging me to the home of some friends of hers to celebrate the new year The problem is that they are total teetotalers and to me a day much less New Year s Eve without a drink is no day at all Would it be rude if I took a nice bottle of French wine OK maybe two And would a corkscrew and proper glasses be pushing it Jakeman Dear Jakeman It would indeed be rude unless you called first and asked whether it would be OK It is their house their party and their rules If they say no which would be quite within the bounds of propriety you should either restrain yourself at the party or not go to it Prudence teetotally Dear Prudence I see that every editor these days is trying to copy the tone of the wonderful advice given by the sainted Mary Killen in the Spectator Tell me why do you think this is It can t be because they have no brilliant ideas of their own can it Yours expectantly Michael ElliottWashington D C Dear Prudence In recent years one of my favorite newspaper columnists has become less and less interesting Eppie not her real name used to write an advice column Readers would write her with their questions on life love and usually microeconomics and she would give them really great advice e g Wake up and smell the coffee honey Lately however her readers seem to have decided to become America s Nannies mailing in all sorts of precatory silliness Eppie tell your readers never to leave a dead fish alone in a car on a hot day with the windows rolled up Or Eppie please please tell your readers not to make fun of fat people such as Tipper Gore They re human too you know And Prudence she prints that stuff in her column Every day Advice Fahgeddaboutit Buster Prudence will they ever put Eppie out of her misery Do you represent the next evolutionary step in journalism Or are you nothing more than this year s Jeffrey Zaslow Popo not my real name Dear Michael and Popo Your letters raise related questions and I hope you won t mind if I answer them both at once Dear Prudence did not originate with an editor searching for a new idea It was a response to the overwhelming public demand for advice People seek answers to their real problems and other people enjoy and profit from reading the problems submitted and the answers given People real people that is are more interested in those problems than in the questions that pundits make up just so they will have something to write about questions selected so that the answer requires little thought and no research As for my antecedents I must confess that I have never heard of Mary Killen Eppie or Jeffrey Zaslow I trace my lineage back to Joseph Solomon the Delphic Oracle Cassandra Adam Smith and Benjamin Franklin I deliberately omit that old fool of an advice giver Polonius Banks thrive by being both borrowers and lenders Thus I consider myself part of the constants of history not part of an evolutionary trend But hey it s a free country and a free market If no problems are submitted there will be no answers And if there are problems and answers but no one reads them Prudence will go back to her needlepoint Prudence modestly Dear Prudence and how are John and Paul My girlfriend s former boyfriend broke up with her via a note That she was pregnant at the time makes the situation with respect to his morality quite clear He had and has the morals of a banana slug That he cringes at salt shakers only bolsters this conclusion The question that I find interesting concerns the etiquette of breaking up I contend that the only way one person should kiss off another is face to face I ve a number of reasons to support this view but my fundamental reasoning is moral as morality is the basis of so much mannerly behavior In justice the kissed off as the offended party should have the right to confront and possibly to throw sharp objects at the kisser off Any other way by telephone by note smacks of cowardice Further it seems to me that my preferred mode serves a useful societal function as well by making romantic relationships somewhat more stable since somewhat more difficult to dissolve during temporary difficulties This last point of course presumes that society has an interest in stable romantic relationships if you accept that society has an interest in marriage and that stable romantic relationships both include and lead to marriage you must conclude that society does indeed have such an interest Have you any thoughts on this A nation holds its breath well except for those holding others at gunpoint Emily Post s Meaner Brother Dear Brother Whether a face to face encounter is required for a breakup depends on the reason for the breakup If A splits from B because B has been obviously offensive and fraudulent the courtesy of a face to face explanation is not required Suppose for example that Mr B has given Ms A every reason to believe that he is not married but she learns that he is B then deserves nothing In the case to which you refer the young lady deserves a face to face meeting an apology and whatever solace can be offered Probably the general rule is that a party who is seriously aggrieved owes no consideration to the aggrievor I am surprised that you did not mention e mail as a medium for breakups Isn t there a Web site containing form e mail letters for breakups They re well thanks Prudence Dear Prudence I hate to start our relations by pointing out little details but both you and Lovelocked missed another major point of Chivalry on the question of opening the door for your loved one The other point is you don t leave her standing alone on the far side of the car and thus more easily jostled and or assaulted by the nearest purse snatcher or other criminal element who can often appear quickly and quietly no matter the time of day just a point m dear Saintswrd Orlando Fla Dear Saintswrd Thanks for your addition to the reasons for helping your beloved get into the car Unfortunately it is a necessary addition Sentimental Prudence prefers to focus on the romantic side of life but she cannot deny there is a darker side also Prudence ruefully
