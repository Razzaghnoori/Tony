 okay so what do you think well i believe in capital punishment um and i i think the way that i understand the laws right now they are only for certain crimes um i m not sure exactly what they are i think rape and uh uh huh capital murder yeah the person gets killed you know oh yeah that would be a capital crime yeah yeah something like that but my problem with capital murder capital punishment is they don t carry it out yeah i agree they so if they re going to have it to me they ought to do it i agree they uh you know they people people been sitting like they had on 20 20 or 48 Hours one of them they had them on the man was twenty years waiting on death row uh huh see that don t make no sense yeah i think that we waste a lot of money keeping people in prison yeah that uh is not necessary and now i think they ought to increase it to all these drug dealers yeah have you ever been on a jury huh uh i haven t either but and i you know i i have real strong beliefs in capital punishment but when it comes right down to it yeah i i m wondering though they re not going to do it that s my biggest problem is even if you give them the death penalty they appeal it and appeal it and appeal it and there s you know right but what if they re not guilty huh what if they re not guilty what do you mean what have been what if they truly are not guilty and they re convicted anyway that s the whole system though isn t it yeah see that s what there are a lot of people that aren t guilty that s in jail yeah but you know uh i i i don t know about if you if they was like capital murder and then if they were married then what would you do yeah i don t know you know like i said said i do believe in capital punishment but if i were sitting on a jury and had to make the decision i wouldn t want to have to be the one to make it yeah and i do agree that they keep people that we spend too much money keeping people in prison the jails are overcrowded if they re going to do well you know let s do it uh huh do it and get it over with i don t know if i could i could probably it depends on the crime my problem would be that like people to me the like the child people the people that s killing kids uh huh uh the ones messing with old people yeah those type of people now i i have no pity for them yeah you know but just like if a man and wife is fighting and he kills her that he shouldn t die because it might been accident or you never know what you know what what they done went through together should i say yeah but i don t know if they if they if uh the death penalty i don t think they give them the death penalty if given today anyway yeah yeah i don t think they give it to just i think they just put them in jail and let them think about it yeah for a long time so i don t know uh i definitely think anyone that kills somebody should be in jail i don t think everybody that kills somebody should die yes die because it all depends so under the circumstances there s a lot of circumstance sometimes i even feel like and up in another state i think it was Ohio where they don t have uh self defense laws and i think that s wrong is it i i m from i ve lived in Ohio and i didn t realize that yeah they had them on the news this lady her husband she was seven i ll never forget it because she was seven months pregnant and he hit her in the stomach and then tried to cut her throat um oh my gosh well she shot him and she went to prison she you know she killed him but she lost her baby and then they sent her to jail so that s not right um huh uh they she s nothing should have happened to her at all he shouldn t have hit her in the stomach i don t care well see he shouldn t have been trying to slit her throat anyway but he did both yeah well i wonder why did they say why well he was he he she was abused woman he was he was a a what do you call it abuser he would he would beat his wife all the time oh so there was a history of that oh yeah so she s not going to get to have her baby she no she lost the baby oh okay he hit her in the stomach with the shovel oh it s just you know things like that that you know i don t think those women or even a man because a man they had a woman man that his wife shot him but he didn t die uh huh and uh they put her in jail now i don t think anything should happen to him but i think she should stay in there because really she just did it because she wanted to get out the marriage and she wanted all his property uh huh see i think that s wrong too but i don t cheaper than a divorce no she she wouldn t have got no property see there was no grounds for divorce she was she wanted out cause she had a boyfriend and it was weird but uh the capital punishment i don t know actually what they give the death penalty for yeah um the only thing i i know they give it for is shooting a killing a cop or you know assassination of the President and and something big you know yeah i think capital crimes uh capital crimes and i want to say kidnap i don t know why kidnapping sticks in my mind but um uh huh i don t know yeah i think they should give it to them but i don t think they should keep them waiting in jail and let having us pay for it for twenty years no if they going to give it to them i think they should go ahead you know okay maybe a year or you know like that two years whatever but twenty years ten years on death to me that s worse for them too yeah they re not they don t know when they going to die they know they got the death penalty but that don t mean nothing not anymore well i i assume that you live in do you live in Texas uh huh i think Texas is very uh one of the leading states i mean i think Texas executes more people than just about any other state i don t know they don t they don t put it on the news or they don t broadcast it because you know the i guess they don t just don t well they they they they don t sensationalize it anymore they used to make a big deal out of it every time it happened uh huh oh yeah all the people for right uh life or something and i think now that it happens more frequently than we know that it s just not sensationalized as much at least in Texas because i hear every once in a while i ll hear something on the news yeah yeah i but i think they going to have to do something to make people wake up like on especially the drug dealers you know the the not the little penny ante ones on the corner i don t think they ought to get in trouble i mean i know they ought to get in trouble i m not they ought to get in trouble but not not death because see they you know we re to me what they ought to do if they can find the big man but they ought to get yeah i was because see that s where it s coming from to me it it s coming in here some kind of way i don t care what anybody tells me people tell me i said if the government really want to i think it s all government something to do with the government i really do they because if you can stop uh Cuban cigars from coming you can t buy anything Cuban in the United States so why can t they stop anything illegal yeah hum you know if they really wanted to i think they could they just don t want to put there s too much money people s been bought out you know and that s what s wrong with some of the kids on the street yeah they you can t blame just like the man says he can make two five hundred dollars a day for just taking a bag somewhere uh huh and his mom is not getting that much money hum you know if you think you think about all the kids in the ghetto my mom would probably kill us but but uh you know it s something that has to be done to me if they bring kids into it because now kids are killing and so they going to have to do something with the death penalty or to scare these people i think that s the whole thing they re not scared they know they re not going anywhere yeah well yeah i mean when when you think about it yeah when you think about how many people die from drugs you know ultimately uh huh innocent people not just the drug people i m talking about innocent people when they have they little drive by shootings and and and see because i m from Los Angeles oh yeah um see originally i ve been in Texas twelve thirteen years but originally in LA they people die all the time just from being in the way at the wrong place you know see you know but i think something should be done for them yeah um yeah so i agree but i don t know too much about the death penalty i think that that they have much i like that they ve changed it to lethal injection rather than you know the electric chair or gas yeah but they don t use that no more no they don t they use the the injection thing or whatever it is yeah i think that s a lot more humane than uh than the electric chair than the than the gas or the gas uh huh it s funny because i had listened to a comedian talk about the death penalty you know about people saying they they don t have nobody to do this and i said well if somebody killed my husband just because i ll pull the switch i ll even do you know to me if if that person can forgive them fine but what is that man going to do next is he going to go out and kill somebody else kill right you know how many times is it going to take for this man to kill people before you kill him yeah now you know sometimes i can understand maybe if they robbed something they didn t mean to do it okay but how many times you going to go by that how many times you going to this person keep killing so i don t know uh huh yeah i guess if you stay out of trouble you don t have you worry about it but well it s like you said though sometimes people just get caught up in it innocently but uh huh so i think it just i think it depends on the circumstances and how many times that person has been in trouble i mean really big trouble yeah yeah you know so yeah but that s all i got to say okay and it is nice talking to you all righty well it s nice talking to you i ll have to start doing this again some more i i don t know what i ve tried it several times with oh it s fun i call
