          well hi i guess uh ill just start by saying that we entertain with uh a gourmet club here um which means that we have like eight eight people four couples   uhhuh   and most of the husbands this is really peculiar most of the husbands cook   great   i mean the wives during the day you know get i guess so burned out on cooking whatever they have to cook every day um you know they dont really care about gourmet stuff but it was the guys that got together and did all this and um like my husband just   oh thats nice   he really really likes to cook in terms of um oh barbecue and i mean all guys i think like to barbecue i think its caveman mentality but um he really does cook and its a good thing because you know you cant you cant knock that but all these other guys do too   right right no   and so weve gotten together and we just do these really elaborate gourmet meals and its really really kind of a neat thing to do you can     how often do you meet   well we try i mean because you know everybody is so active with their kids and all that its like you know if we can do it once every six months we are doing well yeah so i mean we originally started out you know when we were younger  and didnt have so much stuff going on with the kids   oh yes yes uhhuh   um then we would we tried to do it every other month but lately its just been once every six months   yeah oh well thats much more reasonable i was involved in a a club like that for um that you know where we tried to really do gourmet uh meals and uh we   yeah   we were a little bit too frequent i think i dont remember if we were once a month or anyway it was   oh   it was difficult by the time we went around it was uh four couples so uh by the time we got around uh to each of us and it was time again we were almost tired you know   really really   um partly because um  gourmet cooking is not particularly conducive for regular dining its too rich   oh it is absolutely   and so i we found that while we enjoyed the evening we regretted it the next day   yeah   um so uh we we kind of and then one of the couples uh moved and so we sort of didnt didnt continue it but um and i must admit that as you say when your children start taking up your time then you you dont have as much time for uh regular entertaining but um when when we entertain i usually try to find something that would be  um kind of good for everybody and that that sometimes means you cant do gourmet   right   because depending on who your guests are   oh yeah well yeah thats true and we have a gourmet friend that cant stand fish so mean and she can get with in   oh yeah well one of my friends doesnt eat any cheese at all   oh my   uh so thats a real problem because so many dishes require cheese uh well i take that back uh she cant eat some cream cheese but that that really limits um   oh yeah yeah it sure did it makes you uh keep looking for recipes every time you have an eye out for something like right so we we try to keep all that in mind but otherwise um i guess you know entertaining um   oh yeah right   i i guess i have recipes i um but thats thats basically what we do is the gourmet so you know they would be pretty elaborate   umhum yeah   um but its fun i mean it took us four days to cook a stock and three days to make this stuff and you know you get all prepared but youre right its very very rich and im glad we dont have it every   oh wow yeah     because it is its a quite a treat it really is um   yeah sounds wonderful   right but so you like food and i just love the the community of food i just think its neat i just love sharing meals and   oh sure i do too yeah right   and um and whatever you can do you know to do that i dont think you have to be you know more than hamburgers and hot dogs out in the backyard and the and the coleslaw and potato salad but but   right right sure well my um daughter is graduating uh Sunday and so were having a uh few   ah   people in Sunday afternoon and i did a cop out on to it im buying cold cuts  well i have to make a cake and i have to make hors doeuvres and i have to make dessert so i figured for the main thing its going to be sandwiches     but you providing so right right there you go   uh so oh im buying the little tiny rolls and so on but i cant do it you know working fulltime and its just too much   i know were all not built like uh what what the oh   those people that try to do everything   Martha Stewart you know we all arent Martha Stewart and have our coordinated glasses and tablecloths and and time to you know shoot yeah   yeah   wouldnt that be nice   shoot a video of the whole thing i dont know but its its really kind of a neat thing i get a kick out of it i i really do everything all parts of the food i mean i love to make things from scratch you know making breads and   yeah right umhum yeah   and you know people really pretty much appreciate it and   oh they do it its very difficult to purchase um  items that are as good as what you can make yourself   oh i think so   um in spite of uh or if you if you do buy it its extremely expensive in fact uh i just got back from a shopping trip to purchase purchase them cold cuts and i i bought turkey and pastrami and and barbecued ham at a an Amish market near here and ive never been there before and i found that theres uh individual vendors and the foods are wonderful and one of the uh the um  vendors had   oh oh   cakes all sorts of wonderful cakes uh they fresh strawberry strawberry cheesecake now and and so on and its like thirteen fifty for a whole strawberry cheesecake   oh   um which is really not such a bad price i decided i i i just couldnt quite make myself um  buy it because i do make cheesecake and somehow   there you go   i didnt want to do that because it but i was very tempted because it looked wonderful and they they had black forest cherry cake and all those things that are but those are homemade they are not um   oh my   commercial bakery made and in that they are made in their homes um so it its kind of interesting um its out there if you want to pay the price but   oh it is i mean we have bakeries around here that you know you you just gain weight going by the door you know just like that really but i dont know i guess some of the best things ive ever had um   right just smelling the air yeah   i some of them were just hors doeuvres you know doing little hors doeuvre things that   umhum   i have a kick making that i mean you know  i get off on strange little details of food i guess but um   yeah yeah   gee we have so much going on here because  you know this is Dallas this is the southwest this is you know chips and Picante sauce and anything hot you know you can always make it hotter and and lots of stuff like that you know so thats um   umhum right   really good party time eating all that hot food and   yeah   and they just love it you know down here it just just you know all the   we like hot food too so   stuff that goes with that so oh im not thank you for noticing  im from Chicago  and how i got really and well how i got to   right you dont sound like youre from Texas originally though   i thought i thought that there was a slight difference in accent right   Texas by way of Virginia im and everything is a long story but yeah       oh that did um do you have a favorite hors doeuvre recipe thats easy or is it always complicated   well absolutely i in fact it just came to mind um and this
