 The Bell Epoch It s hard to imagine David but when The Coming of Post Industrial Society was first published in 1973 much of the controversy it generated arose from the threat it seemed to present to scientific Marxism How dare Bell suggest that there might be an interim post industrial stage between the twilight of monopoly capitalism and the dawn of socialism You are right that Marx is not in vogue at the moment although there are some soi disant Marxist guerrillas stirring in Colombia I do not know of any Bell ist guerrillas anywhere except perhaps at the American Enterprise Institute You are of course bang right about stock options muddying the old dichotomy between the capitalist and working classes although some people have told me that they can feel quite proletarian when their options are under water Before delving back into this slag heap of a book for additional nuggets let me take a breather and say a few more words about Bell the man He marks himself off from his fellow New York intellectuals by describing himself as a social democrat in economics a liberal in politics and a conservative in culture In the mid 60s he and Irving Kristol founded the policy journal The Public Interest arguing that with the end of ideology the ladder to the City of Heaven must be an empirical one based on hardheaded problem solving Nonetheless in the 80s Bell refused to be lumped with Irving Kristol and the neocons saying Whenever I read about neoconservatism I think That isn t neoconservatism it s just Irving Although it is not always apparent in his writing Bell can be witty sometimes wickedly so About his late brother in law the loveable but notoriously irascible Alfred Kazin he once remarked We re all human but Alfred abuses the privilege An index of Bell s stature abroad An international jury has just honored him with the Prix Tocqueville which carries a cash award of 100 000 French francs Previous recipients include Raymond Aron Karl Popper and Octavio Paz Yiddish was Bell s first language as he grew up on New York s Lower East Side An uncle changed the family name from Bolotsky to Bell Now back to the book The more I think about Bell s farsightedness the less impressed I am by it Most of the trends he wrote about were well established by the early 70s The United States had already become the first nation in the world in which services had come to dominate manufacturing both in employment and as a share of GNP Computerization had been under way for two decades Information technology had been playing an increasing role in industrial production since after the Second World War when the field of operations research inventory control etc was invented to help the U S miliary manage its massive war effort When Bell peers into the future toward the year 2000 his forecasts are often the opposite of what has proved to be the case For instance he predicted that more and more public outcomes would be determined by government technocrats rather than the market the way things are say in France That has not happened as witness for instance health care which after the political fiasco of Hillary Clinton s abortive reform is increasingly being governed by insurance companies and HMOs So what is Bell s achievement in this book He was the first to identify the structural changes in American society that led to the information age He dreamed up a conceptual scheme full of ideal types and whatnot that tied everything together I don t think that conceptual scheme has a whole lot of explanatory or predictive value the way Marx s would if only it were true but at least it has helped us to see the post industrial society steadily and whole and as something qualitatively different from the industrial society that it superseded By naming the thing Bell ushered it into existence Thanks to him we see it as obvious a clich One thing still bothers me though Bell often writes about information as though it is something we consume directly something that makes us happy In fact our utility functions as economists call them have not really changed The final goods from which we derive satisfaction are food and manufactured objects the products of agricultural and industrial society Information has transformed the mode of production rationalized it made production and markets more efficient and so on But the information revolution has not changed the nature of the good life Or has it David
