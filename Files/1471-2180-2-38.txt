 Background Chlamydia pneumoniae is an obligate intracellular bacterium that infects and causes disease in the respiratory tract 1 2 and has recently been associated with heart disease 3 Approximately 10 of pneumoniae cases and 5 of bronchitis and sinusitis cases in the U S are attributed to C pneumoniae infection Pathogenic mechanisms utilized by C pneumoniae to replicate and disseminate within hosts remain unclear Little is known about strain specific determinants of C pneumoniae Isolates of C pneumoniae are virtually indistinguishable using 16s rRNA 4 restriction fragment length polymorphism 5 and amplification fragment length polymorphism analysis 6 Unlike C trachomatis only a single serotype or genotype of C pneumoniae has been identified by any of the above methods Recently three genomes of C pneumoniae have been completed and published These include CWL029 http chlamydia www berkeley edu 4231 7 AR39 http www tigr org 8 and J138 http w3 grt kyushu u ac jp J138 9 Comparative analysis suggests that overall genomic organization and gene order in each C pneumoniae genome is highly conserved 8 9 Given this conservation the study of individual regions of sequence variation will provide insight into strain specific virulence genetic diversity and adaptive responses within and among C pneumoniae populations Genomic analyses have recently revealed a large gene family of 21 polymorphic outer membrane proteins Pmps with predicted outer membrane localization in C pneumoniae 7 10 11 The function of this gene family in chlamydial growth and development remains unknown Several studies have examined genetic variation and strain differentiation of Pmp proteins which may be important for genetic flexibility and adaptive response Recently it has been reported that interstrain and intrastrain variation of gene expression and protein productions of pmpG 6 and pmpG 10 are modulated by deletion of tandem repeats in pmpG 6 9 11 and variation in the length of polyguanosine tract in pmpG 10 12 13 This evidence suggests that variation may be an important requisite for the function of this gene family in the biology of Chlamydiae Examination of the C pneumoniae genome sequences by Daugaard et al 14 demonstrated that a unique and related family of genes is found within the C pneumoniae genome and that variation among strains leads to differences within several members of the gene family Gene products of these paralogous genes contained a unique bi lobed hydrophobic domain which is a predictive marker for localization to the inclusion membrane 15 In this study we further characterize this family by examining variation in sequence of the family members both within and among different C pneumoniae isolates Results Bioinformatic analysis of the Cpn 1054 gene family The Cpn 1054 gene family consists of 11 C pneumoniae specific genes or gene pairs Cpn 07 08 09 010 010 1 011 012 041 042 043 044 045 046 0124 0125 0126 1054 and 1055 1056 Family members indicated with slashes have deletions or internal shifts in reading frame that interrupt otherwise related coding sequences Figure 1 The size of the paralogous repeat unit ranges from approximately 1 500 bp 1055 1056 to approximately 2 800 bp Cpn 007 Family members are located in four separate regions on the chromosome including contig 1 0 1 1 Cpn 007 Cpn 011 012 contig 1 5 1 6 Cpn 041 Cpn 046 contig 2 5 Cpn 0124 126 and contig 13 0 13 1 Cpn 1054 Cpn 1056 The nucleotide sequence identity of the Cpn 1054 gene family members ranged between 20 99 Figure 1 Table 1 Although in some cases the overall sequence similarity among family members is low many share extensive regions of identity at the predicted 5 end Figure 2 This region of identity includes a polyC tract within each paralogous locus The CWL029 genome sequence has predicted GTG codons as a translational initiation site for several family members Cpn 08 010 041 045 and 1055 Figure 2 The conserved hydrophobic domain of the Cpn 1054 gene family In a previous study we demonstrated that a bi lobed 50 60 amino acid hydrophobic domain is a predictive marker for protein localization to the inclusion membrane Inc proteins 15 Consequently 68 C pneumoniae proteins including several members of the Cpn 1054 family Figure 3 were identified as putative inclusion membrane associated proteins The nucleotide sequence found at the 5 end of each paralogous repeat unit represents the region of highest identity among most family members Figure 2 This includes the sequences that encode the major hydrophobic domain of each repeat unit Figure 4A In some cases Cpn 007 124 126 the hydrophobic domain represents the primary reason the gene is included in the Cpn1054 gene family Figure 4A 4B Figure 5 Three nearly identical copies of this domain are found within Cpn 007 Figure 3 a protein that is otherwise not similar to other family members Homopolymeric cytosine poly C tract and the variations of the length of poly C tracts in the Cpn 1054 gene family Genomic analysis of the Cpn 1054 gene family revealed a repeat sequence of 6 to 15 homopolymeric cytosine residues positioned either upstream or immediately within the predicted 5 end of Cpn 008 010 041 043 045 1054 and 1055 Figure 2 Analysis of each sequenced genomes indicated that three Cpn 1054 gene family members had identical polyC tracts in each of the respective genomes Cpn 041 CCCCCCTCCCC Cpn 043 12C and Cpn 045 CCCCCC In each of the other family members however the length of the polyC tract varies in the published genomes These analyses were expanded to examine the polyC tracts in several clinical isolates Sequence data collected directly from amplification products of several Cpn 1054 family members showed that polymorphisms within the polyC tract were present in all tested family members except Cpn 041 and Cpn 045 not shown Therefore the polyC tract in Cpn 041 and Cpn 045 appear to be conserved among isolates a result consistent with the data in the genome sequences In order to examine the clonal variation within other Cpn 1054 family members sequences surrounding the polyC tracts were amplified from selected genes and the products cloned into plasmids The polyC tract was then examined through nucleotide sequence analysis of a selection of independent plasmid constructs Sequence variation within the polyC tract was first examined for Cpn 043 Cpn 1054 and Cpn 1055 of C pneumoniae AR39 Sequence analysis of independent recombinant plasmids showed variability in the length of the polyC tract of each tested gene Figure 6A We next examined variation within a single gene Cpn 1055 using genomic DNAs from strains AR39 AR 458 and PS 32 as template Variation in the length of polyC was observed in this gene from each tested isolate Figure 6B Two approaches were used to demonstrate that the observed variation in length of the polyC tract was not a function of PCR errors during the analysis First two different thermostable polymerases Taq and Pwo polymerase were used to generate the primary amplification products for cloning and subsequent sequence analysis Amplifications with each enzyme resulted in clones with variation in the length of the polyC tract Figure 6C A second approach for examination of the possibility of PCR errors was to reamplify the polyC tract from a single plasmid template and examine the sequence of the polyC tract directly in these amplification products No variation of the length of the polyC tract of Cpn 043 1054 and 1055 was identified in these PCR products not shown These results support the conclusion that the variability in the length of the polyC tracts is not an artifact of the amplification process and thus the observed variability reflects differences at these loci within individual isolates Allelic differences within Cpn 010 010 1 Analysis of published genomic sequence of several 1054 family members identified polymorphisms within several genes Two examples of these polymorphisms can be found in Cpn 010 10 1 and Cpn 1054 family members that are over 98 identical at the nucleotide level 14 Analysis of the published genome sequences indicates that these two genes likely duplicated through nonreciprocal exchanges or by gene conversion 16 Comparative analysis of the three genomes showed that the short sequence polymorphisms are present in Cpn 010 10 1 Cpn 043 and Cpn 1054 14 Cpn 10 10 1 and Cpn 1054 are especially interesting as the two genes differ by only a few nucleotides over a 2 400 base pair coding sequence The primary differences between these genes are 1 a single nucleotide polymorphism SNP that alters the reading frame in 10 10 1 14 and 2 a region of diversity at the 3 end of each gene Figure 7 Daugaard et al 14 identified an RFLP marker that exploits the SNP and other candidate RFLPs can be identified in the 3 region of diversity Figure 7 Short sequence polymorphisms were examined in Cpn 010 10 1 by PCR amplification and nucleotide sequencing in 12 C pneumoniae isolates Variability at both polymorphisms was observed between strains The frameshift mutation leading to the truncated sequence of Cpn 010 was identified in CWL029 and 4 other isolates AR388 AR231 KA5C and KA66 not shown The 3 polymorphism that distinguishes Cpn 10 10 1 from Cpn 1054 was found within Cpn 10 1 in two isolates AR39 and AC43 Figure 7 There was no apparent linkage between the central frameshift mutation and the 3 polymorphism as the two regions varied independent of one another There was also no evidence that these sequences vary within individual C pneumoniae isolates Discussion Relatively little is known about molecular pathogenesis genetic diversity and adaptive strategy of C pneumoniae Although the genomic organization of these independent strains is very similar over 99 9 identical there are regions of variation within each isolate 8 In the present study we have identified a paralogous gene family within C pneumoniae designated as the Cpn 1054 gene family This family consists of eleven paralogous loci with single repeat elements consisting of single ORFs or ORF pairs The identity of the predicted polypeptide sequences shared among family members ranges from 20 99 It is likely that the diversity of these genes arose through gene duplication and subsequent diversification It appears that certain duplications were relatively recent as at least two of the repeated loci Cpn 010 10 1 and Cpn 1054 are nearly identical Analysis of the three genomes also demonstrates that apparent gene conversion has occurred between 10 10 1 and 1054 in strain AR39 16 and that an intact 1054 ORF is found within each sequenced genome 14 However its location varies between the two loci The redundant nature of the Cpn 1054 family members is somewhat unusual against the generally reductive evolutionary strategy of the chlamydiae 17 There is no evidence that the Cpn 1054 gene family is found outside of C pneumoniae and thus the members of the family may be important in the unique biological traits of this species Gene duplication and subsequent genetic drift are the likely means by which variation is manifested between members of the Cpn 1054 gene family Variation is also observed within individual family members both between strains 14 and as shown in this report within individual isolates Several gene family members including Cpn 008 010 043 1054 and 1055 contain homopolymeric cytosine repeats either upstream or at the predicted 5 end of the coding region In C pneumoniae variation of the short repeat of homopolymeric nucleotides was first identified in the pmp family Comparative genomic analysis and cloning expression showed that the length of the polyG tract of pmpG 10 varies between strains and within an isolate 12 13 Furthermore variation of the length of polyG has been demonstrated that it plays a role in the differential expression of PmpG 10 12 Variability in short nucleotide repeats generated via slipped strand mispairing are key elements in the generation of phenotypic diversity within many pathogenic microorganisms 18 Further investigation will be required to determine if the expression of members of the Cpn 1054 gene family is affected by the observed variability in length of the polyC tract Although the proteins in the Cpn 1054 gene family are classified as candidate inclusion membrane proteins 15 their subcellular locations and role in infection and disease remain to be identified It is also not yet known whether the Cpn 1054 gene family is expressed individually or coordinately or to what extent each gene is expressed during the course of an infection However the variation both within and between strains is a potential requisite for this gene family that may contribute to the unique biology of C pneumoniae Conclusions The C pneumoniae genome contains a gene family the Cpn 1054 gene family consisting of 18 different genes in 11 paralogous loci Variation is observed both within and among isolates This variation may be useful for the biotyping of C pneumoniae clinical isolates and may be important in phenotypic diversity within the species Methods Bacterial strains plasmids and C pneumoniaegenomes All experiments were conducted using a collection of independent
