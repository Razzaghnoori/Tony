 Background DNA microarray analysis has become the most widely used technique for the study of gene expression patterns on a genomic scale 1 2 Differential microarray co hybridization assays measure the relative gene expression of paired query and reference samples and the power of microarray analysis comes from identification of informative patterns of gene expression across multiple experiments Achieving both these objectives is facilitated by using a common reference sample that provides a baseline expression measure for each gene enabling normalization and comparison of independent experiments Pooled RNA derived from cell lines is a commonly used reference sample To provide optimal coverage of genes spotted on the array reference samples are often constructed from a large number of cell lines from a variety of tissues One example is the universal human RNA reference commercially available from Stratagene 3 This reference consists of equimolar quantities of RNA from ten human cancer cell lines representing ten different tissues B cells breast brain cervix liver lipocytes macrophage skin T cells and testis Another challenging technical consideration in microarray analysis is the cutoff value used to distinguish differential expression from natural variability in the data A cutoff of twofold up or down regulation has been chosen to define differential expression in most published studies 1 2 However little has been done to evaluate the accuracy of the technique and assess the confidence levels for various fold level changes in expression ratios In addition microarray analysis is a complex multistep technique involving array fabrication labeling hybridization and data analysis and many laboratories have developed a variety of protocols for each of these steps 4 5 Studies by a number of groups using a range of protocols and including many different RNA samples will give a better picture of how reliable microarrays are for elucidating gene expression profiles In this study we evaluate the performance of cDNA microarrays using our current laboratory and data analysis protocols and derive a new intensity dependent approach to identifying differentially expressed genes RNA from 19 different human cancer cell lines the Stratagene universal reference RNA and RNA isolated from a tumor specimen were assayed in a series of self self hybridizations on a 19 200 element cDNA array containing 9 600 elements spotted in duplicate Statistical analysis of the ratios of Cy5 Cy3 fluorescence intensities among this large number of distinct samples provides insight into the variation inherent in expression ratios extracted from cDNA microarrays We assess reproducibility of array experiments by analyzing replicates using both clones spotted in duplicate on the same array and in triplicate hybridization assays In addition we use the methodology developed in this study to compare expression in a colon and an ovarian cell line to identify tissue specific genes Self self hybridization results for individual cell lines were also analyzed to determine the composition of an optimal reference pool consisting of RNA derived from cell lines Our underlying hypothesis was that pooling a large number of cell lines might not necessarily improve the overall gene representation Although some cell lines express significantly more genes than others not all cell lines express all genes at the same levels Consequently mixing cell lines may dilute rare transcripts so that their representation in the final RNA pool is below the detectable limit Results of our analysis will aid in the future assessment of gene expression patterns and the design of reference RNA samples Results and discussion Cell line self self hybridizations To evaluate the natural variability present in spotted cDNA microarray data across a number of distinct RNA samples we carried out a set of self self assays in which aliquots of the same RNA are separately labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 dyes and co hybridized to a single microarray Poly A RNA was prepared from 19 human carcinoma cell lines 2 brain 5 colon 10 ovarian 1 pancreatic and 1 testicular and Stratagene s universal human reference RNA RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using random hexamer primers in the presence of 5 aminoallyl dUTP Cy3 and Cy5 dyes were covalently coupled to the incorporated aminoallyl linkers in a subsequent labeling reaction For each cell line Cy3 and Cy5 cDNA samples were co hybridized to a spotted microarray containing 19 200 human cDNA clones 9 600 clones printed in duplicate Hybridization results were analyzed to determine relative expression levels for each printed element and hybridization intensity data were first normalized globally using an iterative mean log 2 ratio centering approach Briefly log 2 ratio values were calculated for each array element and the mean of the distribution was calculated Ratios were adjusted such that the mean log 2 ratio for the entire collection of genes was set to zero or a corresponding average ratio of 1 As outliers can significantly influence this process these were identified and excluded and the process repeated until convergence This process results in an average Cy5 Cy3 log 2 ratio of zero for the spots analyzed in each microarray We and others have noted that the log 2 ratio values often have a systematic dependence on intensity most often observed as a deviation from zero for low intensity spots Locally weighted linear regression lowess 6 has been proposed as a normalization method for microarray assays 7 8 that can remove intensity dependent dye specific effects in the log 2 ratio values In this procedure fluorescence intensities are measured from both channels for all elements on the array and the log 2 Cy5 Cy3 ratios for each spot are represented as a function of the log 10 Cy5 Cy3 product intensities Scatter plots of such data referred to as an R I plot for ratio intensity can reveal intensity specific artifacts in the measurement of the ratio which tend to occur most notably for weakly fluorescing arrayed elements For a self self hybridization of the type analyzed here one expects a mean log 2 Cy5 Cy3 ratio of zero for each element in the array independent of intensity Lowess enables deviations from this expected behavior to be detected and corrected by performing a local weighted linear regression for each data point in the R I plot and subtracting the average ratio from the experimentally observed ratio A representative R I plot for the cell line KM12L4A in Figure 1shows a slight upward curve of the log 2 ratio for low intensity data points shown in blue which is removed after application of the lowess correction producing a balanced distribution of expression ratios around zero independent of intensity shown in red Similar plots including a calculated standard deviation SD both before and after lowess correction are shown in Figure 1c The most important feature of the data is the narrow distribution of ratios in individual array experiments regardless of the RNA sample assayed in each experiment This is also true of the entire dataset as can be seen in the histogram of combined expression ratios from 30 experiments shown in Figure 2 These results are comparable to those obtained in a recent study of 30 self self hybridizations on 10 000 element cDNA arrays 9 Yue et al 9 created histograms for three sets of data each consisting of 10 independent array experiments using mRNA derived from human placenta brain and heart tissue In one of their data sets a 2 SD limit of 1 25 fold was observed combined 99 5 of the data points were within 1 4 fold A small number of distinct samples 3 in combination with a large number of replicates per sample 10 most probably accounts for the slightly tighter distribution of expression ratios than that observed in our study The second important aspect of our dataset is the number of outliers approximately 5 of the data points in each array fall outside of 2 SD from the mean data not shown While this is not unexpected it suggests that the distribution of log 2 ratio values does not deviate badly from normal This is of a particular significance because it should enable detection of genes with low levels of differential expression at high confidence in future studies Combining all data from all 30 hybridizations the 2 SD limit is equivalent to 1 46 fold change 0 546 log 2 ratio only 18 221 out of 332 601 points or 5 5 of the expression ratios fall outside a 2 SD threshold Consequently if differential expression is defined as greater than 2 SD from the mean genes with fold changes greater than 1 5 can be classified as up or down regulated at approximately 95 confidence level Good quality array data can only be generated using well developed and extensively tested laboratory and data analysis protocols Our group has been working continuously to improve our laboratory procedures and implement new data analysis methods One of the changes recently adopted by ours and many other laboratories is indirect cDNA labeling As first strand cDNA synthesis is identical for both samples incorporation of nucleotides with an aminoallyl linker followed by the covalent coupling reaction to Cy dyes reduces bias for incorporation of one dye over the other by the reverse transcriptase Slight dye specific effects are present in normalized low intensity data probably caused by a wavelength dependent differential response of the photomultiplier tubes in the array scanners or slight differences or nonlinearities in the quantum efficiencies of the fluorescent dyes but these can be efficiently removed by the application of the lowess correction Tissue sample self self hybridization In our experience hybridization using RNA derived from tissue samples is generally more problematic than that derived from cell lines To determine whether data of comparable quality can be generated with tissue RNA we carried out a similar expression analysis using RNA derived from a colon tumor liver metastasis Twenty micrograms of total RNA that have been extracted using Trizol and subjected to secondary purification using Qiagen RNeasy columns were labeled with both Cy3 and Cy5 and examined in a self self co hybridization assay The distribution of expression ratios is in excellent agreement with cell line data only 507 out of 11 743 4 3 of identified spots fall outside the 1 42 fold change 2 SD limit Intensity dependent estimation of differential expression While lowess normalization greatly reduces dye specific artifacts that often appear for low intensity data points the data exhibit additional structure that can be used to evaluate patterns of gene expression As can be seen in Figure 1a the log 2 ratio measures generally show greater variation at lower intensities Most published microarray studies use a single log 2 ratio threshold as a measure of differential expression Examination of the distribution in Figure 1suggests that this may inappropriately identify genes at intensities where the natural variation in the data would not support their selection while at the same time causing genes to be missed in other intensities where the data suggest that much lower log 2 ratio values are statistically significant Several mathematical models have been derived to explain this phenomenon 10 11 12 13 14 One 10 discusses the use of a smoothed estimate of the SD as a function of the fluorescence intensity The study conducted by Hughes et al 11 shows how their model for estimating intensity dependent differential expression can be used to identify biologically meaningful differential regulation at levels lower than twofold in a compendium of 300 different Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants and chemical treatments We developed a much simpler approach to identify differentially expressed genes using an intensity dependent calculation of a standard Z score Using a sliding window of fixed width in log 10 Cy5 Cy3 the local mean and SD was calculated for each gene using the data in the normalized R I plot Figure 3adepicts the result of such a calculation for the cell line KM12L4A with data less than 1 SD shown blue between 1SD and 2SD in green and greater than 2 SD in red respectively genes greater than 2 SD from the local mean Z 2 are identified as being significantly differentially expressed The shape of the R I plot and the Z score distributions are characteristic of the samples being compared in the microarray assay under consideration For closely related samples such as RNA from a cell line and the same line perturbed with a stressor the R I distribution has a tadpole shape similar to that shown for our self self hybridization although typically with a slightly broader distribution in the log 2 ratio than that shown in Figure 3a When two very different samples or tissues are compared however the distribution generally has a characteristic eye shape with the greatest spread coming at intermediate expression levels Figure 3bshows the results from a hybridization comparing the CaC02 colon and PA 1 ovary cell lines Analysis of replicates Expression data for clones spotted in duplicate were examined to assess reproducibility within each array Plots of the log 2 transformed ratios of the Cy5 and Cy3 intensities for the two replicates were generated for this purpose As can be seen in the representative plot in Figure 4a blue log 2 Cy5 Cy3 values form a sphere centered around zero with the majority of data points lying between 0 5 and 0 5 on both axes However a small number of outliers is present and probably represent situations where one or both of the replica spots are of poor quality Similar plots were obtained for the other 29 self self hybridization assays data not shown Because one cannot determine a priori which of the duplicates is in error irreproducible elements should be removed before any further analysis unless many more replicates are analyzed The idea of outlier filtering was also incorporated into the model for the intensity dependence of expression ratios introduced by Baggerly et al 10 we developed a simple approach to flag and eliminate questionable replicates Ideally Cy5 Cy3 ratios should be the same for the two replicas and log 2 r 1 r 2 where r 1 and r 2 are Cy5 Cy3 ratios for the two replicas should be equal to zero replicates where this condition is not satisfied probably contain one or more bad elements Consequently we sought to filter out genes whose log 2 r 1 r 2 deviates greatly from this expected value of zero We calculated the mean and SD of this log 2 r 1 r 2 for each pair of replicas in the entire array and eliminated pairs of elements whose log 2 r 1 r 2 is greater than 2 SD from the mean In Figure 4a 6 3 of data points were eliminated using this outlier criterion red resulting in a much tighter dataset We also examined duplicate clone filtering in a hybridization assay of two different samples CaCO2 and PA 1 Figure 4b In the case of differential expression the correlation of the replica ratios is expected to be linear The correlation increases from r 0 86 blue dashed line to r 0 95 red solid line after 1 7 of outliers are filtered out using the method outlined above The substantial increase in the correlation coefficient suggests that our filtering procedure efficiently removes elements with at least one unreliable log 2 Cy5 Cy3 value A similar approach can be used to identify questionable replicate spots on separate slides To show this five cell lines CaOV3 HCT 116 KM12L4A NT2 D1 and SW480 were selected and assayed in triplicate In addition expression in CaCO2 and PA 1 was compared in triplicate hybridizations RNA from the same isolation was used for replicate hybridizations thus allowing us to concentrate on technical and not biological replication and to explore more thoroughly the systematic errors that can arise Replicate slides were subject to filtering in pairs arrays 1 and 2 2 and 3 1 and 3 using a process analogous to that applied to within slide replicates representative data are shown in Figure 5 Correlations of log 2 Cy5 Cy3 values for the three pairs of arrays before blue dashed line and after red solid line filtering for the CaOV3 cell line self self hybridizations are shown in Figure 5a The same set of plots for differential expression assays of CaCO2 and PA 1 cell lines including linear fits to the data is shown in Figure 5b Triplicate hybridization assays enable us to assess variability among independent labeling reactions and hybridizations As can be seen in Figure 5a there is some variation in correlations for each pair of hybridization replicas arrays 1 and 2 as well as 2 and 3 show better correlation than do arrays 1 and 3 When averaged over three pairs of replicas however the variability between arrays is comparable to within array variation Similar results were obtained for the remaining four cell lines data not shown For the case of hybridizations of two different samples Figure 5b the mean r values increase significantly from 0 83 blue dashed lines to 0 94 red solid lines after outliers in each pair of hybridizations are filtered out These correlations are as in the case of self self hybridizations similar to those seen for within array replicas Our analysis suggests that replication is essential for ensuring data quality whether spotting replicate clones on single arrays or performing multiple independent hybridization assays Further the replicate filtering process we describe here is a simple approach that can eliminate questionable array elements and provide higher confidence expression measurements Identification of differentially expressed genes To show how the concepts presented in this study can be applied to detect differentially regulated genes we sought to identify sets of genes that are over and under expressed in ovary relative to colon by analyzing hybridization assays of CaCO2 colon and PA 1 ovary cell lines The CaCO2 sample was labeled with Cy3 and the PA 1 sample was labeled with Cy5 genes that are expressed in colon at much higher levels will therefore have negative log ratios and ovary genes will have positive log ratios For this analysis we applied the process outlined in the previous discussion as follows First individual arrays were normalized using mean log centering and lowess procedures as outlined in the Cell line self self hybridizations section Next unreliable spots among triplicate arrays were eliminated using the filtering approach discussed in the Analysis of replicates section Then intensity dependent SDs on the log 2 ratio were computed for each array as described in the Intensity dependent estimation of differential expression section Array elements with ratios outside the 2 SD limit were defined as differentially regulated 510 543 and 523 were identified in each individual assay Finally the intersection of differentially expressed genes on all three arrays was taken this resulted in a list of 324 array elements 225 genes as some are within array replicates of which 157 109 genes have higher expression in colon and 167 116 genes are more highly expressed in the ovary relative to colon A list of differentially expressed genes with mean log 2 Cy5 Cy3 values and SD calculated over three experiments is available see Additional data files The small SDs illustrate the reproducibility of measurements made using the methods described here and show their ability to provide a high confidence list of differentially expressed genes and their expression ratios In an attempt to validate the differential expression we observed in this assay we compared our results to the expression patterns derived from EST libraries generated from 18 colon and 12 ovarian sources including normal tissue cancer tissue and cell lines using the digital differential display DDD available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information NCBI 15 see Additional data files Although these data sets are not completely complementary we identified one gene that is significantly upregulated in the colon relative to ovary PLAB coding for prostate differentiation factor Hs 296638 THC888554 and one gene that is overexpressed in the ovary relative to colon 24 dehydrocholesterol reductase DHCR24 Hs 75616 THC932478 in both microarray and DDD data We also identified three gene families significantly differentially expressed in both datasets We found genes in the solute carrier families 34 Hs 84700 DDD 22 THC960422 microarray and 16 THC863879 microarray as well as laminin A5 Hs 11669 DDD and A4 THC933239 microarray to be more abundant in the ovary In addition serologically defined colon cancer antigens 28 Hs 84700 DDD and 33 THC899239 microarray were more highly represented in colon However we also found two discrepancies in relative abundances of one gene and one gene family between the DDD and microarray data DDD data indicate that the protein kinase inhibitor P58 Hs 177574 THC906738 is more abundant in the ovary but the same gene appears to be more highly represented in the colon in our microarray study Similarly insulin like growth factor binding protein 3 Hs 77326 DDD is upregulated in the ovary relative to colon while the opposite is true for insulin like growth factor binding protein 6 THC1022140 microarray To further validate our findings we performed quantitative real time reverse transcription PCR RT PCR assays on 25 genes with log 10 R G and log 2 R G values encompassing the entire range present in the microarray data Expression ratios obtained by quantitative RT PCR see Additional data files are in good agreement with the ratios obtained using microarrays This concordance is especially significant for genes with low expression ratios and for transcripts expressed at low copy number confirming the validity of our approach for obtaining a high confidence list of differentially expressed genes RT PCR data also showed that the P58 protein kinase inhibitor Hs 177574 THC906738 is upregulated in the colon relative to ovary which supports our array results and suggests that the discrepancy between microarrays and DDD is not due to technical limitations of microarray assays but reflects a true biological difference between the cell lines we compared and tissues used in DDD Reference pool selection Comparison of query samples to a common reference sample is among the most widely used experimental designs for large scale microarray studies 16 17 Reference samples often consist of pools of RNA molecules derived from cell lines because cell lines provide a renewable source of large quantities of RNA Each cell line expresses a distinct assortment of RNA species so any particular cell line will provide measurable baseline hybridization for only a subset of the genes on an array Consequently cell line RNA reference pools are typically constructed from a large number 10 or more of cell lines derived from a variety of primary tissues The idea underlying such a design is that by combining RNAs from diverse cell lines one might obtain a more complete representation of the genes spotted on the array This approach however does not take into account the expression levels of individual genes in each cell line While genes expressed at high levels will give detectable signal even when diluted by a factor of 10 many of the more rare transcripts may get diluted to below the detection limit Therefore we hypothesized that comparable or better representation of spotted genes might be obtained using fewer cell lines each expressing a large number of diverse genes To test this hypothesis we constructed two reference pools TP 1 and TP 2 using a naive gene counting approach designed to include three cell lines with the greatest representation of unique genes that are also easy to grow and yield high quantities of RNA TP 1 consists of colon cell lines CaCO2 and KM12L4A as well as the ovarian cell line OVCAR3 OVCAR3 is replaced with the U118MG brain cell line in TP 2 The results of our analysis are summarized in Figure 6 which shows a histogram representing the percentage of array elements with signals in both Cy3 and Cy5 channels in self self hybridizations The performance of TP 1 is comparable to that of the Stratagene pool approximately 75 despite a large difference in the number of cell lines in each pool This supports our hypothesis that adding more cell lines to the pool may not necessarily improve the overall gene representation because some genes are diluted below the detection limit Including cell lines from very dissimilar tissues may however give a better representation of the genes on the array TP 2 contains a brain instead of an ovarian cell line and covers close to 80 of the spotted sequences This improved performance relative to TP 1 is likely to be due both to the fact that brain exhibits the greatest diversity of transcripts on the basis of based EST and serial analysis of gene expression SAGE analysis and that the subset of genes expressed in brain is more disjoint with the genes observed in colon than in ovary This illustrates that a simple pool of RNA from diverse cell lines can provide a superior reference Conclusion DNA microarray assays performed using well optimized laboratory protocols can produce high quality reproducible data although the use of replicates particularly dye reversal or flip dye assays are highly desirable While global normalization of the data can help to provide meaningful expression ratios a more sophisticated normalization using lowess allows for correction of intensity dependent artifacts in the data Together the laboratory and analytical techniques described here can produce highly precise and accurate data In the 30 assays we performed the global 2 SD limit corresponded to an expression ratio between 1 33 fold and 1 62 fold induction or repression with a mean of 1 47 corresponding to log 2 ratio values of 0 41 0 70 and 0 56 respectively with fewer than 5 of the data points falling outside the 2 SD limit This suggests that changes in gene expression smaller than the 2 fold commonly used can be reliably identified as differential expression More careful analysis of the distribution of ratios as a function of intensity suggests that an intensity dependent assessment of local SD of the distribution provides a better measure of statistically significant differential expression essentially calculating a local Z score The same holds true for tissue RNA from tumor samples Individual labeling reactions and hybridizations do not introduce significant variability as judged from good correlations of replicate experiments However a small number of outliers present in replicate spots and or arrays can be filtered out underlining the importance of replicates in generating high quality expression data Pooled reference samples should be designed on the basis not only of representation of individual genes in each cell line but also of expression levels of genes within the cell lines Adding more cell lines to the pool does not necessarily improve overall gene representation because rare transcripts become undetectable when diluted in a pool of a large number of cell lines Overall the data presented herein derived from a large number of RNA samples from cell lines and tissue suggest that the laboratory and data analysis protocols we describe should allow for a more accurate and reproducible identification of differentially expressed genes than does the selection of an arbitrary global fold change threshold chosen independent of any measure of the natural variability in the data We propose a model for analysis of cDNA microarray data consisting of three steps lowess normalization of individual arrays followed by replica filtering to remove questionable elements and finally estimation of the local Z score for identification of differentially regulated genes Materials and methods Array fabrication cDNA clones were obtained from the Research Genetics sequence verified human cDNA collection Clone inserts were PCR amplified directly from

Arrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000 dual color confocal laser scanner Axon Data were collected in Cy3 and Cy5 channels and stored as paired TIFF images Data analysis Spots were identified and local background subtracted in the TIGR_Spotfinder software 19 In the first step a grid consisting of square cells is drawn around each array element Spot segmentation is then performed using a histogram segmentation method that uses the distribution of pixel intensities to separate probable signal from background and a binary thresholding approach to identify spots followed by a procedure to exclude disconnected features Raw intensity for each element is obtained by first excluding saturated pixels and then summing all remaining pixel intensities inside the spot contour The area outside the spot contour but inside the cell is used to calculate local background Background per pixel is estimated as a median of the pixels in this area and is multiplied by the spot area to give an estimated spot background value In the final step this integrated background value is subtracted from the raw integrated spot intensity to produce the background subtracted integrated intensities we use for further analysis Furthermore a quality control QC filter is used to remove questionable array features Two criteria for spot rejection are a spot shape that deviates greatly from a circle and low signal to noise ratio Spots for which the ratio of area to circumference deviates by more than 20 from the value for an ideal circle and spots containing fewer than 50 of pixels above the median background value are flagged and eliminated from further consideration This approach has proved extremely robust to misidentification of the spot boundaries and expression measures have shown it to be both reproducible and verifiable The output data from Spotfinder is available as additional data files Lowess normalization was implemented using a native Java implementation in TIGR MIDAS
