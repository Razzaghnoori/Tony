 Web Weather Today A few nights ago I turned on Channel 4 to watch the 6 p m weather forecast Or rather I turned on Channel 4 to watch meteorologist Bob Ryan It was a deeply satisfying six minutes Bob s brow was furrowed his jaw was tense A cold front he warned had gathered strength in the Canadian Rockies and cut a swath across the Midwest It was now bearing down on Washington D C threatening to wallop the Washington area with 6 to 8 inches of snow Then his mouth relaxed slightly He said that a high pressure system was building in the Southeast and would shoot a blast of warm air up the Atlantic coast Would it reach us in time to fend off the snow Bob was hopeful American weather forecasters like to say that the United States has the most exciting weather in the world It s biblical from hurricanes to blizzards droughts to floods and the occasional plague of locusts for good measure I don t know if the United States does have the most exciting weather but it certainly has the most exciting weather forecasts They too are biblical The ancient Greeks ascribed lightning to Zeus we haven t made much progress The weather forecast is still an epic a story of God s war with man Hot and cold air masses clash storms strike and sweeping fronts ravage the nation The forecast is a tale of heroes the noble high pressure system savage villains Hurricane Andrew and omnipotent inexplicable deities El Ni o the Jet Stream I m sure I m not the only one who feels a frisson when a forecaster announces that a cold front is descending from Canada as if some malevolent Arctic god were coming to exact revenge for the sins of Washington Weather in short is a crackling good story infused with enough drama to sustain local news broadcasts millions of water cooler conversations and an entire cable channel So imagine my excitement when I stumbled upon the Web weather industry Here was a world of weather 24 hours a day weather personalized weather global weather fishing weather flying weather farming weather e mail weather graphics weather text weather Its breadth boggles the mind CNN forecasts day and night on its snazzy weather site So do USA Today MSNBC and The Weather Channel which has claimed the best weather address on the Web Other Web forecasters include weatherOnline INTELLICAST WeatherNet TVWeather AccuWeather Geocities Canada s The Weather Network BBC Weather and the National Weather Service to name only the mainstream sites There is of course something obviously ironic about all this Web weather The Web doesn t have any weather unless you count the hot air that envelops most newsgroups In fact you could argue that the entire point of cyberspace is to have no weather to liberate us from the mundane and inconvenient physical world But the Web will have weather weather or not Indeed Web weather technology is as sophisticated as it gets The sites make television s Weather Channel look amateurish or rather even more amateurish than it already looks All the sites are constantly updated You never have to wait for a forecast The sites are both easy to navigate and comprehensive On most a few mouse clicks will retrieve the five day forecast for any ZIP code any city any state any nation complete with smiling sun frowning raindrop animations You like satellite photos The Web lets you download current satellite images of any corner of the earth On several sites you can string together the last few hours of satellite photos into a cloud movie Are you big on ground radar Most sites offer pictures from more than 100 Dopplers Many will let you monitor earthquake activity ozone levels humidity and flood threats All the sites rely on essentially the same package of NWS data satellite photos and Doppler images so they do have a certain laundry detergent quality same powder different box This monotony is reminiscent of sports Web sites which also draw from a single well of data So sites strive desperately to build brand identity Some make four day forecasts instead of five day forecasts Some dispense with jaunty graphics delivering temperatures in sober gray text Some niche market to pilots sailors or farmers CNN and the Weather Channel supply a weather newswire Light snow dusts the Dakotas West is dry An illustrated weather encyclopedia accompanies USA Today s site And weatherOnline reviews weather media and will soon launch The Adventures of Weatherboy a cartoon based on the exploits such as they are of a real life teen weather forecaster The grand prize for gimmickry goes to AccuWeather com It devotes an entire Web page to the most important weather in the world mine When the password works which is rarely I can view David Plotz s Personal AccuWeather TM This page has my five day forecast well Washington D C s a chart of my current weather conditions actually National Airport s and a radar map centered over my house Sterling Va but who s counting It s exactly the same information available on all the other Web weather sites but it s got my name on it At this point I am supposed to pause to pay homage to the miraculous Internet Web weather I should say displays all the medium s virtues Efficiency Convenience Personalized service A rich supply no a surfeit of useful information How extremely useful it is Too useful actually Even the best Web weather sites USA Today INTELLICAST The Weather Channel manage to do what I thought was impossible They make weather boring Following weather on the Web is like following baseball by reading scorecards The weather forecast is more than rain You must also hear the story of the rain Where is it coming from Whose fault is it Canada s The Great Lakes The Bermuda High s What kind of rain is it When it will arrive Will the Jet Stream protect us from it Is it much needed or unwelcome You do need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows But the Web dispenses with all that The cyberforecast is purely mechanical and purely boring Even the Web s supposed innovation individualized forecasts is depressing We no longer make common cause against the weather god Now I have my weather David Plotz s Personal AccuWeather TM and you have yours Fortunately not all Web weather is such a drag Commercial sites comprise only a fraction of online meteorology Just as it has for New Jersey Nets fans and Whitewater conspiracists and foot fetishists the Web has also given birth to a community of weather fanatics Granted theirs is a most peculiar kingdom It feels almost exactly like a normal place you can shop travel talk learn watch movies except there is only one subject weather Amateur meteorologists for example make chitchat at two Usenet newsgroups devoted to general weather sci geo meteorology and uk sci weather True devotees talk shop at even more specialized groups such as one on Northeastern weather ne weather whose recent conversation topics included the great blizzard of 1978 and the freak snowstorm of May 1977 Weather obsessives shop on the Web Three count em online weather stores including the WeatherStore hawk meteorological gizmos Favorite gizmo the weather radio which is tuned permanently to National Weather Service broadcasts You can plan a weather holiday on the Web At least two outfits including Cloud 9 Tours sell storm chasing tours online Designed for folks who ve watched Twister too many times these vacations consist of spending two weeks driving a van around the bleakest parts of the Midwest hunting for tornadoes Weather voyeurs can sneak a glance at more than 100 weather cameras filming the skies in other cities Weather games weather videos weather prizes they have all found their way to the Web There is even weather identity politics Women in Weather profiles female meteorologists and hosts discussions about topics female and meteorological We re both meteorologists how will we both get jobs in the same place It may be the disaster sites that best capture the spirit of the weather Web Dozens and dozens of sites such as Eye on the World celebrate tsunamis typhoons hurricanes droughts and of course tornadoes Most are illustrated with brutal photos of beached ships downed trees and shattered houses These sites are I think the meteorological equivalent of snuff films They prove that even when all you care about is weather the Web still has plenty of dirty pictures to show you
