                            At first glance the preschool classroom on the other side of the twoway mirror looks        like any otherbrightly colored rugs scattered toys and tiny chairs But almost        immediately an observer notices differences in the Team Toddle students here at the        Neuropsychiatric Institute of the University of California at Los Angeles UCLA Los        Angeles California United States        A therapist instructs a toddler on his colors flashing a rapid sequence of blocks at        him When the toddler starts rocking in his chair and repeatedly touching his forehead the        therapist physically restrains his hands placing them back on the tabletop until he stops        the repetitive behaviors and focuses once again on her face and the blocks During        playtime a twoyearold girl sits by herself in the corner fixated on some picture cards        oblivious to a group of other children playing with a racetrack and to the therapist who        tries to draw her out to join the group        These children lack some of the key social skills that normal toddlers pick up        naturallylooking to others for reassurance or cues focusing on faces and playing        together Social and communication impairment is a hallmark of autism and can show up as        early as  months of age But with an unknown cause and genetic linkages still hazy        there is little consensus among researchers on how the disorder develops in children and        how it causes a broad spectrum of social language and behavioral deficits        Following one line of research David Amarals laboratory at the MIND Institute at        the University of California at Davis Medical Center in Sacramento California United        States has recorded in autistic brains a brain volume increase in a specific structure        the amygdala which is thought to be important for social behavior A similar study at the        University of Washington in Seattle UW Seattle Washington United States has reached        the same conclusion There are so few facts about autism to have two labs come up with        the same data is phenomenal says Amaral We feel confident this is a real finding but        what does it mean to these kids        On another research track using functional imaging RalphAxel Mller a cognitive        neuroscientist at San Diego State University San Diego California United States sees a        scattering of brain activation in autistic brains that he views as an indication of a more        general brain development problem underlying the disorder Figure  He has hypothesized        that the earlydeveloping basic functions may require more brain area in autism pushing        out and disturbing the later specialization for more complex functions Im sure this is        wrong he says but it will allow us to look in a more hypothesisdriven way at animal        studies of how the cerebral cortex develops specialization Animal models may in turn        yield clues about normal and abnormal brain development in humans        Since there is no major hypothesis as to cause of autism there are many plausible        ideas says Amaral If we go after all of them we will waste all of our resources We        have to come to some consensus about which are most plausible At least two levels of        pursuit exist for tracing brain problems associated with autismthe exploration of the        general developmental disruptions that result in an autistic brain and the examination of        more specific problems in particular brain structures that produce symptoms Although        scientists still debate how autism evolves in a patient the field has begun in the last        decade to replicate findings and make sciencebased arguments for interventions Progress        has come in small steps with advances in neuroimaging and more rigorous experimental        designs        Research focuses have shifted from curing autism to finding better diagnostics for        early intervention improving behavioral therapies and gaining insight into the        development and function of the autistic brain Both advocacy groups and government        programs have started to bring together neuroscience and genetics experts clinicians and        families to sharpen the focus of studies and ensure progress in what has often been a messy        field                    A World Apart        Autism spectrum disorder strikes between one and six out of every  children around        the world but diagnosis and treatment are currently limited to developed countries Autism        is four times more prevalent in boys than girls but makes no racial ethnic or        socioeconomic distinctions It is characterized by three main symptoms impaired language        social and communicative deficits and repetitive and stereotyped behaviors such as hand        flapping rocking and unusual responses to sensory stimuli Autism spectrum disorders can        be broken down into other categories such as lowfunctioning autism IQ below         highfunctioning autism IQ above  and Asperger syndrome similar to highfunctioning        autism but with no language deficit        Researchers suspect that there are even more distinct subsets of autism patients For        example some patients also have epilepsy and it has been suggested that there is a        regressive form of autismchildren who at two or three years of age appear to regress and        lose developmental milestones they had already achieved Researchers say that sorting out        these different profilesor phenotypesof autism will be especially important in sorting        out which genes or which brain abnormalities are implicated for particular deficits This        sorting should also help clarify the mounds of contradictory data that have dogged the        field by tamping down the experimental noise in studies Boosting the number of children        studied and following them from early infancy through adolescence and beyond will also be        key components of future studies        There is not going to be rapid progress in autism research unless we subtype Amaral        says He predicts that brain differences in kids with a regressive form of autism will be        different than those of kids with the more congenital type of autism He and others are        teaming up in an autism phenotyping project that will characterize  children into        categories of autism comparing them to  children with mental retardation and         controls Splitting autism into subtypes will boost both neurobiology and genetics studies        Box  to find real effects related to specific traits                    Facing Up to Autism        A key area of research explores the brains response to human faces at a young age        Studies at the UW Autism Center have shown that unlike typically developing        threeyearolds autistic children do not show a differential brain response to their        mothers face compared to that of a stranger While dysfunctional face recognition may be        one of the more devastating symptoms for caregivers it is also one of the most promising        avenues for research to determine how autistic brains process their world differently        Sara Webb a child psychologist at UW has followed about  autistic children since the        age of three for a longitudinal study that will test many parameters until they reach age        nine Her work has already shown that autistic threeyearolds process seeing a strange toy        differently from seeing a favorite toy in the same way a normal child does But activity        in their brainsmeasured through a network of electrodes placed on the scalpis similar        whether the face is familiar for example mom or strange This Webb says led to two        hypotheses either the brain area for face processing is not set up correctly in autistic        children or the way these children incorporate experiences from their environment is so        different that the brain area develops improperly        We think the latter is a more likely explanation at this point says Webb By the        time they are adolescents or adults they are showing the proper response for familiar        faces Indeed a functional MRI fMRI study by UW neuroimaging researcher Elizabeth        Aylward showed that the brains of highfunctioning adolescents and adults did activate the        facerecognition center the fusiform gyrus when shown a very familiar face However the        same subjects did not activate the center when viewing strange faces This points to the        possibility that greater experience seeing the familiar face ie on a daily basis for        many years can eventually influence the appropriate brain areas        You need the biological wiring set up properly but you also need experience for it to        function normally says Aylward Were guessing what is missing is the experience To        test that idea one of her graduate students will train half of the autistic patients in        face recognitionsomething most children pick up on their ownby having them study        manipulate and match faces using computer games Then fMRI scans will be done again to see        if the fusiform gyrus might now be activated when viewing strange faces as it is in        control subjects Intense training of a similar type for reading has already been shown to        effect change in brain activation in as little as three weeks for children with        dyslexia        In their model it is as if all the parts are there ready to go but somehow they        havent gotten the ignition turned on says Aylward At the  annual meeting of the        American Association for the Advancement of Science Washington DC United States the UW        center director Geraldine Dawson explained that this tackling of specific deficits will        help researchers attach them to particular mind modules in the brain and will ultimately        lead to the genes that control the development or function of those modules That modular        view however is not shared by many of her colleagues elsewhere who argue that autistic        behaviors are the result of a systemwide perturbation of early brain development and        connectivity                    Structural Support        For example Mller points to structural studies that seem to uphold his theory of        overall disorganization of the brains cortex Work by Manuel Casanova and colleagues at        the University of Louisville Louisville Kentucky United States shows that the        minicolumns of neurons that make up the cortex are narrower and more numerous in autistic        brains Normally these organized bundles appear very early in the developing fetal brain        In postmortem studies of autistic brains Casanova found that the minicolumns had the same        number of neurons but smaller margins between the bundles The margins Casanova says may        act like a shower curtain of inhibition that prevents information from flooding adjacent        minicolumns        Reducing those margins he hypothesizes could mean that an autistic brain has too much        positive feedback acting like a noisy amplifier For an autistic individual who is trying        to piece together too much information from a face maybe its like looking at the sun he        says        More general studies of adult autistic neuroanatomy have given conflicting resultsmost        likely from diversity in the study populationsthat make functional inferences difficult        if not impossible But recent studies that focus on developing autistic brains earlier in        life have revealed intriguing differences from normally developing children        Several studies have shown that from ages two to four autistic children have larger        overall brain volumes and correspondingly larger head circumferences than normal        children but that the difference had disappeared by about age six or seven Since autism        is usually diagnosed around age two or three when the brain is already abnormally large        Eric Courchesne and colleagues at University of California San Diego San Diego        California United States hypothesized that brain overgrowth must occur earlier before        signs of autism appear        In an elegant retrospective study the team analyzed head circumference and brain volume        measurements of autistic children that started at birth and continued until  months of        age The study revealed that at birth autistic childrens head size is much smaller than        healthy children in the th percentile but by  months their head size had increased        to the th percentile an excessive growth rate The increase correlated with increased        brain volumes of both gray and white matter regions measured by structural imaging between        ages two to five        The Courchesne study strongly suggests that with autism significant unregulated brain        growth occurs in the first year of life The team also found an association between greater        increases in brain size in infancy and a later age for first word worse repetitive        behavior and a trend toward more severe autistic symptoms later at diagnosis The rapid        growth of autistic brains may produce too many connections too quickly without the        opportunity to be shaped by the experience and input that a typically developing child        accumulates over many years At age six or later when the growth slows the already        derailed connections may no longer be able to incorporate experiences By that time        write Courchesne et al the period of plasticity that allows the exquisite and graceful        complexity of the human brain to emerge will have passed                    Playing Well with Others        This idea that autistic brains are developing at warp speed to their detriment fits        intriguingly well with what is known about treatment of autismthe earlier and more intense        behavioral therapy an autistic child receives the better the outcome will be Thats why        the toddlers at UCLA get oneonone training by therapists who fire rapid questions and        physically repeat tasks until they sink in        Stephanny Freeman codirector of the Early Childhood Partial Hospitalization program at        UCLA Los Angeles California United States says these methods would be alien to and        lost on typically developing twoyearolds who would be bewildered by such a highly        structured environment Her colleague and codirector Tanya Paparella chimes in It as        if we are opening a window or door to the autistic brain Keeping that door open as long        as possible in very young autistic patients seems to give them a better prognosis than        older children who are more difficult to treat        But while most agree that early and intense therapy is good for autistic children until        recently little research on intervention methods existed Connie Kasari an educational        psychologist at UCLA along with Freeman and Paparella has run one of the first        randomized controlled trials on therapies designed to teach autistic kids social skills        The group tested two skills in particularsharing attention with others and pretend playing        Figure  The team hypothesizes that these skills which normal children pick up easily        and early lay important groundwork for language development        The teams results show that autistic children can learn these skills from intense        training At least anecdotally some of these children have gone on to function in normal        school classrooms even making a few friends although they are still a bit socially        awkward Whether or not improvements in those skills will correlate with language        improvements will require further testing But Kasari notes that this work is not        universally accepted in the autism therapy community and that many more controlled studies        will have to be published before a systemwide change in autism preschool education can        occur                    Funding the Search        In the last decade National Institutes of Health funding for autism research has        increased from  million to  million and much of that has been funneled into large        multidisciplinary research projects Advocacy groups such as Cure Autism Now Los Angeles        California United States and the National Alliance for Autism Research Princeton New        Jersey United States greatly influence which autism research projects get funded both        through their own grant programs and also by lobbying Congress for increased federal        grants Some question whether it is wise to let emotions and the desire to find a cure        drive research agendas In the past tensions between government programs and advocacy        programs have run high        Casanova for one criticizes the disproportionate flow of money to what he calls        imaging and genetic fishing expeditions and says more should go to neuropathology        studies He points out that only about  postmortem mostly adult autistic brains have        been studied so far a tiny fraction compared to those studied in other neuropathological        disorders like Alzheimers disease or schizophrenia        But Daniel Geschwind a neurogeneticist at UCLA defends this approach saying that a        wellplanned fishing expedition that uses the right technology and looks in the appropriate        places can result in a freezer full of fish He also says that parent organizations keep        the field honest by constantly reminding us to keep an eye on the ball and dont get        distracted Geschwind Amaral and other top experts have recently been recruited by        advocacy groups or by friends with autistic children to shift some of their research        questions to examining autism        As more researchers in genetics and neuroscience have become involved Amaral says the        tensions between the parent groups and the National Institutes of Health have eased The        parents communicated to the scientists the tremendous need for research and the scientists        convey back to them which research projects make sense to fund he says He adds that        advocacy groups have been indispensable to research setting up large genetic and brain        tissue banks and enlisting families to participate in those efforts        So researchers say the goals of the National Institutes of Health programs and the        advocacy programs have started to come together to focus on wellexecuted studies that        might lead to better diagnostics and earlier proven interventions The work of Courchesne        et al suggests that children at risk for autism might easily be diagnosed by head        circumference measurements as early as the first few months of life Imaging studies        combined with training programs such as the work at UW on face recognition may one day be        able to verify that behavioral interventions are effective at activating target brain        areas As researchers work to untangle the causes and effects of brain dysfunctions in        autism Aylward notes there is good reason to be hopeful Although this is a genetic        disorder we know there is plasticity in the young brain
