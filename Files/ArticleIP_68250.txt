 Putin It Nicely On New Year s Eve Russian President Boris Yeltsin abruptly resigned leaving Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as the country s acting president Everyone expects Putin to win the presidency outright in the upcoming elections But what kind of man is Putin His detractors say he s a KGB spy a believer in centralized power and a ruthless prosecutor of the war in Chechnya And what do his defenders say That each of these vices is really a virtue 1 He s a spy Critics point to Putin s 15 years in the KGB calling him a KGB spy KGB agent and KGB colonel One antagonist says Putin was dubbed Stasi the name of the former East German secret service for wielding behind the scenes power Detractors use these terms to portray Putin as a Cold Warrior who can t be trusted with Russia s nukes On television this weekend U S Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger lent credence to this theory by arguing that Putin has two strands on one side his KGB years and on the other his years as a democratic reformer in St Petersburg Putin s allies reject the two strands theory They argue that his KGB experience actually reinforced his interest in economic liberalization As Putin s spokesman explained on Meet the Press Mr Putin worked in the West That s a very positive point The people in the KGB in some way prepared perestroika because they were very open and they knew the exact situation in the economy inside Russia and what was happening outside Putin s former mentor in St Petersburg ex Mayor Anatoly Sobchak told the New York Times He is a convinced supporter of the market economy He knows the western model of economic and political life not as an outsider but from the inside This counterspin is already making headway Putin returned from his KGB service steeped in Western business knowledge says the Times On This Week Times Washington bureau chief Michael Oreskes noted that according to Putin s colleagues In his years as a KGB agent in Europe he learned a lot about Western business practices and that may be exactly what he needs to understand to solve Russia s economic problems 2 He s a socialist American skeptics worry that Putin might wield too much state power over the economy and society thereby undermining both capitalism and democracy Putin however sees the state as the protector of honest capitalism and true democracy Any attempt to exceed the limits of the law and Russia s Constitution will be decisively crushed he warned in his New Year s Eve message Freedom of speech freedom of conscience freedom of the press the right to private property all these basic principles of a civilized society will be reliably protected by the state Putin s Russian allies and even his enemies agree that the chief threat to freedom in Russia today is too little power in the central government not too much But how can they make this case to the world s most powerful lender the United States in terms we can understand By comparing Putin to former American presidents Putin has a wonderful opportunity to become for Russia what the Roosevelts are for America Sobchak told the Times The Times buys this analysis Theodore Roosevelt took on entrenched monopolies helping small businesses to thrive and competition to flourish Franklin Roosevelt reworked the federal government to aid the poor improve education and create a less crash prone financial system Both men amassed state power over the government and economy to shape the capitalistic system that exists today 3 He s a strongman Critics call Putin cruel a dictator and a Russian Pinochet who might suspend civil liberties to whip Russia into shape They re particularly outraged by Putin s War in Chechnya George W Bush says he s troubled that Putin owes his popularity to the Chechen war Bill Bradley and John McCain demand economic sanctions against Russia for its brutal assaults on Chechen civilians On Meet the Press Tim Russert said Putin had called the Chechen rebels dark skinned people who must be annihilated and had warned that they will be found in latrines and killed Furthermore Russert noted His first official visit was to Chechnya giving hunting knives to the Russian military To make nice with Putin U S officials have begun to rephrase complaints about the war When asked about Russian atrocities they express regret about Russia s actions But they also frame the war as an unfortunate expression of a trait that could serve Putin well in other pursuits When asked about Putin s vow to annihilate the Chechens Albright called Putin very determined and action oriented The media too have begun to use positive adjectives to describe Putin s conduct of the war aggressive tough minded determined decisive uncompromising no nonsense How according to Putin s supporters will these traits make him a good leader First he can halt Russia s slide into chaos Putin frames the Chechen war as a struggle to rein in terrorism and the breakup of Russia a rationale for which Berger and Albright express sympathy Second he can confront cronyism Critics portray Putin as Yeltsin s pawn installed by Yeltsin s daughter and other cronies to safeguard their financial interests and shield them from prosecution for corruption By underscoring his image as a fearless strongman Putin defies this critique He began by firing Yeltsin s daughter eliciting oohs and aahs from the world press even though everyone expects her to stay on as an informal adviser In view of Russia s endemic corruption American pundits are reconsidering whether a strongman president is such a bad thing Does he have the power and the will to take on the robber barons asked George Stephanopoulos on This Week Will he tax them Will he crack down on them Will he clean them up Third a ruthlessly efficient leader can win a ruthlessly efficient election and craft a ruthlessly efficient economy Arguing for a quick end to the Chechen war both Albright and Berger appeal not to Putin s mercy but to his political interests He now faces an election in three months says Berger If the costs become too high for the Russians this could become an albatross around his neck in March Never mind morality When asked whether the United States should oppose loans to Russia because of the war Berger replies It s a premature question because the predicate question is whether they get the economic reforms in order at which point we ll have to look at what s in our national interest Here is an argument Americans can understand We should judge Russia s president the same way we judge ours The test for Putin says Berger is the economy stupid
