 Background The aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH superfamily of enzymes consists of a group of NAD P dependent enzymes which can oxidize a structurally diverse group of endogenous and exogenous aldehyde substrates Seventeen ALDH genes have been identified in the human genome and have been classified into ten different families based on amino acid sequence identities 1 2 High levels of ALDH1A1 activity can protect human and murine cells from the toxicity of the alkylating agent cyclophosphamide and its oxazaphosphorine analogs Indeed it was hypothesized that the high expression of ALDH1A1 formerly known as class 1 ALDH was responsible for the successful use of cyclophosphamide in tumor cell purging regimens during bone marrow transplantation 3 The detection of elevated ALDH1A1 activity in the most primitive human hematopoietic progenitor cells 4 5 6 has provided evidence in support of this hypothesis However no physiologic role for this enzyme in the hematopoietic stem cell population has been identified Vitamin A retinol is the prototype of a class of natural and synthetic chemical compounds named the retinoids Retinoids are found in a variety of chemical oxidation states including alcohol aldehyde ester and carboxylic acid functionalities The acid form retinoic acid is a pleiotropic hormone which regulates gene expression in embryonic development epithelial cell differentiation hematopoeisis and tumor cell formation Several enzymes including isoforms of alcohol dehydrogenase ALDH and cytochrome P450 CYP recently have been shown to be involved in the formation of retinoic acid from retinol and retinal 7 8 The purification cloning and characterization of several ALDH enzymes which efficiently catalyze the oxidation of retinal Figure 1A has suggested that regulation of retinoic acid formation could be a key physiologic role for these enzymes The report of the crystal structure of the homotetrameric ALDH1A1 enzyme from sheep liver revealed a substrate tunnel capable of binding retinal which was absent in ALDH2 and ALDH3A1 enzymes 9 Likewise the crystal structure reported for mouse ALDH1A2 revealed a substrate channel which could provide specificity for retinal and exclude short chain aliphatic aldehydes 10 The specific role of each enzyme in the regulation of retinoid signalling may depend on the species cell type and developmental status of the cell In vitro purified mouse 11 human 12 and Xenopus 13 ALDH1A1 can efficiently oxidize all trans retinal to all trans retinoic acid In vivo the introduction of ALDH1A1 mRNA into Xenopus embryos induces early synthesis of retinoic acid while ALDH1A1 expression is detected during the tail bud stages of Xenopus embryogenesis 14 ALDH1A2 in the mouse 15 and rat 16 has shown even greater specificity and catalytic efficiency for retinal as a substrate Immuno histochemical analysis of mouse embryos shows that ALDH1A1 expression occurs primarily in cranial tissues while ALDH1A2 expression occurs primarily in trunk tissue 17 In addition the targeted knockout of the ALDH1A2 gene in mice results in a significant decrease in retinoic acid biosynthesis and early embryo death 18 The development of inhibitors which can target individual ALDH enzymes provides one approach for addressing the role of a specific ALDH enzyme in the oxidation of retinal to retinoic acid in a given cell type We have identified 4 N N dipropylamino benzaldehyde DPAB Figure 1B and 4 N N diethylamino benzaldehyde DEAB as potent selective inhibitors of ALDH1A1 but not ALDH2 or ALDH3 with the dipropyl analog exhibiting 10 fold greater efficacy for inhibition 19 20 The effect of DPAB on ALDH1A2 has not been reported DEAB was first used to sensitize the mouse leukemic cell line L1210 CPA which is resistant to 4 hydroperoxycyclophosphamide 4 HC by virtue of its overexpression of ALDH1A1 Treatment of L1210 CPA cells in vitro with 50 M DEAB abolished the tumor cells resistance to 4 HC 19 DEAB also exhibited in vivo efficacy as a ALDH1A1 inhibitor as demonstrated by the toxicity to the intestinal crypt cells in mice receiving co injections of DEAB and cyclophosphamide 21 More recently DEAB has been used to demonstrate that overexpression of human ALDH1A1 in transfected cell lines is sufficient to cause cellular resistance to the oxazaphosphorines 22 and 4 HC 23 DEAB has also been an effective reagent in fluorescent activated cell sorting FACS techniques to isolate human hematopoietic stem cells based on the expression of ALDH1A1 activity 5 6 In contrast to DEAB and DPAB daidzin a natural product isolated from Pueraria lobata the Kudzu plant shows specificity for inhibiting ALDH2 at concentrations similar to that of DPAB used to inhibit ALDH1A1 24 25 An inhibitor specific for ALDH1A2 has not yet been reported In normal hematopoiesis terminally differentiated cells are generated daily from a limited number of pluripotent stem cells The stem cell population must be exquisitely regulated to ensure sufficient self renewal as well as commitment to progenitor cells which can give rise to mature erythrocytes platelets lymphocytes granulocytes and macrophages Retinoic acid appears to elicit a complex response of cell proliferation and or commitment to a more differentiated cell type depending on the differentiation state of the cell receiving the signal 26 27 The HL 60 human promyelocytic leukemia cell line responds in culture to sub micromolar concentrations of retinoic acid all trans and 13 cis by undergoing terminal differentiation to a granulocytic cell with the ability to phagocytose and reduce nitroblue tetrazolium 28 The response to retinoic acid in HL 60 cells is dependent on the expression of the retinoic acid receptor RAR 29 The use of all trans retinoic acid in differentiation therapy for patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia has resulted in prolonged complete remissions when combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy and may provide complete long term remissions as a single agent 30 However the enzyme or enzymes responsible for the formation of retinoic acid in the HL60 cells have not been identified In one report ALDH1A1 protein was not detected by Western blot but enzyme activity was detected using flow cytometry and a fluorescent aldehyde substrate 5 In a second study ALDH1A1 protein was detected using an ELISA assay and activity was detected using aldophosphamide as substrate 31 In these two studies designed to look at the relationship of ALDH1A1 activity to antitumor drug resistance the levels of ALDH1A1 were low in HL 60 compared to other cell types corresponding to the sensitivity of HL 60 cells to oxazaphosphorines ALDH activity has been reported in HL 60 cells using 4 hydroxynonenal as substrate 32 However since this molecule is such a poor substrate with ALDH1 compared to ALDH3 the measured activity likely represents only ALDH3 activity ALDH3 does not oxidize all trans retinal Expression of ALDH1A2 activity in HL 60 cells has not been reported Therefore we chose the HL 60 cell line to assess the role of ALDH1A1 in the oxidation of retinal The collection of results demonstrating that retinal is an excellent substrate for ALDH1A1 in vitro that ALDH1A1 is responsible for the synthesis of retinoic acid in the cranial tissues of the mouse embryo and that hematopoietic stem cells are characterized by high expression of ALDH1A1 have led to the hypothesis that the oxidation of retinal to retinoic acid is a key physiologic role for ALDH1A1 in hematopoietic stem cells Our long term goal is to use DPAB to investigate the role of ALDH1A1 in retinoic acid biosynthesis at different stages of hematopoiesis In this paper we show that DPAB is a potent inhibitor of retinal oxidation by murine and human ALDH1A1 However DPAB only weakly inhibits the retinal induced differentiation of HL 60 cells suggesting that ALDH1A1 is not the operative retinal oxidizing enzyme in these cells Results and discussion DPAB is a potent inhibitor of retinal oxidation with IC 50 values of 0 11 and 0 13 M for purified mouse and human ALDH1A1 respectively Table 1 These IC 50 values are 100 fold lower than the retinal concentrations used in the assay The IC 50 values for mouse ALDH1A1 are between the values observed with propanal 0 040 M and phenylacetaldehyde 0 36 M as substrates with the human ALDH1A1 showing the same inhibition with retinal or propanal as substrate The IC 50 values reported were initially obtained from spectrophotometric assays and repeated with an HPLC assay We were concerned with using a spectrophotometric assay for these inhibition studies due to the presence of several absorbing species at 340 nm including NADH DPAB retinal and retinoic acid Thus we modified an HPLC assay in order to directly measure the amount of retinoic acid product formed Previous reports of HPLC assays for ALDH reactions with tissue extracts used a single time point at 60 min to measure accumulation of product after documenting that retinoic acid formation was still linear in time course experiments 33 In our hands the reaction with purified enzyme was only linear for product formation up to 10 15 minutes Following continuous exposure to 1 M retinoic acid for 96 hours almost 40 of cells have differentiated to granulocytes as seen by the positive NBT staining Exposure to 1 M all trans retinal for 96 hours induced differentiation equivalent to exposure to 0 05 0 1 M retinoic acid With co exposures to 1 M retinal and up to 50 M DEAB or DPAB HL 60 differentiation was inhibited by only 30 after 144 hours of exposure compared with cells exposed to retinal alone Figure 2 DPAB did not alter the induction of differentiation by retinoic acid nor did it affect cell viability up to 144 hours Since DPAB s inhibition of cell differentiation in cells exposed to retinal was so low we needed to demonstrate that chemical oxidation or any serum enzymatic oxidation of retinal to retinoic acid was not occuring under our culture conditions Control dishes containing media and retinal were incubated for 144 hours with aliquots removed every 24 hours and analyzed by HPLC By day 6 less than 1 of the retinal was oxidized to retinoic acid suggesting that non enzymatic formation or serum mediated formation of retinoic acid was not responsible for the observed differentiation in cells exposed to DEAB or DPAB Although DPAB is a more potent inhibitor of human ALDH1A1 than DEAB we were concerned that DPAB was not remaining in solution at 50 M in the culture media However the observation that the addition of DEAB a much more soluble compound resulted in the same percent inhibition suggested that solubility was not a factor Thus artifacts due to solubility of inhibitor and extracellular oxidation of retinal do not appear to contribute to the observed response of DPAB on retinal oxidation In addition the NAD dependent oxidation of propanal or retinal was less than 0 05 nmoles NADH formed min 10 7cells in spectrophotometric assays using HL 60 cell extracts even in the absence of DEAB or DPAB The NAD dependent oxidation of these aldehydes was not reproducibly detected above background in spectrofluorometric assays Therefore though low levels of ALDH1A1 activity have been reported in HL 60 cells in previous studies 5 31 it appears that the differentiation observed in cells exposed to retinal alone or retinal plus DPAB was not mediated by ALDH1A1 oxidation of retinal to retinoic acid One possibility is that a cytochrome P450 CYP enzyme is catalyzing the oxidation Raner et al 34 and Chen et al 35 have described the formation of all trans retinoic acid from retinal and retinol by members of the CYP1 and CYP3A families In addition expression of CYP1A1 and CYP3A4 mRNA has been reported in HL 60 cells 36 The contribution of ALDH1A2 also can t be ruled out However its activity should be detected by the spectrophotometric or fluorometric assays Although ALDH1A2 appears only to catalyze the oxidation of all trans retinal to all trans retinoic acid both ALDH1A1 and CYP1 and CYP3A 34 enzymes are capable of oxidizing 9 cis retinal to 9 cis retinoic acid The family of retinoic acid receptors includes those that bind only all trans retinoic acid RAR and those that bind either all trans retinoic acid or 9 cis retinoic acid RXR Since the transcriptional regulation of the retinoic acid ligand receptor complex appears to involve the binding of receptor heterodimers RAR RXR the specific cellular response may depend on the ratio of all trans to 9 cis retinoic acid formed as well as the expression of receptor subtypes Our results suggest an intriguing possibility that regulation of retinoic acid formation in the HL 60 cells and the subsequent terminal differentiation to granulocytes could be mediated by one enzymatic acitivy e g a CYP mediated oxidation of retinal whereas regulation of retinoic acid formation in the hematopoietic stem cells and the subsequent maintenance of the self renewal capacity of the hematopoietic stem cells is mediated by ALDH1A1 oxidation of retinal Figure 3 This hypothesis can be tested by using global or specific CYP inhibitors in the presence of retinal in HL 60 cells and by using DPAB in the presence of retinal in an hematopoietic stem cell assay system We are attempting to assess the ability of DPAB to block retinoic acid formation in cultured mouse hematopoietic stem cells Conclusions We have shown that DPAB can serve as a potent inhibitor of purified human and mouse ALDH1A1 and should be a useful molecule to assess the role of ALDH1A1 in retinal oxidation in a cell system In addition our results indicate that in HL60 cells the prototype cell line for studying retinoic acid induced cell differentiation ALDH1A1 is not the operative oxidizing enzyme for retinal Materials and methods Materials NAD all
