 More Bang for the Buck A friend of mine offers a theory about why Bill Clinton s poll numbers stayed so high throughout the Lewinsky scandal The news made it possible for serious minded people to spend lots of time at the office and over lunch talking about semen stains vaginal insertions and blow jobs And the people were grateful That s probably because they re not getting all that much themselves A recent University of Chicago survey of 10 000 adults found that Americans are having considerably less sex than was generally thought Only one American in 20 has sex three times a week One in five didn t score at all last year If that s true many of us could use a little sexual self improvement Not me of course I have been happily married for 26 years since the age of 21 Deb and I have what seems to us to be a perfectly fine amorous life yet everywhere I turn the culture tells me almost mocks me you can do better What would happen to our sex life then if Deb who participated in this story because she loves me and because she has tenure and I tried for the first time to make something happen to it And so it was that we found ourselves for the first time ever in a sex toy store A Touch of Romance located near our home in Los Angeles across the street from a Macy s The idea behind shops like these is to make obtaining the materials of sexual experimentation as ordinary as purchasing plumbing supplies or housewares Which sort of works the only sexual thrill I got from the visit was knowing that Microsoft just bought a cock ring Choosing it wasn t easy Most of them came in presized sets of three I couldn t figure out which would fit right and intuited that try ons weren t an option So I opted instead for an adjustable circumference version a little strip of vinyl with snaps for 11 95 Man what a rip off Unless it works It doesn t Back home I derived a certain depraved buzz in cinching the device on but that was soon eclipsed The thing works on the Roach Motel principle your blood gets in but it can t get out But then I got to thinking Under battlefield conditions it doesn t get out anyway And while I should have been paying more attention to other things this led to thinking about the old joke with the punch line and right ball go POW My wife hadn t noticed any difference at all Overall rating on a scale of 1 to 10 2 toes curled A woman I know says women s magazines are the best places in America to find sex tips She s right go ahead just try to find a sewing pattern in Redbook You re much more likely to land on Try phone sex dirty notes porn videos fantasy games and sex in new places Try lingerie and no underwear Try talking dirty and silk scarves Try anything at all or articles such as Eight New Games for the Foreplay Challenged An article in the April Cosmopolitan The Six Best Sex Positions seemed more promising than the Redbook playbook Each position was accompanied by a succinct write up and a stick figure diagram The position we settled on was The Butterfly which we had to read three times to comprehend The man stands the woman remains supine on a bed or counter top with her feet up on his shoulders The whole idea is to produce a pelvic tilt for better access to the G spot Instead we experienced an uncomfortable pretzel feeling that stick figures must be immune to And in general Cosmopolitan s exotic sex positions require the sort of body placement you can t remember in the moment of passion and even if you could for proper alignment you still might need mood killing accessories such as a plumb line and a laser pen Rating 3 toes curled Next we tried those Better Sex instructional videos advertised in the New York Times Book Review I ordered Better Sexual Techniques Advanced Sexual Techniques Making Sex Fun and Advanced Oral Sex Techniques priced about 11 95 each not including shipping and handling My wife couldn t bear to watch them I persevered but must admit it was a chore The oral sex tape starts with well known sex therapist Diana Wiley in her poofy hair and broad shouldered blue power suit looking like she was about to explain how the sales force could increase its third quarter productivity Instead she runs through all the euphemisms for oral sex and then the video cuts to XXX action with gratuitous commentary Wiley s overexplanation of everything two people can do to each other with their mouths raises this question Do you really need a five minute video segment on whether or not to swallow In the great tradition of hotel and travel ads the guys tend to be markedly less attractive than the women No way he d be with her if this wasn t an instructional sex video The inanity of the experts and the dubious casting make these films about as erotic as well as the New York Times You could learn more from any randomly selected porn video Rating 0 toes curled Another approach is food The notion that certain foods such as oysters or rhino horn are aphrodisiacs has been pretty much discounted But it s plausible to think that cooking a meal together and then dining on it just the two of you could be erotic Especially if like me your schedule frequently forces you to eat alone and you often find yourself standing in front of the microwave screaming Come on goddammit Intercourses by Martha Hopkins and Randall Lockridge 24 95 Terrace Publishing 1997 preaches that for every time of day and every phase of a relationship there is a type of eating experience that will heighten sexual response There s also a chart showing which foods are good for eating off which body parts Deb and I blocked off a whole Saturday afternoon and evening for the Intercourses experiment settling on rosemary scented lamb over pasta Page 87 followed by frozen coffee almond dessert Page 31 According to the book rosemary is sexy because of its fragrance used in many perfumes and because of its texture which so the text assured tickles nerve endings The dessert was mostly coffee rum and Kahlua which has worked before We shopped for the food together and cooked together drinking wine and beer along the way At one point while I was working on the dessert I asked my wife how long to beat the heavy cream mixture Till it s stiff it s an aphrodisiac she said Preparation took less than an hour and everything came out perfectly Eating at our dining room table for the first time ever without guests we were having fun by candlelight But the mood was romantic not erotic Overall rating 4 toes curled That s when we went for the Viagra 212 50 for 10 doses which includes a consultation fee The drug was prescribed by a doctor whom I ve never met and ordered from a pharmacy in Miami Beach Fla where I ve never been I completed the transaction via the Internet after filling out a cover their ass questionnaire in three minutes We each decided to take one pill clinked our glasses and gulped And then what It felt awkward sitting in our bedroom knowing that it could take up to an hour for Viagra to work I suggested that we play strip poker something I d never done Deb had never even played poker so I had to explain the rules I won in about six hands auspiciously I thought with three aces But we still weren t really in the mood yet So then I got out the other purchase I d made at A Touch of Romance Dirty Dice 4 95 One of the two pink cubes is marked with these words instead of dots lips above waist ear breast below waist and The other cube is labeled kiss squeeze lick blow suck and eat We took turns throwing the dice but the activities generated seemed forced and arbitrary Finally as they say at NASA there was word from the pad that the launch sequence was initiating It was pretty much like all other sex except for a slight lightheadedness Deb said she noticed a remote tingling sensation On the plus side there was no priapism and neither of us experienced disruption of our color vision nor a fatal heart attack which was nice Overall rating 5 toes curled St Augustine held lust to be a fitting punishment for man s disobedience to God the body s disobeying of the mind the will the spirit and even of itself The paradigm of this for him is the unbidden hard on Jean Paul Sartre discovered something similar although celebrating it rather than deploring it Essential to the erotic is the body s defiance of design and control The paradigm of this for him is the jiggle Sartre s view yields a sort of sexual Heisenberg principle There is an inherent tension between physically abandoning yourself to another on the one hand and sexual planning on the other The more of the one the less of the other And this I discovered is the chief obstacle to sexual self help Getting an erection is sexy Making one is not As my wife said about Viagra You start to have a new feeling and then you realize where it came from and then you don t have it so much Anything that makes you think about it like that is just creepy This is not to say there isn t a way out of this conflict between desire and design With homage to our potent POTUS there is I think a Third Way that s neither sexual complacency nor standard self help If the intrusion of consciousness is the problem then maybe the answer is to block it out Sure you could do this the old fashioned way with alcohol and drugs But then you have all the traditional drawbacks including diminished physical attractiveness and degraded sexual performance So how about this instead Go for all the sexual self help you can but do it covertly Watch a sex video or porn flick if you want but by yourself and then try to share what you learned without sharing how you learned it Don t tell your partner you took Viagra Or give each other standing permission to slip it into the odd after dinner drink saying nothing Of course when you do it you ll still know but having an unselfconsciously turned on partner is a real compensation for that and next time your partner can surprise you And yes this requires trust But why would you be having sex with someone you don t trust My main conclusion is that contrary to our blabby culture the key to a better sex life is less communication
