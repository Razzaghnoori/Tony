 Surfing for Hitler on the Internet Hi Jim Your theory that the Internet is the crack of the 90s is a keeper if not a PhD dissertation waiting to happen From Columbine to the recent Atlanta shootings the Internet did it Or if it didn t exactly pull the trigger it sure didn t tackle the gunman and restrain him So goes the conventional wisdom Day trading death and the like For the latest installment of the Internet as crack see Susan Faludi s Newsweek column Rage of the American Male where the computer is front and center in her portrait of the alienation of men in America as exemplified by the Atlanta shooter Mark Burton That culture holds up a frightening mirror Reflected there is an image of a man in a room alone isolated from his fellows unneeded by his family staring into a computer screen on which he seeks a disembodied fortune or if that fortune fails types a suicide note As I sit here in a room staring into a computer screen reading Faludi s piece online isolated from my fellows maybe I should be grateful that I have the Breakfast Table for a little human connection or that I have two X chromosomes Murderous rampages not enough for you How about Nazism The section of the New York Times with Granger s line about how that the Internet is contributing to the demise of magazines also includes an intriguing piece of reporting about how the Internet pedals Nazi propaganda to Germans Amy Harmon s story Internet Sale of Nazi Books in Germany Assailed relates that Amazon com and Barnesandnoble com are drawing the ire of an L A based anti Semitism watchdog group for shipping Mein Kampf to Germany where the book is banned In my edition this story coincidentally appears right above an ad for a 30 day free trial of TheStreet com where they are presumably not selling Nazi literature but may be implicitly promoting day trading which as we ve seen above is suspiciously connected to murderous mayhem in its own way even though we re not sure exactly how The best part of Harmon s story is this priceless detail The researcher who ordered Mein Kampf from Amazon received E mail suggesting that he might also like White Power by the American Nazi leader George Lincoln Rockwell for instance And if that isn t enough synergy for you if you go to the pages for Mein Kampf on Amazon as I did you ll also find links to recommended Amazon auctions including a collectible sign of Hitler photographed with two children and various commemorative stamps You have to love shopping bots always thinking ahead to your next purchase Gee I didn t even know I needed a Hitler figurine until I saw the link right there Maybe the greatest irony of the Kuczynski piece on the declining influence of magazines is that the story is much more magazine like than what you d get from a newspaper like the Times say 15 years ago It reads as a reportorial essay in contrast to the Harmon story which is much more of a straight newsy item Could it be that since there are so many other news sources Internet cable TV newspapers are doing more and more magazine style stories Maybe next week s Times business section s lead media article should be about whether newspapers have become more like magazines in their struggle to maintain and build readership in these trying digital times In any case I m sure it s the Internet s fault Until tomorrow Katharine
