 Viagra Creep The craziest idea coming out of the Viagra frenzy is that it s somehow scary and wrong for health insurers to limit reimbursement for the drug Many insurers will pay for the erection wonder pills only for men who are tested by a urologist and proved to have organic not psychological erectile dysfunction Some insurers are also limiting the number of pills they will pay for to 10 each month some even fewer and a few none at all Commentators on talk shows and news programs are incensed by the limits although no one yet complains that Medicaid programs are likely to refuse reimbursement altogether Get the insurers out of our bedrooms is the rallying cry But not so fast As Dr Michael O Leary a Harvard urologist and expert on sexual dysfunction told the Wall Street Journal I m not convinced that it s a God given right to have an excellent erection Viagra is just the latest in the boom of quality of life technologies that aim to enhance rather than save lives Such treatments as Viagra Propecia for hair loss and fertility treatments pose a distinct problem for insurers True the treatments address biologically caused problems but ones that are hardly incapacitating Still there is no clear distinction between these disorders and such accepted medical problems as acne or vitiligo a disorder of skin pigmentation If severe enough even wrinkling or hair loss can be considered medical problems So these new drugs erode accepted distinctions between worrisome abnormalities and the normal variations of human life While the drugs push in one direction the insurers push in the other Before Viagra the hoist and pull mechanics of previous impotence treatments inflatable penile implants Caverject erection injections and vacuum devices made them unattractive to most men impotent or not Viagra by contrast is simple and offers discretion Instead of creating erections on its own it amplifies the signals men s bodies already have The mechanics of Viagra have been widely reported Click for a reminder The results in impotent men are better longer lasting erections and more satisfying sex These effects might also occur in perfectly able men Some are already seeking the drug in the hope that they can sustain repeat performances and they re filing claims One HMO executive even had a claim from a young man for a Viagra prescription he had procured to enhance his wedding night performance At the very least insurers should be allowed to distinguish these kinds of claims from others Tougher cases became evident to me during a visit I made to O Leary s urology clinic That afternoon some two dozen patients ranging from 21 to 86 years of age were lined up for Viagra I joined him in seeing a few Each patient bashfully left the impotence literature and Playboy magazines in the examining rooms untouched O Leary is one of the few Americans who can take a tax deduction for pornography But the urologist didn t beat around the bush Are you here for Viagra was his opening question to each patient Everyone replied yes seeming relieved to have the doctor raise the subject One patient I ll call him George Davis was around 60 obese and hadn t had sex with his wife in over three years because of difficulty getting erections a problem almost certainly related to his diabetes At some age most people would say impotence is normal As many as 30 percent of 65 year old men and probably over 50 percent of 75 year olds are unable to obtain and or maintain a satisfactory erection for intercourse Before Viagra many weren t quite ready to accept their decline but few were ready to accept the treatments Sex wasn t important enough So insurers were happy to let men define for themselves whether their impotence was worrisome or not Now a little blue pill might do the trick Davis wasn t sure if he was willing to pay 10 a pop But he figured his insurance would cover it so why not give it a try Davis was a walking demonstration of every insurer s nightmare We don t think people should have to worry about cost when deciding whether to undergo treatment for cancer or arthritis But for the life enhancing technologies there s nothing wrong if insurers say that at some point cost should come into play If Davis is willing to pay 10 for say a bottle of wine but not for sex why should the insurer pay If these expensive new drugs were free people would demand amounts out of all proportion to the value they actually place on them But quality of life drugs have social side effects that are potentially more troubling than the cost strains The sneaky thing about Viagra for example is that it s so straightforward it makes not treating impotence seem as strange as not treating pneumonia Viagra lowers the bar on what s medically abnormal Indeed all the quality of life drugs do In a current ad barrage manufacturers encourage people to ask your doctor about drugs for unsightly nails The prescription skin cream Renova is hawked for wrinkles Bristol Myers Squibb is testing a drug to reverse sun damage in skin And of course who can miss the ads for Propecia All these drugs treat problems that most people hadn t considered medical before Insurers will try as they must to counter the tendency of quality of life drugs to redefine abnormality upward But the insurers are fighting an irresistible force The drugs play on the inevitable some say genetic human desire for youth and immortality As each new drug is released on a wave of hype insurers will fight the deluge but patients will clamor and doctors will go along The transformation of normal to abnormal may start with a pill But the physician s need for diagnosis is what drives the process Since the new quality of life drugs can have adverse health effects the drugs need to come through physicians But we don t give out drugs willy nilly We must provide a medical reason a diagnosis So we call impotence erectile dysfunction baldness hypotrichosis and so on The rapid increase in attention deficit disorder is a striking example of diagnosis creep The disorder hardly seemed to exist before the stimulant Ritalin came along A core group of kids do have a distinct attention abnormality but Ritalin worked so well it can reduce distractibility even in perfectly normal children that now almost any difficult child is considered for the diagnosis and drug A 1990 study found that 28 percent of children diagnosed with the disorder didn t actually meet the definition Nevertheless the percentage of children on Ritalin has doubled since then By giving a patient s condition a medical name we turn it into a medical abnormality That creates a presumption that insurers must pay It also creates a presumption that it will be treated If I write a new diagnosis in a patient s chart I have to indicate what I plan to do about it It d be malpractice not to More than that once a condition is established as a diagnosis society practically treats it as a crime not to do something about it This raises an ironic prospect Quality of life drugs offer not just the pleasing possibility that you can do something about impotence baldness blackened toenails They create a culture in which you must fight against these conditions even if it means risking serious side effects the anti fungal drugs for nails can damage the liver Propecia s anti testosterone action can decrease libido By their sheer effectiveness the quality of life drugs narrow the range of what society accepts as normal In doing so they may ultimately reduce the quality of life for the many of us who are less than perfectly endowed If you missed the sidebar on how Viagra works click
