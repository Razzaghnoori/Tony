 Do Not Love Thy Neighbor Please send your questions for publication to prudence slate com Dear Pru I am a 21 year old male living with my girlfriend I have two kids with her but I ve been going out with my neighbor The problem is that my neighbor knows about my girlfriend and I don t know what to do What s worse I think I m falling in love with my neighbor Can you help M D Dear M Help you what Move Get unattached Prudie is fascinated that the problem you re concerned with is your neighbor s knowing about your girlfriend Usually a man is spooked if his significant other knows about the neighbor Prudie must tell you that a number of things seem less than optimal here You have barely reached your majority yet you have already fathered two offspring while unmarried and are being unfaithful to the woman to whom you ve presumably made a commitment It would really be lovely for all concerned if you were having a goof with Prudie On the off chance that your letter is on the level it could be that the purpose of your life is to serve as a warning to others If you do call it a day with the mother of your children you will be spared a divorce but will remain financially responsible for child support If you do make an alliance with the neighbor Prudie hopes you will move And do try to stop being so horizontally accessible Given your age you could very well populate the whole neighborhood Prudie alarmedly Prudie I have a problem I hate my brother s wife She has been cheating on him for the past year They have only been married a year She treats him terribly and she tells me she hates my family I have been trying to ignore her comments but it s impossible Do I tell my brother how I feel or continue to hold my tongue Seething in Texas Dear Seethe What do you think the chances are that your sister in law lives near the fellow who wrote the previous letter Only kidding though all these loose people are really no laughing matter From your report of the timetable your brother s wife started the marriage with no intention of being faithful Chances are that if you know she s running around it s likely your brother does too The fact that she treats him terribly however is definitely known to him and it is for this reason that Prudie suggests you say nothing He is either masochistically neurotic or is figuring out how to extricate himself The only mechanistic thing you can do is make yourself scarce And should your brother ask your opinion give it to him Prudie pragmatically Dear Prudence I m a 27 year old gay guy My problem is that I ve fallen for this guy I ve been chatting with on the Internet for the past six months Seth thinks of me as someone he can confide in not as a potential boyfriend He s a serious bodybuilder and says he s looking for muscular guys only While I do have a toned bod I am definitely not of the bodybuilder ilk My question How can I convince Seth that we would be perfect together even though I m not a bodybuilder He doesn t seem interested in meeting The only thing he does seem interested in is pouring his heart out to me about how difficult it is to find a muscular mate Please advise Looking for Love Dear Look Take a deep breath and face the facts You are interested in a partner this chap is interested in pecs and lats Your cybercrush sounds like a muscle bound moron and you would not be perfect together Where is the commonality of interests You might try to figure out why you are attracted even electronically to someone who is whining to you about his inability to find another bodybuilder For whatever reason you want what you can t have Prudie hopes you will refocus consider yourself lucky and move on to another chat room Or better yet start going out Prudie sociably Dear Prudie I accepted a new job a couple of months ago and relocated to another city which is away from my grown children The new job has been fantastic and I felt I made the right decision in moving Until a few weeks ago anyway My manager was moved laterally within the department and the person they hired is an ex manager of mine and the cause of my leaving my old company He totally disrespects women and anyone not in his field The management knows that I cannot and will not work for him I have requested an inter company transfer so I would not be his subordinate I have another job offer in yet another state which I rejected to accept this position but they still want me to work for them I am getting ready to sign a lease for my housing but am unsure if I want to stay here if I m forced to keep this position What do you think I should do Haunted Dear Haunt Move quickly That is get a commitment from a superior that you will be given a different job where you re not reporting to the chauvinist pig er former manager Don t be shy about mentioning the other offer You say that your current management understands your aversion to this man If you can get an ironclad guarantee of another position sign the lease and get on with your life If you feel there is any dilly dallying on the part of your new employer having already left the area where your children live would make one more move merely a temporary inconvenience If you do not get a firm promise of an inter company transfer by all means go to the company that still wants you If that happens and if what s his name winds up working for them it should be Ripley you write to not Prudie Prudie hopefully
