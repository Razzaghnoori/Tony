 okay what kind of hobbies do you have um mostly what i do i do do some crafts like it mentioned in the thing and then i i read a lot um hum i like to read too i was trying to think of some while while it was uh talking about it and then i it took so long for someone to answer i started reading the newspaper and kind of forgot about it but uh oh yeah i i d say reading s probably one of my biggest ones because it s the type of thing that you can you can do a little bit at a time whereas i would love to do crafts and stuff if i just had the time to do it and uh huh or if i had the space i live in a pretty small apartment and uh i would have to you know put stuff away i have two cats so i couldn t really leave it out if i was working on something so reading is a little bit easier to work around yeah um hum yeah you can pick it up and take it wherever you go that s right fills up any time of space i get too involved in reading sometimes that i neglect what i should be doing so i you get so involved in what you re reading that s true i do the same thing what types of crafts do you do um i do some little bit of woodworking well i used to i i don t have the equipment here we moved to Dallas about a year ago and my dad had a lot of woodworking equipment and i did some of that um here i ve mostly done things that i can do strictly by hand um sewing um hum um hum and quilting and um um hum what else have i done things to hang on the wall um hum mostly just stuff that i can you know use right around the house um hum or give away as gifts right i ve been making a lot of quilts well not a lot but several quilts lately uh huh so i enjoy uh sewing and needlework also i ve i ve uh made some small things um cross stitch things and um back when i was in high school i worked um hum at a uh needlework shop and i i used to do the latch hook rugs and needlepoint and things like that and i i still remember how to do it it s just been so long since i ve actually sat down and and taken the time to do something like that but i have recently done some cross stitch um hum and i enjoy doing that it s just the same old thing it s just getting the time to do it yeah i ve done some cross um cross stitch but i never count right and i always have to either take it out or have my picture slightly off centered or or something it never has worked it out completely right um hum yeah it takes a lot of concentration i mean it was the type of thing i was i was making some little things for Christmas and i also made a little thing for a baby gift and uh i thought oh i can do this while i watch TV wrong yeah right no you must pay all attention to what you re doing it s it s it is a lot more difficult than it seems like it would be it took me uh quite a bit of time i thought oh this won t take long at all but i was wrong it took while it took a while to do but it was fun i enjoyed it um hum yeah the first project project i started out one was a big one it was uh it was of a lady and she was kneeling and it was about fifteen by twenty maybe oh my gosh and i it was just too much to start with and i still haven t finished it because i stopped i stopped and i thought well i better do some simple things and work up to this because it was just so difficult to to get it done and there were so many different shadings and colors and uh huh yeah and uh it it was just too much to begin with and i think that kind of discouraged me from doing much more with it yeah that s pretty understandable and i ve done some of the crewel and the um um hum something similar to that but it doesn t have the specific stitches anyway it s a little bit more loose and not uh quite as structured and i like that a little bit better the variety of stitches and stuff in that uh huh yeah more like embroidery or something but i m trying to think of anything else i do as a hobby um i don t even watch TV very much i was tonight but yeah i was reading when you called um how about movies do you like to go to movies yeah um yeah i do i do like to go to movies and uh i have a VCR so i like to rent movies and um i have right now i have the movie channel so i ve i ve recorded quite a few movies off of that um um hum just i ve kind of got a collection going of tapes now and whenever i go visit my parents they re always saying well bring some of your tapes and they they always borrow a few of them i was over there they live in Duncanville and i was over there at Easter uh huh and they said bring some tapes with you so they they are always borrowing my tapes yeah well we but uh i like to i like to do uh stuff with plants i like um i have a lot of plants in my apartment and i ve got a pretty small porch but it s it s uh i ve got a few planters out there that i i ll uh you know in the winter time i usually plant some pansies in there and then in the summer i ll plant petunias or something that that s colorful and like that blooms a lot but uh haven t done that yet it i i kept thinking that it was going to get cold one more time but i think we re probably past that now i probably should go buy some but um hum yeah i guess if i had a house i might enjoy gardening some i m not real crazy about pulling weeds and things like that but yeah the hard work yeah it s yeah i like the planting and and watering is okay it s so nice though when you have a nice yard full of flowers it s so beautiful i mean we don t we live in an apartment also uh huh but i ve got a few plants here but um i m not really really knowledgeable i i i feel real good if i water them and they continue to grow you know i feel like oh i ve accomplished something so i enjoy it but i m just not experienced enough with it to uh huh yeah i don t know too much about it either mine s pretty limited to my little uh porch plants and and then the ones in my apartment half of which don t look real healthy but i don t always get direct sun uh huh oh yeah except in certain spots and so that s probably my problem there but uh have you tried any growing any um like fruits and vegetables or anything i guess vegetables are inside inside like in pots and stuff um hum no i never have tried that just because i don t have that much space on this little porch here in this apartment um or this little balcony and my my other two pots are they re kind of they re pretty big and and i have enough plants in them that um uh huh it it takes up a lot of my porch area so between that a nd the chairs and the barbecue grill and the fireplace wood there s no room for much else but my dad uh excuse me my dad used to grow tomatoes and things at the house and i d i think when i was real little i probably had a finger in on that every time he did it and had to you know be out there and watch and that type of stuff but i ve never really tried anything like that since then um hum well i ve considered it last year and this year both but i haven t done anything about it so um hum i think it would be nice to just go out and pick some tomatoes off the porch we get lots of sunlight here and the porch is screened in and it s pretty large uh huh oh wow so u m i think if i just would be if i d do something be motivated enough to do something i think it would work out well uh huh but but there there goes that motivation thing again right well i enjoy playing with my cats i don t know if you d call that a hobby but i have two cats and i gave them a bath tonight so they re a little bit angry at me but uh they didn t like it too much oh do are you can you put them can you put them right in the water or oh that s good yeah oh yeah right in the tub and and it helps because it s the time of the year that they re shedding a lot and cleaning cat fur off the couch and off the floor is not a hobby of mine so i thought well this ll help you know help them shed and yeah and sure enough boy the fur just came off like crazy once i got them in the tub so oh yeah they re pretty content now but they they were mad at me for quite a while they went and hid after they after they got dried off sulked for a while huh well i like animals but we don t have any yet we have a nine month old with another on the way and we thought well maybe when they re a little bit bigger then we ll or get into a house with a little more space yeah uh huh yeah uh huh yeah i d i d love to have have some animals uh huh but i like dogs and my husband like cats so we haven t reached a real agreement on that yet if we get a place where we can have both it ll be great but until then yeah yeah i like both but since i m in an apartment i just i don t think an apartment is big enough for a dog dogs to me dogs need a yard even little dogs they just need a yard um hum yeah cats cats can deal with being inside all the time just fine but i just think dogs need need to be outside so yeah i agree with you i if we were going to get anything now it would definitely be a cat um hum but or even a bird or a fish tank or something you know yeah now that s an idea with the with the small babies something small that she can watch but won t take too much care yeah because you kind of even even a cat you never know when they might bite or scratch or something there not as likely to as a dog might i guess but so um hum with little ones i d be kind of scared to get anything that that has teeth or claws yeah yeah especially when they re not quite to the age of understanding that they re hurting you know that they they grab hold with both hands and then just jerk and oh yeah and if i was a cat or dog i d respond probably by biting or something i don t know that would be my self defense but oh yeah um hum yeah well i i think we probably reached our time limit yeah probably so cause and i m out of out of good ideas for a hobby anyway so well it was good talking to you okay well thank you for calling bye bye all right bye bye
