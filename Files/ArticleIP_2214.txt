 Nefarious Plots Nefarious Plots As Slate s Pundit Central points out the consensus view of the commentariat is that President Clinton is to be blamed for selling burial rights at Arlington Cemetery to campaign contributors even though it turns out he never did it because it s just the sort of thing he might have done Or not quite There s a perception well founded or otherwise that this is the sort of thing he might do Here is an important new development in the Washington press corps perceptions game Often in the past when chasing some alleged miscreant the press has brushed aside the question of what exactly is wrong with the explanation that the situation creates the perception of impropriety We thereby avoid the tiresome issue of whether anything improper actually has occurred The trick works both ways Actual miscreants confess to having created an appearance of impropriety thus sidestepping the little matter of impropriety itself Since the press itself largely creates the perception with its coverage justifying the coverage on the basis of the perception is a convenient form of circular reasoning Never before though to our knowledge has a public figure been found guilty of committing a perception when the perception is demonstrably untrue Until now there had to be at least a possibility that the perception of impropriety might some day molt into hard evidence of actual impropriety In this case that possibility doesn t exist Undoubtedly there are folks who will continue to insist against all evidence that Clinton sold entry to Arlington But those who take the isn t this just typical line are doing so precisely because although they think it s typical they accept that it isn t true Apparently that doesn t matter anymore as long as it s typical or arguably typical So boo to Clinton no need to apologize and no need to worry about being the conduit for any faintly plausible bit of poison his critics may be dispensing Like all journalists we at Slate have longed for the day when might be true is accepted as the standard for our trade Never in our most idealistic moments did we dare hope for a standard of might be true even though it isn t Like a starving man standing before the bounty of oh say the Microsoft cafeteria check out the vegetable stir fry we hardly know where to begin don t miss those Rice Krispies squares Maybe Clinton sold the national monuments Q Who is buried in Grant s Tomb A If you have to ask you can t afford it Could be true After all it would be typical of someone who sold Arlington Cemetery plots which though he may not have done it is nevertheless typical of the kind of guy who d kill Vincent Foster which he didn t do either but that doesn t matter because he s the kind of guy who does the kind of thing that gets you accused of doing that kind of thing Maybe Newt Gingrich actually poisoned his first wife After all he divorced her on her deathbed or something like that We don t remember the details exactly but they certainly created the perception that he did something like that and anyone who could be perceived to do something like that has created an atmosphere that makes possible the perception that he could do something worse So he has no one to blame but himself Hey this is going to be fun Turkey of All Time Last week Time magazine reported some preliminary results from a poll it has been conducting on its Internet site about whom it should pick for its Person of the Century An impressive 5 million votes have been cast since the poll went up in June But bizarrely 1 7 million of those votes were for Kemal Atat rk Atat rk was the founder of modern Turkey which is no mean accomplishment what have you done with your life but the Time folks understandably suspect ballot stuffing Time s mistake we think was its stinting view of history If you re going in for shameless promotional gimmicks why limit yourself to a century Slate hereby announces its intention to mark the year 2000 by anointing a Person of the Millennium Kemal Atat rk need not apply In fact although all other nominees are welcome Slate s software development team through a simple iterative program has already cast 1 8 million votes for Bill Gates Could there be any other real answer Madonna was a distant second Speaking of Turkey in honor of Thanksgiving Slate has published a full week s issue as of today Wednesday Nov 26 two days early Our Today s Papers column will be posted Friday but not Thanksgiving Day Our normal schedule will resume on Monday Dec 1 Michael Kinsley
