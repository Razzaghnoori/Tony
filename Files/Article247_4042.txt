 Willy Sue On Page 138 of the November Premiere senior editor Holly Millea tells her side of a heated encounter with Peter Kaufman son of director Philip Kaufman and a producer of his father s upcoming movie Quills In Millea s account she was scheduled to interview Quill s star Kate Winslet while Winslet was being driven home from the set after a day s work When Millea pulled up in Winslet s hired car Kaufman confronted her and according to Millea ordered a crew member to Get her out of here Now Millea quotes Winslet s driver as saying afterwards I wanted to slug him That s wee willy syndrome there Take that Mr Son of Sexy Yet Classy but Commercially Disappointing Film Director Millea also notes that Winslet later defended the younger Kaufman as just fiercely protective of his actors Imagine the hilarity in Premiere s legal department when the magazine received a letter from Peter Kaufman s lawyer objecting to the wee willy passage and hinting at legal action Was Kaufman charging that the description was false and that his willy was not in fact wee Would he submit to a discovery on the matter Can t you have wee willy syndrome without actually having a wee willy Think of the potential for a Court TV sweeps week special Premiere s editor James Meigs acknowledges receiving a lawyer letter and says We stand by our story But surely Peter Kaufman wouldn t be stupid enough to let himself become known as the man who brought the Wee Willy Lawsuit would he Alas he s probably not When kausfiles contacted him Kaufman seemed in an affable non litigious mood The letter he said was just a thing that our lawyers do It s pretty well over now Kaufman did contend that Millea s article was pretty vicious and not accurate and offered his side of the confrontation which was basically that Millea kept coming when he asked her to stay away But will he sue I have no plans I just don t want to comment on that A subsequent call to his lawyer Barry Tyerman went unreturned The only hope now is that this item itself will somehow goad Kaufman into bringing his suit
