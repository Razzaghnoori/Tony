 Whose Ox is Gore With little news breaking on Christmas the papers lead with dependably worrisome issues The Los Angeles Times sets off on a whirlwind tour of trouble spots all over the planet potential violence in Africa the Balkans and the Middle East economic crisis in Asia and Russia and frets about the impact of impeachment on American stewardship of global stability The Washington Post reviews weather induced havoc in the South The New York Times lead describes the easy end run that insurance providers have found around the legally mandated minimum coverage for mental illness The 1996 Mental Health Parity Act only requires that dollar limits on mental health coverage equal those for general medical services So providers and employers simply mete out treatments in non monetary denominations like number of visits and days in the hospital Congress is expected to close the loopholes next year The LAT fronts a four day old interview in which Vice President Gore prevaricates about how to handle his role in an impeachment trial Yes the Constitution requires him only to preside over the Senate and to break any tied vote on verdict or procedure But can he lobby Senators to vote against impeachment Gore opines that it would be inappropriate for him to buttonhole Senators but hedges if he s asked he will feel free to communicate with them in full In this spirit of indecision the interview was conducted Tuesday downplayed by his aides on Wednesday and then embargoed until the safety of the Christmas news lull Meanwhile the piece doesn t articulate the stickiest and most obvious of the Vice President s conflicts of interest how Gore s own presidential ambitions could influence his performance as referee The NYT and the LAT front the agreement between Russia and Belarus to merge their currencies synchronize trade and relax political barriers The LAT describes the deal as the first step of a full on merger but the NYT points out that a it s not really a merger because the plans are just too vague and b the Belarussians are considerably more gung ho about it than their Russian counterparts The deal brings Russia the chance to flex its slackened superpower muscles but at the cost of providing shelter to Belarus destitute population bankrupt government and bone dry economy In addition the LAT notes Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko s dubious record he extended his term in a dummy referendum and has been known to gag the opposition press and imprison dissidents The NYT reports inside that U S officials have been able to protect an eggshell fragile cease fire in Kosovo An AP story inside the WP reports that Western monitoring forces will continue to saturate the area in order to prevent more fighting However ethnic Albanian rebels seem eager to shatter it at any minute We will win or we will turn to dust says one young commander to the Times A survey by the WP suggests that Americans tolerate but do not condone homosexuality A front page feature one in a series on American Values maps out the ambivalence many Americans feel about the issue 72 of respondents call gay sex unacceptable but a robust 87 say that homosexuals should have equal rights and opportunities in the workplace The piece suggests that gay rights may become the same kind of ideological litmus test for electoral candidates as abortion However the ideological confusion reported in the survey is complicated by unclear statistical reporting although the credentials of the pollsters are described at length the size and nature of the sample is not The WP front page also reports that PBS stations are no longer relying on simple tote bag giveaways to raise viewer contributions Instead stations are scrapping their fusty regulars for fitness experts and self help gurus who capture minds and pocketbooks with lectures on spiritual healing and de toxifying your negative emotions Reaction within the public television community has ranged from sheepishness to horror But perhaps these stations are banking on very very long term loyalty The title of one videotape sent to thank viewers for their pledges by scholar author lecturer environmentalist scientist investigative reporter journalist Gary Null How to Live Forever
