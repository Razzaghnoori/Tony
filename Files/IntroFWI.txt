 The Islands and the People They re French indisputably spiced with an intriguing Caribbean flavor These perpetually sunny islands are also very beautiful in the best tropical manner a riot of flowers tangled green forests mountain waterfalls dramatic rocky headlands beaches of white tan or black volcanic sand And the sunsets are breathtaking Each of the islands has an Atlantic and a Caribbean shore with the water s hues spanning a mini spectrum from pale green to midnight blue In the sparkling unpolluted sea fishing techniques haven t changed much since Columbus claimed these remote outposts for Spain almost 500 years ago Ashore fields of sugarcane and banana plantations drape steep hills and rolling plains Volcanoes hummingbirds mangroves mongooses and palm trees complete the picture The heat is year round average 25 C 77 F but so are the trade winds that temper it Our little corner in the Caribbean crows the publicity from Paris Actually the French West Indies FWI or Antilles Fran aises as they re called in France are not at all a neat geographical cluster The few dozen islands and rocks are widely scattered along the great curving chain of the Lesser Antilles Guadeloupe and Martinique much the largest of the islands and about 160 km 100 miles apart are becoming internationally known resorts To the north little Saint Barth lemy and the French side of Saint Martin the other side is Dutch have as much charm without the bustle Though some 256 km 160 miles away they re dependencies of Guadeloupe So are the tiny eastern and southern satellites of La D sirade Marie Galante and Les Saintes All of the islands are now officially and proudly part of France not colonies as they were for some three centuries Martinique and Guadeloupe formal d partements since 1946 have recently become r gions in an administrative reshuffle Each has a pr fet named in Paris and sends three deputies and two senators more than 6 400 km 4 000 miles to sit in the national legislature To New York about 3 000 km 1 900 miles away they send back streams of contented tourists French Antilles citizens enjoy the same state benefits as all French citizens drink the same famous wines and eat the same cheeses and pat s on baguettes just as crustily delicious as those turned out by every bakery in the m tropole And yet despite the flocks of familiar French automobiles with yellow headlights the francs and centimes the gendarmes caf s and just like Paris little shops you ll sense immediately that this is not nor could it ever be metropolitan France The atmosphere is richer more exotic Africans Asians Indians and whites of various origins have become absorbed and transformed into the fascinating culture known as Creole By world standards this racially varied society is a model of harmony What will strike you first is the marvelous range of subtly different skin tones and facial features The famous FWI women inevitably wearing bright earrings and flashing colors manage to be both graceful and sensuous as they walk This is true even when they glide along country roads with large bundles balanced on their heads Little girls learn this sure fire posture improver very early in life In these already overpopulated islands where Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion the government provides an initial lump sum for each birth and a monthly support grant allocation familiale for each child Because of the male exodus to France and elsewhere in search of jobs women continue to outnumber men More than half of 800 000 native islanders are children and the mother is traditionally responsible for bringing them up handling the money and making key domestic decisions Everyone agrees there s a special magic to the Creole soul Smiling readily but somewhat shy about making the first approach the islanders will often overwhelm you with kindness once contact is made Honesty is taken for granted You ll find a simplicity a lack of complication about many local people yet something too of the sophistication associated with the French Away from tourist resorts and shopping areas rarely will any language be spoken except French and the mystifying Creole patois which though based on French is almost incomprehensible to anyone not used to it even non initiated French speakers But people of all ages will invariably go out of their way to help a foreigner The biggest marque d attention a tourist can receive is to be invited to a Creole home You ll soon notice how easy it is to get a cheerful early start on these islands Punch the ubiquitous drink of local rum sugarcane syrup and lime is popular from dawn to dusk And along with punch gossiping is a favorite pastime in the FWI The women and girls washing clothes along the river banks are probably doing so if they re not singing And it s a safe bet that in the open air markets the sales ladies under the big straw hats are gossiping too between transactions involving such prized local items as guavas tamarinds red pimentos and plantains While tropical fruits and vegetables abound along with a satisfying variety of fresh fish much food in the FWI is imported primarily from France Nowhere else in the Caribbean can you eat as imaginatively or as well Traditional French dishes are as highly esteemed as the spicy specialties of Creole cuisine As on most tropical islands the pace of life tends to be lazy During the hottest hours things come to a virtual standstill though the Caribbean siesta is an hour or two shorter than its Mediterranean counterpart It would be folly for a visitor to expect American style efficiency or speedy service it would be wisest to slip into the casual drift of things West Indian Whether eating touring or shopping taking your time will always be rewarding But when the sun goes down and the music starts up there s nothing lazy about the dancing This is where the biguine began and still belongs along with all manner of other Caribbean rhythms just as popular and even more frenzied They say that if you can understand their dancing you ll have begun to understand the Creole soul It s certainly worth trying Not fully discovered and certainly unspoiled the FWI are relative newcomers on the world tourist scene Though their economic well being is about the most precarious of any part of France these basically agricultural islands can and do provide the scenery the sun the sea and the sand in sufficient quantity to attract rapidly growing numbers of vacationers looking for fun relaxation and something different
