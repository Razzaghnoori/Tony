 How are you doing today I m doing fine You ready to tell a story Yes OK I m trying to think of a story I should tell OK Well I worked as a police officer for the town of Matthews for about four and a half years until recently And I ll tell the story of one of my chases and if that doesn t go enough time I ll tell the story of another chase vehicle chase Um one night after I had arrested my second DWI I took the DWI down to the intake center that s the jail in downtown took him down to the jail and him processed and got him in And on my way back home I take Independence Blvd on the way back into Matthews And about at probably Idlewild Rd no probably at Albemarle Rd I got in behind uh this is still in Charlotte so it wasn t in my jurisdiction I got in behind a uh an old like 69 or 70 Oldsmobile Cutlass that had a paper tag And I didn t think anything about it I did I did notice it and that it had a paper tag and that it was primer primer black black primer Paper tag Paper tag a 30 day tag OK And which you can track them but it s real hard to because it s so it s common to switch them And I we we were headed outbound on highway on Independence Blvd Highway 74 and I noticed he was running about 50 miles an hour 50 55 So I got in behind him or not behind him but I was in the lane beside of him and he was little bit ahead of me for the turn for the vehicle was a little ahead of me And I didn t think anything about it Well uh I noticed he he sped up to 60 miles an hour And so I sped up to 60 just to see what he was doing just to kind of let him know Hey you re speeding you know And and we we re still headed outbound we cross over um we cross over Idlewild and um no actually no this is right prior to Idlewild and he s running 60 miles an hour And then he goes he starts going 65 as we as we cross over Conference And so I m going 65 And um I got on the radio with Charlotte thinking he might be impaired or you know drunk or something like that So I try to get in get on the the radio with Charlotte And as I m going down the road 65 miles an hour I see the Charlotte police officer on the right hand side sitting in front of uh um that shopping area right right prior to Conference Is that where the Harris Teeter s at Yeah He s he s sitting right back up there And I try to tell Charlotte that we just passed an officer and needless to say uh they didn t get up with him And so I called my my sergeant and let him know that I was coming inbound By this time we were running 70 miles an hour We re passing um the roads were wet it had been raining that night And um we pass um we pass uh uh the car dealerships on our left hand side We re running 70 as we come past probably the probably at Harris Blvd And so I went ahead and let my units know up ahead as soon as we got into Matthews he s getting blue lighted And I felt that he was impaired to go ahead and start another unit then And so we re running 70 probably 70 a good 70 miles an hour and we go we pass over Sardis North and right as we get into Matthews about where uh Crown Point Executive Dr is I uh told them I was initiating a stop So I flipped on my blue lights and it was on He took off and was running about 90 miles an hour and I m right in behind him um I m keeping radio contact with um with dispatch and the other units And um Rich Brian Rich evidently came up uh Sam Newell and got in behind me I didn t see him because I was worried about this guy We re running we re heading past we re probably at at the Pep Boys now maybe where the Boston Market is We re running probably a hundred Um we got up to the fastest we got up to on 74 was about 110 And um he s still getting on along and uh I m still sticking with him and I felt uncomfortable on the wet roads And um my sergeant of course was asking me during the chase that s uh Sergeant Stevens was making sure that the traffic was was OK and that I felt OK with the chase And the the the what the driver was doing you know keeping up with all the locations and landmarks which I I do pretty well I was ready with that And dispatch is you know telling me whenever I d call out I d say OK Independence and Winter Square Dr And they d say 10 four Independence and Winter Square Dr And I said Still continuing eastbound on Highway 74 And um so we re running we re booking on along about 110 or so and I say uh Headquarters the roads are wet I don t feel comfortable anymore I m going to go ahead and 22 the chase 10 22 is Disregard the Chase you know go ahead and and let back I had already called 10 43 which is Pursuit The minute you call 10 43 basically all radio traffic ceases and you are the you re the main person Rich evidently had gotten in behind me and I 22 ed the chase probably about the Highway 51 bridge maybe a little past it And so as I m backing off I m I m still keeping an eye on him if he s slowing down a little bit and he goes to highway to Matthews Mint Hill and 74 makes a left hand turn And so I went ahead and uh got back in the chase again because I figured um you know I just figured I d go ahead go ahead and chase him because I knew that he couldn t keep up that kind of speed on the uh on the Matthews Mint Hill And Rich was in behind me by then and so we head on the way down Matthews Mint Hill we probably running around 80 or 90 miles an hour We get to uh Providence or uh I m sorry we get to Highway 51 to Matthews Mint Hill and he makes that right turn and he slows down for that and so I m right in behind him blue lights and sirens all the way Give them my location and Brian Rich is behind me And uh we re heading out on Idlewild Rd we re or we re on 51 Matthews Mint Hill both being the same now We get to the Petro we get to the Petro now the BP station at Idlewild and 51 he makes a right heading towards Union County And uh so we start heading down that way and uh we re going on down Idlewild Rd keep right on going cross over 485 construction which it was under construction at that point and um we re we re running a good clip And uh by that time what I had done was you know at about 51 or so I had switched over I was talking to Charlotte Mecklenburg and the Highway Patrol on my main car radio and talking to Matthews dispatch on my hand held as as I m driving Um Rich Brian Rich is still behind me and as we didn t have our new radio tower up had we had the radio tower up I would be able to maintain contact with Matthews on my hand held but the hand helds don t transmit very well Um so I mean I was still maintaining contact and they could still hear me on uh Mutual Aid but the thing was I should have been on Matthews uh main channel on my car radio because it transmits stronger Uh Brian s still behind me and um so I m getting on with the Highway Patrol trying to have the Highway Patrol come and and meet with me because we re heading towards Union County Not that I can t chase into Union county but I d much rather have the Highway Patrolman out there myself because they ll ram somebody off the road in a heart beat Not really but uh they re better at chases they ve had training in chases And um so we start going over some hills down Idlewild Rd and Brian Rich loses me Um or I should say both of us lost him I m still maintaining contact with with Highway Patrol and uh they re hearing me fine and uh they re trying to get somebody out there to me But as we down to we re heading we re getting into Union County a good ways and we get down to we cross over Stevens Mill and there s the next road pass Steven s Mill I think it s Union Mill or Indian Trail Rd I m not exactly sure And there s a BP station right there They lost me and I m still transmitting on Mutual Aid because I didn t see any units around me and I knew we were headed towards a Highway Patrol station because they re down there on Seacrest Short Cut and pretty soon Unionville Rd or Idlewild I think turns into Seacrest Short Cut I believe And uh so my sergeant gets on the radio and says uh you know 321 if you can copy me 22 your chase 22 your chase And so I disregarded my chase and parked at the BP station and uh advised Highway Patrol that I was being 22 ed by my sergeant And uh so I parked there and kind of calmed down for a few minutes and here comes Rich and here comes Sergeant Stevens And so he both pulls in they both pull in you know and I let them know that I lost him and then a Highway Patrolman comes up and uh asks Which way did he go and I say He went down that way And so he heads out that way spinning tires trying trying to catch up to the guy My best guess is what he did was when I 22 ed he probably took a side road and uh headed headed out into the county somewhere So he was never caught No Never caught My I probably he was either it probably wasn t a stolen car or anything like that Probably what had happened was his license was revoked or he was DWI or something like that and uh but but the whole thing about it was had I maintained contact with Matthews on my main radio we would have probably caught him or at least been able to get the Highway Patrol up there and they could have assumed the chase And of course I would have to have been the secondary unit because I I started the chase So Did you get into trouble No Harris just told me Next time be on your radio And Glenn one of the dispatchers up there he goes We didn t have to do anything Uh you were contacting Highway Patrol and you were contacting us and basically you were doing our job for us But I knew that was wrong thing to do But at the time I didn t know where any of my other units were I knew Rich was behind me but I had lost sight of him Pat said he was just afraid that I had uh that I had wrecked or something like that That I was you know in the woods somewhere up against a tree in my patrol car after running 90 miles an hour down Idlewild Rd as it gets curvy But that was the story of my one chase Thank you You re very welcome
