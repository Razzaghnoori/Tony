                all right uh   did you uh did you have to wait very long   excuse me   did you have to wait very long   yeah   oh i forgot my i i had to dig through my suitcase and find my personal identification number   okay       all right so uh   they had   are Americans still paying too much too many taxes thats a thats an easy one are we supposed to spend five minutes on this   yeah i yeah   well no  i mean yes   oh you think you that we are paying too much in taxes   yeah yeah i dont think were paying a lot too much i uh i think were paying i i i used to live in Sweden and uh i know that they pay a lot more than we do   umhum yeah its even higher uh tax rate over there on income   yeah so i guess we should be grateful that its as low as it is   right are are you youre a native youre from uh the United States   yes i im from Idaho actually   but you worked over there for a couple of year   yeah yeah i was so when i was living in Sweden i got uh an impression kind of an impression of their system which is socialistic   yes   and so they everything is subsidized by their government their their taxes are higher than ours so i guess i shouldnt be i shouldnt complain so much       i uh i do get concerned that theres that theres a lot of uh government spending on things like um things that that dont really benefit anyone outside of the congressmans district who proposes the measure like restoring some old ship or something like that   right you talking about special projects in the US in the US you mean now   it   right   okay yeah its true i feel that um you know i dont feel that uh were paying too much taxes provided we get the right services for what we pay for but i think weve kind of gotten away from that um for what we get were paying too much i would say   you wouldnt mind paying that much if you were getting that equivalent value for it   right or if if things i didnt feel that things were wasted   i can go   for uh you know through uh red tape through waste you know uh money a lot of money is lost and how much effect are you getting out of your dollar and how much goes to just waste   yeah i think i have to agree although i pay an awful lot of taxes because im single im in a reasonably high tax bracket so um it seems very expensive to me for what i get   right right typically um you dont get a whole lot   no although i get some things that i very much appreciate i mean i dont i dont have a dictator i dont im not reporting for a dictator i live in a free economy and so i mean in a sense i dont mind spending money on and uh welfare on reasonable amounts of welfare i dont mind spending money on and things like highways and stuff i dont mind spending on   well right a lot of federal money goes for highways but speaking of um people who are on welfare i know one of the presidents Patrick Buchanan has a idea that says that if hes president if you dont get a job within two years then youre taken off welfare so to eliminate people who continuously uh kind of leech off the system you know you you have you get to spend your time but then youre off   huh dont know if i agree with that or not i mean because theres people that just plain i dont know what the percentage is but there is some percentage of people out there that just cannot get a job for whatever reason although two years that does sound like quite a while   yes   i dont know what do you think of that one   well i i i guess im not i dont like to make hard and fast rules that you have to live by because theres always exceptions but i think something has to be done some type of reform measure   he certainly seems to be looking at the right issue   uhhuh yeah   um one thing that ive kind of been following that i id really im kind of waiting for it and i maybe after the presidential elections well see it and that is for President Bush to uh see if he can see if he can uh give the line item veto a try   right   and uh apparently hes been waiting for a test case hes been waiting for quite a while   hm   but i think itd be fascinating to see him try vetoing some of the one of these rider bills thats thats clearly a waste of money and to see how Congress reacts to that   yes   thatd be quite an exciting battle   yeah umhum yeah i dont know whats your situation i live uh im a property owner in the city limits of Atlanta   uhhuh   and we get taxed tremendously tremendously on our property taxes and a lot of that money doesnt go for what the original intent of property taxes was um i pay for a a local hospital uh Grady Hospital where a lot of indigent people are go and get free care   uhhuh   and i pay for schools which you know maybe homeowners should pay for that but i i and a lot of other things
