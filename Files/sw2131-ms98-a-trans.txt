music i even like classical music yeah i did too and then yeah uh i m pretty diversified too i i don t i don t like acid rock either i ve i grew up in a small town so uh the only we only had one radio station so it was country music but then uh when i yeah yeah i grew up with Hank Snow and Lefty Frizzell and Hank Williams and all of those old country and western songs oh really you re older than i am oh but uh i did you happen to see last night the special on channel two with James Galway we don t get channel two my our cable doesn t i wish we got that one it was it well we don t get channel two oh that was fabulous when yeah when he played Danny Boy it just almost brought tears to your eyes because he can make that flute sing oh really yeah and uh it was tremendous now he he is a good uh actually i did i played flute for almost ten years and and uh so i i i i appreciate his too his his music he he he s from Ireland isn t he yeah yeah yeah uh huh and it was uh mostly all Irish tunes

they played all the Irish jigs and so forth it was just fabulous yeah i he he is really good yeah i ve i ve i come from a musical background so uh um i ve played flute flute flute and piano so i i i have uh yeah yeah a big appreciation for music yeah up to a point i i m getting now to the age where i don t like the new stuff that s coming and much of the new stuff that s coming out husband says i m getting old yeah yeah yeah i love uh i like i especially like instrumentals do you yeah i love to just lay back on the couch and and turn a good good instrumental on and just close my eyes and listen that yeah that that s nice to do that that is yeah i ve got a i ve got a two i ve got a two year old who s now getting i m getting well well versed in in kiddy music uh i m i never played an instrument in my life i ve always wanted to i ve always wished my parents had forced me to learn the piano or something yeah yeah well i was one of the forced ones but uh but i i d just love to be able to go to a party or something and sit down at the piano and bang out music oh i could never do that i was never that brave but um yeah hm hm but i guess the closest i ve ever come to participating in music is singing in the choir yeah oh yeah i ve i ve done i ve done that at church too haven t done that in a long time yeah yeah so let s see what well what kind of music do you not like well like i say the acid rock i just do not care and i don t care for rap music either oh oh gosh that s not music that is not i don t know what that is but that s not music huh uh no no if i can t understand the words i don t wanna listen to it well it s it s it s not it s not music it s just it s just uh uh beat talking in a beat it is just it s not exciting at all it doesn t it doesn t give you relaxation you can t dance to it you can t do anything to it yeah yeah yeah yeah right but i and i love uh i look at the orchestra music too like the Boston Pops or or anything did yeah have you ever been to the to to the Dallas Symphony have you is it are they good uh huh yeah yeah they re good are they i i have never i ve never been and uh we went and saw uh Les Les Les Miserables oh really oh the music in that was fantastic i ve i ve heard i ve heard that that is a really yeah i heard that was hard to get tickets to yeah it it uh i can t remember how far in advance we reserved tickets but it was out you know out at the State Fair Music Hall probably cost yeah yeah that was a real and uh it was well worth the price yeah was it i i bet it was i bet i really bet it was is that the only uh musical do you go see musicals musicals a lot of musicals yeah just just ever so often you know a real a real good one like that one and yeah the that that would be that would be nice we went and saw uh i think it was uh Sugar Babies that was good that had good music in it was it i how how i can t i don t know what that s about uh that was the one with uh Mickey Rooney and uh oh what s that real oh not real old uh well she is old too dancer um i can t think of her name i got it right on the tip of my tongue and can t say it Helen something uh oh oh i think i know who you re talking oh i know who you re talking talking about she s got black hair uh real long legs and dark hair yeah okay i know who your talking about i can t think of her name either yeah that was that was that was i remember that being uh here a few years ago i can t think of it yeah but uh oh oh the last country music my my parents still uh really like country music and they they like um they like the Oak Ridge Boys and the Stadler Brothers and yeah oh yeah yeah and uh well my my my my parents Blackwoods yeah my my husband likes uh country music real well and he he likes some of the new groups like Shenandoah and uh yeah he really likes Shenandoah yeah Alabama yeah oh yeah Alabama well yeah yeah Alabama i think they re i think they re a bit too over exposed i get kind of tired get tired tired of every other song being Alabama on the radio yeah but i yeah either Alabama or Hank Williams Junior oh i i i i ve never cared for Hank Williams Junior i never neither and i never have figured out how he won the entertainer of the year for about three or four years in a row i oh we we watch those award shows too we like we enjoyed watching the country and the Grammies and stuff but i just i just don t care for him i just never have i don t yes yeah i guess probably my favorite all time country and western song or singer is uh probably Eddy Arnold is is it okay uh i i i think i i know who that is uh huh i think my parents have have uh some of his records hm yeah um but i got about i ve got about a hundred and or had a uh some uh i sold some of them i had about a hundred and fifty old seventy eight RPM records of country and western songs wow Smiley Burnette i don t know if you re old enough to remember him i ve heard the name he was uh played in the old western movies he was the sidekick of Gene Autry i believe or they i think his name when in the movie was Froggy huh had had a real raspy voice i ve i ve never seen a Gene Autry movie hm and uh some of those old ones of course Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys and Ernest Tubbs and no i never have yeah Red Foley and yeah those go back quite a ways yeah i took them up here to Collectors Rector Records and was able to get a little money for them yeah but uh my mother mother and dad used to own a restaurant and they had a they had a uh nickelodeon of course in the restaurant and when they would come and change the records it s hard to find oh yeah yeah the guys would and the guy would give her the old records well that would that s neat so uh that s where i learned about that would be great great if they weren t too worn out at the time yeah course there s not a whole lot of market for seventy eight RPM records is there not you you d well you d think there would be well the problem is that most of the record players now will not play them because you have to have that needle that uh particular kind of needle well that s true oh yeah and uh they just won t play on a modern day uh well that s a shame phonograph because i i we go to antique stores a lot and you see seventy eights yeah uh a lot at at the store at at at or in record stores you d yeah think there d be a market for i i m sure you could find old players for them but that d cost a fortune if you could find them that worked oh yeah yeah course they you know just don t have the quality of records nowadays either because you you you get that scratchy sound no um hum well those things were big and thick weren t they yeah yeah now you could kill somebody with them and the one you buy go out and buy one now and they re just so thin and flimsy and yeah they warped real easy yeah they just they re not meant to last at all no no neither are tapes i i i buy we buy cassette tapes and machines will eat them you did so you re best bet any day anymore these days is a compact disk those things are practically indestructible yeah yeah yeah yes but i i guess you know the old country and western music you back then when i was a kid there wasn t that much TV so that s all you had to listen to was the radio oh no radio yeah and uh that that s just what just what you had back plus i think it was better back then to the TV there s too much TV now yeah and the radio is you know more exciting really than than television kept your imagination yeah yeah was it it it kept it it just didn t vegetate your mind like television does yeah i remember mother and dad always turned on the Grand Ole Opry oh yeah and was that on the radio every week yeah what what day what day was that on do you have you can you recall i i seems like it was on a Friday Friday or Saturday Friday
