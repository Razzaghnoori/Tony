 Movies Beloved Buena Vista Pictures After weeks of buildup critics are ambivalent about Oprah Winfrey s adaptation of Toni Morrison s novel T he movie is undeniably a labor of devotion and intelligence but in the end a labor is just what it is Owen Gleiberman Entertainment Weekly The film gets a few outright raves and Oprah s performance is universally lauded As for Winfrey one can only say My God what a blaze of genius she is Stephen Hunter the Washington Post But critics praise the film s intentions more than the film itself Other complaints 1 At nearly three hours the running time is too long 2 The plot is hard to follow if you haven t read the book 3 The film is too literal an interpretation of a book whose very essence is obliqueness and indirection Find out more about the film at the official site Bride of Chucky Universal Pictures For the fourth sequel to a movie that wasn t great to begin with this installment in the story of a demonic doll is getting surprisingly good reviews Detractors are predictably disgusted T he novelty of a bloody horror film built around a malevolent doll carrying the soul of a serial killer has worn thin Lawrence van Gelder the New

editorials citing the First Amendment McNally s latter day gay interpretation of the life of Jesus is universally panned Corpus Christi has all the power of a slap across the face with a limp lettuce leaf Jennifer Harper the Washington Times Contrary to expectations the play is neither lascivious nor particularly blasphemous It positively exudes a puppy like friendliness and eagerness to

poetic about the official release of the hitherto bootlegged Royal Albert Hall concert S tunningly good The band creates waves of music that crash onto the shore and Dylan is almost giddy as he rides them in David Hinckley New York Daily News This pivotal concert bridges the gap between Dylan s beloved acoustic phase and his controversial electric phase and the interplay between a defiant Dylan
