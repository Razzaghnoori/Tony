 okay Charles uh gun control what are you uh for in favor or no comment i m very much in favor of gun control oh you are yes i am well this should be very interesting because i m against it i don t i don t mind people owning guns i just think it should be a little you know a little a little more regulated well you know uh now here here s something that uh first occurred to me when they started having all these problems with these automatic uh weapons yes uh now there always has been a federal law against fully automatic weapons i believe that s correct uh huh and yet their uh the gun control enthusiasts are are uh preaching about the gun control and how they should be have we should have stronger laws and what not um hum i don t understand why we don t enforce the laws we have that would certainly help i m sure now this is not just a state law this is a federal law controlled by the Treasury Department um hum yep uh for fully automatic weapons and uh all right now for instance in California where they passed the uh um hum uh semi automatic or or uh now what was it they called them um hum the military version attack weapons or something yeah right uh huh uh how how is that going to affect the uh sports weapons i mean rifles that are automatic or semi automatic um hum yep i really don t have any problem Jack with you know uh people using firearms for sporting purposes i don t have any problem the only thing i i am in favor of the seven day waiting period i would like to see that see that happen i uh huh well now uh i ve got to admit i m inclined to agree with you there um hum uh even though i am a member of the NRA and they are against they their reason being that well if you let one little law get through pretty soon one s going to stack up on top of another and so forth and so on um hum right yeah i understand that and you ve got to admit that Congress does kind of look at things that way um hum that s true i i like i say i don t have any problem with people using firearms you know for sporting purposes or hunting purposes i just think it s just may be a little too easy you know to acquire one on on a whim of some sort uh that that s true uh now did you hear about the the control that they have up in Virginia i m not sure i have uh it it s it s a little hard to believe but they can uh of course like just like just about every other state in the union they have a felony law anyone ever convicted of a a felony is cannot purchase a weapon um hum and they don t have a waiting period because they have access to computer records concerning all these felons and the uh when you go in and buy a weapon or a handgun in uh uh Virginia um hum the salesman just calls some number and uh punches in your name and if it comes up negative okay fine and you get your gun your gun right then and there i see uh but they are the only state that does it hm that s interesting and uh according to Virginia it didn t cost all that much um hum and frankly i i don t understand why a state doesn t have those records available anyway uh uh at least yeah yeah you would think they would uh records of of uh known felons which are available to local police departments um hum yeah right yeah i m surprised that more states doesn t do that uh uh uh certainly those those records are available and all they would have to do is expand it um hum yeah right to uh uh well connect them into a modem somehow um hum i wouldn t think it d be that difficult to do well Virginia is not a particularly rich state and they managed to find squeak out a few bucks to do it yep right and uh it s uh uh one hundred percent successful hm that s interesting yeah i just heard about this last week uh they were bragging about it with uh uh yeah they should have have pride in this because it s it s a good system and it s working well absolutely yeah i agree and they don t need that seven day waiting period uh huh because the whole idea of that waiting period was so that uh it uh the police could check up on you yep well you know what s going to happen there those files are going to back up on somebody s desk just a that typical bureaucratic work um hum that s another uh uh thorn in my side bureaucratics uh huh yeah right i agree yep right politicians i was just thinking there s so anyway well we seem to be one in favor and one against yeah i guess that s about right although neither one of us are are uh really uh uh dyed in the wool uh we but we both uh yeah i m not totally rigid on the subject i just think there should be you know shouldn t be quite so easy to do well there should be some way of checking now here in in Texas uh all you need is a driver s license uh huh right um hum and uh even felons can still get a driver s license sure so i i don t think they are too well they re not rigid enough here in Texas yeah that s true but don t tell the NRA i said that i won t i promise i won t okay i promise they re liable to tear up my membership you say you retired a year ago yes i did uh huh i m looking forward to it in about a just just over a year myself yeah i rea lly enjoy it i stay pretty busy uh uh huh i do quite a not quite a lot i do some uh volunteer work here in Plano i i have a few uh handicapped persons that i you know try to do things for help them do oh uh huh well uh i bought a motor home here four four years ago and i have been living in it ever since and i m looking forward to just traveling uh huh that s uh sure i can understand that i have four sons scattered all over the country and a few few grandchildren and i m looking forward to just traveling around visiting them um hum yep that d be neat sure would well Charles good luck to you on your okay nice talking to you yeah nice talking to you too take care now
