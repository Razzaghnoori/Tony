services Originally the post was simply an inter city letter service One could deposit a letter at the post office in a city for transportation to the post office in another city where the recipient would call for it 1 It was not until the mid nineteenth century that city delivery began on a regular basis in the U S By the end of the century rural delivery was started on a limited basis but it did not become ubiquitous until the early part of the twentieth century Delivery changed the post in many ways No doubt it has been a substantial cause of the tremendous growth in volume since its inception But delivery also changed the economics of the modern post because it introduced a large amount of fixed costs While the letter mail monopoly preceded the introduction of delivery service the fixed costs associated with delivery underlie the two modern justifications for the letter monopoly First it is argued that a letter mail monopoly is necessary to assure universal service at a uniform price Second it is argued that delivery is a natural monopoly and that legal protection is necessary to prevent cream skimming and thereby to maximize the benefit of the universal delivery system 2 The first argument is a political one which presumes significant urban rural cross subsidizes in delivery The second is an economic argument which presumes that the Postal Service as a monopolist is an efficient provider of delivery The analysis presented here is an attempt to address the second argument 1 Campbell James I Jr An Introduction to the History of the Postal Monopoly Law in the United States The Last Monopoly The CATO Institute Washington D C 1996 2 For purposes of this paper cream skimming refers to concentration on serving only those markets that exhibit lower than average delivery costs regardless of the characteristic that causes those costs to be less than average Such characteristics are not confined to network density and could include favorable geographic demographic or operational characteristics For example in the U S curb delivery is less costly than park and loop delivery which is less costly than foot delivery In an unsubsidized postal system as in the United States the postal customer bears all costs of the system The customer therefore is the beneficiary where return to scale are maximized by having a single firm a monopoly provide delivery On the other hand monopolies can be harmful to consumers when they protect technically inefficient behavior and allow economic rents to be extracted 3 This paper sets up a framework to examine the following question Do the economies of scale in the delivery function exceed the technical inefficiencies and economic rents of the Postal Service In short does the monopoly increase or decrease the price of postal services to postal customers 4 This paper measures the returns to scale of the U S delivery function It then compares this benefit with the cost that the monopoly imposes on the consumer Because delivery involves so much fixed cost it would create a tremendous barrier to entry even if the legal monopoly were abolished Thus it may be that having once enjoyed a de jure monopoly national posts would enjoy a de facto monopoly even if the legal one were abolished 5 This paper provides a quantification of the barrier to entry in the letter mail market in the United States caused by high fixed costs in the delivery function This paper next estimates the value of scale in delivery exhibited by 21 national postal systems based on data from an unpublished paper which was presented at the 1994 Stockholm conference on Postal and Delivery Services 6 7 Finally it compares the estimated value of scale with an estimate of the wage premium in each country 3 It is also claimed that monopolies harm consumers with lower quality of service and by being less innovative than firms which must compete 4 It is important to distinguish postal consumers i e paying customers from recipients of mail The latter may derive great benefits from a monopoly in the form of services that would not be provided in a competitive postal environment These might be called political rents Consumers being forced to underwrite the political rents and any inefficiencies and economic rents in the system may be better off in a competitive environment 5 This may well be the case in Sweden which abolished its monopoly in 1993 A letter mail competitor began operations in Stockholm where it captured 20 percent of the market but nonetheless failed 6 An Exploratory Quantitative Comparison of Postal Administrations in Industrial Countries 7 The data for each country is from 1988 and is based on UPU statistics which have been verified and revised as necessary based on communications with officials in most of the countries The Uniqueness of the Delivery Function We distinguish what is known in the U S as the in office delivery function and the street delivery function The former is an extension of mail processing it is where the mail is sorted into the delivery sequence Delivery function as used in this paper refers to street delivery Recent empirical research confirms the widely held belief that economies of scale exist in the delivery of mail 8 Other functional components of the Postal Service are presumed here not to exhibit significant scale economies although this has not been demonstrated John Panzar has characterized street delivery as a bottleneck function because a single firm can deliver to a recipient at a lower total cost than multiple firms delivering to the same customer He suggests that processing and transportation of mail do not seem to be characterized by scale economies and that they could be provided by competing firms Under this scenario he suggests that rates be set to allow nondiscriminatory access to the monopoly delivery service by the firms competing in processing and transportation 9 The Postal Rate Commission and the U S Postal Service have implicitly recognized the absence of significant scale economies in mail processing and transportation functions in the Postal Service s rate structure Postal rates in the U S allow for a substantial degree of competition with the Postal Service in mailprocessing and transportation For example the U S Postal Service gives sorting and barcoding discounts to about 40 percent of First Class letter volume Mailers perform about 60 percent of this worksharing while third parties perform the 8 Natural Monopoly and Technological Agnosticism The

Delivery Services Ed Michael A Crew and Paul R Kleindorfer Kluwer Academic Publishers 1993 rest 10 11 In some classes mailers transport much of their mail to downstream locations to take advantage of zoned rates for transportation Street Delivery Cost While the Postal Service collects extensive data on the cost behavior of city delivery carriers it collects little data on the cost behavior of rural carriers12 For purposes of this analysis we assume throughout that rural delivery cost behavior is similar to that of city delivery 13 In the U S street delivery costs for rural and city carriers combined comprises 21 percent of total costs See Table 1 Table 1 USPS Operational Costs by Major Function Note Nonoperating costs such as payments made to the Treasury for retroactive charges are excluded 10 These third party sorters collect mail from mailers sort and apply barcodes and deliver the mail to the Postal Service for a portion of the discount In addition discounts encourage bulk advertising mailers to sort their mail all the way to the carrier s walk sequence thereby avoiding the carrier in office function 11 Economic rents in the form of a wage premium paid by the U S Postal Service partially explain why mailers and third parties can sort mail at a lower cost than the Postal Service When third parties compete with the Postal Service however in highly automated operations such as applying barcodes with optical character readers and sorting barcoded mail a wage premium would seemingly not be a very significant factor 12 The U S Postal Service has two types of delivery personnel city delivery carriers and rural carriers In 1993 there were 164 thousand city delivery routes with 80 million delivery points and 49 thousand rural routes with 23 million delivery points Rural costs were 20 percent of total delivery costs 13 For example it is assumed that the ratio of rural carrier in office cost to total rural carrier cost is the same as the ratio of city carrier in office cost to total city carrier cost This paper adopts the analysis of street delivery costs presented by the U S Postal Service in several rate proceedings over the past 20 years That analysis disaggregates street delivery time into three subcomponents route time access time and load time Route time is the time it would take a carrier to walk or drive the route passing but not accessing any delivery point Access time is the time it takes a carrier to deviate from the route in order to make a delivery This may mean departing from the basic line of travel and walking or driving to a delivery point and returning to the basic line of travel or it may mean slowing down from normal driving speed stopping to make a delivery to a curbside mail receptacle and then resuming normal speed Finally load time is the time it takes a carrier to place the mail in a mail receptacle 14 Table 2 disaggregates street time in the U S Table 2 Note For simplicity coverage related load time 1 232 million is included in access time and street support is piggybacked on all three functions Route time costs are essentially fixed while access is partly variable and load time is 100 percent variable with volume The analysis of variability of access time involves estimating the number of new accesses that would be caused by an increment of volume In the U S approximately 93 percent of all possible stops receive mail each delivery day 15 Consequently the number of new accesses 14 Load time is divided into elemental and coverage related load time Elemental load time varies with the number of pieces being loaded Coverage related load time is the fixed portion of load time at a stop it varies with the number of stops Thus it is partly variable and partly fixed 15 A stop consists of one or more possible deliveries For example a 5 unit apartment house with a cluster of 5 mail boxes would be one stop and 5 possible deliveries caused by an increase in volume would be small Regression analysis of carrier street data indicates that at the current volume the variability of access cost is about 6 percent In other words a 10 percent increase in volume will yield a 0 6 percent increase in the number of accesses The Postal Service regularly collects a representative sample of street delivery costs volumes and delivery point characteristics for city delivery carriers The Postal Service s FY 1993 data set contains observations from about 300 routes 16 Observed every two weeks over a one year period data is collected from about 270 000 stops This data is used to model the behavior of access costs The coverage function shown in Figure 1 models the change in the percentage of possible stops that are accessed on a route as a result of changes in volume 17 Marginal access cost can be estimated from the coverage function As volume per stop grows and coverage approaches 100 percent the volume variability of access cost approaches zero As the volume per stop declines coverage declines and the volume variability of access costs rises Measure of Scale Economies Our methodology for measuring scale economies essentially compares the cost of providing delivery by a single firm with the cost of providing delivery by two firms 18 We measure the returns to scale in the U S postal delivery function by first determining the total cost of delivery provided by the Postal Service Next we determine the total cost of delivery performed by the incumbent and a second firm that is assumed to be equally efficient We assume that the two firms share the market equally each delivering a random half of the mail Further each firm serves 16 See the testimony of U S Postal Service witness Bradley in Docket No R94 1 USPS T 5 at pp 5 10 17 The Postal Service developed the coverage function and first used it in the Docket No R76 1 rate case For this paper we have altered the Service s model slightly Unlike the Postal Service s model all stop types and mail classes are consolidated 18 Of course the cost of providing delivery by a single firm could also be compared with the cost of three or more firms This would simply inflate the measure of scale economies the entire country each delivery day Thus each firm would have to incur the same route time costs that the incumbent currently incurs Since each firm will have only half the volume the number of accesses by each firm will be less than the incumbent currently experiences The number of total accesses by the two firms will however be greater than the total experienced by the incumbent alone This is because some stops receiving multiple pieces will receive delivery from both firms We assume here that both firms provide the same frequency of delivery daily 19 Since route time is essentially fixed 20 it would double with two firms providing service each with half the volume Conversely because load time is 100 percent variable with volume it would not change since total volume is assumed not to change Access cost would fall somewhere in between since it is partly variable and partly fixed Access cost variability is estimated from the coverage function shown in Figure 1 Under the duopoly scenario described it would grow by 61 percent Given these responses to volume total street time cost would increase from 10 billion to 16 1 billion The difference 6 1 billion represents an upper bound on the benefits from scale economies of delivery 21 Monopoly Rents and Inefficiencies In 1993 the average U S postal worker subject to collective bargaining received 35 001 in pay and allowances and an additional 7 713 in fringe benefits 22 To put these earnings into perspective the median annual earnings 19 A niche incumbent might provide delivery less frequently or to a subset of possible stops These would be special cases of the more general case analyzed here 20 The slight variability the Commission has found in route time is ignored here for convenience 21 Ceteris paribus less efficient postal services do not have greater scale economies than more efficient ones Theoretically scale economies in delivery are not firm specific They are a product of the territory served and the current state of technology which would be employed by an efficient firm The 6 1 billion figure is inflated by any inefficiency and or wage premium which characterize the U S Postal Service and in that sense it is an upper bound 22 The fringe benefit figure excludes unfunded civil service retirement liability certain annuitant benefits workers compensation unemployment compensation repriced annual leave bonuses and awards without fringe benefits was 24 076 for full time U S workers in that year 23 Michael B Wachter of the University of Pennsylvania and his colleagues conclude that there is a wage and fringe benefit premium for the postal bargaining labor force of 29 5 percent with respect to comparable workers in the private sector 24 Such a wage premium would amount to 9 billion in monopoly rents for the entire postal system Wachter s 9 billion system wide wage premium exceeds the 6 1 billion delivery scale economy by 2 9 billion Wachter s wage premium for the delivery network alone however amounts to only 2 3 billion which is 3 8 billion less than the value of the scale benefit from delivery Unlike labor costs technical inefficiency of the Postal Service has not been analyzed There is however some indirect evidence of inefficiencies in the Postal Service Since 1970 total factor productivity has increased at an average annual rate of only 0 4 percent This is in spite of the fact that little mechanization existed in the Postal Service prior to 1970 and large amounts were added in the 1970s Beginning in the early 1980s and continuing to the present about 5 billion has been invested to automated mail processing including the in office carrier sequence function and forwarding for undeliverable as addressed mail Additional billions have been invested in buildings in part to house the automation In spite of this investment productivity appears to have increased only in response to hiring freezes or reductions in the average wage and fringe benefit package caused by special circumstances 25 26 23 Statistical abstracts of the U S Table 665 1994 24 The Comparability of U S Postal Service Wages and Benefits to the Private Sector Evidence from the Total Compensation Premium New Hire Increases Quit Rates and Application Rates Michael L Wachter Barry T Hirsch and James W Gillula July 10 1995 Dr Wachter has published a number of studies on the Postal Service s labor costs under contract to the USPS Critics of previous Wachter studies claim that they ignore the fact that the Postal Service pays minorities the same as it pays white males The critics argue that it is the Postal Service s minority employees not white male employees who earn more than their private sector equivalents and this only means that the Postal Service does not discriminate 25 See A study of U S Postal Service Productivity and Its Measurement Staff Study of the Postal Rate Commission May 9 1990 26 Other indications of inefficiency are management claims that work rules are unnecessarily restrictive and that 73 075 grievances were filed by employees in FY 1995 and not resolved at the local level In addition the Postal Service has failed to capture a large market share in two areas of direct competition with the private sector which are relatively unaffected by the Private Express Statutes Parcel Post and Express overnight Mail This may have been in part caused by either a wage premium or technical inefficiencies or a combination of both The Postal Service argues that a Figure 2 presents the consumer benefit from delivery scale economies net of inefficiencies which are expressed as a percentage of total postal costs The top curve incorporates any wage premium the Postal Service may have the bottom curve nets out Wachter s 29 5 percent wage premium The top curve shows that if the Postal Service has 0 percent inefficiencies with its current wage premium the measure of scale economies equal 6 1 billion If the Postal Service were about 13 percent inefficient there would be zero net scale benefit The bottom curve shows that at 0 percent inefficiencies the net scale benefit is 2 9 billion if the value of scale is adjusted for Wachter s wage premium Any inefficiency would exacerbate the loss If the wage premium is accurately calculated by Professor Wachter it would be difficult to defend the U S postal monopoly on purely economic grounds Moreover understanding the net economic cost of the monopoly allows one to see how much universal service costs postal customers at least under current institutional arrangements Figure 3 presents the same information considering the street function alone Wachter s wage premium amounts to only 2 3 billion for the delivery function alone Thus the net scale benefit is initially positive whether or not we adjust for the wage premium It is far more likely that a monopoly for delivery alone would produce net benefits for consumers than would a monopoly that included processing and transportation as well as delivery This result lends support to the Panzar s suggestion of opening processing and transportation to competition while maintaining a monopoly in delivery lack of pricing flexibility has contributed to the Postal Service s failure Others argue that the quality of service product features and underlying cost of these Postal Service s offerings make them uncompetitive Barriers to Entry Because a large proportion of street costs are fixed 27 the unit per piece street cost initially declines rapidly as volume increases and continues to decline at a decreasing rate A firm with a small share of total volume that competes with an incumbent in delivery only will find its unit cost high relative to the incumbent even if the competitor pays no wage premium and or is more efficient A competitor can reduce its fixed costs by reducing the level of service i e deliver less frequently than the incumbent Many First Class mailers do not require daily delivery and most advertising mailers do not require daily delivery While it may be politically difficult incumbent postal administrations have the possibility of reducing delivery frequency Table 3 displays the cost savings if the U S Postal Service were to reduce delivery frequency The savings are substantial relative to the current 10 billion delivery costs They are not so substantial when considered in the context of the total Postal Service expenditure in 1993 of 48 billion Table 3 Cost of Delivery Frequency Table 4 illustrates how difficult it would be to enter the U S delivery market 28 The table displays the market share that a competitor would have to capture in order 27 In the U S about 71 percent of street cost are fixed 28 Over and above the problems discussed here the U S mail box law represents a huge barrier to entry The law forbids any private party from placing anything in a receptacle used to deliver mail to a residence or business to have the same unit costs as the U S Postal Service For example if a competitor delivered six days a week and its combined wage and efficiency advantage is 50 percent the competitor would have to capture 35 percent of the total market in order to have the same unit delivery cost as the Postal Service Even if this competitor delivered only one day per week it would have to capture 15 percent of the total market in order to have the same unit delivery cost as the Postal Service on a national basis This is about 27 billion pieces per year or 519 million pieces per week Assuming a competitor would capture volume slowly and would have to charge rates no higher than the incumbent the competitor would have to be ready to sustain large loses before it could break even Thus the effects of economies of scale in delivery present significant barriers to entry Table 4 Break Even Market Share for Competitors Competitor Combined Wage and Efficiency Advantage An International Comparison of the Values of Scale in Delivery with Wage Premiums As mail volume increases in postal systems variable costs processing and transportation increase and fixed costs decrease as a percentage of total costs Therefore street delivery costs which are largely fixed decrease as a percentage of total costs as volume increases Route time cost which is a fixed cost and the largest component of street delivery costs decreases with a rise in volume The fixed access cost as a percentage of total cost would increase with volume until all stops are covered while the variable access cost percentage decreases as volume increases Figure 4 shows these relationships for the U S Postal Service costs Conversely as volumes decrease fixed costs become a higher percentage of total costs For example if the U S Postal Service volume were one third of the 1993 level then delivery costs as a percentage of total costs would increase from approximately 21 percent to 36 percent of total costs In equally efficient but smaller volume postal systems street delivery costs should also be a much greater percentage of total costs than the 21 percent in the U S Postal Service Table 5 displays the implied coverage the percentage of total cost represented by street delivery cost and the percentage of total cost represented by fixed delivery cost for the 21 countries based on their respective per capita volume in 1988 29 For example Germany had about 230 pieces per capita which yields a coverage of about 64 percent Its per capita volume and corresponding coverage imply that its fixed portion of delivery equaled about 19 percent of its total costs The U S by comparison had about 535 pieces per capita and had 91 percent coverage for 1988 Thus the fixed portion of delivery in the U S amounted to about 14 percent of total cost The implied coverages range from 16 percent to nearly 100 percent The implied proportions of fixed delivery cost tot total cost ranged from 12 percent to 43 percent This assumes that the coverage function Figure 1 developed from an analysis of delivery routes in the U S is valid for the other countries included in this analysis Table 5 Fixed Delivery Costs Note Assumes fixed costs are incurred only in the delivery function All other functions are assumed to vary with volume For each of the 21 countries in the international data set described above we calculate the value of scale in the delivery function using the same approach we used for the U S with a slight modification For the U S we calculate the value of scale by comparing the cost of a hypothetical duopoly with the cost of a monopoly This is calculated using volume per possible stops data and the coverage function For the other 20 countries we use a slightly different approach because detailed street delivery cost and point of delivery data are not available We use volume per capita as a proxy for pieces per possible stop and assume that the street delivery cost to total cost relationship of the U S is the same for the other 20 countries See the Technical Appendix for a more detailed discussion of the methodology Using the 1988 data we use the per capita volume for each country to approximate pieces per possible stop We assume a direct linear relationship between volume per capita and pieces per possible stop Using the estimates of pieces per possible stop for each country we then calculate the monopoly and the duopoly costs based on the U S costs We then take the ratio of the value of scale to the monopoly cost and multiply that ratio by the actual total costs for each country to estimate the value of scale for each country For example for the United Kingdom the value of scale is about 4 46 billion using the U S model In 1988 the total cost for the Postal Service was about 36 5 billion When we adjust the total cost for the United Kingdom s coverage level the total cost would be about 26 7 billion If we assume that all cost segments other than street delivery vary with volume the value of scale is about 17 percent of the total cost at the United Kingdom s volume and coverage levels We then apply the 17 percent estimate to the United Kingdom s actual total cost for 1988 6 58 billion to calculate the value of scale 30 The value of scale for the United Kingdom is about 1 1 billion Table 6 displays the estimates of value of scale for the 21 countries in our data set The value of scale ranges from 14 million for Luxembourg to 4 5 billion for the U S A measure of a wage premium can be calculated for each country by comparing the postal hourly wage with the average manufacturing wage in that country 31 It should be noted that Belgium Finland and Spain have a negative wage premium according to this measure The net value of scale is the difference between the value of scale and the wage premium 30 The total costs for national postal systems other than the U S are expressed in purchasing power parities 31 The postal data for calculating the wage premium comes from the above mentioned paper The private sector data comes from International Comparisons of Hourly Compensation Costs for Production Workers in Manufacturing 1993 U S Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics Report 873 June 1994 Table 6 Comparison of Value of Scale in Delivery with the Wage Premium in 21 National Postal Systems millions 1988 Note Expressed in U S dollars based on purchasing power parities If the wage premium measure is valid then seven countries have a wage premium alone which exceeds the value of scale in the delivery function Australia Austria France Japan Luxembourg Switzerland and the United States In these countries it appears that it would be difficult to justify a postal delivery monopoly based on economic grounds Better understanding of inefficiencies in national postal systems would allow further evaluation of the economic basis for the postal monopoly in the remaining countries 32 Sweden and Finland do not have legal monopolies TECHNICAL APPENDIX A Estimating the Coverage Function 1 Data We use the FY 1993 data from the Postal Service s City Carrier System CCS to model the behavior of access costs The CCS data base contains a representative sample of street delivery costs volumes and delivery point characteristics for city delivery carriers The CCS FY 1993 data set contains observations from about 300 routes The Postal Service sampled each route every two weeks over a one year period resulting in about 8 000 route level observations 2 The Coverage Model For this paper we use a nonlinear regression model that establishes the relationship between volume and coverage We define coverage as the percentage of stops on a route that receive mail It has been well established that route coverages relate directly to the fixed and variable nature of access cost The coverage model specification is as follows COVi 1 e b PPSi 1 where COVi ASi PSi ASi Number of actual stops on route i PSi Number of possible stops on route i PPSi Number of pieces per possible stop on route i Since coverage cannot exceed 100 percent we have specified an exponential function The regression results from the model are highly significant The estimated coefficient b is 0 6587 B Measure of Scale Economies 1 Scale Economies for the U S We measure the returns to scale in the U S postal delivery

billion If we assume that all cost segments other than street delivery i e in office delivery mail processing transportation retail services and other costs vary with volume the value of scale amounts to about 13 percent of the total cost 2 Scale Economies for 21 Postal Systems1 For each of the 20 countries other than the U S described above we use a slightly different approach because detailed street delivery cost and point of delivery data are not available We use volume per capita as a proxy for pieces per possible stop and assume that the street delivery cost to total cost relationship of the U S is the same for the other 20 countries First we use volume per capita for each country to approximate pieces per possible stop We assume a direct linear relationship between volume per

Kingdom s volume and coverage levels We then apply the 17 percent estimate to the United Kingdom s actual total cost for 1988 6 58 billion to calculate the value of scale The value of scale for the
