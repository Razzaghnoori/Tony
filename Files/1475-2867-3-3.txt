 Background Vitamin E is an essential fat soluble vitamin The general term vitamin E refers to eight naturally occurring and synthetic tocopherols and tocotrienols and their acetate and succinate derivatives Although the naturally occurring forms of vitamin E have lipid soluble antioxidant properties that protect cell membranes against damage by free radicals the acetate and succinate derivatives that are esterified at the C 6 position of the chromanol ring do not have antioxidant properties unless the esterification is hydrolyzed and free tocopherol is regenerated 1 2 3 Synthetic vitamin E a form of vitamin E commonly used as a dietary supplement is the form used in the in vivo studies reported here It is a mixture of eight stereoisomers in equal amounts designated dl or all rac tocopherol and does have antioxidant properties 4 Thus different forms of vitamin E can have different antioxidant properties as well as differences in their absorption distribution and metabolism 4 There are also reports that some forms of vitamin E have activity against cancer cells in vitro 3 5 For example tocotrienol and vitamin E succinate are reported to have antiproliferative activity in human cancer cells whereas some forms of vitamin E are reported to induce apoptosis in cancer cell types but not in normal cell types 3 Specifically these apoptogenic forms include RRR tocopheryl succinate and RRR tocopherol while the and tocopherol and acetate derivatives of tocopherol were not apoptogenic 3 There are few reports on the use of vitamin E for treating tumorous cancers in vivo but the results are inconsistent 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 It is therefore essential that the form of vitamin E used in any research study as well as the dosage and the mode of administration be defined The study reported on here was originally designed to test the ability of a high dietary dose of sE to prevent lipid peroxidation in nude mice bearing a human breast cancer xenograft MDA MB 231 11 12 To assure suppression of lipid peroxidation sE was added to the diet at a dose level For example the vitamin E requirement for mice when all rac tocopherol acetate is used as the dietary source is 32 mg kg for diets in which lipids comprise less than 10 percent of the diet 1 Thus the 900 mg kg diet used in this study is 28 fold higher than this estimated requirement This is in contrast to human recommendations which are given in mg of tocopherol equivalents with the adult RDA set at 15 mg day and the upper limit set at 1000 mg day The observed antitumor activity of this sE dietary supplementation was an unexpected experimental result as sE was not previously reported to have antitumor activity although vitamin E may give modest protection against the risk of breast cancer 5 Based on the observed antitumor activity of high dose sE in the diet it became important to investigate if the sE supplement when fed at such a high dose was associated with the modification of the fatty acid composition of mitochondrial and microsomal membranes and if the sE was acting as an antioxidant or possibly a prooxidant in tumor and in host tissues Given that such a high dose of sE has antitumor activity it also became important to look for possible side effects in host tissues prior to further preclinical trials Results Tumor growth The mean tumor growth rate was calculated using linear regression analysis of mean tumor size over time After two weeks of dietary intervention the mean growth rate of the group of mice fed the sE supplement was half that of mice not fed the sE supplement however this difference was not quite significant at the p 0 05 level Tumor growth rate in mice not sacrificed after 2 weeks of dietary intervention was followed for an additional four weeks Analysis of mean tumor growth rate for the entire 42 days of intervention revealed that the mean tumor growth rate of mice fed the sE supplement was 63 slower than the mean tumor growth rate of mice not fed the sE supplement significant at p 0 01 as illustrated in Fig 1 Lipid peroxidation Tumor and host tissue malondialdehyde and malondialdehyde by products were analyzed by the thiobarbituric acid reactive substrates TBARS assay to estimate the extent of lipid peroxidation after six weeks of intervention The TBARS findings are summarized in Fig 2 The mean value of TBARS was significantly p 0 01 lower in the tumor and in the liver of the mice fed sE but was not significantly different p 0 05 in the colon Fatty acid composition of microsomal and of mitochondrial membranes Data on the percent of the total fatty acid composition for linoleic acid LA for arachidonic acid AA and for docosahexanoic acid DHA in the microsomal and in the mitochondrial fractions of tumor of liver and of colon after two weeks of dietary intervention both with and without sE supplementation are summarized in Table 1 The mean levels of LA were lower in both microsomal and mitochondrial fractions of the tumor the liver and the colon of mice fed sE than in mice without the sE That 6 of 6 mean values of LA were lower with sE supplementation indicates a consistent pattern of membrane LA composition change in the tumor and in the host tissues Conversely the mean level of DHA was higher in the microsomal and mitochondrial fractions of the tumor the liver and the colon of mice fed sE than in mice without the sE supplement That 6 of 6 mean values of DHA were higher with sE supplementation indicates a consistent pattern of membrane DHA change in the tumor and in the host tissues The mean level of AA in the membrane fractions of the three tissues was not consistently changed To further explore the effect of sE supplementation on membrane fatty acid composition the relative level of each of the three fatty acids in each fraction of each tissue was expressed as a ratio of the level with sE supplement over the level without sE supplement The results of this exercise are plotted in Fig 3 The ratio is consistently lower than unity for LA mean 0 70 and consistently higher than unity for DHA mean 4 9 The mean ratio for AA was near one indicating no significant difference Body weight Data on change in body weights at two weeks and at six weeks from the body weight at the start of dietary intervention are summarized in Table 2 The mean values for change in body weights at two or at six weeks are not significantly different due to diet The body weight loss observed at six weeks can be attributed to the presence of the growing tumor Blood counts Results of blood counts as summarized in Table 3 reveal no significant differences in white cell WBC in red blood cell RBC or in platelet PLT numbers due to two weeks of sE supplementation Colon histology Colon crypt height expressed in number of cells from the crypt base to the crypt mouth was scored as an indicator of damage attributable to sE supplementation The crypt column heights number of cells mean SE was 21 24 0 54 15 for mice without the sE supplementation and 21 63 0 51 11 for mice with the sE supplementation These means are not significantly different No histological differences attributable to the dietary intervention with sE were observed Heart histopathology and antioxidant enzyme gene expression Histological cross sections of the heart taken one third of the distance from the apex were studied for indications of side effects of high dietary levels of sE Vacuole formation in the cardiac myocytes has been used as a marker of cardiotoxicity 13 The mean percent of cardiac myocytes with one or more vacuoles in the subendocardial myocytes of the left ventricle was significantly p 0 05 higher in mice fed the sE supplement Fig 4 Based on this indication of cardiotoxicity the remaining portion of the heart that had been snap frozen in liquid nitrogen at the time of sacrifice was used to look for differences in expression of antioxidant genes using quantitative RT PCR methodology The results of the RT PCR findings are summarized in Table 4 Of the antioxidant enzyme mRNAs measured the only mRNA that differed significantly due to diet was the inducible form of heme oxygenase which is identical to heat shock protein 32 A complete set of data was taken on each heart which allowed calculation of the ratio of each antioxidant gene transcript to each of the other gene transcripts The results of this ratio analysis reveal that the feeding of sE supplement caused the ratio of MnSOD over GPX 1 to significantly increase see Table 4 Assay for chromosomal breakage or loss The presence of one or more micronuclei in peripheral erythrocytes in mice is an accepted marker of chromosomal breakage or loss that occurred prior to the extrusion of the nucleus during erythrocyte differentiation Results of the scoring of the numbers of peripheral erythrocytes with and without a micronucleus are summarized in Table 5 Included in Table 5are data from mice treated with a series of injections of doxorubicin Doxorubicin DOX is a cytotoxic drug with prooxidant properties known to cause genotoxic damage resulting in an increase in number of erythrocytes with a micronucleus The results from the DOX treated mice served as a positive control Results of statistical analyses demonstrate a significant increase in erythrocytes with micronuclei due to DOX treatment but no significant difference due to sE supplementation Note that the highest mean incidence of micronuclei occurred in the group of mice fed the sE supplement and treated with DOX Discussion Vitamin E was established as an essential micronutrient for proper fetal development 1 and the amount of vitamin E required to maintain proper fetal development has been defined in International Units In addition to its role in reproduction vitamin E is known to be a lipid soluble antioxidant that blocks peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in cellular membranes and is known to stabilize biological membranes 14 15 16 17 Because vitamin E has multiple biological activities it is best to report dosage in weight units The recommended dietary allowance and tolerable upper intake limit for sE the commercially available form has been calculated to be about 22 and 1470 mg per day respectively for 70 kg adult humans 1 In animal species oral intake of up to 200 mg kg body weight per day was reported not to result in noticeable side effects 18 Thus we selected to use a dietary dose of sE at the level of 200 mg kg body weight per day in tumor bearing mice in an attempt to maximize inhibition of lipid peroxidation in the cellular membranes of the tumor without an expectation of finding harmful side effects Specifically this experiment was originally designed to test the hypothesis that DOX a prooxidative cancer chemotherapeutic drug inhibits tumor growth by increasing lipid peroxidation products in the tumor to cytostatic or cytotoxic levels and that suppression of lipid peroxidation by sE would suppress the antitumor effects of DOX 11 12 The results demonstrated that sE supplementation did markedly suppress DOX induced lipid peroxidation yet tumor growth was still suppressed in mice treated with DOX and sE It was concluded that increased levels of lipid peroxidation products were not the sole cause of tumor growth inhibition by DOX As reported here Fig 1 the dietary supplementation with this high dose of sE by itself retarded tumor growth to a significant extent It is not known how such a high intake of sE works to suppress tumor growth What is known from the current study is that the sE supplement reduced lipid peroxidation Fig 1 and preferentially stabilized membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids with more double bonds Fig 3 It has been proposed that vitamin E may incorporate into cellular membranes by association of the tocopherol side chain with the polyenoic fatty acid residues in the membrane fatty acids 15 19 This interaction may stabilize cell membranes by making highly unsaturated fatty acids less liable to peroxidation as well as by making highly unsaturated fatty acids less available for phospholipid hydrolysis by phospholipase 15 16 The latter action may reduce mobilization of arachidonic acid AA from the membranes and in this way reduce the amount of AA available as a substrate to cyclooxygenase and or lipoxygenase to produce eicosanoids with mitogenic and with inflammatory properties 17 20 Other possible antitumor actions include induction of apoptosis interference with hormone production modulation of cellular signaling and gene transcription and induction of differentiation 4 21 22 23 24 In comparison to the inhibitory effect of vitamin E on mammary tumor growth this report Cognault et al report a stimulatory effect of vitamin E on mammary tumor growth Specifically Cognault et al report that when the diet was high in omega 3 PUFAs tumor growth was significantly increased by vitamin E supplementation However when the diet was relatively low in omega 3 PUFAs the promotional effect of vitamin E was not observed 8 It is noteworthy that the diet used in the presently reported study was very low in omega 3 PUFAs and that this diet combined with the high dietary level of sE resulted in suppression of tumor growth Thus the different results may be attributable to the type and the amount of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids PUFAs in the diet Evidence for cardiotoxicity as observed in this study was not expected as supplementation with vitamin E at extremely high doses gave no significant indications of harmful side effects in animals or in humans 18 25 Perhaps vitamin E supplementation acts to inhibit lipid peroxidation but at the same time acts to down regulate other protective antioxidant systems as suggested by the antioxidant enzyme gene expression data in Table 4 If gene expression levels in Table 4reflect antioxidant enzyme activity then an increase in SOD and decrease in GPX without an increase in CAT would result in accumulation of inorganic and organic peroxides and hydroperoxides that can react with Fe 2 to yield highly reactive free radical products that can damage cellular proteins and DNA as well as lipids Likewise the sE supplementation used caused low expression of the stress induced isoform of heme oxygenase HO 1 HO 1 catalyzes the breakdown of prooxidant heme to biliverdin with release of carbon monoxide and iron ion It should be realized that these observations are suggestive of cardiotoxicity but are not definitive Early studies suggested that vitamin E lessened the cardiotoxic effects of DOX chemotherapy 26 whereas other studies indicate potentiation of DOX induced cardiotoxicity 27 28 Shinoyawa et al 28 suggest that vitamin E when combined with DOX may increase levels of toxic products in the heart and in the tumor while Liu and Tan 27 suggest that vitamin E may have prooxidant properties at high dosage levels The micronuclei results in Table 5suggest that while sE protects against lipid peroxidation it did not protect the genome of erythroblasts against the prooxidant effects of DOX in this study Thus while the toxic effect of DOX was not significantly enhanced by vitamin E supplementation neither was the toxic effect of DOX lessened by vitamin E supplementation Conclusion The adage that more is better may not hold true for vitamin E as there may be beneficial effects at certain levels but not at high levels Clearly more research is needed on the antitumor effects of sE but caution is advised that sE may also have side effects in the heart
