 re Boris and Bill Dear Andrew You didn t just accuse me of complicity in murder did you If we want to get into evil empires and who supports them conservatives have a great deal to answer for South African apartheid and other anti democratic regimes around the globe and don t forget the genocidal Khmer Rouge supported not by Russia but by the US govt Things are not so simple as us good them bad And there are more than two positions I didn t defend the Soviet Union while it existed so why should I do so now Soviet style Communism is not my idea of the left I agree with you about Tony Blair s Thatcherite propensities Although I suppose British voters don t see it that way or they wouldn t have delivered the Tories your guys as I remember such a smashing defeat It strikes me by the way that you have given yourself the heads I win tails you lose position If the Tories had defeated Blair you would have taken it as their vindication and the final trouncing of the Left Faced with the fact that your side in fact lost the election you simply declare Blair an honorary Tory But what about the real Tories I may be wrong of course but I don t think Russia is on its way to solid prosperity more like third world extremes of rich and poor I think what s going on now is basically the looting of the country s resources by an elite of ex communists speculators and mafiosi Although maybe when things get bad enough Nike can come in and built some sweatshops there You know for generations Communists told themselves the sufferings imposed by their system were temporary necessary sacrifices usually to be made by someone else on the way to a better world It seems to me you are making the same argument on behalf of unbridled market capitalism and with the same self exception it s always easy to be stoical on other people s behalf Do you have a time limit in mind for your experiment Talk to you soon Katha
