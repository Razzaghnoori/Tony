 Drug Company Merger Maniacs Need Sedation In the wake of American Home Products friendly bid for Warner Lambert and Pfizer s 80 billion or 74 billion depending on who s counting hostile counter offer click here to read an Explainer on hostile takeovers expectations are growing that we re going to see a wave of mergers in the pharmaceutical industry Novartis Glaxo Monsanto Schering Plough Merck Everyone is either on the block or shopping Whether all this buying and selling makes economic sense seems somehow beside the point After all they don t call it merger mania for nothing The most perplexing thing about the goings on in the pharmaceutical industry though is not that drug company CEOs would rather run 70 billion companies rather than 30 billion companies Nor is it that Pfizer s bid which remember it could have made long before American Home Products came a courting seems driven as much by the if you want Warner Lambert then I want Warner Lambert impulse as anything else These after all are the basic ingredients of many if not most mergers which has something to do with the fact that most mergers destroy and don t create economic value No the most perplexing thing about all the merger talk is the reaction of investors who have driven up the prices of pharmaceutical stocks pretty much across the board Since acquisitions almost universally occur at a price above the current market price and since bidding wars of all kinds tend to drive prices far above fair value investors have jumped into the drug stocks assuming that merger mania has to be good for them Here s the problem though There are no outside bidders for these companies The only company that s going to buy a Glaxo is another drug company So there isn t any flood of outside capital coming into the drug industry If a wave of mergers gets touched off all that s going to happen is that capital will be redistributed from certain companies shareholders to other companies shareholders But the total amount of value in the industry as a whole will remain the same In bidding up the prices of all these drug companies then investors are essentially saying that if you divide a pie up into four slices it s more valuable than if you divide it up into eight slices But the pie is the very same size It just looks different It s true that it s better all other things being equal to own one of the four slices rather than one of the eight But all other things aren t equal since for Pfizer to become a 70 billion company it s going to have to spend huge amounts of money to acquire Warner Lambert The possibility of a merger wave may make the stock of the potential acquirees more valuable But it should make the stock of the potential acquirers equally less valuable The other possibility is that there really will be synergies in the new giant companies that will make them more profitable together than they are apart But it is hard to see what these are and empirically synergies are next to impossible to realize What that means is that the determinants of value for the industry as a whole free cash flow return on invested capital and future growth prospects will remain unchanged after the merger wave is done And that means the stock price of the industry as a whole if there were such a thing should remain the same
