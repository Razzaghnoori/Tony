        i got a budget that i worked out on a spreadsheet that i keep on my home computer the only thing is that i kind of drifted away from it originally when i set it up       um id started back to school and had all these grand plans and sat down and figured out everything to the penny all the way down to haircuts every little thing i could imagine spending money on       and got it all set up and then kind of got tuned to it and for about a year or so i kept real good track of bills and made sure things fit into it but i got to the point where my spending habits pretty much stabilized and i just knew what they were i dont think ive looked at that thing in a year and a half     uh i wish i could say that we did the same in terms of our family uh it we have considered it from time to time and the problem that i always got into was the hassle of keeping track of all the data and then deciding basically what we was going to do about it   um   because to me the need for a budget is especially when moneys tight and im happy to say that moneys not too tight we just kind of drift along   yeah   uh weve gotten into troubles recently while the last couple of years were all of a suddenly uh its IRS time and we look and say ooh we owe a lot of money       but weve even recovered from that and so i guess our budget is mostly in our head   yeah keeping it keeping all the records and all that stuff is a pretty high maintenance thing takes some dedication to really sit down and do it but it definitely does pay off if you keep track of things keep a good grip on it   how does it pay off for you   well by seeing the flow and stuff like that i can see where theres a lot of uh frivolous frivolous waste too much uh going out things like that that really i can do without those kind of things its hard to um to just go out and keep a day to day balance of stuff   right   reminds me years ago i had trouble quitting biting my nails and i read some uh suggestion that said well you know if you keep them all and tape on a piece of paper and see how many you know nails youre biting off youll be amazed       and uh man that that ended it in about a week um     and the same thing for the budget huh   yeah very similar procedure   interesting i i just got a lecture today from my mother about being frivolous she wants me to be more frivolous       and so i guess my thought there is uh not to uh not to look at it and say oh my goodness im not allowed to do this on the other hand uh i think im ready to elect you to Congress uh uh in terms of actually considering a budget   and staying with it   really that has got to be one of the worst problems weve got here today     right   and its hardly considered you know here it is uh a an election election year and you hardly hear anything about it   right right   especially the deficit this massive looming black cloud waiting to break out on us   yep and so i think we as a society tend to have uh at least now kind of uh well budget who needs a budget i mean were having fun   yeah yep   and so i guess im kind of midway between the the party party party side and the uh uh oh my goodness we got to look at every last cent actually your story reminds me of uh when back in college uh i had overspent my budget which was kind of haphazardly kept but it became very obvious when i had something like twenty eight dollars left for the month of February uh and it got very obvious as to what i was going to do uh and some of that included eating     um yep     uh i it was called subsist on peanut butter and jelly for the the month and at one point some girls in a sorority that i knew uh that i hung out at felt sorry for me and took me in the back room and fed me a salad     yeah colleges and education in many ways       you bet you bet i think the reason why they did was they were afraid that somebody else was going to win the pool on whether i was going to die of berry berry or some sort of  disease like that     i havent resorted to um peanut butter but i have had to go to long periods of ragu and um pasta     well at least youre not down to cat food   ooh ooh actually weve got a stash of that we had a cat but it ran away   uh oh no   um so weve got a good bit weve got a dog now and itll eat the cat food though thats its treat at the end of the day   sounds like a dog with a complex   well hes a puppy i dont thing he really knows knows too much of uh the difference yet     uh great   its good food fortunately thats cheap and it fits in the budget twenty five cents a can     yeah right right well as long as youre not teaching him how to meow or something like that   well ive been trying to teach him to sing lately yeah thats uh it hasnt been real successful but he barks real well   oh really uh reminds reminds me of that old adage never teach a pig to sing the results can be really terrible and besides it annoys the pig   uh
