broker The new spin Of course 2 5 99 Washington D C Mayor Anthony Williams decided to rehire a white aide who had resigned for using the word niggardly The word means stingy and is unrelated to the N word but some people had misunderstood it The aide David Howard had then resigned saying his use of the word was insensitive and Williams had accepted his resignation Williams now says he acted too hastily The spins 1 Bravo to Williams for admitting his error and refusing to bow to ignorance 2 Howard should take a less visible job because his rapport with black city residents is crippled 3 Howard says the episode was really not about me or the use of the word niggardly It was about feelings underneath the surface I used to think it would be great if we could all be colorblind That s naive especially for a white person 4 Shut up and take the job 2 5 99 The White House rebuked People magazine for running a cover story on Chelsea Clinton The profile while essentially positive dwells on a negative context how the Lewinsky scandal is stressing out Chelsea and affecting her personal life e g the headline is Grace Under Fire An intimate look at the deep bond of love that sustains the Clinton women through their painful family ordeal The White House reportedly tried to spike the story on security grounds then condemned it as an invasion of Chelsea s privacy The spins 1 The Clintons are good parents who are trying to protect their daughter 2 They re hypocrites since they ve used People and other popular magazines for publicity about their family when it suits them 3 Chelsea is

Social Security The GOP wants an across the board tax cut but Clinton proposes smaller targeted tax breaks e g for long term health care instead Clinton calls his budget progressive but prudent The GOP calls it more big government Editorial spins 1 Clinton should be applauded for spending less and saving more than the big government critique admits 2 Republicans are right that he s using the surplus to avoid adjusting Social Security taxes and benefits so the program will remain solvent 3 But their tax cut would only make things worse 2 3 99 An Oregon jury ordered anti abortion activists to pay 107 million in damages for running a Web site that tracks the murders of abortion providers The site called The Nuremberg Files identifies the doctors baby butchers in the format of a most wanted list along with their home addresses license plate numbers and the names of their spouses and children The doctors names are crossed out as they are murdered The plaintiffs spin The site is a

campaign for Democratic House candidates in the hope that Democrats will recapture the House and he will become speaker This leaves ex Sen Bill Bradley D N J alone against Vice President Al Gore The

Clinton s impeachment The unspoken spin He s getting whipped by Gore in the polls 2 3 99 The Rev Jerry Falwell apologized for saying the Antichrist must be Jewish At a prayer breakfast he said I apologize to my Jewish friends here and around the world and I apologize to the Christians here for having created any kind of rift I apologize not for what I believe but for my lack of tact and judgment in making a statement that served no purpose whatsoever The spins 1 Falwell is an anti Semite 2 No the only reason he had said the Antichrist must be Jewish is that Jesus was Jewish and the Antichrist is supposed to resemble Jesus 3 So Falwell had nothing to apologize for other than insensitivity another triumph of political correctness 4 If resemblance to Jesus were the only issue why didn t Falwell say the Antichrist must be a carpenter For more on the Falwell Antichrist flap see in Slate 2 3 99 Scientists say they have found the source of HIV They traced HIV 1 the virus that has

Broncos won their second straight Super Bowl beating the Atlanta Falcons 34 19 The hero was 38 year old Broncos quarterback John Elway who passed for 336 yards and ran for a touchdown to put the game away The goat was Falcons safety Eugene Robinson who was arrested the night before the game for allegedly trying to buy oral sex from a prostitute Sports writers mercilessly scrutinized Robinson s errors in the game notably getting burned on an 80 yard touchdown pass and partly blamed the Falcons sloppy performance several muffed touchdown opportunities and four second half turnovers on the attendant dismay and distraction The runner up goat was Falcons Coach Dan Reeves whose defeat at the hands of his former quarterback Elway and an assistant coach he fired seven years ago Broncos Coach Mike Shanahan made Reeves 0 4 in the Super Bowl The postgame hype revolves around whether Elway will attempt a threepeat next year or will retire on top as Michael Jordan did 2 1 99 Family values activist Gary Bauer announced he would form an exploratory committee to run for president The political spin is that Bauer will be the Pat Buchanan of 2000 He lacks experience in elected office and is too conservative for most voters he plans to make anti abortion legislation a cornerstone of his campaign but he will have plenty of diehard donors volunteers and caucus goers from the religious right

leave of absence from his job then set up an announcement interview on Meet the Press then persuaded newspapers to write preview stories about the TV announcement all before he had even filed the papers to set up the committee that would set up his eventual campaign The New York Times punished Bauer s milking of the media by publishing a follow up story about how he milked the media 2 1 99
