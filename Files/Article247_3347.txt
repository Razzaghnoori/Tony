 After the Flood Dear Jodi I feel a little like a contestant on an old time game show like Supermarket Sweep staggering to the check out counter with boxes of Cheerios and cellophane wrapped Porterhouse steaks dropping off the top of my overstuffed grocery cart So many newspapers so little time Jodi it seems like months ago that we started these exchanges musing about the cosmic meaning of day trading It may be a reflection of our amnesiac media culture that Monday s societal menace of crazed stock market fiends has already disappeared down the memory hole As I prepare to pack up my newspapers I can t resist passing on one more gem Today s Washington Post ran a mournful headline that read Hundreds Are Killed Millions Left Homeless by Asian Floods Guess where the Post played this story Page A 15 beneath the fold But don t blame the Post The Wall Street Journal kissed off 1 8 million homeless Chinese in six terse lines towards the bottom of its front page news briefs And what about the Times rightly famed for its international coverage Not a word in today s paper about the Chinese floods presumably because they deemed a chatty feature on the Italians obsession with cell phones to be more relevant to its readers In fairness the paper of record ran a wire service picture on Wednesday s Page A 6 of flood drenched South Korean mourners crossing over to a funeral in rowboats Jodi I ll especially miss our e mail exchanges tomorrow morning when the Journal arrives with its special Weekend section which frankly I find addictive packed with stories about 7 million vacation homes and new electronic gizmos for the bored executive Last week the Journal found a business titan who admitted that he had fired someone over his cell phone while lounging on the beach This is getting to be a long good bye So before I wax too maudlin let me just say Jodi that you ve been a great morning pen pal Enjoy the F train And here s hoping that you enjoy the summer weekend without thinking for a single New York minute about the upcoming Senate race Fondly
