 what kind of lawn and garden work do you do well right now the place where i m living the yard was basically neglected for the about the last twenty five years so i ve been trying to rebuild and reestablish the entire lawn and after three years of working at it i ve i ve been amazed at just what a little bit of doing help out things to the lawn has really brought it back instead instead of mowing it the same direction every time changing one day you ll or one one one time you ll cut it cut the lawn the long way then you ll go the opposite way instead of going lengthways you go width and it helps the grass come back oh does it really i didn t know that did um you ve been working on it for three years for for three years really what have you done killing lots of fire ants i was firmly convinced the entire front yard was nothing but one gigantic ant mound uh huh because it was like you couldn t you couldn t even stand still out there without ants starting you know i can barely hear you is this better yeah a little bit yeah it was like you d go out in the yard to water something you d just be standing still uh huh and the ants would start crawling up your legs and it s like i m not standing in a mound though oh wow how did you get rid of them uh Dursban Two pardon a chemical called Dursban Two it s a crystal oh Dursban Two yeah Dursban will get rid of just about anything i think but um so you haven t had a problem with that since um not bad every once in a while you ll have a mound pop up but that s yeah gonna to be expected what else did it kill did it kill anything else it wasn t supposed to um as far as i can tell it hasn t killed anything it wasn t supposed to the even the area of the grass that was underneath and around the mounds it didn t kill it not really yeah really well that s pretty wild we yeah we used it for fleas we had fleas in our yard real bad last year and we did that um i just i m not basically i like to mow the lawn believe it or not but i sometimes have problems starting the mower so a lot of times i don t get out and do it but my husband basically does most of it and he does the you know edging and all that kind of thing and we re renting and so we don t really put a lot of money into the uh you know this like this lawn could probably stand a couple of loads of dirt and some Saint Augustine we just we have winter rye out back and we have i don t even know what it is out front but um we this is the first house we ve ever lived in and we re just not real into the lawn probably because we rent i guess huh but anyway well well you said you had problems with fleas last year in the yard right uh huh we get uh i found one thing that it s kind of a weird thing to say to put out in the lawn but every time i ve done it it s got it it drives the fleas completely out of the area what powdered sulphur oh really hm i wonder why it does you don t you don t have to put a whole lot out just if you ve got a broadcast spreader uh huh i think it comes in a forty pound bag and it s real fine like flour uh huh and you just sift yeah go out and do the entire yard and you i mean you don t have to put clumps of it just very lightly cover the entire yard really well i ll have to remember that because uh hopefully we won t have them this year but we have a cat that comes in and out and the cat was getting um fleas and stuff and bringing them in the house so we had a real problem last year with fleas and it was uh quite a drag because um we got them in our house and we re Christians and we prayed that we could get rid of these fleas and we got rid of them believe it or not with smoke bombs which is just about impossible to do but we did and so we don t want them back this year you know so i ll remember that if we see it s a problem in the yard we almost they were so bad last year even ticks it i don t know we ve had ticks before a lot and we ve had to get out and treat our lawn for that i think we used Dursban we used Dursban and Diazinon and get out there and do what you do with that thing you know and spread it all out everywhere but that s about the extent of our lawn care so i don t know do you enjoy doing it oh i love it my wife can t understand it d be a hundred degrees outside i ll be out there but it s too hot to be working in the yard i m under the trees i m having fun and i m stopping to drink water so what s the problem yeah well that s well that s funny yeah not everybody enjoys it though everybody has a different things i kind of enjoy it and my husband doesn t i kind of have to sometimes i m too busy to get out there and do it and he you know he doesn t really enjoy doing it but he ll do it and he doesn t gripe about it or anything but you know i m kind of like you and he s kind of like your wife and you know in that he doesn t really enjoy it but i would like to have a garden though that s my thing but right now where we re living we have the trees where the uh roots are at the top of the ground everywhere all over the ground i don t know what kind of trees they are but you can t have a garden you can t till it or it ll it ll tear up a nice tiller so we re going to wait until we move we don t have a lot of sun either because it big trees back there so we re going to wait and when we move that s one of our priorities is to get a house where we can have a um garden and so i d like to do that i have a feeling i ll be out there all the time taking care of that but that s our next thing do you have a garden i ve got the this is the neat thing about the place we ended up at i m sitting on about a two acre lot now and uh half of it s the back half is my garden um hum oh are you kidding that sounds fun where do y all live uh in Missouri City southwest southwest side of Houston oh really what southwest where southwest Houston oh really oh because we re in Dallas i guess i assumed you were here well that s neat and um yeah that s what we want we have a yeah that s really what we want but we just haven t been able to do that yet so one day we ll be able to do it and i m excited about it and then i don t know anything about it and i ll have to learn and maybe i ll give you a on gardening what do you do in your garden and i ll go nothing what is should i do but anyway i guess that s about it though it sounds like we ve covered all the bases so i guess we ll let you go and um do you have anything else you wanted to say uh no enjoyable very enjoyable conversation with you okay i know you too i hope you have a nice day and we ll talk to you later bye okay you too okay bye bye
