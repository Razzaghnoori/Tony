 so what TV shows do you like do you like comedies or i like comedies and i like sitcoms i like to watch TV for escape i m not much interested in uh huh do you like uh do you like Cheers yeah i like that and i like L A Law and i like Thirty Something Cheers Night Court i like Night Court in fact it s on right now yeah i i think that s pretty much what i like is my favorite TV show is Cheers and then after that is uh Night Court but i also i also like Star Trek and that s kind of an adventure i guess you would call it yeah i never really got involved in Star Trek and i don t really care to watch movies because it s committing too much time i think yeah you know you never know what s going to come up you know if you commit thirty minutes or an hour to watch some TV shows it s a little different than yeah that s true you know two hours for a movie especially you know things that are i hate things that are continued yeah especially like uh have you have you seen that movie uh Dances with Wolves no i haven t you don t want to see it it s like three hours long and it just drags on forever that s what i ve heard well i like i mean i like you know things that are funny and and all you know like like Cheers you know is really funny it it makes you laugh or you know so it s not like uh uh a show that goes on forever even though it s only half an hour i think yeah and it s a just a nice escape and you know it s something to laugh at and enjoy yeah something to remove you know something to remove me from reality for a little while get away from real life right exactly exactly that s that s what i like because i i mean i don t know it s just something i think something we need as you know as human beings something to remove you from reality to relieve the stress yeah and Cheers does it i don t know i like the way i like the way the people act in Cheers it s it s pretty funny it s it s kind of you know the extremes of certain characters yeah yeah you re right about the other you re right they are now that i think about it yeah i watch it it s on it s on here um like three or four times a night on various cable channels i m sorry i think i must ve i ve probably seen every episode about thirty five times yeah the syndicate yeah they when they ll show one one episode in one channel and like the next day they ll show it on another one well yeah but right um let s see here they ve got it they ve got it at like six six or six thirty and then they have it again at ten and ten thirty you know on a different channel yeah and so you know where where i where i where i m at right now is in a dorm and we don t have the uh we don t have cable so i just get regular TV but oh okay we see it uh every day at six o clock uh huh the older one yeah right and then the new one comes on at nine Thursdays yeah i m trying to think what other shows i like there there s just television has changed so much and uh there s just not as many really good shows on i think as there used to be yeah i guess a lot of people think that the shows that i watch are kind of stupid and most of my friends and the people i know don t well how about the Wonder Years do you like the Wonder Years yeah i like that that s pretty good i mean it s it s not something you see every day so it s i guess it that that keeps the quality a little higher well yeah and what i like about that show is that the time the time period that that takes place in is exactly the age i was during that time period uh huh so it s even closer to you yeah it s kind of funny to you know sit back and remember it brings back a lot of memories um i don t know i like do you like um i don t know if if you re you would know like Barney Miller do you ever watch that or the old Bob Newhart Show uh huh i never ever really got into Bob Newhart never got into those the old i m talking about the old one when he was a psychologist no i don t i don t i never never saw that don t remember those i don t know my friends don t like my TV TV they think it s trashy but uh well yeah i kind of i kind of stayed away from the TV for a couple of years when i first came up here so i you know there s a gap in my TV viewing but recently that s basically what i watch is Cheers and yeah and uh and Night Court because they re right they show them back to back back to back when i was in college you know we didn t have TVs and so i remember somebody happened to have one in their room it was a really big deal and everybody d get together like one night a week to watch TV but i hate that span of giving you have to give up a lot of TV when you when you re when you re going to school lot of things you have to give up when you re going to school yeah but uh well sounds like we have real similar tastes we have tastes i mean as far as the sitcoms go what about the do you like L A Law or yeah no no i don t i don t particularly get into those shows because they don t keep my interest i ve seen um L A Law i think once or twice and the episode wasn t that great so i just i figured they were all like that so i don t waste my time is that all uh huh looking at that and you know and if it s if it s funny or if it keeps my interest if it s exciting i ll watch it if not i don t and times that i saw that or pieces of that it wasn t any it wasn t great Thirty Something i watched a few times because there was a few good episodes and then after that it it i just lost interest in it yeah um but i guess it s because it s not aimed for an audience of my age yeah probably not no i m i m in my twenties my early twenties and so i guess Thirty Something is not is definitely not for me about ten years yeah ten years down the road for you but um those are really the only two drama shows that i like and i tell everybody don t call me but other than that i you know i like i um i m recovering from surgery and so i read and watch a lot of television so uh huh i get to see just about everything yeah well that that way you ll you ll get to see all the shows and you get to really form good opinions on which one is really good and which one is really yeah but who cares about my opinion yeah i like the uh i don t know it seems like some of the best shows they take off the air one of my favorite shows was Wise Guy and they took that off the air what was wise guy it was a cop show oh but i mean i heard of it before but i never i never seen it yeah i have to stay up if i want to see it i have to stay up till eleven thirty and then it s all reruns and the guy that was started out in it isn t in it and anyway it s a long did you have you ever seen that that show they i mean they they trashed it before it ever got started but it was like i think they showed a couple of shows of uh what is it a Cop Rocks or something like that i heard a lot about it but i never saw it now i heard i heard it really sucked did it because uh it was supposed to be something like a show uh singing and like like a musical but yeah oh really like a musical like right in the middle of acting they would sing songs or something you re kidding no maybe i should have surely it maybe it would have been pretty funny i don t know i can see why it crashed i don t think it was supposed to be funny though you know well it was nice talking to you nice talking to you i guess you ll get to watch all of Night Court yeah i ve missed the first ten minutes oh well i ll get off the phone and let you watch it then and good luck on your recovery i m sorry i m just teasing thanks all right bye bye bye
