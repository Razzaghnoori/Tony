 Pushing Politics and Prozac Please send your questions for publication to prudence slate com Dear Prudence I didn t think Jerry Springer should so I m glad he decided not to I do think you should run for Congress Not only does Congresswoman Prudie have a nice ring but your constituents readers would definitely benefit from all the sound advice you could impart to all those bozos such as Tom DeLay currently taking up space in D C Some friends and I have collected 23 to get your campaign started So think about it Electorally yours Neil Dear Elect If Prudie were paranoid she would think some of her readers were trying to get her out of the advice business what with one fellow wanting Prudie to run for president and now you suggesting Congress Prudie however is not paranoid so she thanks you for the well vote of confidence As for the 23 why don t you start PrudiePac and see if you can t straighten out the dolts in Washington Prudie politically Dear Prudie Two of my friends have begun taking anti depressants One for depression I guess the other to quit smoking Because they are on anti depressants now they think EVERYONE needs them and have literally been making appointments for their whole families Both have told me I definitely need them I have a professional therapist with whom I discussed this and she disagrees My therapist is not against medication and in fact recommends it for some patients When I explained this to these two ladies they both shook their heads like they know better than my therapist One came right out and shouted that I was in denial Wouldn t it be nice if people restricted their opinions to those areas in which they had professional expertise What do you think Christine Rochester N Y Dear Chris The last time Prudie checked girlfriends could not prescribe drugs It is a rule of human nature that people often when they add or subtract something from their lives think everyone else should do the same Tune out the suggestions of these amateur shrinks You are right that it would be nice if people only spoke of things about which they were expert It would also be nice if every female over the age of 16 had a 5 000 gift certificate at Tiffany s Alas my dear neither one is likely to come to pass Prudie realistically Dear Prudence Do we as a society need a refresher course on what things to say or not to say to a pregnant woman My best friend is 37 weeks pregnant with her second child She has been getting comments about how large she is for the past three months Worse than even the comments one woman just stood in front of my friend and gaped saying Oh my God Why would people feel the need to point out a pregnant woman s size And is there an appropriate response to these people that would remind them their comments are not appreciated Sincerely Annoyed in Omaha Neb Dear Ann As for why people say inappropriate things it usually has to do with the connector cable between brain and mouth being on the fritz These rude and unappreciated remarks just slip out the verbal equivalent of being a klutz The way Prudie knows this is that she herself has made this mistake a time or two well maybe three or four If your friend with the belly spanning two ZIP codes wants to have a comeback she might try looking down then remarking Pretty good huh And I m only two months along Prudie promises you the thoughtless person will have nothing more to say Prudie pointedly Prudie My girlfriend is a staunch supporter of Patrick Buchanan for prez I feel Buchanan is way too liberal for my taste I have been a big Pat Robertson fan for years The girlfriend also listens to Rush Limbaugh but I know that Rush has been a running dog lackey of the liberal Republican news media for years A typical liberal country club Republican I was going to support Sen Bob Smith of New Hampshire in his new Conservative Taxpayers Party but now that he s withdrawn there seems to be no one true to the Reagan legacy The question is should I dump the girlfriend Redmond Wash Dear Red You re kidding right The part about Buchanan being too liberal supplied the hint And Redmond is home base for Slate so Prudie will offer a choice of answers allowing for all contingencies 1 If the political chasm is legitimate and as wide as you describe yes undo from the girlfriend If you guys have such different outlooks now future differences have the potential for major fireworks 2 If you are a fellow Microsoftie pulling Prudie s leg to kill time before a Jolt Cola break why don t you get back to work hmmm Prudie constructively
