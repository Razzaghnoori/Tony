 The Net The Crack of the 90s It s painful to watch the demise of a city daily We went through it in 1995 when Times Mirror shut down New York Newsday Prematurely I still believe The paper had already broken even and in today s economy would probably be adding millions of dollars a year to shareholders profits On the other side I correctly predicted five out of the last zero deaths of the New York Post As you ve indicated newspaper competition is often better in theory than in practice I remember visiting a friend last year at Mother Jones who had a front page of the Chronicle reproduced on her office bulletin board One story was about marijuana consumption another about chocolate She had written Slowest news day of all time on her copy but from what you say it sounds more like business as usual Still whatever the Chronicles s weaknesses it seems unlikely that eliminating competition will make them better As for the New York Post it s still kicking and usually kicking Hillary Clinton Today s front page WHAT HILLARY DIDN T SAY Author She skirted issue of sex addiction in interview It seems entirely possible that anti Hillary stories could take up three quarters of the front pages of the Post between now and Election Day 2000 in a city where the all but declared candidate first lady is reasonably popular That political truncheon gives you some idea of why Rupert Murdoch keeps the money losing paper around But then since Fast Company s owner is Murdoch s chief competition maybe the less I say on this subject the better I can t say I liked the Kuczynski piece much The article quotes Esquire editor David Granger blaming among other factors the Internet for the putative inability of magazines to engage in real debate This fuels my theory that the Internet is becoming to the late 90s what crack was to the late 80s a catchall explanation for everything that goes wrong in a particular sector Crime up Must be crack Circulation down Must be the Internet Magazine editors don t have a clue about what readers really want Gotta be the Internet I admire Granger for turning his magazine around somewhat when everyone else was ready to apply embalming fluid But for him to assert and for the Times to accept a causal link between the Net s rise and Esquire s decade long tumble is ridiculous The decline of the general interest magazine has been with us for a lot longer than Kuczynski or Granger have had a login and password Unfortunately the reasons increased number of titles declining newsstand sell through etc are often very dull and so it s much easier just to blame the Net To be fair the Times piece does mention other forces but I still find it an unambitious mishmash Not that the Net doesn t change things Just turn the page to find the story about Cisco Systems investing a billion dollars in KPMG the accounting and consulting business The New Economy taking over the Old Now there s a story for a magazine that wants to engage readers
