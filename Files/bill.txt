413 PHASE I SULFUR DIOXIDE REQUIREMENTS a Emission Limitations 1 After January 1 1995 each source that includes one or more affectedunits listed in table A is an affected source under this section After January 1 1995 it shall be unlawful for any affected unit other than an eligible phase I unit under section 413 d 2 to emit sulfur dioxide in excess of the tonnage limitation stated as a total number of allowances in table A for phase I unless A the emissions reduction requirements applicable to such unit have been achieved pursuant tosubsection b or d or B the owner or operator of such unit holds allowances to emit not less than the unit s total annual emissions except that after January 1 2000 the emissions limitations established in this section shall be superseded by those established in section 414 The owner or operator of any unit in violation of this section shall be fully liable for such violation including but not limited to liability for fulfilling the obligations specified in section 406 2 Not later than December 31 1991 the Administrator shall determine the total tonnage ofreductions in the emissions of sulfur dioxide from all utility units in calendar year 1995 that will occur as a result of compliance with the emissions limitation requirements of this section and shall establish a reserve of allowances equal in amount to the number of tons determined thereby not to exceed a total of 3 50 million tons In making such a determination the Administrator shall compute for each unit subject to the emissions limitation requirements of this section the difference between A the product of its baseline multiplied by the lesser of each unit s allowable 1985emissions rate and its actual 1985 emissions rate divided by 2 000 and B the product of each unit s baseline multiplied by 2 50 lbs mmBtu divided by2 000 and sum the computations The Administrator shall adjust the foregoing calculation to reflect projected calendar year 1995 utilization of the units subject to the emissions limitations of this subpart that the Administrator finds would have occurred in the absence of the imposition of such requirements Pursuant to subsection d the Administrator shall allocate allowances from the reserve established herein under until the earlier of such time as all such allowances in the reserve are allocated or December 31 1999 3 In addition to allowances allocated pursuant to paragraph 1 in each calendar yearbeginning in 1995 and ending in 1999 inclusive the Administrator shall allocate for each unit on Table A that is located in the States of Illinois Indiana or Ohio other than units at Kyger Creek Clifty Creek and Joppa Steam allowances in an amount equal to 200 000 multiplied by the unit s pro rata share of the total number of allowances allocated for all units on Table A in the 3 States other than units at Kyger Creek Clifty Creek and Joppa Steam pursuant to paragraph 1 Such allowances shall be excluded from the calculation of the reserve under paragraph 2 b Substitutions The owner or operator of an affected unit under subsection a may include in itssection 404 permit application and proposed compliance plan a proposal to reassign in whole or in part the affected unit s sulfur dioxide reduction requirements to any other unit s under the control of such owner or operator Such proposal shall specify 1 the designation of the substitute unit or units to which any part of the reduction obligations ofsubsection a shall be required in addition to or in lieu of any original affected units designated under such subsection 2 the original affected unit s baseline the actual and allowable 1985 emissions rate for sulfurdioxide and the authorized annual allowance allocation stated in table A 3 calculation of the annual average tonnage for calendar years 1985 1986 and 1987 emittedby the substitute unit or units based on the baseline for each unit as defined in section 411 4 multiplied by the lesser of the unit s actual or allowable 1985 emissions rate 4 the emissions rates and tonnage limitations that would be applicable to the original and substitute affected units under the substitution proposal 5 documentation to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the reassigned tonnage limitswill in total achieve the same or greater emissions reduction than would have been achieved by the original affected unit and the substitute unit or units without such substitution and 6 such other information as the Administrator may require c Administrator s Action on Substitution Proposals 1 The Administrator shall take final action onsuch substitution proposal in accordance with section 404 c if the substitution proposal fulfills the requirements of this subsection The Administrator may approve a substitution proposal in whole or in part and with such modifications or conditions as may be consistent with the orderly functioning of the allowance system and which will ensure the emissions reductions contemplated by this title If a proposal does not meet the requirements of subsection b the Administrator shall disapprove it The owner or operator of a unit listed in table A shall not substitute another unit or units without the prior approval of the Administrator 2 Upon approval of a substitution proposal each substitute unit and each source with suchunit shall be deemed affected under this title and the Administrator shall issue a permit to the original and substitute affected source and unit in accordance with the approved substitution plan and section 404 The Administrator shall allocate allowances for the original and substitute affected units in accordance with the approved substitution proposal pursuant to section 412 It shall be unlawful for any source or unit that is allocated allowances pursuant to this section to emit sulfur dioxide in excess of the emissions limitation provided for in the approved substitution permit and plan unless the owner or operator of each unit governed by the permit and approved substitution plan holds allowances to emit not less than the units total annual emissions The owner or operator of any original or substitute affected unit operated in violation of this subsection shall be fully liable for such violation including liability for fulfilling the obligations specified in section 406 If a substitution proposal is disapproved the Administrator shall allocate allowances to the original affected unit or units in accordance with subsection a d Eligible Phase I Extension Units 1 The owner or operator of any affected unit subject to anemissions limitation requirement under this section may petition the Administrator in its permit application under section 404 for an extension of 2 years of the deadline for meeting such requirement provided that the owner or operator of any such unit holds allowances to emit not less than the unit s total annual emissions for each of the 2 years of the period of extension To qualify for such an extension the affected unit must either employ a qualifying phase I technology or transfer its phase I emissions reduction obligation to a unit employing a qualifying phase I technology Such transfer shall be accomplished in accordance with a compliance plan submitted and approved under section 404 that shall govern operations at all units included in the transfer and that specifies the emissions reduction requirements imposed pursuant to this title 2 Such extension proposal shall A specify the unit or units proposed for designation as an eligible phase I extensionunit B provide a copy of an executed contract which may be contingent upon theAdministrator approving the proposal for the design engineering and construction of the qualifying phase I technology for the extension unit or for the unit or units to which the extension unit s emission reduction obligation is to be transferred C specify the unit s or units baseline actual 1985 emissions rate allowable 1985emissions rate and projected utilization for calendar years 1995 through 1999 D require CEMS on both the eligible phase I extension unit or units and the transferunit or units beginning no later than January 1 1995 and E specify the emission limitation and number of allowances expected to be necessaryfor annual operation after the qualifying phase I technology has been installed 3 The Administrator shall review and take final action on each extension proposal in order ofreceipt consistent with section 404 and for an approved proposal shall designate the unit or units as an eligible phase I extension unit The Administrator may approve an extension proposal in whole or in part and with such modifications or conditions as may be necessary consistent with the orderly functioning of the allowance system and to ensure the emissions reductions contemplated by this subpart 4 In order to determine the number of proposals eligible for allocations from the reserve undersubsection a 2 and the number of allowances remaining available after each proposal is acted upon the Administrator shall reduce the total number of allowances remaining available in the reserve by the number of allowances calculated according to subparagraphs A B and C until either no allowances remain available in the reserve for further allocation or all approved proposals have been acted upon If no allowances remain available in the reserve for further allocation before all proposals have been acted upon by the Administrator any pending proposals shall be disapproved The Administrator shall calculate allowances equal to A the difference between the lesser of the average annual emissions in calendar years1988 and 1989 or the projected emissions tonnage for calendar year 1995 of each eligible phase I extension unit as designated under paragraph 3 and the product of the unit s baseline multiplied by an emission rate of 2 50 lbs mmBtu divided by 2 000 B the difference between the lesser of the average annual emissions in calendar years1988 and 1989 or the projected emissions tonnage for calendar year 1996 of each eligible phase I extension unit as designated under paragraph 3 and the product of the unit s baseline multiplied by an emission rate of 2 50 lbs mmBtu divided by 2 000 and C the amount by which i the product of each unit s baseline multiplied by anemission rate of 1 20 lbs mmBtu divided by 2 000 exceeds ii the tonnage level specified under subparagraph E of paragraph 2 of this subsection multiplied by a factor of 3 5 Each eligible Phase I extension unit shall receive allowances determined under subsection a 1 or c of this section In addition for calendar year 1995 the Administrator shall allocate to each eligible Phase I extension unit from the allowance reserve created pursuant to subsection a 2 allowances equal to the difference between the lesser of the average annual emissions in calendar years 1988 and 1989 or its projected emissions tonnage for calendar year 1995 and the product of the unit s baseline multiplied by an emission rate of 2 50 lbs mmBtu divided by 2 000 In calendar year 1996 the Administrator shall allocate for each eligible unit from the allowance reserve created pursuant to subsection a 2 allowances equal to the difference between the lesser of the average annual emissions in calendar years 1988 and 1989 or its projected emissions tonnage for calendar year 1996 and the product of the unit s baseline multiplied by an emission rate of 2 50 lbs mmBtu divided by 2 000 It shall be unlawful for any source or unit subject to an approved extension plan under this subsection to emit sulfur dioxide in excess of the emissions limitations provided for in the permit and approved extension plan unless the owner or operator of each unit governed by the permit and approved plan holds allowances to emit not less than the unit s total annual emissions 6 In addition to allowances specified in paragraph 4 the Administrator shall allocate foreach eligible Phase I extension unit employing qualifying Phase I technology for calendar years 1997 1998 and 1999 additional allowances from any remaining allowances in the reserve created pursuant to subsection a 2 following the reduction in the reserve provided for in paragraph 4 not to exceed the amount by which A the product of each eligible unit s baseline times an emission rate of 1 20 lbs mmBtu divided by 2 000 exceeds B the tonnage level specified under subparagraph E of paragraph 2 of this subsection 7 After January 1 1997 in addition to any liability under this Act including under section 406 if any eligible phase I extension unit employing qualifying phase I technology or any transfer unit under this subsection emits sulfur dioxide in excess of the annual tonnage limitation specified in the extension plan as approved in paragraph 2 of this subsection the Administrator shall in the calendar year following such excess deduct allowances equal to the amount of such excess from such unit s annual allowance allocation e 1 In the case of a unit that receives authorization from the Governor of the State in which such unit is located to make reductions in the emissions of sulfur dioxide prior to calendar year 1995 and that is part of a utility system that meets the following requirements A the total coal fired generation within the utility system as a percentage of total system generationdecreased by more than 20 percent between January 1 1980 and December 31 1985 and B the weighted capacity factor of all coal fired units within the utility system averaged over the period from January 1 1985 through December 31 1987 was below 50 percent the Administrator shall allocate allowances under this paragraph for the unit pursuant to this subsection The Administrator shall allocate allowances for a unit that is an affected unit pursuant to section 414 but is not also an affected unit under this section and part of a utility system that includes 1 or more affected units under section 414 for reductions in the emissions of sulfur dioxide made during the period 1995 1999 if the unit meets the requirements of this subsection and the requirements of the preceding sentence except that for the purposes of applying this subsection to any such unit the prior year concerned as specified below shall be any year after January 1 1995 but prior to January 1 2000 2 In the case of an affected unit under this section described in subparagraph A theallowances allocated under this subsection for early reductions in any prior year may not exceed the amount which A the product of the unit s baseline multiplied by the unit s 1985 actual sulfur dioxide emission rate in lbs per mmBtu divided by 2 000 exceeds B the allowances specified for such unit in Table A In the case of an affected unit under section 414 described in subparagraph A the allowances awarded under this subsection for early reductions in any prior year may not exceed the amount by which i the product of the quantity of fossil fuel consumed by the unit in mmBtu in the prior year multiplied by the lesser of 2 50 or the most stringent emission rate in lbs per mmBtu applicable to the unit under the applicable implementation plan divided by 2 000 exceeds ii the unit s actual tonnage of sulfur dioxide emission for the prior year concerned Allowances allocated under this subsection for units referred to in subparagraph A may be allocated only for emission reductions achieved as a result of physical changes or changes in the method of operation made after November 15 1990 including changes in the type or quality of fossil fuel consumed 3 In no event shall the provisions of this paragraph be interpreted as an event of force majeureor a commercial impractibility or in any other way as a basis for excused nonperformance by a utility system under a coal sales contract in effect before November 15 1990

conservation measure The term qualified energy conservationmeasure means a cost effective measure as identified by the Administrator in consultation with the Secretary of Energy that increases the efficiency of the use of electricity provided by an electric utility to its customers B Qualified renewable energy The term qualified renewable energy means energyderived from biomass solar geothermal or wind as identified by the Administrator in consultation with the Secretary of Energy C Electric utility The term electric utility means any person State agency orFederal agency which sells electric energy 2 Allowances for emissions avoided through energy conservation and renewable energy A In general The regulations under paragraph 4 of this subsection shall providethat for each ton of sulfur dioxide emissions avoided by an electric utility during the applicable period through the use of qualified energy conservation measures or qualified renewable energy the Administrator shall allocate a single allowance to such electric utility on a first come first served basis from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve established under subsection g up to a total of 300 000 allowances for allocation from such Reserve B Requirements for issuance The Administrator shall allocate allowances to anelectric utility under this subsection only if all of the following requirements are met i Such electric utility is paying for the qualified energy conservation measuresor qualified renewable energy directly or through purchase from another person ii The emissions of sulfur dioxide avoided through the use of qualified energyconservation measures or qualified renewable energy are quantified in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Administrator under this II The qualified energy conservation measures or qualified renewableenergy or both are consistent with that plan III Electric utilities subject to the jurisdiction of a State regulatoryauthority must have such plan approved by such authority For electric utilities not subject to the jurisdiction of a State regulatory authority such plan shall be approved by the entity with rate making authority for such utility iv In the case of qualified energy conservation measures undertaken by aState regulated electric utility the Secretary of Energy certifies that the State regulatory authority with jurisdiction over the electric rates of such electric utility has established rates and charges which ensure that the net income of such electric utility after implementation of specific cost effective energy conservation measures is at least as high as such net income would have been if the energy conservation measures had not been implemented Upon the date of any such certification by the Secretary of Energy all allowances which but for this paragraph would have been allocated under subparagraph A before such date shall be allocated to the electric utility This clause is not a requirement for qualified renewable energy v Such utility or any subsidiary of the utility s holding company owns oroperates at least one affected unit C Period of applicability Allowances under this subsection shall be allocated onlywith respect to kilowatt hours of electric energy saved by qualified energy conservation measures or generated by qualified renewable energy after January 1 1992 and before the earlier of i December 31 2000 or ii the date on which any electric utility steam generating unit owned or operated by the electric utility to which the allowances are allocated becomes subject to this subpart including those sources that elect to become affected by this title pursuant to section 417 D Determination of avoided emissions i Application In order to receive allowances under this subsection anelectric utility shall make an application which I designates the qualified energy conservation measures implementedand the qualified renewable energy sources used for purposes of avoiding emissions II calculates in accordance with subparagraphs F and G thenumber of tons of emissions avoided by reason of the implementation of such measures or the use of such renewable energy sources and III demonstrates that the requirements of subparagraph B have beenmet Such application for allowances by a State regulated electric utility shall require approval by the State regulatory authority with jurisdiction over such electric utility The authority shall review the application for accuracy and compliance with this subsection and the rules under this subsection Electric utilities whose retail rates are not subject to the jurisdiction of a State regulatory authority shall apply directly to the Administrator for such approval E Avoided emissions from qualified energy conservation measures For the purposesof this subsection the emission tonnage deemed avoided by reason of the implementation of qualified energy conservation measures for any calendar year shall be a tonnage equal to the product of multiplying i the kilowatt hours that would otherwise have been supplied by the utilityduring such year in the absence of such qualified energy conservation measures by ii 0 004 and dividing by 2 000 F Avoided emissions from the use of qualified renewable energy The emissionstonnage deemed avoided by reason of the use of qualified renewable energy by an electric utility for any calendar year shall be a tonnage equal to the product of multiplying i the actual kilowatt hours generated by or purchased from qualified renewable energy by ii 0 004 and dividing by 2 000 G Prohibitions i No allowances shall be allocated under this subsection for theimplementation of programs that are exclusively informational or educational in nature ii No allowances shall be allocated for energy conservation measures orrenewable energy that were operational before January 1 1992 3 Savings provision Nothing in this subsection precludes a State or State regulatoryauthority from providing additional incentives to utilities to encourage investment in demand side resources 4 Regulations The Administrator shall implement this subsection under 40 CFR part 73 2001 amended as appropriate by the Administrator Such regulations shall list energy conservation measures and renewable energy sources which may be treated as qualified energy conservation measures and qualified renewable energy for purposes of this subsection Allowances shall only be allocated if all requirements of this subsection and the rules promulgated to implement this subsection are complied with The Administrator shall review the determinations of each State regulatory authority under this subsection to encourage consistency from electric utility to electric utility and from State to State in accordance with the Administrator s rules The Administrator shall publish the findings of this review no less than annually g Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve The Administrator shall establish a Conservationand Renewable Energy Reserve under this subsection Beginning on January 1 1995 the Administrator may allocate from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve an amount equal to a total of 300 000 allowances for emissions of sulfur dioxide pursuant to section 411 In order to provide 300 000 allowances for such reserve in each year beginning in calendar year 2000 and until calendar year 2009 inclusive the Administrator shall reduce each unit s basic Phase II allowance allocation on the basis of its pro rata share of 30 000 allowances Notwithstanding the prior sentence if allowances remain in the reserve one year after the date of enactment of the Clear Skies Act of 2002 the Administrator shall allocate such allowances for affected units under section 414 on a pro rata basis For purposes of this subsection for any unit subject to the emissions limitation requirements of section 414 the term pro rata basis refers to the ratio which the reductions made in such unit s allowances in order to establish the reserve under this subsection bears to the total of such reductions for all such units h Alternative Allowance Allocation for Units in Certain Utility Systems With Optional Baseline 1 Optional baseline for units in certain systems In the case of a unit subject to the emissionslimitation requirements of this section which as of November 15 1990 A has an emission rate below 1 0 lbs mmBtu B has decreased its sulfur dioxide emissions rate by 60 percent or greater since 1980 and C is part of a utility system which has a weighted average sulfur dioxide emissions ratefor all fossil fueled fired units below 1 0 lbs mmBtu at the election of the owner or operator of such unit the unit s baseline may be calculated i as provided under section 411 or ii by utilizing the unit s average annual fuel consumption at a 60 percentcapacity factor Such election shall be made no later than March 1 1991 2 Allowance allocation Whenever a unit referred to in paragraph 1 elects to calculate itsbaseline as provided in clause ii of paragraph 1 the Administrator shall allocate allowances for the unit pursuant to section 412 a this section and section 414 as basic Phase II allowance allocations in an amount equal to the baseline selected multiplied by the lower of the average annual emission rate for such unit in 1989 or 1 0 lbs mmBtu Such allowance allocation shall be in lieu of any allocation of allowances under this section and section 414 SEC 414 PHASE II SULFUR DIOXIDE REQUIREMENTS a Applicability 1 After January 1 2000 each existing utility unit as provided below is subject tothe limitations or requirements of this section Each utility unit subject to an annual sulfur dioxide tonnage emission limitation under this section is an affected unit under this subpart Each source that includes one or more affected units is an affected source In the case of an existing unit that was not in operation during calendar year 1985 the emission rate for a calendar year after 1985 as determined by the Administrator shall be used in lieu of the 1985 rate The owner or operator of any unit operated in violation of this section shall be fully liable under this Act for fulfilling the obligations specified in section 406 2 In addition to basic Phase II allowance allocations in each year beginning in calendar year2000 and ending in calendar year 2009 inclusive the

may be reduced at least as cost effectively asemissions from each other principal category of sources of sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides including industrial boilers onroad mobile sources and off road mobile sources and any other category of sources that the Administrator may identify and ii reductions in such emissions will improve air quality in thepetitioning State s nonattainment area s at least as costeffectively as reductions in emissions from each other principal category of sources of sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides to the maximum extent that a methodology is reasonably available to make such a determination In making this determination the Administrator will use the best available peer reviewed models and methodology that consider the proximity of the source or sources to the petitioning State or political subdivision and incorporate other source characteristics C The Administrator shall develop an appropriate peer reviewedmethodology for making determinations under
