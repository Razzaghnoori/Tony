                                 The End of Crime and the Last Squeegee Man                        Dear Ester            You of course raise the issue that has split criminal justice andcriminology right down the middle in your last notewhy has crime gone downAnd you are right on the mark regarding the role that ideology has played inthis debate Moreover New York City media center etc has become the focusof this debate The arguments against Giuliani and Bratton and Safirsimplified are along the lines you suggest changing drug patterns changingeconomic conditions and changing druguse patterns Even many who concede thatpolice practices were central argue that the crime reductions came at anunacceptable cost in terms of police brutality            My own position is considerably different than claims on either side Againtrying to put forth a complex argument in a short note is difficult howeverlet me try As you know long before the New York and crime reductionstories I was an advocate of community policing By that I did not mean thatpolice should be nicer or that they should do in effect communityrelations I argued that to deal with crime police had to be involved withcitizens organizations institutions etc and that communities had toreclaim public spaces and control and nurture youth To use New York City as anexample that is exactly what happened Think of the activities of citizengroups business improvement districts the transportation authority inremoving graffiti and reclaiming the subway the restoration of Central andBryant Parks the creation of the Midtown Community Court etc etc In otherwords New York City had been reclaiming itself for at least  years And youwere right Dinkins and Lee Brown his police commissioner did substantiallyincrease the number of police Moreover by the end of the secondDinkinsGiuliani mayoral race both candidates were running against squeegeemen Also although Giuliani and Bratton got credit for eliminatingsqueegeeing it was Ray Kelly Dinkins last police commissioner who broughtme in to lead the problemsolving exercise that figured out how to do it            The police however provided the tipping point that accelerated a processthat you properly note Crime had been slowly dropping for some period of timeThe steepness of the drop after Giuliani and Bratton was largely unprecedentedin American history A large part of the dramatic nature of the drops has todo with police practices in New York City As I am certain that you are awaresince the s NYC police have been so preoccupied with preventing corruptionthat staying out of trouble by doing nothing became a unique NYC art forpolice This Bratton and Giuliani changed            The fact that this is a national trend and that the stories are different inmost cities I find both not surprising and comforting Each city has begun tofind ways to reclaim public spaces and control and nurture its youth on its owntermsBoston San Diego Fort Worth etc There is no one story because ofthe uniqueness of each city            But in closing for now I went to a fascinating discussion put on lastnight by the Manhattan Institute in NYC It was a discussion by FrancisFukuyama of George Mason University and Alan Wolfe of Boston College aboutFukuyamas new book The Great Disruption  The most interesting part ofthe discussion focused on why the disruption For Fukuyama it was largelythe womens movement and the pill for Wolfe it was the addition of moralfreedom to economic and political freedom and for Norman Podhoretz whooffered some comments it was the power of a set of ideas that changed thingsovernight            And finally yes it would have been fun to have met before thisconversation But I must be off to my guest teaching I will write againlater Have a good breakfast            George Kelling
