Victimized or Vicious Margaret Carlson writes concerning Linda Tripp I have to stick by my observation that people for better or for worse grow into their appearance coming to look on the outside as they feel on the inside Imagine if Rush Limbaugh said something like that regarding say Hillary Jim Howard Tripp Trapped It seems that most people view Linda Tripp Linda Tripp Victimized or Vicious as some kind of wicked stepmother and that is unfortunate Tripp is justified in worrying that her job and reputation were being threatened after Clinton s lawyer identified her as someone who is not to be believed It would be very easy for me to say piously that I would have sacrificed my job rather than make the recordings but I am a single 24 year old without children and I can afford to take a more principled stance Tripp has not only herself to think about when it comes to protecting her job and reputation but also the well being of her children and her ability to support them What would people think of a mother who sacrificed her own children in order to protect the president and Monica Damian M Schloming Taping for Trouble Please ask Jonah Goldberg Linda Tripp Victimized or Vicious to explain why he thinks if all Tripp wanted to do was to protect her good name she continued to tape Lewinsky long after she would have had enough evidence for this purpose As Carlson says A seeker of the truth as Tripp refers to herself might at best need to tape one conversation and hold it in reserve for that dark moment when her veracity was challenged Instead she taped 20 hours worth and offered them up gratuitously to get the ball which wasn t moving much rolling Why Jonah Angus Maitland Yates Yikes As one of the constituents of Sidney Yates the topic of Jacob Weisberg s July 2 Strange Bedfellow I can tell you that he has been a distant and ineffective congressman for decades I say this despite the fact that I agree with Yates on most political issues Not surprisingly Weisberg admits his personal relationships with Yates and his staff Yates has done little for the economic development of our district While I admire his championship of the arts and the environment these do little concrete for the vast majority of constituents Yates is the only congressman in the Illinois delegation who refuses to set up an e mail link for constituents How does this sit with a Microsoft enterprise Yates refused to step aside when he became obviously physically infirm He misses more votes than all but a handful of congressmen Yates maintains little contact with his district and made only token campaign appearances He refused to debate his campaign opponents Emperor Sid treated those Democrats who dared to oppose him as traitors and thought of himself as congressman by divine right Our district will now be vastly better off by his replacement by a person 45 years his junior Yates has personally enriched himself at the expense of his constituents and his retirement is welcome to many Ironically one of the biggest news splashes made by Yates in the last decade was when one of his staffers invoked Sid s clout and attempted to set up dog walking runs in Rock Creek Park When this hit the newspapers out of touch Sid denied any knowledge of the aide s activities What an embarrassment Thomas A Marshall Phenomenology of Spirits As a member of that clandestine group of German wine lovers that Fareed Zakaria describes in his June 30 Wine s World I feel obliged to clarify the place in the pantheon of winedom of one of the figures mentioned in Zakaria s hymn I speak of course of Hegel Whatever the merits of the rather severe idiom in which Hegel chose to couch his ideas he was nonetheless a member in good standing in the wine lovers circle He grew up in a wine drinking area W rttemberg and he did a stint as a house tutor at Frankfurt s most distinguished wine merchant In fact in an effort to lure him into taking the job his friend H lderlin even promised him you will drink very good Rhine wine or French wine at the table When he was writing his Phenomenology of Spirit despite his very meager income at the time he was ordering shipments of M doc and Pontak Haut Brion See where his priorities lay When he became famous in Berlin his tastes shifted slightly to Mosels loved them Rhine wines and Cahors lots of it He especially loved the 1811 vintage of comet wines and he and Schleiermacher even stopped quarreling for a while after Schleiermacher gave Hegel the address of a good Bordeaux merchant Worldly in his heart he was also not averse to the Italians drinking and praising Lacrima Christi red as he was writing a Latin oration on the Augsburg Confession When he was visiting Saxon Dresden at the height of the Prussian reaction in the 1820s he surprised his students sitting at the table with him by ordering the most expensive champagne in Europe Ch teau Sillery With none of the students quite understanding just what called for such a lavish outlay on the old fellow s part he astonished them even more by raising his glass and toasting July 14 and the storming of the Bastille So on July 14 instead of champagne a crisp Riesling might be the way for us German wine lovers to toast that venerated French holiday We can celebrate Hegel and the revolution at the same time And indulge our secret taste Terry Pinkard Professor of philosophyGeorgetown UniversityWashington Bedrock Blues As much as I enjoy Scott Shuger s daily analysis of Today s Papers from time to time he gets the facts just plain wrong Usually it s in the last paragraph and it s usually some flippant remark that would be witty if it were only true In the July 2 Today s Papers Shuger wrote Clinton told families there that home ownership is an investment in society the bedrock of middle class life Wonder if the Times had trouble resisting the observation that it s an investment Clinton s never made a bedrock he s never stood on I quote from Page 151 of Meredith Oakley s biography On the Make The Rise of Bill Clinton Hillary three months shy of her twenty eighth birthday returned to Fayetteville inclined to accept the twenty nine year old Clinton s marriage proposal Any remaining reluctance was dashed when he greeted her return with the news that he had purchased a small brick and stonework house she had admired This oft reported account of Clinton s marriage proposal is well known Too bad Shuger felt the need to be witty but wrong Guess he was just following Clinton s Fifth Law of Politics Page 146 Under enough pressure most people but not everybody will stretch the truth on you Kari Chisholm Portland Ore The Delicate Art of Profanity I was just reading this fascinating and well written article Flame Posies July 3 about the New York Times and the Washington Post and admiring the balls of a publication that ran the headline Who gives a f about the yen last week and had already used the phrase holy shit upward of five times in the opening paragraphs when I happened upon this sentence Later that year the paper spread its legs for the theory that TWA Flight 800 was downed by foul play based on the discovery of PETN residues in the wreckage I am personally a big fan of the well chosen off color remark Screw you kiss my ass fuck me these are all phrases that have levels of meaning that have nothing to do with the physical acts they describe See Donnie Brasco and fuggedaboudit I have recently deliberately begun to use variations of kick ass and bites X in the ass because they are colorful evocative phrases because thanks to South Park ass references are newly familiar and hilarious and because they don t evoke particularly vivid mental images of asses any longer Or at least less than they used to What I am very gently trying to get at is I don t think the phrase spread its legs has quite entered the off color oversoul I think like up the ass it is just a smidgen too vivid for the average reader Then again we have seen the rise of suck in its many forms so perhaps I ll be proved wrong So when you write spreads its legs that s exactly what I think of and for me there is something inherently unpleasant in having my gender s chief sexual activity thrown up on the electronic page as an analogy for submissiveness Human reproduction pretty much hinges on leg spreading and hence one would think this act would be synonymous with well something better than the Times being sluttishly seduced into an ill supported TWA theory Bottom line You don t have so much as a Saturday Night Live sketch to point to as an example of how the phrase spread its legs has become so prevalent as to have mostly lost its primary meaning I think sex deserves better than to be compared to bad reporting and I m not especially keen on seeing my gender s role during sex interpreted as one of whorish submission Kate Powers School Principles David Brooks chides Bill McKibben in the July 1 Breakfast Table for having one child arguing that it is symbolic politics taken to an extreme If only one couple does it it will have little effect on the situation Maybe if everybody followed McKibben s lead it would make a difference In the next paragraph he says it s OK for Bill and Hillary Clinton to send their kid to a private school while opposing school choice because you should be able to rise above principle to send your kids to private school Am I the only one who notices the faulty logic The problem is that the Clintons aren t an isolated example Many of the opponents of school choice send their kids to private school even while professing steadfast belief in public schools This is like McKibben having 10 children making his wife significant other take fertility drugs and then telling everyone we are running out of resources and everyone else should have one child If there were only one white affluent couple sending its child to private schools while decrying school choice for others that would be one thing For an entire political class to engage in this behavior is a national disaster Perhaps that is why as Brooks says public schools are crappy in three fourths of the country Bill Jones Pasadena Calif The AFI Cannon I followed Charles Paul Freund s argument in the July 1 High Concept about the AFI 100 greatest films list and the decline of cultural gatekeeping right up to the point when he began discussing the actual movies on the list But his offhand comment that Bonnie and Clyde presents criminality in soft focus is so off the beam it taints his entire analysis Exactly what is soft focus about the bank teller who gets shot full in the face or Gene Hackman s agonizing death throes or Bonnie and Clyde s final staccato dance of death Freund s take on the Godfather pictures as a daydream of limitless wealth and power is even loonier Has he even seen The Godfather Part II which charts the complete moral decay of Pacino s Michael in minute psychological detail Freund is right that in many ways the Godfather pictures especially Part II are the opposite of the traditional gangster movie but he s precisely wrong in his reasons why In fact it s the older gangster pictures that romanticize the charismatic crooks portrayed by Bogart Cagney Robinson et al There s nothing romantic about the criminal violence depicted in the Godfather movies or the way the blood seems to drain out of Pacino s character over the course of the epic Given the volumes that have been written about these movies Freund s blatant misreadings are stupefying Maybe a little more cultural gatekeeping on the part of Slate editors is in order Steve Warrick Pleasant Hill Calif The Dirt on White Boards Regarding the June 29 Millionerds column on white boards Michael Lewis writes But I have now seen many hundreds of these boards bearing the remnants of some recent group meeting and I cannot recall ever seeing anything on them remotely resembling a thought Have you now Have you ever been part of a team developing a OO plan for a software project Have you ever diagramed a relational database for a critique from your colleagues Most of the white boards you ve seen were spied while you were escorted about by PR flacks or techs and suits on a PR mission They were all sort of nervous because you re a celebrity writer They gave you free meals Am I right so far You ve never seen a white board used in real technical development have you You don t really know what you re talking about do you The fact that what you ve just written and much of what you ve written before is untrue doesn t bother you because it s all in fun right And not really important true Just to amuse you see You re a stylist Mitchell Coffey So What Regarding Michael Lewis comments in Millionerds about programmers use of so It s a California programmer thing not a programmer thing I work in Champaign Urbana Ill about 150 miles south of Chicago 120 miles west of Indianapolis home of the University of Illinois and no professional programmer I know has this verbal mannerism My personal opinion would be that people give so many technical presentations in formal and informal settings where every other sentence or clause starts with so so then the frob bit is set so this path is followed so no data hits the wire that they just get in the habit of prefacing everything with so Alan M Carroll Cisco Systems Working Words Although Jason Turner s remark discussed in the June 29 Chatterbox may have been unintentional in its reference to the welcome sign over Auschwitz s main gate his attitude remains the same forced labor without hope for education decent child care or a better future I m not Jewish or German but I immediately recognized the infamous quote I believe a Haitian proverb properly sums up the entire work welfare debate If work were good for you the rich would leave none for the poor Amen Max E Hughey Jr San Diego Address your e mail to the editors to letters slate com Please include
