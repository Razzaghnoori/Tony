conformed to a degrading racist stereotype of a person of African American heritage Lord Justice Peter Gibson ruled that these words could never convey that defamatory meaning I could have wished Miss Norman had told the hoary old joke contained in the subject of this libel action as it would have shown that in addition to possessing the remarkable vocal and dramatic talents which have made her world famous as a distinguished opera singer she had an engaging sense of humour Unhappily she has taken offence at the false attribution to her of the six words Season s Greetings Extra It s not too

deliberately spills a cup of water just out of reach of a very thirsty Brasco on the floor of his cell I don t begin to understand the ideological assumptions behind this one but if I had any
