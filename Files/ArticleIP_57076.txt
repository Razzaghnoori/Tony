 The Trade War Thousands of demonstrators mobbed Seattle this week to protest the Third Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization They argued that the WTO a 135 nation club in which membership is voluntary but free trade rules are mandatory threatens to dissolve human rights labor laws and health and environmental protections in the acid of global capitalism Tuesday and Wednesday President Clinton and WTO Director General Michael Moore fired back The WTO s advocates belatedly realizing that it has become a political target are beginning to counter the principal spins against the organization 1 Whether to trade vs how to trade The protesters want us to ask first what political terms of trade are being offered and then to decide based on how good or bad those terms are whether or not to trade By this logic because the WTO doesn t include labor and environmental regulations in its trade rules thereby undermining such regulations in many countries according to the protesters the WTO should be suspended Until the WTO addresses these important issues there will be no support for a major new round of trade negotiations declared AFL CIO President John Sweeney several days before the Seattle meeting Hey hey ho ho the WTO has got to go protesters chanted in the streets In a New York Times ad a coalition of environmentalists said public interest groups want the WTO to stop in its tracks Many feel the WTO can never be democratically reformed Clinton wants to reverse these two questions He wants us to ask first whether trading is generally good or bad and then only after we ve agreed that it s good to begin discussing on what political terms we should trade We are going to have to listen to people who have legitimate economic concerns legitimate environmental concerns legitimate labor concerns Clinton conceded in a speech in Seattle Wednesday But first said Clinton Everybody has to decide Do you think we are better off or worse off with an increasingly integrated global economy where productive Americans have a chance to sell their goods and services and skills around the world I think we re better off That s the number one core decision we ought to make up our mind as a country we agree about 2 What is capitalism destroying The protesters contrast global capitalism with enlightened national laws According to the environmentalists ad the WTO by promoting and mandating unfettered trade is destroying standards for safety health and the environment in nations that try to protect the safety of their food their jobs small businesses or Nature The AFL CIO says the WTO should be reined in to preserve workers rights and to protect the ability of governments at all levels to use their purchasing power to reinforce their values and standards The WTO and its defenders argue that the regimes and laws mowed down by global capitalism are more often corrupt than enlightened in short that capitalism is an improvement Clinton says the WTO fosters respect for the rule of law which weeds out corruption and discourages war Francis Fukuyama writing in the Wall Street Journal says poor people around the world are dominated by local companies interlocked with local political elites in a web of cronyism and corruption Globalization in the form of foreign direct investment by multinational corporations not only creates employment but directly threatens these local elites by exposing them to competition Addressing the WTO conference Tuesday Moore argued that global capitalism has replaced not Marxist utopia but warped Marxist totalitarianism and aggression Free trade tore down the walls of economic and political oppression said Moore Our parents learnt from the great depression made deeper and more lethal by rising trade barriers from which came the twin tyrannies of our age fascism and Marxism thus war hot and cold They swore it would not happen again and they created an international architecture which included the UN IMF World Bank and the GATT now the WTO to achieve that peaceful purpose 3 Does the WTO permit problems or solutions The protesters say the WTO is bad because it permits oppressive and environmentally destructive practices and by liberating greed promotes these practices By focusing on the free flow of capital WTO leaders are not supporting human rights and workers rights said a union official in Seattle Clinton sees it the other way around The WTO is good because it permits discussion of these practices It is not wrong for the United States to say we don t believe in child labor or forced labor or the oppression of our brothers and sisters who work for a living around the world and that we don t believe that growing the economy requires us to undermine the environment said Clinton But to make those arguments and resolve those issues with other nations effectively said Clinton You have to have some system to resolve them 4 Opening the WTO vs opening world trade Sweeney blasts trade accords negotiated behind closed doors and demands that the WTO become open and accountable The environmentalists call the WTO an invisible government that was elected by no one and operates in secrecy Moore replies that the WTO is democratic Ministers are here because their people decided so Our agreements must be agreed by Parliaments but Clinton goes further He frames the issue of openness more broadly arguing that the WTO has made trade decisions more accountable and more universally beneficial than they used to be We do have to open the WTO and the world trading system to greater public scrutiny and to greater public participation says Clinton But what we came here to the WTO meeting in Seattle to do is to open markets and expand opportunities 5 Stability vs progress The protesters focus on stability and worry that unfettered trade will demolish it Thanks to world capital flow says Sweeney financial collapses have grown more severe and more frequent But what the protesters call stability Moore calls stagnation The least developed countries are not threatened by globalization They are threatened by de globalization falling outside of the world economy and slipping ever further behind Clinton portrays the instability of big industrial shifts for example the loss of American jobs in steel and the simultaneous creation of American jobs in software as a transition to a world in which everybody can do what they do best To mitigate that instability he promises to give people time and support and investment to make the transitions into the new economy Human nature puts Clinton at a disadvantage in this debate Most people would rather keep what they have than risk it for a hypothetical payoff And while the costs of unrestricted trade tend to be visible because they re nearby and concentrated e g the closure of a local factory the benefits tend to be invisible because they re faraway or diffuse e g lower prices at the grocery store or higher wages in Latin America The people that are going to win will always be somewhat uncertain of their gain whereas the people who will lose are absolutely sure of what they are going to lose says Clinton Therefore embracing free trade will require imagination and trust and humility and flexibility 6 Bully or protector Former WTO Director General Renato Ruggiero once called the WTO a new constitution for a single global economy and protesters have seized on this somewhat presumptuous self characterization to portray the WTO as a police state designed by rich nations to facilitate the exploitation of poor ones Unlike other global bodies including the UN the WTO enjoys unique enforcement powers the environmentalists warn in their ad Offending countries must conform with WTO rules or face harsh sanctions Moore sees these governmental analogies in a different light He thinks the WTO s constitution and police powers will protect poor countries not exploit them Developing countries need a secure and stable world trading system he says They need more openness not less Stronger rules not weaker ones I m from a small country New Zealand but I don t see what we are doing here as a threat to our sovereignty I see interdependence as a guarantor of our sovereignty and safety 7 Imports vs exports Some goods are produced more cheaply in the United States than abroad Others are produced more cheaply abroad than here Unrestricted trade will help U S industries in the first category but will wipe out those in the second category That s why Clinton talks about the first category while the protesters talk about the second Two weeks ago Sweeney brought a steelworkers union official to the National Press Club to illustrate how the WTO s prohibition against trade barriers facilitates the loss of U S manufacturing jobs to dumped imports and cheap labor abroad Wednesday Clinton chose to talk about a different industry The typical American eats 20 pounds of fresh apples each year whereas the typical European consumes about 46 pounds said Clinton So America exported 353 million worth of apples last year Lowering trade barriers in China Japan and Mexico means more apple sales from Washington and more help for family farmers he observed Clinton joked that his apple reference was a pander to Washington state but it was more than that The national industries that will lose under global capitalism and the national industries that will win are to borrow a self illustrating rhetorical metaphor apples and oranges And the key to reassuring Americans about the WTO is to talk about the apples
