 The Art of Strategic Annoyance Dave Nope I never went to summer camp Or rather never to a sleepaway camp I went to day camp and hated it To me it was like an 8 hour session of PE I grumbled so loudly that my parents didn t send me back the next year Which is how I wound up sewing sneakers for Nike for a summer at the tender age of 10 Oh sure the days were long the factories were dark and the machines claimed both my pinkies but at least I never had to play dodge ball again As for the smoking story what s gone unreported in the Times is the tobacco companies proposed compromise wording for the warning label Smoking will kill you On the other hand we are all mortal Actually diseased lungs and rotting teeth could be quite attractive packaging particularly if you put a little cowboy riding in front of them In any case I d imagine that Canadians can shortly look forward to many fine gallery displays and public television programs on the sexiness of lung disease underwritten by the good people of Philip Morris The cigarette packaging thing reminds me in an indirect way of a larger issue I ve always found interesting the deliberate effort to frustrate or annoy the consumer I once talked to an architect who told me that the key to designing a successful shopping mall is to include lots of angles so that you can t see clearly from one end of it to another that way the customer walks and walks always convinced that the store he s trying to find is just around the next corner In the meantime of course he might stop in at any one of a dozen other stores Similarly the Publisher s Clearing House I remember reading makes its contests difficult to enter Go find the red stamp and put it on the entry form Now find the yellow sticker and put it on the envelope Now include a tail feather from a bald eagle Now sing for two reasons First obviously is so that the customer will spend more time combing over the materials and is therefore more likely to order one of their magazines But the second reason is that they ve found that there s a much higher response rate for every bell and whistle they add And finally there s Vegas where every aspect of a casino s design is meant to keep you inside hence the confusing layout the paucity of exit signs the lack of clocks etc In other news did you see the story in the far left column of yesterday s Wall Street Journal My editor pointed it out to me here s the headline and the lead A Dancer a Dream Still It s a Long Slog to Broadway s Lights SEVILLE Spain When the Gypsy street legend Torombo dances his feet are on fire and his head is often in the clouds For he dreams and when he dreams he dreams of this Broadway Oh dear God Tim
