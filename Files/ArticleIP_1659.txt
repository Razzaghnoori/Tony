 Weekend Warriors Pundit in Chief Bill Clinton made an hourlong appearance on Meet the Press marking the 50 th anniversary of the show that invented TV talking heads Issue 1 on his agenda was Iraq Clinton takes the view that there will be consequences if Saddam doesn t start behaving The rest of the Sunday commentariat unconstrained by the ability to actually do anything made even noisier threats The official sound bite of the weekend offered up by Clinton and by National Security Adviser Sandy Berger on CNN s Late Edition and aped by the heads was that this confrontation pits Iraq against the world not Iraq against the United States Several weekend warriors were ready to fly to Baghdad and grease the dictator themselves New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman made this position respectable in a Thursday piece that called on the United States to take Saddam out with a head shot before the United Nations starts tut tutting and rushing to his defense Friedman was not engaging in metaphor as you can see by clicking here George Stephanopoulos elicited a gasp from Cokie Roberts on ABC s This Week when he too demanded Saddam s assassination G I Bill Kristol concurred We need to go in and get Saddam even if it requires ground troops On The McLaughlin Group even Pat Buchanan who ardently opposed the Gulf War back in 1990 endorsed unilateral American military action noting only that Saddam will take hits for a long time In general the heads seemed almost giddy in anticipation of battle There was no talk of body bags Late Edition s Steve Roberts grabbed the obvious war is the health of the state angle One Democrat had told him Thank God for Saddam Hussein Anthrax cocktails on the house for both Roberts and the unnamed Democrat please There was similar unanimity last weekend on Issue 2 the fast track trade bill which teetered on the Hill as the Sunday pundits gabbed The virtues of free trade are a given among the commentariat So instead of debating the merits they analyzed the political shadows cast by the legislative battle Why are so many Democrats deserting their president and why are so many Republicans deserting their free trade principles The pundits answer which may even be correct labor union cash and hatred of Clinton respectively David Broder on PBS Washington Week in Review Cokie Roberts on This Week and Mark Shield on CNN s Capital Gang all noted the Democratic National Committee s 15 million debt Campaigngate has left Democratic donors angry and stingy Clinton s failure to rally House Democrats has reduced him to a prophet without honor in his own party said Paul Gigot on PBS s NewsHour Fast track s ultimate winner Newt Gingrich said Stephanopoulos in a somewhat stagy display of his newfound powers of objectivity Why Newt He ll get the credit if it passes and Clinton will get the blame if it loses Clinton said on Meet the Press that his weekend speech to a gay rights group was an all American blow for civil rights although he confided that he didn t think the gay alternative should be taught in school This Week guest Bill Bennett seized on this comment to insist that the president s gay rights position isn t really analogous with civil rights Dan Quayle who confessed he hadn t heard or read the Clinton speech said on Fox News Sunday that the administration was behind a left wing agenda to change people s attitudes about sexual orientation Minutes later Quayle upgraded it to a radical left wing agenda Bennett reprised Quayle s talking point twice calling the speech a signal of the new agenda for liberals Bennett may or may not be correct that gay rights is at the center of the liberal agenda But Sunday s lockstep sound bites are confirmation that the issue is now at the center of the conservative agenda And yet even conservatives are careful to express a degree of acceptance that would have been considered radical just a few years ago Quayle urged a sort of tolerance for homosexuals that stops short of approval and endorsement which sounds suspiciously like Clinton s don t ask don t tell construction Clinton credited the Republican sweep of Tuesday s election to 1 a good economy and 2 the abundance of Republican incumbents Stephanopoulos backed this party line The Republican party line was of course that the country is turning Republican On NewsHour Gigot urged Clinton to get back into the game by rehiring Dick Morris who could save the Democrats by triangulating policies in a Republican direction Reagan Democrats are now Republicans said This Week s Kristol hinting at a broad political realignment Pundit Bites Former Christian Coalition leader Ralph Reed was billed on Late Edition as a Republican strategist This is a new chyron for Reed who used to insist that he and the coalition did not serve Republicans but the name that is above all names Fox News Sunday s recent efforts to uplift the debate with expert round tables that aren t pegged to the news race in America last week and the media is it fair this week leave Pundit Central hankering for McLaughlin Group style shouting matches I will run for president someday threatened Dan Quayle on Fox News Sunday Jack Shafer
