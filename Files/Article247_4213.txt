 Does Your Dental Plan Cover Gnashed Teeth Dear David At the end of this series and of the century is the Millennium It can either be prosaic or dramatic If it is just the spasm of sex or the drunkenness of drink and then the drab morning after there is no meaning to the millennium But what if Y2K is the perfect metaphor for one outcome The wheels of the trains the whir of the airplanes the lights in all the houses go out because we have reached the limits of two zeroes 0 and 0 and then chaos The computers flop All the stock options lapse We all become cavemen and cavewomen and the Hobbesian world erupts in all its grim fury All the world is Chechnya with the leer of your Boris Yeltsin hovering overhead But Y2K is itself mundane It probably will not happen Three zeroes will emerge and the computers will go whirring on endlessly But what if beyond the Y2K come the real portents of drama The curtain rises We call it eschatology the transforming moment the end of days That has been one of the most enduring and powerful themes in Western history We see it first in the frightening pages of the Book of Revelation the last pages of the New Testament The trumpets sound The seven seals are broken The beasts come up from the seas The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse begin their grim ride the last being the pale horse and pale rider Death with a mantle dyed in blood And behind it the word of God As the fundamentalist preacher thundered In the fiery furnaces of Hell there is wailing and gnashing of teeth But I don t have any teeth cried an old man Teeth will be provided the preacher answered And then a new heaven and a new earth The new Jerusalem comes down from heaven Revelation subsided for a millennium But then in the 12 th century an obscure Cistercian monk Joachim of Fiore developed a powerful and original theology three books including the Expositio in Apocalypsim which put eschatology into history As the Marxist Ernst Bloch said Joachim was the first to set a date for the kingdom of God for the communist kingdom Joachim prophesized three ages the age of the Father the age of the Son and the age of the Holy Spirit a new age of spirituality in which the church hierarchy would be abolished and the infidels brought back into the fold the lions and the lambs so to speak lying down together in peace How do you have the lions and the lambs in the same cafe Henry Kissinger once asked Nikita Khrushchev in wonder at the Moscow zoo By changing the lamb each day la femme Nikita replied Joachim was adopted by the Spiritual Franciscans as their prophet but few Christians today are spiritual Franciscans with their begging bowls unless it is in the Nasdaq market But Joachim did have an echo in poetry since his prophecies inspired Yeats Second Coming Poetry also came into eschatology in the movies as many persons found a liking for Blake s Milton in the spirited lines Bring me my bow of burning gold Bring me my Arrows of Desire Bring me my Spear O clouds unfold Bring me my Chariot of fire And ending of course that he will not cease from Mental Fight until we have built Jerusalem in England s green and pleasant Land In the bowels of England s pleasant British Museum Karl Marx was creating a new political eschatology the leap as he said from the Kingdom of Necessity to the Kingdom of Freedom The drama is spelled out in that lumbering bible Das Kapital where in the deepening crises of capitalism and the sharpening knives of the class struggle the end of days arrives as Marx put it in the penultimate chapter of Volume I when the capitalist integument bursts asunder and the new society nurtured in the womb of the old steps forth as social labor cooperative labor communal harmony the transit workers and Giuliani in a mutual embrace All this was given concrete historical reality in October 1917 with the holy Russian Revolution In the 1920s the famous journalist Lincoln Steffens came to the Soviet Union and marveled I have seen the future and it works It was a phrase repeated over and over by esteemed visitors such as H G Wells and Sidney and Beatrice Webb until in 1989 the mantra stopped And amid the detritus one could find a scrawled phrase by a character in an earlier novel by Robert Littel Mother Russia a man improbably named Robespierre Pravdin I have seen the future and it needs work So off we go heigh ho heigh ho as in the Disney cartoon singing the words of Sidney Blumenthal the new politics the new economics the new technology nu nu all insured by comprehensive health insurance with prescription drugs spectacles and false teeth for the aged as promised by Nye Bevan in 1950 when he set up the new British comprehensive health system But hey where is the millennium Oh That That was the spasm of sex and the drunkenness of drink That was the night before And this is the morning after Love Dad
