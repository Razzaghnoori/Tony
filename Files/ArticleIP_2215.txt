 Traffic Report How many people read Slate Last August in a Webhead column by our then Program Manager Bill Barnes we attempted to answer that question while at the same time explaining why any claims about the popularity of Web sites are inherently suspicious With that same caveat we offer an update In August we were serving an average of about 90 000 pages a day seven days a week In recent weeks we have been serving about 140 000 pages a day As that Webhead column explained the design of a site can drastically affect the page count A Web page is of no fixed size and the same material can take few or many pages We think a better measure is unique browsers the number of individual computers that visit a site Each computer is counted just once no matter how many times it visits In the month of August we had about 80 000 individual readers by this measure In the month of November we had close to 140 000 This doesn t count the 22 000 who get Slate delivered by e mail every Friday morning if you wanna sign up click here or the thousands who get e mail delivery of Today s Papers five days a week click here to sign up Why the growth Naturally we d like to attribute it to our excellent editorial product and to the kindness and enthusiasm of Slate readers in spreading the word But we suspect that other forces are at work as well There s the steady increase in the number of Internet users who nonetheless account for barely 15 percent of the adult population And there s the particular boost Slate has been getting from our beloved distribution partners America Online Hotmail and the Microsoft Network To whomever we owe thanks thanks And if you re one of our new arrivals welcome New Stuff Slate continues to be an experiment in magazine journalism on the Web We try things sometimes they work sometimes they don t This week we inaugurate no fewer than three new features Reply All is an update on the old fashioned epistolary novel fiction in the form of letters such as Les Liaisons Dangereuses the 1782 novel by Choderlos de Laclos that was turned into a play and two different movies a few years ago Our version is fiction in the form of e mail among three characters one in Washington one in New York and one in the Bay Area Each character s mail is written by an author in that city In another throwback to earlier forms Reply All will be written and published in weekly installments Chapter 1 is posted now International Papers is a worldwide version of our popular Today s Papers column synthesizing and commenting on what leading newspapers outside the United States are saying about the major news stories Al Gore was a bust in Kyoto apparently and noting stories that are being ignored in the United States but loom large elsewhere Did you know for example about the beauty queen boom in India or the controversy about transsexual athletes in Australia At least for now International Papers will be updated just twice a week on Monday and Thursday evenings PST The author is Alexander Chancellor a distinguished columnist for the Guardian of London and former editor of the Spectator By its nature not to mention Alexander s nature International Papers will be less structured than Today s Papers Rather than analyzing the same five front pages every day it will flit around the world courtesy of the Internet looking for trends and patterns The language barrier will be a challenge but our author is about as well qualified as anyone to take it on Although he doesn t know much Chinese or Urdu he is fluent in French German and Italian Oh yes and a bit of English Cheat Sheet is a spinoff of the Hackathlon see below It is on tryout as a replacement for The Gist We re looking for ways to bring readers quickly and painlessly up to speed on issues in the news they haven t followed closely or have found confusing or frankly are bored by but feel guilty about it For the Hackathlon a hack writing contest for journalists Deputy Editor Jack Shafer provided a cheat sheet of information the contestants could draw upon in each of four rounds The cheat sheets were so entertaining and informative that we thought we d try this form as a regular feature The first one about the Arlington Cemetery flap is posted now As part of the ebb and flow of Slate features two have concluded their runs Don t miss this week s breathtaking conclusion to Doodlennium the cartoon saga of the chicken people by Mark Alan Stamaty And of course the entire year and a half long series is available in The Compost Liberated from Doodlennium Mark will have an expanded role in illustrating the rest of Slate Check out his drawing of Robin Williams and Matt Damon in Summary Judgment Varnish Remover Robert Shrum s analysis of a TV commercial has been suspended to allow Bob to concentrate on whatever it is he does exactly as an international political and business consultant But he ll be back we hope either with Varnish Remover or some new feature closer to next fall s elections More New Stuff We need your help with another new feature that starts next week It is an advice column called Dear Prudence Although the author stands prepared to answer questions on any topic she is better qualified to share wisdom about morals and manners what youth can learn from age and macroeconomic policy than about how to get your brand new 200 fax modem to work properly Please send your inquiries to prudence slate com Hacks Americana The first annual Slate Hackathlon is over after four not especially grueling weeks for four not really so hackish hacks And the readers have rendered their verdict The New York Times now has another honor to add to its string of Pulitzers Michael Specter a Moscow correspondent for the Times was judged to be the biggest hack by a 37 percent plurality of Slate readers Malcolm Gladwell of The New Yorker came in second with 27 percent British journalist Geoffrey Wheatcroft representing the nation that invented hack journalism and whose journalists still pride themselves on maintaining their lack of standards got a disappointing 19 percent And Hanna Rosin of the New Republic came in last with 17 percent But she s young She has plenty of years yet in which to compromise her integrity For more details and analysis of this historic sporting event go to the Hackathlon itself Slate Between Covers Looking for a good

From Mars Bill Is on Venus Corrections Slate s In Other Magazines column incorrectly said that The New Yorker said that President Clinton calls Attorney General Reno The Martian behind her back The New Yorker actually said that Clinton aides call her this Also the Washington columnist spells his name Rowland Evans not Roland as Slate s Pundit Central alleged last week Dear Prudence I am just a guy named Bill being pursued by a gal named Janet Janet was also pursuing another guy named Bill but he somehow or other put her off the scent She s stopped chasing him but she s still chasing me Neither of us appreciates her attentions What I want to know is why does she have this vendetta against guys named Bill And how did the other one manage to lose her What has he got that I don t got Is life unfair or what Sincerely Bill G Redmond Wash Michael Kinsley
