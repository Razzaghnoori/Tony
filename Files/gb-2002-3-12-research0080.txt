 Background One of the goals of the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project is to define experimentally the transcribed portions of the genome by producing a collection of fully sequenced cDNAs We have previously reported the construction of cDNA libraries from a variety of tissues and developmental stages these libraries were used to generate over 250 000 expressed sequence tags ESTs corresponding to approximately 70 of the predicted protein coding genes in the Drosophila melanogaster genome 1 2 We used computational analysis of these ESTs to establish a collection of putative full length cDNA clones the Drosophila Gene Collection DGC 1 2 Here we describe the process by which we sequenced the full inserts of 8 921 cDNA clones from the DGC describe the methods by which we assess each clone s likelihood of containing a complete and accurate protein coding region and illustrate how these data can be used to uncover additional cases of RNA editing We have confirmed the identification of 5 375 cDNA clones that can be used with confidence for protein expression or genetic complementation Results and discussion Sequencing strategy Current approaches to full insert sequencing of cDNA clones include concatenated cDNA sequencing 3 primer walking 4 and strategies using transposon insertion to create priming sites 5 6 7 8 9 We adopted a cDNA sequencing strategy that relies on an in vitro transposon insertion system based on the MuA transposase combined with primer walking see Materials and methods for details The production of full insert sequences from DGC cDNAs is summarized in Tables 1and 2 For DGCr1 clones were sized before sequencing Small clones 1 4 kilobases kb were sequenced with custom primers and larger clones were sequenced using either mapped or unmapped transposon insertions For DGCr2 clones were not sized and a set of unmapped transposon insertions was sequenced to generate an average of 5 sequence coverage For both DGCr1 and r2 custom oligonucleotide primers designed using Autofinish 10 were used to bring the sequences to high quality To date we have completed sequencing 93 of the DGCr1 clone set and 80 of the DGCr2 clone set The strategy used for sequencing DGCr1 clones appears to be more efficient because on average they required fewer sequencing reads than DGCr2 clones However we were able to reduce cycle time and increase throughput using the shotgun strategy adopted for sequencing the DGCr2 clones The average insert size of the 8 770 high quality cDNA sequences that have been submitted to GenBank is 2 kb and they total 17 5 megabases Mb of sequence The largest clone SD01389 is 8 7 kb and is derived from a gene CG10011 that encodes a 2 119 amino acid ankyrin repeat containing protein Evaluating the coding potential of each cDNA on the basis of its full insert sequence For many potential uses in proteomics and functional genomics 11 12 13 it is important to establish cDNA collections comprised only of cDNAs with complete and uncorrupted open reading frames ORFs To determine which of our sequenced clones meet this standard we compared them to the annotated Release 3 genome sequence 14 15 using a combination of BLAST 16 and Sim4 17 alignments see Materials and methods for details We grouped the cDNAs into four categories Table 3 The first category contains a total of 5 916 cDNA clones or 68 of the sequenced clones We are confident that 5 375 of these clones contain a complete and accurate ORF as they precisely match the Release 3 predicted protein for the corresponding gene An additional 541 clones are from the SD GM and AT libraries which were generated from fly strains that are not isogenic with the strain used to produce the genome sequence The predicted ORFs from clones from these libraries were required to be identical in length to the Release 3 predicted protein with less than 2 amino acid difference to be placed in this category We cannot at present distinguish whether these differences result from strain polymorphisms or reverse transcriptase RT errors However our own internal estimates of RT errors see below based on the observed nucleotide substitution rate in cDNAs derived from the same strain as the genomic sequence and published estimates of strain polymorphisms 18 lead us to believe that the majority of these changes are the result of strain polymorphism The second category represents 2 450 clones that are known to be compromised in one of a number of ways The sequences of the largest class of compromised clones 1 314 align to the Release 3 predicted transcripts but have nucleotide discrepancies that are most likely the result of errors generated by RT during library construction These include missense and frameshift 1 or 2 nucleotide difference changes in the predicted ORF relative to the Release 3 predicted protein Clones placed in this class can show up to 2 amino acid differences from the Release 3 peptide for isogenic libraries and up to 4 difference for non isogenic libraries We estimated the error rate of an RNAseH deficient RT SuperScriptII Invitrogen Carlsbad CA by comparing the nucleotide sequence of cDNAs from isogenic libraries to the genomic sequence For the GH HL LD and LP libraries 1 we observed an error rate of 1 in 4 000 for the RE and RH libraries 2 we observed an error rate of 1 in 1 000 This difference is likely due to the different RT reaction conditions used in these two library construction protocols 1 2 Although these numbers are higher than the 1 in 15 000 figure reported for SuperScriptII Taurai Nenguke personal communication the in vitro assay used to obtain this error rate is based on assaying a single site for mutations that revert an amber codon The next largest class of compromised clones 768 consists of clones apparently truncated at their 5 ends as judged by comparison to the Release 3 predicted ORFs of the corresponding genes The 768 5 short clones represent 757 distinct Release 3 annotated transcripts For 151 of the 5 short clones 143 from DGCr1 and eight from DGCr2 we were able to identify clones with longer ORFs by additional EST sequencing The remaining 606 clones are assumed to be 5 short because they do not possess a 5 in frame stop codon and the corresponding annotated ORF in Release 3 extends further 5 This class of clones represents approximately 9 of all finished clones consistent with our original estimates that 80 94 of the DGC clones would contain the full ORF 1 2 The remaining six classes of compromised clones consist of a total of 368 cDNAs 4 of all finished clones see Table 3 Eighty three clones encode ORFs that are truncated at their carboxy termini and are most likely the result of priming from internal poly A tracts Seventy seven clones contain two unrelated ORFs and are almost certainly the result of two cDNAs being cloned into the same plasmid vector during library construction Seventy clones contain ORFs of less than 50 amino acids One hundred and eleven clones overlap a Release 3 predicted gene but are transcribed from the opposite strand from that of the mRNA encoding the Release 3 predicted protein and are considered anti sense transcripts a number of such cases were documented in the reannotation of the genome 15 and have been reported in many organisms 19 Twenty one clones correspond to transcripts of transposable elements on the basis of their sequence similarity to identified Drosophila transposons 20 Finally six clones contain a bacterial transposable element Tn10 IS1 or IS2 that most likely inserted into the clone during propagation in Escherichia coli bacterial contaminants The third and fourth categories consist of clones that may represent alternative transcripts 138 and clones that are currently computationally unclassified 417 respectively The summary of the analysis of these clones is described in Table 3 Improving the DrosophilacDNA resource We have identified and sequenced cDNA clones that contain a complete and accurate ORF for 40 of all predicted Drosophila genes We plan on extending this project in two ways First we intend to increase the number of genes represented in this set of fully vetted cDNA clones using a combination of experimental approaches We can use site directed mutagenesis to correct clones that carry single nucleotide changes or other small localized defects For the majority of the compromised clones we have candidate replacement clones available that were identified as part of our EST sequencing and analysis efforts 2 Generation of the Release 3 annotation of the genome made extensive use of our full insert sequence data 15 In the course of that effort human curators identified a total of 2 013 clones that have become the DGCr3 The DGCr3 currently includes 309 clones chosen to replace clones with truncated ORFs 543 clones for genes that are not currently represented in the DGC and 833 clones that represent alternative splicing forms To identify cDNAs for the remaining genes we plan on using a combination of additional EST sequencing reverse transcriptase PCR RT PCR and cDNA library screening Second we plan on transferring ORFs to a universal cloning system see 21 22 for examples in order to generate a standard reagent for proteomics and other functional genomic experiments In collaboration with Orbigen 23 we have already generated 72 baculovirus expression clones from a set of Gateway Invitrogen Carlsbad CA clones encoding transcription factors mRNA editing RNA editing is a well documented mechanism of generating nucleotide diversity beyond that directly encoded by the genome Adenosine deaminase ADAR targets double stranded regions of nuclear encoded RNAs catalyzing the deamination of adenosine A to inosine I 24 Inosine mimics guanosine G in its base pairing properties and the translational machinery of the cell interprets I as G In this way an A to I conversion in the mRNA can alter the genetic information and consequently protein function Null mutations in the single ADAR gene in Drosophila dADAR suggest that the function of pre mRNA editing is to modify adult behavior by altering signaling components in the nervous system 25 26 Among the mRNAs known to be edited in Drosophila are those encoded by cacophony a calcium channel gene 27 paralytic a sodium channel gene 28 and GluCla a chloride channel gene 29 all of which have multiple editing sites in their coding sequences In the course of evaluating the quality of the DGCr1 and DGCr2 cDNAs described above we compared their translation products to those of the recently completed Release 3 genomic sequence Such comparisons should reveal cases of RNA editing In cases in which the predicted protein sequences disagreed we examined the corresponding nucleotide sequences in search of site specific A to G variation between cDNA and genomic sequences We identified over 30 candidates consistent with RNA editing however additional cDNA or EST data will be required to distinguish RNA editing from RT errors or strain polymorphisms In a few cases we had enough cDNA and EST data to indicate that RNA editing is the most likely explanation for the observed variation One such example is shown in Figure 1 The gene CG18314 encodes a G protein coupled receptor of the rhodopsin family containing a seven transmembrane protein domain with similarity to 2 adrenergic receptors of mouse and human 30 31 Ten potential sites of RNA editing were revealed by comparison of the genomic sequence with those of two cDNAs and three ESTs We validated these 10 sites by gene specific RT PCR using RNA isolated from heads of isogenic animals and identified 15 new sites see legend to Figure 1 We are now in the process of a more rigorous and thorough analysis of potential RNA editing targets Materials and methods Sequencing strategy The Drosophila Gene Collection DGC consists of two releases DGCr1 and DGCr2 A process flow diagram of our sequencing strategies is available online 32 and is summarized below The clones in DGCr1 were arrayed by insert size 1 and sequenced accordingly clones in DGCr2 were not arrayed by size DGCr1 clones less than 1 4 kb were assembled using phrap 33 and analyzed with custom scripts to determine whether they were complete Autofinish part of the consed computer software package was used to automatically design custom primers 10 for clones that needed quality improvement Clones that did not finish in the first two rounds of Autofinish were sent to a manual finishing queue for more sophisticated finishing cDNA clones larger than 1 4 kb were divided into three groups 1 4 to 3 kb 3 to 4 5 kb and greater than 4 5 kb All clones were sequenced using the in vitro Template Generation System TGS tmFinnzyme Clones 3 to 4 5 kb in size were sequenced using a minimal path of transposon bearing clones Clones 1 4 to 3 kb and those greater than 4 5 kb were sequenced with 24 and 48 unmapped transposon bearing clones respectively After the initial cycle of transposon sequencing the clones were analyzed using in house scripts and Autofinish to determine their state of completeness and quality DGCr2 clones were sequenced using 24 unmapped transposon bearing clones After an initial cycle of transposon sequencing the clones were analyzed for completeness and quality as described above for DGCr1 clones using in house scripts and Autofinish DGCr2 clone sequences were screened for transposable element sequences cases of co ligation and presence of a poly A tail before any finishing work was ordered In vitrotransposition and mapping insertion sites Transposon insertion reactions were carried out in 96 well format using the Template Generation System TGS tm according to the manufacturer s recommendations Finnzyme Transposon reactions consisted of 1 l 50 150 ng plasmid DNA isolated from Qiagen or Revprep DNA isolation robots 1 6 l 5 reaction buffer 8 ng Entranceposon Kan R 0 4 l MuA transposase and deionized water to bring the final volume to 8 l Reactions were carried out in PCR plates and incubated in an ABI thermocycler according to the manufacturer s instructions After heat inactivation of the MuA transposase 2 l of the reaction were used to transform 17 l of DH5 chemically competent cells Invitrogen in 96 well format Following incubation at 37 C for 1 h in 183 l SOC medium cells were plated onto appropriate medium selecting for vector and Entranceposon antibiotic resistance Plates were incubated at 37 C overnight Colonies were picked into 1 2 ml polypropylene titer tubes E K Scientific containing 0 5 ml LB medium supplemented with 7 5 glycerol and the appropriate antibiotics and incubated at 37 C overnight These stocks were then used to inoculate 1 2 ml 2XYT medium in 96 well square deep well plates E K Scientific for culture and DNA plasmid preps Transposon insertion sites were mapped relative to the vector ends by PCR essentially as described 34 Forty eight transposon bearing clones were picked for PCR mapping using the Mu End primer present at both ends of the tranposon in combination with vector specific primers resulting in 96 PCR products Agarose gels were imaged using custom software developed in house Earl Cornell LBNL and analyzed using an algorithm Supertramp 35 36 to identify a minimal path of transposon bearing clones to be re arrayed and sequenced DNA sequencing Purified plasmid DNA from transposon bearing clones was sequenced using 2 l ABI BigDye II Dye terminator mix Applied Biosystems in a 10 l reaction Sequencing reactions were processed through 96 well Sephadex G 50 SF plates Multiscreen filter plates Millipore and loaded onto ABI Prism 3700 DNA Analyzer Sequencing primers specific for each end of the Entranceposon were used in the reactions 5 ATCAGCGGCCGCGATCC 3 and 5 TTATTCGGTCGAAAAGGATCC 3 Sequencing of 5 and 3 cDNA ends was carried out as previously described 2 The sequencing reported here was carried out over a 2 year period during which we made several major modifications to the strategy for example switching from sequencing mapped transposon insertions to random transposons These changes improved throughput and cycle time but made the process less efficient in terms of the required number of sequencing reads Because of these changes it is not possible to give a meaningful single efficiency estimate however our overall efficiency is comparable to other efforts using a similar strategy 8 9 Data processing and assembly cDNA clone data management relied on custom scripts and an Informix database Sequences were processed using phred 37 38 and assembled using phrap 33 5 and 3 EST end reads were combined with the transposon based reads to generate cDNA clone assemblies We adopted the sequence quality control standards defined for the Mammalian Gene Collection project 39 Custom scripts evaluated assemblies for 5 and 3 EST reads in a single contig in the proper orientation at least 10 bases of 3 poly A tail phrap estimated error rate of less than one in 50 000 bases and individual base quality of at least q25 Double stranded coverage was not a criterion for a clone to be considered finished however we have determined that 96 2 of all submitted bases are double stranded and 48 of clones had complete double stranded coverage Autofinish 10 was used to design primers to improve quality or extend sequence from multiple sequence contigs cDNA clones with an estimated error rate greater than one in 50 000 bp were automatically identified and processed with additional rounds of Autofinish designed finishing work If Autofinish could not design primers custom primers were designed manually using consed Custom scripts were used to manually order primers to generate a further round of sequencing The sequence data described in this paper have been submitted to the GenBank data library under accession numbers AF132140 AF132196 AF160900 AF132551

ORF and a gene assignment based on a high BLASTN similarity score to the Release 2 genome annotations Subsequent processing was used to determine a more detailed analysis of the clone quality Using BLASTN sequence from each cDNA clone was compared to genomic sequence predicted genes predicted coding sequences CDSs known Drosophila transposable elements and Escherichia coli transposable elements Using BLASTP the translation of the longest ORF was compared to the predicted Release 3 translations 15 Custom scripts were used to parse the BLAST output and record similarity results We also compared the nucleotide sequence of each clone to the Release 3 genome sequence 14 using Sim4 and to the Release 3 predicted CDS with the highest BLAST score mRNA editing We confirmed the sequence quality of the genomic region encompassing CG018314 12 731 bp by independently assembling an 18 284 bp contig consisting solely of whole genome shotgun WGS traces The assembled sequence contig has an average of 8 6 sequence coverage The phrap estimated error rate for each genomic base corresponding to a mRNA edited base is q90 Similarly we determined the phrap estimated error rate for each mRNA edited base to be q90 We manually inspected chromatograms for high quality discrepancies in the genomic sequence and found none indicating that the edited bases are not due to population heterozygosity To validate the editing sites total RNA was isolated from heads from a mixed population of male and female adult flies from the isogenic strain y 1 cn 1 bw 1 sp 1using the Concert Cytoplasmic RNA isolation reagent according to the manufacturer s guidelines Invitrogen Nine independent gene specific RT PCR reactions were performed using the Superscript one step RT PCR kit according to the manufacturer Invitrogen and PCR products were cloned into the PCR2 1 vector Twenty four independent subclones from each of four independent RT PCR products were sequenced and twelve independent subclones from an additional five independent RT PCR products were sequenced we considered amplicons to represent independent transcripts if they arose from different RT PCR reactions or if they differed in sequence The gene specific primers used in the RT PCR experiments were 5 GTGCAGACGAAAACGAGATGCCAATG 3 and 5 TGTAGTTCTTCTCAAAGGGATTACG 3
