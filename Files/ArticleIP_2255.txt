 Soccer Mom Nonsense Soccer when I was growing up in the 70s was a still an esoteric sport To find matches we of the Menomenee Boys Club had to travel a long way from the genteel precincts of the North Side of Chicago Generally our opponents came from ethnic enclaves in the distant suburbs On almost a weekly basis we were humiliated by teams of Polish Ukrainian and Lithuanian extraction whose members had been playing since just after birth Their mothers who surrounded the field terrified our mothers by abusing the referees in thick Slavic accents We believed they locked their boys in the sausage shed as punishment for missing shots The social complexion of the game has changed No longer a mere bridge between limousine liberals and the once captive nations soccer has become as mainstream as Little League baseball Indeed the sport is now so populist that in the opinion of all the experts it is soccer moms who will determine the outcome of next month s election According to a lead story in the New York Times published the day of the first presidential debate soccer moms have become the most sought after voters of the campaign season Following the debate the buzz on NBC was all about this emergent group and how the candidates had tried to woo it The idea is that while most other demographic segments are largely committed soccer moms make up a volatile and hence crucial constituency Who exactly we must ask are these soccer moms who hold the nation s fate in their hands They can be found a CNN correspondent informs us shuttling the kids to practice in minivans nervously pacing the sidelines juggling the demands of family and career Well naturally but what sort of women take their kids to soccer practice According to one South Carolina paper soccer mom is a well heeled super parent whose primary mission in life is to do too much for her children She got on a waiting list early for the right day care center sent junior to Montessori started violin lessons at 5 private school the same year and the next year soccer According to the Rocky Mountain News however soccer mom is financially stressed Opinion is similarly divided on her employment status In the view of the Cleveland Plain Dealer soccer mom is a career woman who has temporarily taken up child rearing According to the Buffalo News however she is balancing the demands of work and family The consensus seems to be that soccer moms are some subset of middle class white suburban women They care about their kids as opposed presumably to urban rap moms who do not and they are incredibly busy If you can t find a soccer mom for your story don t worry Part of the shtick is that she hasn t got time to talk to reporters Nexis the journalist s friend allows us to trace the historical evolution of the term The first reference to a soccer mom that turns up is from 1982 and involves the tawdry tale of a Ludlow Mass man who absconded with 3 150 raised for the benefit of a local soccer league There s very little more until a Susan Smith type tragedy in 1991 when a soccer mom in California got so stressed out that she shot her two daughters and then tried unsuccessfully to kill herself The application of the term to politics goes back only to last year when a Democratic candidate for the Denver City Council last year described herself as a soccer mom and won Credit for this year s coinage apparently goes to Republican consultant Alex Castellanos who made ads for Phil Gramm during the primaries and now works for Bob Dole See a sample of his work in this week s Varnish Remover The working soccer mom is the swing voter of this election Castellanos told the Wall Street Journal back before the Dole campaign signed him up full time And she is not going to trust a guy who argues for the need to own an assault weapon She ll trust a guy who can feel her pain If the phrase soccer moms has rapidly become part of the political lexicon it may be because it is cleverly positioned at the intersection of several different trends the rise of soccer as a middle class pastime the demanding lives of working women the diversification of the suburbs the popularity of the Dodge Caravan and so on Yet there is something intrinsically misleading about the category and indeed about all such categories The outcome of the 1994 congressional election was supposedly determined by the media s ideal voter of that year the Angry White Male who loved guns and beer while hating government and liberals What one wonders happened to Angry White Male Did he die in a hunting accident Did he go on Prozac What about the Perot voters of 1992 who are by definition the largest swing voting block in the country Why aren t they deciding the election The notion that there is a single demographic group that determines each election then recedes back into the anonymity of the general populace is useful for political consultants and reporters But as the impermanence of such categories suggests they are usually clich s that obscure as much as they reveal The soccer mom is this year s hula hoop says Harrison Hickman a Democratic pollster Hickman points out that married women in general tend to be very pro incumbent which somewhat undermines the argument that voting for Bush in 1992 and Clinton in 96 represents some sort of tectonic shift But even in 1992 married women split 40 40 20 for Clinton Bush and Perot respectively In Hickman s view the soccer mom segment is either a group that s so small as to be meaningless or so large that differences between them are more important than similarities among them Narrowly defined as married college educated suburban women with school age children soccer moms constitute only 4 percent or 5 percent of the electorate Broadly defined as suburban white women with school age kids they add up to 11 percent or 12 percent But then as Hickman points out that 12 percent covers both working class women who live in two bedroom ramblers and professionals in Westchester County with inherited wealth As voters these women have little in common from election to election Of course both these groups the Roseannes and the Murphy Browns you might say are currently leaning heavily for Clinton The gender gap has turned into a gorge this year with women in all categories favoring the president by a 26 point margin according to the most recent NBC Wall Street Journal poll Among soccer moms this is actually a category in the poll Clinton is ahead by 29 percentage points If the election were very close such a bulge might make a difference But as Guy Molineaux of Hart Research points out This year the gender gap has gotten to the point where all groups are trending Democratic soccer moms bowling moms you name it Molineaux also points out that in polling it is a truism that higher up the socioeconomic ladder women tend to vote more differently from their husbands So it s hardly a surprise that soccer moms are somewhat more pro Clinton than bowling moms Another pollster Mark Mellman points out that the big swing between Clinton s victory in 1992 and the Republican triumph of 1994 was among men not women And the same seems to be true of the swing back toward the Democrats this year Soccer moms whoever and however many they are are less flighty and thus less crucial to the election than their husbands This year s conception of the crucial swing voter in other words seems especially muddled and misleading But it doesn t matter much By the next election season some other clich will have emerged and we won t have soccer moms to kick around anymore
