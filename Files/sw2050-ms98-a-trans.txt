 well i haven t uh i ve been working in my own home for just um about the last three years but so i can just wear whatever i want around the house but before then i taught taught at the University of Houston and um oh now that s nice yeah so i tried to wear things that were comfortable but still tried to look you know somewhat business attire yeah yes but it wasn t quite business but to give the the students um an made you feel like you were the authority i felt like if i came in just in jeans or tattered clothes that i didn t have as good control over the class right right and if i tried to wear things that were a little bit more businesslike exactly well i i work uh i m a financial analyst and uh uh um hum in my group uh nearly everyone wears a a sports coat and tie uh but that does change in the summer uh they they get a little more lenient and we can wear like uh an open collar or uh uh huh a lot of times in the summer i ll try to uh like on a Friday i ll try to take off half a day and maybe go play some golf oh that s nice so uh i ll try to wear a short sleeve shirt and uh um and that that s okay that s appropriate well do you um meet with clients and so you have to dress a certain way for the clients or not really it s uh it s just uh in our small group we uh we have a controller and uh we support a senior vice president and uh the senior vice president is uh um hum is big on business attire and so um um he sort of funnels that down to uh to the people that work in his group so um i i i enjoy it i think it uh it makes a nice environment and uh i don t know gives it a little more business type uh atmosphere well i uh i have noticed with my own children for example that they will depending on what they re wearing it it makes a big difference on how they act and so that could be the same can be said for the business office too right see i think that s exactly right you know if if you re uh if you re dressed in a uh a suit and uh to me it make it helps me feel uh sort of like you were saying a lot more confident in myself um hum um hum and uh if i do have to approach the uh the controller or the vice president i feel i just have that little little extra confidence in myself being dressed that way well and i noticed in my uh teaching experience that since a lot of the people were my own age or older even um that because i taught English as a second language so i didn t have your average freshman student and um so i oh i see i had to do something to just elevate myself a little bit off their level i mean you want to be friends with the students but you don t quite want to be their equal exactly and so for me to dress in uh in businesslike um clothes my you know i i preferred slacks because we had to walk park pretty far away from oh Lord and down in Houston it d be so hot yeah yes and you wouldn t want to have to walk uh you know in high heels it s hard to walk a long way and the campus is pretty large right i see so i preferred slacks and um you know kind of dressy shirts and things but right so that i would look a little bit different and i would come in and i would have just the appearance of a little bit more authority than they did and that helped with their discipline and right i see didn t make me have um to much trouble and right right with the students and i think clothing you know it it just uh it it does like you were saying the the way you dress makes you feel different ways um if you like when you go out at night uh you may just want to have a casual evening or something so you you sort of dress down but if you re going to a uh um hum a social type party then you dress up and that i think it just has a a change on your attitude well and i i noticed since we moved down here to Texas my husband is originally from Texas but uh i m not and that you don t have to have uh such a wide variety of seasonal clothes that you do up north where you have to i see i m i m sure that s true yeah totally different wardrobe with different fabrics you know heavier wools and right yeah see the winter season s just not that long to to invest a whole lot of money in in uh and in the the heavier heavier materials no and you don t um you know if you usually can wear pretty close to the same types of things just with a jacket or sweater right or something rather than having the whole entire different wardrobe with exactly exactly different shoes you know we always had like um higher higher shoes higher tops on them rather than just um the lower right skimmers skimmers i think they call them that you would wear day to day but and see i think ladies clothing um uh is a lot more varied than than than men s clothing because uh men or at least in my situation you can uh i can wear the same slacks and uh sports coats nearly nearly all year round um hum and uh ladies you know uh uh i don t know if that s marketing or what but they they definitely have a uh i think a a winter type wardrobe and then a spring and then a summer that s really true a lot of it is um the color certain colors seem to be more acceptable true you know if you wear um pastels it s needs to be warm weather right and otherwise you have to wear darker colors in the winter for some reason and i guess part of that is um just the physics of it that in what isn t it dark colors attract the sun and light colors repel repel them so right exactly plus the social attitude you know if if you walk into a place and and uh i know in our office uh our secretary gives everyone a hard all the ladies a hard time if they wear white shoes i think it s uh is it after uh Labor Day or something i don t know and and uh so you know the the social attitude has a little bit to do with uh i think the way we dress um hum that s true there s some rule that s like between Labor Day uh no is it Labor Day or Memorial Day i m not for sure it s that one in September is when you need to quit uh huh right and the one that s like in May you can only wear and and supposedly we don t have an opportunity my husband and i we don t go to a lot of like where you have to wear yeah right a white dinner jacket or something and so you can only wear a white dinner jacket between those two i see right exactly exactly holidays too that s pretty funny it s funny that we have as a society go to so much trouble when we have so many other things we could be spending our time thinking about exactly a lot more uh th at s right a lot more helpful ideas that we could be uh spending time and effort on rather than our appearance um hum yes i noticed uh when we moved to Plano that um the mall here Collin Creek Mall i don t know where you are but um right i live here in Plano yeah oh you do that there there is a pretty um i wouldn t say snobbish but it it s kind of borders on that that if i depending on what i m wearing i get better service at the mall i felt since oh really huh uh where you know from where i ve lived in Houston that you have to in order to get yeah the attention you might need help right you need to be you can t just come in off the street is what i m trying to say exactly and i think that s you know a North Dallas type attitude oh is it and uh because i noticed that uh like even going to church uh seems like people really dress up a lot more uh here in North Dallas going to church um hum and uh i don t know that s that s uh because i i went to school with at uh Texas Tech in Lubbock um hum and uh church was a a lot more casual uh rather than uh you know here it s like going to a fashion show almost yes i think i think your right i ve noticed that too it s just it s very different but i ve i think um it s kind of sad when you have to go in and make dress up to go somewhere i mean just to the shop right to try to keep up with the Jones almost yeah yeah and you have to be sure that your everything coordinates and everything everything is um freshly pressed and everything right you can t just wear your sweats and an old T shirt and no you can t just drop in well i appreciate um the conversation we ve had about clothing i know i ve it s interesting to hear a man s point of view it s usually my husband right he s got a pretty good deal i go out and buy all his clothes and they magically well now that is that is so uh well that is great i appreciate the call well thank you and you have a good day okay bye bye you too bye bye
