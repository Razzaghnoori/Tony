 August 12 1994 Dear Dental Hygiene Colleague Turn back the hands of time and remember when you made the decision to become a dental hygienist For some that decision was made in the recent past and for others the distant past Whatever the case that decision was a defining moment in your life and the beginning of a productive and rewarding future Each student that enters our dental hygiene program is embarking on the same journey that you traveled before them However the excitement and motivation of that goal is often diminished by the difficult financial constraints that students experience Our student population is changing and greater demands are placed on students and their families Financial assistance through the A Rebekah Fisk Memorial Scholarship Fund has helped many dental hygiene students achieve their career goal If you have supported the A Rebekah Fisk Memorial Scholarship in the past I would like to thank you for your commitment to dental hygiene education and ask for your continued support If this is your first donation I would like to thank you in advance for your interest and support of this important scholarship fund An envelope and giving card are enclosed for your convenience Please make checks payable to Indiana University Foundation Sincerely Gail F Williamson LDH MS Dental Hygiene Alumna
