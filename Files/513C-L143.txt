              August        Dear Dental Hygiene Colleague      Turn back the hands of time and remember when you made the decision to      become a dental hygienist For some that decision was made in the recent      past and for others the distant past Whatever the case that decision      was a defining moment in your life and the beginning of a productive and      rewarding future      Each student that enters our dental hygiene program is embarking on      the same journey that you traveled before them However the excitement      and motivation of that goal is often diminished by the difficult      financial constraints that students experience Our student population is      changing and greater demands are placed on students and their families      Financial assistance through the A Rebekah Fisk Memorial Scholarship      Fund has helped many dental hygiene students achieve their career      goal      If you have supported the A Rebekah Fisk Memorial Scholarship in the      past I would like to thank you for your commitment to dental hygiene      education and ask for your continued support If this is your first      donation I would like to thank you in advance for your interest and      support of this important scholarship fund An envelope and giving card      are enclosed for your convenience Please make checks payable to Indiana      University Foundation      Sincerely      Gail F Williamson LDH MS Dental Hygiene Alumna
