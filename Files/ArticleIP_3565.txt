 Drawing upon her rich experience of life Prudence Prudie to her friends responds to questions about manners personal relations politics and other subjects Please send your questions for publication to prudence slate com Queries should not exceed 200 words in length Please indicate how you wish your letter to be signed preferably including your location Dear Prudence The words sex impotence and Viagra are certainly very public today therefore I feel comfortable writing this I am a male in my 60s Five years ago I had a radical prostate operation that left me impotent During this time my wife used other men to satisfy her sexual needs I recently obtained some Viagra and it works for me Self satisfaction was required to prove this as my wife has chosen not to participate I now face the following problem My sexual desires have been restored but to act on them will require my involvement with women other than my wife who does not see things this way I think I should do as she did Do you have an opinion on this Ed in Washington Dear Ed Prudie is fanning herself Let s see if she has understood this When you were impotent your wife was on the town as it were Now that you are operative she is not a willing partner but has decreed that you may not see other women Prudie certainly does have an opinion It is that your wife is a four door gold plated harridan who most likely is using you as either a bed and breakfast or a bank Her stepping out then forbidding you to do so even though she is an unwilling sex partner makes her sound like a perfect candidate for the single life Prudie suggests you take your newly operative self to a divorce lawyer and after that find a nice woman who genuinely cares about you Prudie potently Dear Prudence Please help me I am 18 years old and face a serious problem I am addicted to thinking about sex Every time I do something watch television play tennis swim take a bath all I can think about is sex I am even distracted from studying I open the book read a little then whoosh all these thoughts about having sex start pouring in from everywhere To make matters worse I have never had a girlfriend Actually I don t even want one because I am not very open and friendly toward girls Thus I have never even touched a girl much less kissed one I am not gay Second I am Pakistani American which means that I belong to a culture in which the only way to have sex is to get married which I don t think I will be doing until I am 28 So I will remain a virgin until then Now you have the whole story Please advise me how I could overcome this addiction and please don t advise me to get a girlfriend or get married early because that is out of the question Please don t print my name because I want Extreme Privacy Dear Extreme Prudie will not advise you to get a girlfriend but rather a therapist You can accomplish this either through your university health service or getting recommendations from friends Since you 1 have never gone out with a girl and 2 basically think you don t like them Prudie does not know how you are going to turn your feelings around at the magic and preordained age of 28 As for your obsessive and unbidden thoughts about sex they make it clear you need a professional s counsel You are fixated on an activity that you feel is verboten but which in fact is normal But do not feel that your wheels are coming off You are after all only 18 and beginning to tackle the problem will surely ease the situation As a stopgap measure you might try to make friends with a few girls so they will not seem like such alien and forbidden creatures Prudie certainly Dear Prudence Whether the Department of Justice thinks it is legal or not do you think Microsoft is being rude by installing the browser without asking Or just the opposite Are they being polite by offering people another option without having to be told Like giving a person cream for his coffee and letting him decide whether or not to put it in Southern Courtesy Dear South Prudie for no particular reason is quite fond of Microsoft and perforce their browser And she very much likes your analogy From now on Prudie will think of the Microsoft browser as the cream in one s coffee Following this continuum how could you think someone rude who is trying to enhance your computer s flavor Prudie tastefully Dear Prudie I must admit I was surprised by your response to the person who helped a friend and co worker draft a letter to the co worker s neighbors The letter writer had urged the playing of the race card suggesting that the reason the friend s neighbors were complaining so frequently about his behavior was because the friend was black The letter writer asked you whether you thought playing the race card was appropriate Expecting you to reply No I was most surprised to read your advice to the contrary In my opinion raising race as the motivation behind the neighbors complaints in the absence of evidence to support the charge is quite reckless Even if we accept the friend s protestations that he does nothing to offend we still have no basis for charging that they are acting out of racist hatred It could be that they have ultrasensitive hearing or that they are obnoxious or nosy Perhaps the neighbors are simply bored busybodies with nothing better to do than complain about every little thing that annoys them Charging that the neighbors are racist let alone gasp urging the letter writer to get the American Civil Liberties Union or the Anti Defamation League involved is very serious business Based on the information the letter writer provided there is no reason to conclude that the neighbors are racist Hopefully optimistic Stephen J Konig Dear S K Prudie does not agree with you that there is no basis to conclude that the neighbors are racist having found a number of indicia to the contrary As Prudie s hero Henry David Thoreau observed Some circumstantial evidence is very strong as when you find a trout in the milk Prudie confidently
