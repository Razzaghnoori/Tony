            were supposed to talk about if we agree on if were paying too many taxes or if were getting our monies worth out of the taxes we pay   right i think its kind of a loaded question i dont think anybody would say we should pay more i think i think most of us feel that we do pay enough   no yeah i think here in Texas theyre even running an ah a series right now on the news one of the news channels at night about they were like secretly um supervising people that were supposed to be working for a county here   umhum   and they were hired by the state state so they were being paid with our tax money   right   and they werent even doing the job they were out working on other sites not doing a thing on what they were supposed to do   well i i think whats happened is a lot of these state and city jobs people feel that once they get them theyre entitled to them for life and they can kind of take it easy because theyre protected by their unions etcetera   right   uh during my college years my mom worked for the state and she got me a summer job and when i came in im i was just a little eager beaver and i went through whatever work they gave me and i found people sitting around me polishing their nails and they were downright disgusted with me because i was going to come and go but they were going to live there and they didnt like me you know showing them up and finishing stuff so what they did was give me worse and worse and ugly and uglier things to do so i would just back off but and you know thats what it seemed like from the inside um its not that no one works i think what happens is its a personality thing and those who just like to do a job well done get to do the work for three or four freeloaders   right yeah   who dont do it i think i i you know i think its a cross section of humanity its not so much all state workers i mean its hard to generalize like that   yeah i think that we pay enough taxes and i think that if if everybody would be honest with how they dealt with the tax money if we could somehow get the same um ability to get work done and and be honest about it with our tax dollars i dont think they need to raise it and i think theyd be able to handle with what weve got i feel like here in Texas we pretty much get our monies back out of what we pay i feel very pleased with what they do theyve put in you know as far as the state taxes go i dont know about our federal money i think thats all pretty i hope that theyre doing better with not spending so much more than what theyve got but you know you just never you cant control that but in the state here theyve put in bike trails theyve got really nice parks here in Texas they keep their their their lots that they own that are green and stuff they keep them really nice um their schools here are really good and updated theyve got computers in the schools im very pleased at least with the area that were in with how they spend their money their their they dont tax us outrageously and they seem to really give us a lot for our tax dollars they offer community classes for our kids to go to that are just very minimal minimal costs you know just cover the instructor   oh   and um there lots of opportunities that you can take advantage of there are community colleges here you can take for just practically nothing um they just offer so much for i feel like what we pay in our taxes that i dont mind paying them at all   apparently theres been a uh movement where i am im on Long Island which is a suburb of New New York City and um theres been a movement by home owners to try get their their home taxes reduced they feel their too high and theres all kind of review boards that if you feel strongly about it you can challenge your tax uh the newspapers now running an article on state universities which you know everyone kind of assume at least i did assume that you can get a good education and pay so much less than a private University   umhum   and it seems to be more of an expose than anything i mean you hearing ghastly stories about kids who are taking four and five like five years to graduate because when they try to sign up for a class theyre so over crowded they cant get in the class   yeah   so in order to finish all the uh requisites they have to just stay longer until they can finally get a hold of the class   right   that this this i thought was totally outrageous that they have teaching assistants well thats thats an old thing you know having graduate students teach undergrads but some of these people are you know from India and Asia and they dont speak English well enough for the students to understand now how could they possibly have someone teaching a class who is not fluent   right   and and i heard that thats true i mean thats i find that incredible thats a   so youre not as pleased with your tax dollars and what theyre doing in New York   uh yeah well i guess i have a a private um argument argument with them im a substitute teacher who you know have have has raised a family my kids are older now and id like to work fulltime and theyre firing teachers left and right and the classes are getting bigger our school budgets are really down   yeah   maybe its not handled real efficiently you know thats thats very likely   that could be i dont know um   my you know my husbands in the computer business and the schools just you know theyre updating computers are the hot new thing and my husband was
