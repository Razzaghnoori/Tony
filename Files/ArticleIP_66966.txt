 Vouching Toward Gore Toward the end of Friday s Nightline debate after Al Gore had called Bill Bradley s health care proposal a voucher plan for the third time Bradley finally woke up and smelled the danger They re not vouchers Al Bradley protested It is not vouchers The health care program doesn t have vouchers Two days later in their debate on Meet the Press Gore elaborated There are 75 million Americans today who get Medicare and Medicaid They are all left out under Sen Bradley s plan because he eliminates Medicaid and replaces it with little 150 a month vouchers Bradley fired back immediately That s wrong he insisted It s not a voucher The voucher debate represents the third and decisive stage of the Democratic presidential contest In the first stage each candidate tried to put his best issues on the agenda Gore pushed suburban sprawl health care and education Bradley pushed gun control health care and campaign reform Each man got one of his issues on the agenda campaign reform for Bradley education for Gore plus the issue on whose importance they agreed health care In the second stage the candidates fought for the high ground on those three issues Gore won the high ground on education by proposing a 115 billion school aid package while portraying Bradley as a voucher sympathizer Bradley won the high ground on campaign reform by offering a comprehensive reform plan while teaming up with John McCain against a fund raising system whose corruption McCain helpfully traced to the Clinton Gore White House The third stage is the battle over the remaining issue health care Each candidate is trying to marshal his assets on this battleground by building a thematic bridge to it from the issue he is already winning Bradley is trying to carry his message of comprehensive reform from campaign finance to health care He proposes to replace Medicaid with subsidies that would make health insurance affordable to more people but would require those with sufficient incomes to pay part of their premiums out of their own pockets Gore meanwhile is trying to carry his message of public responsibility from education to health care He wants to convince Democrats that Bradley by substituting partial subsidies for guaranteed benefits would gut the public health care system as well as the public education system If Gore succeeds in linking the two issues this way Bradley will lose the health care debate and with it the nomination That s why Gore has distilled this linkage to a single word vouchers and why Bradley is fighting to extinguish that word with such fury In the context of education Gore has defined the word voucher in two negative ways First vouchers are a zero sum game As Gore sees it every penny spent on them comes out of funds previously allocated to a fully subsidized program Experience shows there s a set amount of money that communities have been willing to spend on education Gore argued on Meet the Press If you drain the money away from the public schools for private vouchers then that hurts the public schools Second vouchers don t cover the cost of the program they replace The flaw with the voucher theory said Gore is that the vast majority of those who receive a tiny little down payment on the tuition cannot afford the rest of it Having packed these two poisonous assumptions into the word voucher Gore is now injecting that poison into Bradley s health care proposal by applying the same word to both contexts Every single time vouchers came up in the Senate Bill for 18 years you voted for them Now you re proposing vouchers in place of Medicaid capped at 150 a month Gore charged on Nightline You canceled Medicaid and give people 150 vouchers to try to replace it If we cancel Medicaid and substitute little vouchers capped at 150 dollars a month there s not a single plan available here in New Hampshire that you can get for anything approximating the cap in this plan On Meet the Press Gore said Bradley expects recipients of health insurance subsidies to buy into the federal employee benefit plan Ninety five percent of all the health insurance plans that are part of that plan have premiums that are far in excess of 150 a month The voucher attack has at least made Gore s ideological position coherent For months Gore vacillated between calling Bradley a liberal budget buster and calling him a crypto Reaganite menace to federal entitlements Now that question is settled Gore will attack Bradley from the left Gore will defend Medicaid the public schools and other government guaranteed programs He will accuse Bradley of threatening to replace these programs with risky and inadequate voucher schemes And he will direct this argument to specific Democratic constituencies such as senior citizens blacks gays and labor unions What s not yet clear is whether Bradley will accept this arrangement On Meet the Press he challenged Gore s leftist dogma against school vouchers If voucher experiments demonstrated that the quality of public education was improved does that mean that you would not even consider vouchers Then he scoffed that Al proposes an education program that comes from Washington Yet Bradley refused to cede the left to Gore Rather than defend the idea of substituting vouchers for government control of schools Bradley insisted that the two options are compatible Every time I voted for vouchers I voted for it as an experimental basis said Bradley And I also said that I would not take any public money that was set aside for schools This would be new money Similarly Bradley refuses to defend the mildly libertarian position Gore has assigned him on health care Bradley could affirm that his subsidies for health insurance don t cover the entire cost of premiums He could argue that individuals ought to bear responsibility for paying a portion of their premiums Or he could simply argue that the amount of money the government takes from taxpayers to subsidize health care should be limited He could in short embrace and defend the idea of vouchers Instead Bradley repudiates the word On Meet the Press he insisted that the 150 he allots to each person s monthly insurance premium is not a cap It s a weighted average In a Memo to National Reporters after the debate Bradley s campaign drove home the point THE BRADLEY PLAN IS SUPPORT FOR HEALTH INSURANCE NOT VOUCHERS Calling the 150 a cost estimate the memo provided dictionary definitions of subsidy and voucher indicating that vouchers are explicitly finite whereas subsidies are not The implication of these caveats is that if universal health insurance turns out to cost even more than the 65 billion a year Bradley has allotted to it the government will tax and spend more to cover the difference Listening to Bradley s equivocal remarks on school vouchers and looking at the sliding scale of subsidies and tax breaks he proposes for health insurance you get the feeling he s rather sympathetic toward solutions that take account of market dynamics You get the feeling that this sympathy is what he s hiding behind noncomittal words such as cost estimates and weighted averages You wonder whether he could win a general election coming out of the right lane of the Democratic Party But first he has to get the Democratic nomination a race he has clearly decided he can t win in that lane In a way it s Bradley s fault On firearms and campaign finance he defined reform as government control He thought he could pass Gore on the left Instead Gore cut him off and now Bradley can t connect his campaign finance crusade under the rubric of reform to his challenges to existing welfare state policies on health and education Every time Gore utters the word vouchers he s bumping Bradley closer to the right edge of the road It s going to be a short race if Bradley won t bump back
