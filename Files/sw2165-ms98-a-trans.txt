        okay im a meat and potato man  yeah   you are huh   yeah i love to cook outdoors   you barbecue steaks   barbecue steaks and fry fish but uh no exotic foods although i did order a uh a uh wok that i saw advertised on TV and im looking forward to getting that and cooking some Chinese food   oh okay   pardon me but uh   i think my standard thing when i have company and im not too brave trying new recipes so a lot of times i will get the grill out and sometimes we do like surf and turf like well get some little filets wrap them up with bacon and then maybe do some little salmon steaks at the same time so thats my husbands deal hes out there you know   yeah   with the grill trying to get those things he likes to put sometimes even hickory chips on the barbecue you know get a little different flavor   yeah   and then you do your mashed potato and your salad you cant go wrong with that thatll push please pretty much any guest   i like to kind of make my own barbecue sauce   oh you do   yeah ill take some of the uh thick and rich barbecue sauce and put a little red wine in it a little uh uh liquid smoke   uhhuh ooh umhum   a little soy sauce and uh some uh seasoned salt mix all that up together and put it on the steak   um okay   tastes pretty good gives it a kind of a hickory flavor but uh grill i have i i dont normally put hickory chips in it but its got the uh uh rocks   uhhuh   in the bottom of it and a lot of times the the juice from prior steaks will give it a a good flavor   oh okay my only other standard menu i guess is uh Thanksgiving  i know how to put the bird in cook the bird and make all the trimmings   oh yeah oh yeah yeah i can remember the big Thanksgiving dinners my mother would make   yeah well what kind of things do you normally have with it people have different ideas of what goes with it   yeah uh you mean Thanksgiving   yeah   uh i i can make a meal just out of the the uh uh corn bread dressing and goblet gravy   oh okay   and uh cranberry sauce i i could eat just that and be satisfied   yeah my uh motherinlaw is into the corn bread stuffing now i never really had that much before i came to Texas but she is always she makes her corn bread and then of course you know she uses that to to make the stuffing we didnt do that so much uh im from kind of like Ohio area and uh were you know not into the corn bread as much so our stuffing was um lot of times was uh like sausage or what not we would make it with you know varied uh meats like that   yeah   inside the turkey and then of course we always had to have mashed potatoes   oh yeah   and your standard vegetables like you always had to have some peas and corn   peas and corn and green beans but uh   and you got to have your cranberry sauce now i like jellied kind   got to have the cranberry sauce yeah   and you got to have your pumpkin pie   so being from the north i guess corn bread and black eye peas are strange are strange to you   well yeah   most people never from north when we mention having black eye peas and corn bread and green onions   yeah and its funny because people call things differently in different areas um my parents grew up a lot in the Philadelphia area i was very young when we lived there but you call things differently like um uh we called them all hoagies down here they call them submarine sandmiches   yeah yeah   and we didnt ever call it uh Cokes and such you know we call it soda   yeah   um so its just different terminology for the same thing   different terminology i dont care much for those subs theres too much bread for me i dont like that much bread   yeah thats its a different kind of bread and its somewhat of a harder crust its not the soft   yeah   you know kind of uh rolls that they have here it was a harder crust and some of the hoagies were cooked like the Philadelphia um steak   yeah   the the hoagie steak that they they sell   but uh Thanksgiving i i dont really care that much for turkey its too dry for me   um   ill eat the dark meat but you can have the white meat       thats like eating sandpaper   well what is it for um New Years lot of people make ham and sauerkraut   yeah well also New New Years down here youve got to have black eyed peas       theyre supposed to bring you good luck or good or good finances   uh i think they cook cabbage up north i think thats one of the things they want im not sure im not   ill eat it as long as im not around while its being cooked   now we always had a ham like on uh uh Easter   yeah   you always have to have a ham or something on Easter   yeah i much prefer ham than i do turkey on Thanksgiving   i think last let me try to think i think the last time we had a big meal like that we did have both i think we did have both on Thanksgiving  just in case people you know have a variety   well plus ham  if youre going to give a party or something hams always good for one thing you can carve it and eat it with your hands you dont have to have a plate   yeah   but you can just snack on it   oh thats true well um you work here at the Expressway site   i work at the Lewisville site   oh Lewisville  any decent food in your cafeteria up there   uhhuh i ive heard people that uh have come and visited that plant that uh from other plants that our cafeteria is head and shoulders above the others   really   yeah thats what ive heard   oh   but of course you you know you eat day in and day out at one particular particular place and i guess you get tired of it or whatever and it doesnt seem like its   umhum   as good as as people say it is   hum well i normally work in the north building and um you would think that since you know the executives are there that we would have a pretty good one but i dont know i think its just kind of standard  like weve got anything while they do cater to the executive dining room but i think they give them different food   yeah i think so too and i i at Lewisville im not fond of their vegetable selection   oh   uh they have as far as im concerned because im im not a big vegetable eater they have too many uh yellow vegetables on the same day and it seems seems like its its a variety of the same type of vegetable   um   like theyll have uh theyll have broccoli and theyll have squash and cauliflower all on the same day   um   and that that doesnt im i like more of a variety than that in fact one day they they had they had three kinds of potatoes       they had mashed potatoes they had French fries and they had au gratin   now that is a little overdoing it   thats overdoing it   well my husband he used to complain at the cafeteria because it seemed like so many of their different items they always added garlic to it like he would get tuna salad this is what is that and the first ingredient no matter what youre making garlic   yeah     and he said tuna salad shouldnt taste garlicky  but everything always seemed to have a garlic flavor to it      yeah    yeah and every once in a while theyll have dressing but uh whoever makes it uh goes crazy with the sage   um     got to to strong of a sage taste to it   um   but uh i usually i can usually find something to eat there even if its a hamburger   well im i spend a lot of time over in Park Central   yeah   but we have just a little deli downstairs but in the mornings they make these really good muffins   yeah   they dont make a lot of them and i dont think they make them at other places this little deli is like RC Cooper its a little place you know its a little chain here in town its real small but uh they make the best muffins were talking its a real good size one you know  and they make them different flavors like   umhum   oh they have a chocolate chip one poppy seed is my favorite  and uh theyll have like a banana nut and a apple one and a zucchini and a blueberry   yeah   really good they usually pretty much go fast they dont make a lot of them You have to get here early in the morning   yeah yeah they have muffins there at the TI cafeteria too in the mornings   pretty good     yeah they got uh blueberry and i guess its apple or some kind of a maybe cinnamon cinnamon apple its its got the cinnamon on top of it   umhum hum   and uh theyre pretty good sized too but i usually wind up getting a donut       a chocolate donut   well you ought to try a muffin if you havent     yeah like i really need the cholesterol     oh well we all indulge right   um yep but i love to cook i wish i was a better cook than i was but i i love to cook   well   i dont like them cleaning up the dishes   yeah i know my husband hell cook every once in a while but like the kitchen is a disaster area afterwards   yeah   because he has to get everything out and he loves to season i mean hes like he gets every seasoning out of the cupboard you know and uses it and he likes to put lemon   yeah
