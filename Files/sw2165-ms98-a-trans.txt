 okay i m a meat and potato man yeah you are huh yeah i love to cook outdoors you barbecue steaks barbecue steaks and fry fish but uh no exotic foods although i did order a uh a uh wok that i saw advertised on TV and i m looking forward to getting that and cooking some Chinese food oh okay pardon me but uh i think my standard thing when i have company and i m not too brave trying new recipes so a lot of times i will get the grill out and sometimes we do like surf and turf like we ll get some little filets wrap them up with bacon and then maybe do some little salmon steaks at the same time so that s my husband s deal he s out there you know yeah with the grill trying to get those things he likes to put sometimes even hickory chips on the barbecue you know get a little different flavor yeah and then you do your mashed potato and your salad you can t go wrong with that that ll push please pretty much any guest i like to kind of make my own barbecue sauce oh you do yeah i ll take some of the uh thick and rich barbecue sauce and put a little red wine in it a little uh uh liquid smoke uh huh ooh um hum a little soy sauce and uh some uh seasoned salt mix all that up together and put it on the steak um okay tastes pretty good gives it a kind of a hickory flavor but uh grill i have i i don t normally put hickory chips in it but it s got the uh uh rocks uh huh in the bottom of it and a lot of times the the juice from prior steaks will give it a a good flavor oh okay my only other standard menu i guess is uh Thanksgiving i know how to put the bird in cook the bird and make all the trimmings oh yeah oh yeah yeah i can remember the big Thanksgiving dinners my mother would make yeah well what kind of things do you normally have with it people have different ideas of what goes with it yeah uh you mean Thanksgiving yeah uh i i can make a meal just out of the the uh uh corn bread dressing and goblet gravy oh okay and uh cranberry sauce i i could eat just that and be satisfied yeah my uh mother in law is into the corn bread stuffing now i never really had that much before i came to Texas but she is always she makes her corn bread and then of course you know she uses that to to make the stuffing we didn t do that so much uh i m from kind of like Ohio area and uh we re you know not into the corn bread as much so our stuffing was um lot of times was uh like sausage or what not we would make it with you know varied uh meats like that yeah inside the turkey and then of course we always had to have mashed potatoes oh yeah and your standard vegetables like you always had to have some peas and corn peas and corn and green beans but uh and you got to have your cranberry sauce now i like jellied kind got to have the cranberry sauce yeah and you got to have your pumpkin pie so being from the north i guess corn bread and black eye peas are strange are strange to you well yeah most people never from north when we mention having black eye peas and corn bread and green onions yeah and it s funny because people call things differently in different areas um my parents grew up a lot in the Philadelphia area i was very young when we lived there but you call things differently like um uh we called them all hoagies down here they call them submarine sandmiches yeah yeah and we didn t ever call it uh Cokes and such you know we call it soda yeah um so it s just different terminology for the same thing different terminology i don t care much for those subs there s too much bread for me i don t like that much bread yeah that s it s a different kind of bread and it s somewhat of a harder crust it s not the soft yeah you know kind of uh rolls that they have here it was a harder crust and some of the hoagies were cooked like the Philadelphia um steak yeah the the hoagie steak that they they sell but uh Thanksgiving i i don t really care that much for turkey it s too dry for me um i ll eat the dark meat but you can have the white meat that s like eating sandpaper well what is it for um New Year s lot of people make ham and sauerkraut yeah well also New New Year s down here you ve got to have black eyed peas they re supposed to bring you good luck or good or good finances uh i think they cook cabbage up north i think that s one of the things they want i m not sure i m not i ll eat it as long as i m not around while it s being cooked now we always had a ham like on uh uh Easter yeah you always have to have a ham or something on Easter yeah i much prefer ham than i do turkey on Thanksgiving i think last let me try to think i think the last time we had a big meal like that we did have both i think we did have both on Thanksgiving just in case people you know have a variety well plus ham if you re going to give a party or something ham s always good for one thing you can carve it and eat it with your hands you don t have to have a plate yeah but you can just snack on it oh that s true well um you work here at the Expressway site i work at the Lewisville site oh Lewisville any decent food in your cafeteria up there uh huh i i ve heard people that uh have come and visited that plant that uh from other plants that our cafeteria is head and shoulders above the others really yeah that s what i ve heard oh but of course you you know you eat day in and day out at one particular particular place and i guess you get tired of it or whatever and it doesn t seem like it s um hum as good as as people say it is hum well i normally work in the north building and um you would think that since you know the executives are there that we would have a pretty good one but i don t know i think it s just kind of standard like we ve got anything while they do cater to the executive dining room but i think they give them different food yeah i think so too and i i at Lewisville i m not fond of their vegetable selection oh uh they have as far as i m concerned because i m i m not a big vegetable eater they have too many uh yellow vegetables on the same day and it seems seems like it s it s a variety of the same type of vegetable um like they ll have uh they ll have broccoli and they ll have squash and cauliflower all on the same day um and that that doesn t i m i like more of a variety than that in fact one day they they had they had three kinds of potatoes they had mashed potatoes they had French fries and they had au gratin now that is a little overdoing it that s overdoing it well my husband he used to complain at the cafeteria because it seemed like so many of their different items they always added garlic to it like he would get tuna salad this is what is that and the first ingredient no matter what you re making garlic yeah and he said tuna salad shouldn t taste garlicky but everything always seemed to have a garlic flavor to it yeah yeah and every once in a while they ll have dressing but uh whoever makes it uh goes crazy with the sage um got to to strong of a sage taste to it um but uh i usually i can usually find something to eat there even if it s a hamburger well i m i spend a lot of time over in Park Central yeah but we have just a little deli downstairs but in the mornings they make these really good muffins yeah they don t make a lot of them and i don t think they make them at other places this little deli is like RC Cooper it s a little place you know it s a little chain here in town it s real small but uh they make the best muffins we re talking it s a real good size one you know and they make them different flavors like um hum oh they have a chocolate chip one poppy seed is my favorite and uh they ll have like a banana nut and a apple one and a zucchini and a blueberry yeah really good they usually pretty much go fast they don t make a lot of them You have to get here early in the morning yeah yeah they have muffins there at the TI cafeteria too in the mornings pretty good yeah they got uh blueberry and i guess it s apple or some kind of a maybe cinnamon cinnamon apple it s it s got the cinnamon on top of it um hum hum and uh they re pretty good sized too but i usually wind up getting a donut a chocolate donut well you ought to try a muffin if you haven t yeah like i really need the cholesterol oh well we all indulge right um yep but i love to cook i wish i was a better cook than i was but i i love to cook well i don t like them cleaning up the dishes yeah i know my husband he ll cook every once in a while but like the kitchen is a disaster area afterwards yeah because he has to get everything out and he loves to season i mean he s like he gets every seasoning out of the cupboard you know and uses it and he likes to put lemon yeah
