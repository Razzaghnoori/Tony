 In the Company of Men In 1985 while writing a review of Sylvester Stallone s grotesque rabble rouser Rocky IV I went back and watched the original Rocky to see if to borrow the controlling metaphor of Ingmar Bergman s The Serpent s Egg through the thin membranes you could clearly discern the already perfect reptile In other words was the man s egotism always this monstrous Maybe not In Rocky which is basically a comedy Stallone is treated as a lumbering sad sack Most striking is the camera placement The director John Avildsen keeps Stallone small in the frame as dwarfed by his desolate environment as Chaplin s Little Tramp After Sly became a superstar he seized creative control of his films and moved the camera way up close so that his heavy lidded nobility and his musculature loomed large In interviews he said that his father remarked on the puniness of his Rocky physique a dig that clearly goaded Stallone into pumping himself up in all senses Stallone has certainly had his blockbusters over the years but he has also turned himself into a Goliath of camp In Cop Land Stallone plays Freddy Heflin the loser sheriff of Garrison N J just across the George Washington Bridge from Manhattan I use the word loser so casually because the film virtually brands it on his forehead He is discovered in a bar playing a desultory game of pinball beside half a dozen empty beer bottles Running short of quarters the soft flabby Freddy staggers outside unlocks a parking meter and spills the coins all over the sidewalk Driving home loaded he glances longingly across the Hudson at the big city where he once dreamed of being a cop and then swerving to avoid a deer plunges off the road into a tree totaling his car and putting a huge gash on the bridge of his nose The hardened policemen who live in Garrison a New York cop enclave treat him like a pet He s there to give speeding tickets In his shabby house he listens to the blue collar wail of Bruce Springsteen The man is Jersey through and through Stallone whom a former associate of his once described to me as the most frightened man in Hollywood had to hold a press conference to announce that he was going to gain weight for the part of a not so super hero in a small movie From his vantage I guess Miramax makes small movies Where normally Stallone would over project his potency in Cop Land he telegraphs his impotence It isn t just the paunch It s the bleary hangdog demeanor the watery eyes the shambling gait the passiveness that borders on the stereotypically feminine He s like a white Stepin Fetchit And yet as obvious as this performance is it s more deeply felt than anything Stallone has done since Rocky and is close I suspect to how the actor really sees himself He s never more winning than when he projects loserdom Cop Land shares its leading man s slow wittedness but also his likability It tries hard It s formulaic but it sticks to a classic Western formula instead of a cartoonish blockbuster one Think High Noon by way of Scorsese with a touch of Peyton Place I could also cite Carl Franklin s One False Move and Tony Richardson s The Border but the list of influences would run as long as this review The writer director James Mangold Heavy labors mightily to establish a sense of place he never stops setting the scene At the start the camera glides over Manhattan into New Jersey while a narrator Robert De Niro who turns out to be an Internal Affairs cop named Mo Tilden informs us that New York City policemen have always dreamed of living outside the metropolis itself where the shit couldn t touch em and that Garrison was such a refuge a city on a hill with a large population of cops no minorities and almost no crime Of course the hill the city sits on is a heap of corruption a pile of lies as high as the Palisades Everything emanates from Ray Donlan Harvey Keitel a super connected New York cop who presides over Garrison like the old style movie boss men of Akim Tamiroff or Edward G Robinson But Ray has a problem While driving drunk back to Jersey his nephew a cop named Babitch Michael Rapaport gets sideswiped on the bridge by a couple of stoned rastas Thinking they fired on him he blows them away I thought they fired on him too but the point is murky no gun is found in the car For some reason Ray fears that his nephew will spill his guts to Internal Affairs so he takes radical and quite frankly moronic measures to keep Babitch from seeing the inside of an interrogation room Mangold and his cinematographer Eric Alan Edwards can t get enough of Garrison s terraced cliffs above the Hudson and they rarely lose sight of the imposing Manhattan skyline It s a constant reminder to Freddy of the time when as a teen ager he saved the town beauty Annabella Sciorra from drowning when her car went off the bridge in the process mangling one ear and leaving himself unfit for the NYPD We learn all this from flashbacks and from a strange oracle called Gary Figgs Figgis Ray Liotta who when drunk can t seem to stop himself from spewing exposition You saved the town beauty from drowning and made yourself deaf in one ear so that you couldn t be a New York cop and then she married some other guy you have a right to be jealous Or words to that effect In the labyrinthine plot everyone has something to hide Ray s wife Cathy Moriarty is having an affair with another cop Peter Berg who s married to Freddy s old heartthrob Sciorra Assorted police goons among them the dependable heavy Frank Vincent and the blue eyed blankly malevolent Robert Patrick the lethal shape shifter of Terminator 2 Judgment Day let the sheriff know he d better turn his deaf ear on Ray s chicanery For most of Cop Land we watch Stallone get bullied and stared down by everyone in the large cast while we wait for him to awaken from his stupor and start blowing bad guys away which you know he has to do or he would never have accepted the role Of course the formula dictates that all his allies must abandon him so he can march down the street wielding a shotgun bleeding but with the iron back in his spine to prove to those city cops what he s really made of Everybody in this town he says is gonna tell the truth Since the film moves in such a leisurely fashion with lots of talk there s plenty of time to be distracted by the over familiar cast Oh there s Cathy Moriarty married to Harvey Keitel hmmm Weren t they in Raging Bull together No that was Joe Pesci Where s Joe Pesci Will Moriarty have any scenes with De Niro her Raging Bull co star Will Keitel have more scenes with De Niro Have they acted together since Taxi Driver Liotta he and De Niro were both in GoodFellas was Keitel in that No that was Pesci but Lorraine Bracco Keitel s ex played Liotta s wife Will Liotta have any scenes with De Niro Wasn t Frank Vincent in Raging Bull And GoodFellas And Casino Where s Joe Pesci All these Scorsese types are in there pitching doing their damnedest to legitimize the movie and its wayward star Under a curly black thatch De Niro coasts along giving an offhand but confidently weird performance I look at you sheriff he says and I see a man who s waiting for something to do The over deliberate diction lets you know that he knows the line is a clich but that he thinks it s entertaining anyway The character is playing with Freddy and De Niro is playing with Stallone I could take you blindfolded both hands tied behind my back he seems to say the heavyweight towering over the bantamweight And Stallone bless him endures it like a man The beginning of Babitch s troubles Rapaport 58 seconds I ve got a sticky problem Mo Tilden De Niro explains the situation to Sheriff Freddy Heflin Stallone 51 seconds
