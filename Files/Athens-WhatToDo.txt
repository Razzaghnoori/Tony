not only for typical Greek style souvenirs but for haute couture good art and jewelry The good news is whatever your budget you re bound to find something exciting to take home whether you want mass produced items or unique hand finished pieces As with any large city individual districts specialize in certain types of goods so here is a short rundown of what is available Where to Shop For undeniably tourist kitsch head for the streets of Plaka and you ll find mass produced items of all kinds They are interspersed with galleries T shirt shops and numerous street hawkers selling fun toys or handmade budget art Monistir ki is the old bazaar area of the city the Sunday flea market is a must for collectors of old china memorabilia and furniture and the myriad small shops sell all kinds of collectibles in addition to good value street clothing Kolonaki is the favorite district of Athenians for the boutiques and home furnishings stores that sell the best of European design Prices match the quality here but if you don t want to spend just sit at a streetside caf and watch the Athens jet set do a little shopping The maze of streets around the Cathedral offers religious souvenirs of all kinds Incense burners icons and tamata votive offerings are the most portable Athens Municipal Market just south of Omonia Square offers wonderful fresh food for you to enjoy as you stroll as well as numerous Greek foodstuffs to take home The streets of Ermou Eolou and Stadiou offer large department stores and numerous pan European names with everything from shoes and clothing to household wares In many parts of the city prices are flexible though not in department stores and boutiques and haggling is expected at the flea market In tourist shops you may get a discount for cash and prices are lower early and late in the season Conversely you may be charged a little extra if you want to pay by credit card What to Buy Copper and brassware Copper and brass have been used for many household utensils for centuries and skilled craftsmen still work in small workshops around the city The newly produced goods have a bright patina that mellows with use and some of the older pieces are exceptionally beautiful Antiques stores in Monastir ki have the best choice and these include urns for carrying water samovars bowls and tureens Ornate Ottoman tables on folding wooden bases are compact enough to carry in hand luggage as are serving ladles and goat bells Ceramics The skills honed at Kerameik s centuries ago are still much in evidence on the streets of Athens You can buy exquisite hand thrown and painted copies of ancient pieces for a price and numerous examples of less expensive factory produced items Traditional shapes of urns jugs and cups are decorated with scenes taken from the lives of the ancients or of the Greek gods in their domain on Mount Olympus Modern ceramic artists also thrive and there are many small galleries showcasing hand created pieces Statuary If you want a little piece of ancient Greece then you ll certainly be able to find it It will be a reproduction of course but still you can own your own copy of Zeus Poseidon or Athena herself small enough to grace a table or large enough to decorate a garden Plaques depicting ancient friezes or masks to hang on walls are also extremely popular as are Mycenaean helmets If classical statuary is too ornate for your taste you can also find copies of the minimalist Mycenaean statues found at the Goulandris Museum The National Archaeological Museum also has a wide range of copies of its artifacts Each comes with a certificate of authentication Leatherware Local craftsmen have always worked goat and cow hides and the industry continues today Footwear bags and clothing come in a range of styles though quality is generally more rustic and bohemian than similar items produced in Italy or France Carpets and needlepoint Ottoman craftsmen left behind a legacy in both the use and production of fine carpets look for hand knotted ornate patterns in wool or silk which come with a hefty price tag Hand produced Greek flotaki rugs were traditionally used in farmhouses across the Greek world and are made from sheep wool They are sold by weight and are decorated with traditional symbols such as deer or patterns such as the Mycenaean geometric designs Needlepoint crochet and embroidery once activities undertaken by every Greek woman are now dying arts so any hand crafted pieces will become collectors items of the future Machine produced pieces are readily available in the form of tablecloths napkins cushions and handkerchiefs Or you could try a traditional embroidered hat complete with long silk tassel now only worn during folkloric spectacles Jewelry When Schliemann excavated the tombs of the Mycenaean rulers he found their skulls decorated with masks fashioned from pure gold Since that time Greece has been famed for the worksmanship of this most precious metal and you can still find many high class jewelry stores in Athens producing excellent quality items Athenians still love to adorn themselves as they did in ancient times with gold and with precious stones imported from elsewhere Prices are very competitive as gold is sold by weight with a relatively small mark up for the craftsman s skill however always check with prices at home if you intend to make a major purchase Most popular items are traditional patterns passed down since ancient times The major museums also sell copies of items displayed which are quite appropriate souvenirs of your trip For those whose taste or budget isn t for precious metals and stones there is a whole range of jewelry featuring semi precious stones and street jewelry such as rings earrings toe rings and though not strictly jewelry worry beads carried by most Greek men to calm the nerves are very decorative The best feature beads of cornelian or amber with silver decoration and silk thread Icons and Art An icon is a religious portrait usually of a saint or apostle These were a development from the fayum paintings that covered the face of the dead in the sarcophagi of Egyptian mummies Icons lie at the heart of Byzantine or Orthodox worship in both the Greek and Russian churches and they form a focus for prayer the characteristic gold leaf used in their production symbolized the glory of God For centuries they were popular souvenirs of the grand European Tour or religious pilgrimage However modern production methods including thin artificial canvas and gaudy synthetic colors saw them lose favor In recent years there has been a rebirth in icon painting using traditional methods both for church renovations and for commercial sale Natural pigments and egg tempura egg yolk and vinegar binding are painstakingly mixed and applied to a canvas bound over wood The gold leaf is then applied and the whole image is given a patina This time consuming work is exquisite and correspondingly expensive Pre 1821 icons will require an export permit You ll find mass produced icons in many tourist shops but for quality pieces visit a specialist store Icons are a very particular form of art and if they are not to your taste there is a whole range of art to choose from Scenes of Athens and the classical sites are extremely popular as mementos Edibles Wonderful foods from the Greek countryside include honey olives and olive oil and nuts such as almonds and hazelnuts All can be bought in pretty packaging for you to take home For something a little stronger try ouzo the aniseed flavor aperitif or Greek brandy which is slightly sweeter than French Cognac Metaxa is the most famous brand name Things to Do with Children Athens requires some forethought if you are taking young children Not all will be as eager to spend days at the ruins and it can be oppressively hot during the summer months However Greeks love children and they will be most welcome and fussed over in tavernas and restaurants which makes eating out a delight Here are some ideas for a child friendly visit Take a boat trip to one of the nearby islands A Metro ride to the station at Pireaus means you only have to cross a highway to reach the ferry port and numerous destinations are only an hour or two away Children will love the journey and the magic of reaching a seaside destination Take time out in the cool gardens of the capital The National Gardens have a lake with water birds and a playground and Areos Park near the National Archaeological Museum has play facilities for children Let your children have their portraits done street artists can be found in Plaka or their faces painted Either way they get to be the center of attention If all else fails a day at the beach will surely blow the city cobwebs away Take a break at Glyf da Vo la or Vouliagm ni only a short taxi ride away
