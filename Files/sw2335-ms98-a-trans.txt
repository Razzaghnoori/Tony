 so what do you think uh the causes of crime um i think it was an imbalance of of power in the United States that s causing the lower class class to rebel that s why there s such such high crime in uh there s crime in uh young people because they don t have real role models yep see too much crime on TV and they think it s way to go i don t know what do you think what about i agree with the upper and lower level you know um hum because that s the lowest thing for themselves plus there s nobody for them to look up to yeah but i also blame some of it on parents okay because parents aren t parents yeah because i remember even when i was growing up i m thirty five i remember when i was growing up and i had friends okay that used to do stuff like you know go to the store and steal stuff my mother warned us it s like i don t care what your friends do if you do it then that was it i mean i knew that i would get mean more trouble from my mother than from yeah from anybody else from anybody else and i think that s the basic is they have no morals anymore so they don t care yeah yeah so yeah i think i can agree with that too but now as far as what they can do about it i don t know you can t make parents be parents that s true you got to kind of make want people wanna do the right thing you know i don t know how you do that i guess if you gave the gave them jobs that that s another problem with the United States there s no jobs anymore yeah well i i ve heard this one theory that if you know if a kid commits a crime that they ve instead of the prosecuting the kid they prosecute the parent or both of them but now put put the blame on the parent that ll work to a point well that d work to a point because some kids are just bad anyway i don t care what you do to them yeah you know so i think it depends on how much trouble that kids has been in you know yeah because uh a child can get into anything regardless i don t care who how good you they are yeah yeah eventually at least one time but now if it s a repeated thing here with this child in juvenile and all this to me yeah both of them because that means she s still not doing what she s supposed to do yeah because i just watched it on TV one night on one of them um Twenty Twenty Forty Eight Hours one of them shows where this boy had been stealing cars um hum yeah i don t know if you seen they was the gang a little it was a little gang of them stealing cars you know and then when they caught him you know his mother sitting there now they re gonna take me away from you that means she was warned hm no i didn t see it yeah but see by that i think that sometimes it a little late yeah you know but i m sure there s something can be done yeah what about with adults you think they can do anything about just adult regular adult crime yeah start prosecuting they but really good instead of having a revolving door on the damn court system yeah huh for well the major problem with that is the jails are overcrowded well they should start with the the if they would get rid of seems to me i know there s a lot about courts that people don t understand there s more people in jail right now for child support um hum okay then there are for people doing drugs hm they ought to take all them little misdemeanor people let them go let them go yeah yeah you know give them a fine whatever make them do civic duty whatever put them fools in there that s what they need to put i call i call them all fools idiots whatever little rock stars put all them in there yeah i mean seriously they ought to put those good people to work yeah hm you know the murderers the the drug dealers the user put them all in jail you know and let all the normal people go yeah you know because okay yeah if you write a bad check you go to jail right yeah okay let them people go yeah not let them go and get out of it let them go and pay their crime or their time doing something else well they yeah they you still have to punish yeah you know like cleaning up the city or however they do they community time you know whatever that is but yeah that s you know put don t put them in jail because they re not hardened criminals yeah and they re they re still they can provide for society whereas some of them are so far gone that they can t do anything good for society um hum yeah so i don t know them people boy they got the i think the United States has got too many problems to be worried about everybody else yeah that s true now how they gonna fix it i don t know the i don t think there is a ready solution no i don t think so either um because the economy is down people you know the the the low man on the pole is getting more of the i guess the bulk of it yeah uh he s gonna have to work extra hard just to make ends meet and they keep taking more money from us yeah people and get and they don t have any incentive to work if we re just gonna take fifty percent of it um hum yeah they might as well steal it then they don t have to pay taxes on it that s it yeah so you know they i i know that s bad but you know the just like Texas now um hum they could of had a lottery they don t want a lottery why not i would rather pay for a lottery a dollar two three dollars whatever i m paying you know a week or whatever they d have a yeah and never see any of that money than to have them take a portion of my paycheck yeah because you know they take and Uncle Sam takes his the Social Security which probably won t be here when i get that old you know hm because we re payin g for Social Security they using now who s gonna pay for mine yeah yeah but it s it s nah you don t count on Social Security but it s it s that s what i m saying they need to do something else no i don t know definitely i m not counting on it yeah hm but crime is gonna go up as long as the economy stays down yeah and it s gonna get worse that s just like last night they killed them people in that store where you at yeah uh i m in Raleigh North Carolina oh no wonder you don t know then why where are you from they killed i m in Dallas okay but last night they killed uh uh four people in a chain food oh man and killed them well it was two stores side by side um hum one was a store and one was like a a fast food place i think it chicken or something i don t know anyway they raped the women yeah beat them all up including the women i mean they just beat them stuffed them in the freezer and then shot them all ow now why was you know dumb why did they do it in the freezer you know why didn t they just if they was gonna lock just lock them in the freezer take the money you know they didn t have to kill them or rape them or anything yeah hm hm that s awful yeah we still get some in Raleigh i mean not not too often real bad ones but um hum it s just getting really ridiculous down here i wish i could move somewhere where this you know you got to like in the country but i don t think there s anywhere where there isn t gonna be crime so well i think if it s the town is smaller um hum and everybody knows everybody it s harder to come in there and do something yeah yeah where is and and and see that s another thing neighborhoods aren t neighborhoods anymore yeah there s nobody next door to you you don t know your neighbors and stuff like that yeah it s just huh uh you know because i moved out some apartments before because they were loaded with drug dealers hm and you didn t even and the what the manager the manager won t even do anything he s probably drug dealer himself never know um hum you don t and so i moved because i moved the day probably a week after one of the apartments blew up wow you know and this is like across the street this was a nice part of town hm and then across the street one of the apartments blew up because they were having that making that um crack stuff and then the other time i saw the cops break down somebody s apartment around the corner i said see this is it hm time to go that s it and i moved and you know now i live in like a family a neighborhood in a townhouse but it s nice i don t you know yeah yeah i m kind of in the same same kind of deal townhouse in the neighborhood but it s pretty nice i don t know how they can let a neighborhood or apartment complex that s what happened that s what s wrong you know i don t think don t rent to them or rent to them evict them because they drug dealers put it on the lease if you deal drugs you can t live here yeah yeah yeah most of them too scared to do anything about it um hum that s it yeah all right well listen i got to go it s good talking to you well alrighty and i thank you bye bye alrighty bye bye
