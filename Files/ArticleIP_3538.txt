 ASK PRUDENCE Prudence drawing on her rich experience of life will answer questions submitted by readers She will respond to questions about manners personal relations politics economics and other subjects Questions should be sent to Prudence slate com They should not exceed 200 words in length Please indicate how you wish your letter to be signed preferably including your location Dear Prudence The papers are filled with stories about the death of Michael Kennedy The stories list other family occurrences that show the Kennedys as a hard luck family It is for example listed as a Kennedy tragedy that other people tend to die in cars driven by Kennedys If a Kennedy is walking by and a busload of people die in a crash it would make the list of tragedies longer Is this an example of good PR Ellsworth M ButlerBoonton N J Dear Mr Butler I agree that the word tragedy is used without discrimination in reference to the Kennedy family The death of Joseph Kennedy Jr in World War II and the assassinations of Jack and Robert were tragedies As far as I can see most of the subsequent problems were the result of their own recklessness or worse Since they are so prominent and have been blessed with so much wealth and public adulation they have a responsibility to be role models of sensible behavior It is unfortunate that they do not see it that way Prudence sadly Dear Prudence I have met a woman whom I am attracted to She is attracted to me and we would like to see more of each other The problem is we are both married The attraction is more than plutonic it is also physical What would you recommend Troubled in Las Vegas Dear Troubled in Las Vegas Your letter is indeed ambiguous You say that the attraction between this woman and you is more than plutonic it is also physical In my old dictionary plutonic means of Pluto infernal I will assume that you mean platonic But then I don t know whether you mean that the attraction is physical or that the consummated relationship is physical and sexual I will assume that you would like to have sexual relations but have not done so My advice is not to do it unless you are prepared to leave i e divorce your present wife One reason is that your wife will probably learn of it and when she does there will be the devil to pay A second reason is that even if she doesn t find out you will know and you will probably go around with a burden of guilt that will sour your life and your relations with both women But there is a third most important reason The relationship you are longing for is wrong The one of the Ten Commandments that everyone knows is Thou shalt not commit adultery It may be often violated but hardly anyone in our culture denies that it is a commandment If our behavior is to be governed only by cost benefit calculations and not by moral standards we are in pretty bad shape Whether you should leave your present wife I cannot tell without knowing much more than you have revealed I urge you to be very cautious about it It is easy to be attracted to a new woman whose faults you do not know who does not know your faults and who has never asked you to take out the garbage or mow the lawn But you have to think of what the new woman will be like after she has become the old woman Also you haven t said whether you and your wife have any children Their interests deserve a lot of weight Prudence Mosaically Dear Prudence I have a long distance boyfriend of three months I ve only seen him three times and I m beginning to dislike him However he constantly phones me and sent me a 75 Christmas present Should I send him a Christmas present or would this encourage him even more I want to break up with him Desperately Dear Desperately There must be something more here than meets the eye On the facts presented you have no problem Don t send him a gift Send his gift back Prudence simply Dear Prudence I received a small Christmas gift from a workmate I thanked her when she handed me the gift My wife thinks that a thank you note is appropriate but I think that the verbal thank you satisfies my obligation What do you think Sincerely Bunsworth Dear Bunsworth You made an oral expression of gratitude which was of course also verbal That is enough unless the gift was extraordinary If the gift was an item of houseware like a microwave your wife should write a thank you note Prudence sufficiently Dear Prudence I have read a few of your comments and you do indeed sound like a thoroughly courteous and sensible person I just have an idea I should like to broadcast via you In public libraries one finds the children s section the adult reading section and the young adult s section read teen agers Isn t this a kind and gentle way of referring to people in the teen years I thought it would gently help those young people to begin to accept the idea that they are growing up and should soon become grown ups or adults That s all Louine King P S I hate the idea that the word adult so often refers to pornographic things There goes another perfectly good word unless we can recapture it with dignity Thanks for your electronic ear Dear Louine I thank you for your comment Indeed it is important that teen agers should recognize that they are becoming adults and that they are not in some playground where they have full capabilities and no responsibilities In the Jewish tradition as I understand it boys become adults at the age of 13 and go through rites intended to impress that upon them The signs you observe in the library are a small step toward making teen agers aware of their status The use of the word adult to rate some movies and I suppose other forms of entertainment is I agree often inappropriate I think we should have two categories adult and immature
