        huh um do yall have a budget   okay thanks well um  yeah we we do um weve been married for twenty three years   umhum   and we have um three teenage daughters and you know theyre very expensive so um  uh we yeah we have somewhat of of a system um its its kind of um you know its its kind of hard to explain weve actually gone uh just recently to you know having having two checking accounts we always had just one and now were having two   yeah umhum   um its kind of hard to talk about this because to me its very personal   yeah its um   so i have to be thats thats kind of the way i feel about it you know   yeah i usually uh my wife handles a lot of the day to day finances and of course were the like everybody like a lot of people we just scramble through month to month you know and uh   yes do you have a two income family or one income   uh we have a two income uh family she also works   yeah yeah   and uh but she she enjoys it you know and and shes good at it um if its if its i am kind of uh uh im im pretty bad about procrastinating and one one of these days i am gonna do something about that but you know  you know how that goes but uh uh if but she she handles it pretty well she uh   umhum yeah yeah   she writes all the checks you know once a month   so your wife yes is that what her is is her career uh related to to finance or accounting   um sort of on a peripheral shes an annuity annuity annuitity administrator and so she uh she works for an insurance company but but she enjoys it she likes keeping track of all that stuff and uh   oh uhhuh yeah so thats sort of related to her field a little bit   yeah sort of and we you know weve experimented with with uh budgets you know from time to time uh   yeah   but if you know you have to keep up with them so a lot of times we just uh just kind of play it by ear we try to keep our um our retirement and our savings kind of automated so we never see that money just like taken directly   yeah its just taking it out right right yeah yeah we do the same thing   yeah and that thats kind of handy yeah because if you dont see it you dont miss it and uh you dont spend it   yeah if if you have something to take it out thats exactly what weve always done and weve had uh theyve always had um where they match your funds you know sometimes if you if you save so much then theyll match it   yeah uhhuh   um that you know weve done that too but my husband works for an insurance company and he he has now for about oh gosh how long has it been ten years i guess   yeah uhhuh   but he was with another company before that but we have we have i i work also but i only have a part time job   uhhuh   and i get paid very little but um you know i try to use that money for food money Jim gives me a certain amount money you know we just transfer it into my account and then i use that for food household expenses and then i add my own check to that and then with that i try and handle   yeah umhum   you know some of the clothes that the girls need and and things like that but the expenses that we need around have around the house   yeah yeah so sounds like yall pretty much do it the same we do just kind of   so yeah   play it by ear but but keep the the deductions you know  coming on   yeah we well Jim has Jim has a budget i mean he works it out every month and writes it all down   uhhuh   um you know im given so much money money a month so i am supposed to kind of get the food out of that so i try not to you know we dont   umhum   you know i dont ask for more i mean i just try and make it on that because i think when you go to the grocery store you can just you can go crazy with all the choices that you have   umhum yeah yeah uhhuh   and uh you can buy you can really waste a lot of money that way so um well how long have you been married   yeah uh about five years yeah   oh yeah so youre just really getting started  so do you have a family too   yeah uh ive got one little girl shes like uh nineteen months   oh yeah yeah   so uh shes shes not uh   she hasnt affected your budget yet really   not not really not too bad uh   no no not like she will later on youll youll see that because all of a sudden youre paying youre trying to decide whether you are going to do you know soccer and piano and all these choices that they have of activities to do   yeah yeah when uhhuh   and then you really have to start saying okay now what can we afford you know what can we do here and then you have to really sit down and plan some more and uh but i think when we were back at your age we didnt have much of a budget   yeah yeah   and then as the girls got older i think we we did more and more of that you know more budgeting as as they got older   umhum   um but um but what do you do do you   im uh i i work for im an electronic technician i work at uh for a university uh Georgia Tech uh research   oh okay oh well good good   as a so i just uh   well we just have yeah we have a good friend thats about to move to Atlanta i guess were not supposed to talk about those things i better get back to the subject but um budgeting i found you know i feel a lot better you know we used to work out of one checkbook   oh well umhum   and it would be very hard for me because i wouldnt have i wouldnt have any idea of how much money i was spending in one month now i have know exactly what im spending and it is so much   yeah
