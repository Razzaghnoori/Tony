 okay well i can tell you pretty much my two favorite shows okay and they kind of are in different spectrums i think um one of them s Quantum Leap and the other one is Night Court and i think i think they re real different i mean i don t think they have anything in common uh Quantum Leap has i mean Quantum Leap is kind of okay a comedy in its own way i guess but uh mostly it s it s kind of science fiction and it s um adventure and things like that um and then Night Court is just pure you know weird fun you know just um hum it s it s nothing serious about it at all so i don t know why the two of them happen to be my two favorite shows but they that s the way it is so it s funny that those are my two husband s my husband s two favorite shows too and i enjoy both watching both of them but i used to didn t like Night Court um hum and i and the only reason i think i like it now is because i ve seen it so much now i m involved with the characters but yeah i used to think um Dan Fielding was just too too vulgar and too crude for me and and i told my husband that s the whole point but i i just it s he is yeah that s right i mean i find him degrading at times and i guess that is the point but sometimes it just well they they really have changed him though if if you ve watched it this season um he s becoming i mean he still is in his own way degrading and everything but uh he s involved in that charity and uh it s taking up so much of his time and so much of his thought that he really has in fact there was one show that he even turned down a date with some you know beautiful woman just because the idea that he was his mind was on the ozone layer and you know global warming and all this other kind of stuff oh and he you know was too depressed you know to so that was part of i guess his character building or whatever but um hum i i think it adds a probably adds a little bit of depth to his character i haven t watched um which of course he needed i think uh yeah i think so which in Quantum Leap you get even though the the person is involved in so many other people s lives you still see a a real person in those situations he gets um he s doing amazing things but he s doing them within the bounds of what of normal person would do and i think that s i like that um hum right right that s that s good point so what do you what do you consider your favorite shows though um i think my favorite show is Hunter and i i like the old series series better when um okay Deedee Deedee was in there yes yeah i agree and um so uh and then the the blonde that they took out the one that got killed yeah i can t remember what her name is but uh yeah i didn t enjoy her i i she was too much of a opposite of Deedee and i think that s what they try to do but i think we wanted to see Deedee there or somebody like her um hum well but see i read an article about uh in TV Guide about uh about Hunter and about his latest you know latest you know his three girls whatever you want to call them uh huh and they say that uh that there was absolutely that there was like a a conflict between her and him uh that they never really could get her into uh any character that they could use i mean you know uh the second lady uh huh yeah yeah the second one the blonde uh you know if you think about it they didn t really interact hardly at all i mean they were never partners they didn t yeah she would go her way and he would do his and i think that s what i didn t like yeah and uh and and even even at the beginning Deedee and and Hunter and would decide that one of them would go do this while the other one would do would go this but uh it seemed like it was almost two different organizations um hum you know like like Hunter was the boss and and this other girl was not and you know you kind of you re wondering you know well when did this happen you know right so yeah i i i kind of agree with that and i like the new lady better but i d just as soon that they didn t have the romance there i d just as soon have the the police story without all the romance well i m afraid that s what they they really wanted to do um yeah i think most shows were doing that and then they went away from it and now they re starting to go back to it and maybe that s what the public wants i don t know but i just um hum i like the the cut and dry solve the mystery and that s what i always enjoyed about it yeah well see there was that spark between Deedee and Hunter for a while but they they like started it and then they d pull it back and they d start it and pull it back and that really made it a very interesting yeah uh show to where you never really knew which which one was going to show up you know whether it was going to where they re going to be real close or whether they re just going to be partners you know and that that i kind of thought was good but um um hum you know it s it i guess you know you always kind of sit there and you see these two people together and you always wonder why they don t you know get together or whatever and so i guess that s what they decide to do yeah just go ahead and quit the wondering and and yeah but it s it s always been a formula uh for TV that the minute that two people that the two main stars get married that the show ends up well you know dying yeah a a good example of this and uh you know this is uh probably well maybe it s not a good example i ve been watching Nickelodeon all last week uh because they had uh what they called Maximum Smart they had Get Smart for uh ten hours a day from seven o clock at night until six or until five o clock the next morning uh huh oh all the Get Smart episodes you could ever see well the the last day all they did was the last season to where the two of them got married and that was i mean that was the killer the series died right after that because well go ahead um hum yeah i didn t i was going to say i didn t ever watch Moonlighting but i heard that s what killed it that that uh interplay died when they got married and so the show died um hum the same thing yeah the it it it seems like you can do so much more of the subtle hints and the subtle little plays on things before they they before they get married you know the minute they get married everything s supposed to be cut and dried and um hum right and well of course another one of their mistakes i think is they have a tendency to change characters or to change the character s uh uh personalities um um well especially after they get married um halfway through yeah yeah couple of examples would be um well like i said this one about uh Max or Get Well Smart uh the female character uh Barbara Feldon um hum she had been at the beginning the the intelligent one the the one who everyone always solved the things and and figured out and kept Max from getting real messed up well toward whenever they got married she got dingy oh you know why would they do that yeah it it made no sense i i m guess it s going falling back into our traditional stereotypes which a lot of shows yeah unfortunately that s probably true yeah which kind of like in the big soap opera shows which i don t enjoy because of that um hum but well do you watch um what is that show uh Who s the Boss it s uh that s on Tuesday nights i think i ve seen it before but i don t watch it regularly usually Tuesday nights i m out so yeah the well i yeah i hardly ever watch it but uh as as i ve seen it they ve they ve done sort of the same thing to where they ve they started to let them get together and then they pulled them apart um hum and i think they re thinking about that exact thing about the idea that if the show lets them uh get together then you lose part of what the show s all about so i always thought that was kind of weird um hum yeah it s funny how we uh we we romanticize people uh like well for instance when i was a teenager you know you romance um hum romanticize a rock star but when he gets married then you don t care anymore or something like that and i think it s the same with your characters on TV hum right well do you think that s why most rock stars nowadays keep their marriages a secret or at least they keep it quiet probably yeah i know it affected me when i was younger i m not into rock stars too much lately but yeah i mean yeah now like Madonna and Sean Penn now i don t particularly like either one of them but um um hum uh their marriage was so highly publicized that there was no way that they could stay together yeah uh or at least that s the way i look at it um hum so i don t know it would have been hard wouldn t it yeah i would think so i i just the the publicity in and of itself much less the i mean when you get married you ve got relationship to develop in the first place so um hum having twenty million people watch you do that yeah it s it wouldn t be easy yeah so hum well that s kind of interesting yeah so um well i guess i guess that s about all we need to do isn t it yeah i think we ve covered our time it s been good talking to you yeah it has Becky i really appreciate it oh you re the first man i ve talked to everybody else has been a female so this is a change well i think i ve um you re the second female i ve talked to you ve had a little bit of variety huh okay well thanks so much bye bye yeah it s it s kind of nice so uh huh bye bye
