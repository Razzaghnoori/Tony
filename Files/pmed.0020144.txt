                            The development of early warning systems EWSs for epidemics of infectious diseases        based on recurrent statistical patterns in other kinds of information particularly data on        climate is an active area of research  Judging from the estimated burden of diseases        for which EWSs might be developed such systems if effective would contribute greatly to        human welfare and could potentially save many lives  According to a recent report         EWSs have two principal aims i to identify whether an epidemic will occur and ii to        predict the number of cases that will result from it For directly transmitted diseases        this second aim may be unattainable at the desired levels of precision regardless of the        quality of information        As an example in a recent report on the relationship between climate and outbreaks of        meningococcal meningitis the authors found that the timing of epidemics is highly        predictable from information on the dynamics of a seasonal weather pattern the Harmattan        winds but that the final epidemic size is not  This finding is not surprising The        characteristics of disease outbreaks particularly outbreaks of emerging diseases to which        human populations are highly susceptible prevent highly precise forecasts        The reason that precise estimates of the final epidemic size cannot be obtained can be        understood intuitively Consider the following description of a typical outbreak        Characteristically an outbreak begins with a small number of initially infectious        individuals Subsequent infectious contacts are mediated by a wide range of social        interactionscontacts within and among households and communitiesso that even individuals        that are virtually identical can differ considerably in the number of secondary infections        they cause This is a microscale cause of variation compared with macroscale        populationlevel sources of variation The important implication for EWSs is that in such        situations especially where the basic reproductive ratio of infections R is initially        very high but is rapidly reduced perhaps by publichealth interventions small deviations        in the realized number of infectious contacts are amplified resulting in relatively large        variation in the final size of the outbreak Because this variation reflects differences in        individual behavior and not macroscopic characteristics of epidemic spread it is unlikely        that climate or other data contain any information about this source of variation though        such data do contain information about macroscopic variation        A more formal explanation of this phenomenon can be formulated based on a simple model        of an epidemic in which an EWS captures all macroscopic causes of variation in the final        epidemic size but no microscopic causes Obviously an EWS cannot realistically be expected        to capture even all the macroscopic information Thus this limit to precision is a        fundamental limit and should be interpreted as a theoretical upper bound on forecast        precision The simplest case considers a disease with only two macroscopic epidemiological        characteristics an infection rate and a removal rate which may change over time as in the        case of meningococcal meningitis In particular we assume that there is no immunity in the        population and that infection and removal are independent in time This model of disease        dynamics belongs to a class of stochastic processes known as nonhomogenous birthdeath        processes which conveniently turn out to be reasonably tractable More than  years        ago Kendall  showed how models for the mean and the variance in the final epidemic size        are affected by these parameters The variance can be interpreted as a measure of the        precision with which the final epidemic size can be predicted Kendalls results can be        broken down to show that this quantity is equal to the sum of the average final epidemic        size and another quantity x minus one For most realistic epidemiological parameters        this other quantity which is related to the covariance between final epidemic size and the        size of the infected population will be much greater than one In these cases the        variance in the final epidemic size will be much greater than the average final epidemic        size itself        This fundamental limit to the precision of forecasts does not imply that EWSs cannot be        used effectively to plan a response to outbreaks Rather it suggests what expectations of        EWSs are reasonable Further since the precision with which forecasts of the final        epidemic size can be obtained will depend on many diseasespecific properties and maybe        other factors too case studies of the potential effectiveness of EWSs for different        diseases are needed These studies should exploit recent advances in modeling birthdeath        processes  to gain further understanding of the differences among diseases and of the        causes of geographic variation in the intensity of epidemics Finally notwithstanding        limits to precision the benefits to be obtained from estimates of the average final        epidemic size and the timing of epidemics alone may warrant considerable investment in        EWSs
