 Dead Head Back when I was a journalist before I became a provider of digital content I thought life would always be simple I would write articles and people would pay to read them But then I heard about the impending death of intellectual property a scenario painted by cyberfuturists John Perry Barlow and Esther Dyson As all media move online they say content will be so freely available that getting paid to produce it will be hard if not impossible At first I dismissed this as garden variety breathless overextrapolation from digerati social theorists But even as I scoffed the Barlow Dyson scenario climbed steadily toward the rank of conventional wisdom Barlow and Dyson do have a solution In the future people like me having cultivated a following by providing free content on the Web will charge our devotees for services that are hard to replicate en masse We will answer individual questions online say or go around giving speeches or spew out insights at private seminars or this one is actually my idea have sex with young readers The key writes Barlow will be not content but performance Barlow a former lyricist for the Grateful Dead offers this analogy The Dead let people tape concerts and the tapes then led more people to pay for the concerts The seminal version of the Barlow Dyson thesis is Barlow s 10 000 word 1994 essay in Wired It is with some trepidation that I challenge the logic of this argument Barlow is a noted visionary and he is famously derisive of people less insightful than himself a group which in his opinion includes roughly everyone He says for example that the ability of courts to deal correctly with cyberissues depends on the depth of the presiding judge s clue impairment Well at the risk of joining Barlow s long roster of the clue impaired here goes Barlow s argument begins with a cosmic premise Digital technology is detaching information from the physical plane where property law of all sorts has always found definition This is wrong on two counts First all information does take physical form Whether digital or analog whether in ink or sound waves or synaptic firings or electrons information always resides in patterns of matter or energy which as Einstein noted are interchangeable manifestations of the physical world To be sure the significance of information is independent of its particular physical incarnation So is its value You download this article from Slate s servers and copy it onto your own hard disk and it s still worth well nothing but that s a Suppose it were a Madonna video You d get just as much enjoyment out of it regardless of which particular bunch of electrons embodied it B ut this independence of meaning and value from physical incarnation is nothing new It is as old as Sumerian tablets to say nothing of the Gutenberg press Indeed the whole reason intellectual property law exists is that people can acquire your information without acquiring the particular physical version of it that you created Thus Barlow s belief that property law of all sorts has always found definition on the physical plane signals a distressing confusion on his part The one sense in which it s true that information is detached from the physical plane the fact that information s value transcends its physical incarnation not only fails to qualify as an original insight and not only fails to make intellectual property rights obsolete it s the very insight that led to intellectual property rights in the first place Barlow announces from the mountaintop It s fairly paradigm warping to look at information through fresh eyes to see how very little it is like pig iron or pork bellies Maybe so but it s hard to say for sure since the people who really did take that fresh look have been dead for centuries If you somehow forced Barlow to articulate his thesis without the wacky metaphysics he d probably say something like this The cost of copying and distributing information is plummeting for many purposes even approaching zero Millions of people can now do it right at their desks So in principle content can multiply like fruit flies Why should anyone buy an article when a copy can be had for nothing Answer Because it can t The total cost of acquiring a free copy includes more than just the copying and transmitting costs There s 1 the cost in time and or money of finding someone who already has a copy and will give it to you for free or for cheap 2 the risk of getting caught stealing intellectual property 3 any premiums you pay to others for incurring such risks as when you get copies from bootleggers and 4 informal punishments such as being labeled a cheat or a cheapskate The size of this last cost will depend on how norms in this area evolve Even in the distant future the total cost of cheating on the system thus figured will almost never be zero Yes it will be way way closer to zero than it used to be But the Barlow Dyson scenario still is wrong Why Because whether people cheat doesn t depend on the absolute cost of cheating It depends on the cost of cheating compared with the cost of not cheating And the cost of getting data legally will plummet roughly as fast as the cost of getting it illegally maybe faster In their writings Barlow and Dyson make clear they re aware of this fact But they seems unaware of its fatal impact on their larger thesis How could cybersages have such a blind spot One theory Because they re cyber sages You have to be a career paleohack like me getting paid for putting ink on paper to appreciate how much of the cost of legally acquiring bits of information goes into the ink and paper and allied anachronisms like shipping warehousing and displaying the inky paper I wrote a book that costs 14 in paperback For each copy sold I get 1 The day may well come as Barlow and Dyson seem to believe when book publishers as we know them will disappear People will download books from Web sites and either print them out on new cool printers or read them on superlight wireless computers But if so it will then cost you only 1 oh hell make it 1 25 to get a copy of my book legally from my Web site Now imagine being at my Web site reading my promotional materials and deciding you d like to read the book Thank you A single keystroke will give you the book drain your bank account of five shiny quarters and leave you feeling like an honest upstanding citizen Do you think you ll choose instead to call a few friends in hopes of scoring an illegal copy And don t imagine that you can just traipse on over to the black market book store section of the Web and find a hot copy of my book As in the regular world the easier it is for Joe Consumer to track down an illegal distributor the easier it is for cops to do the same Black marketeers will have to charge enough to make up for this risk making it hard to undersell my 1 25 by much And there are too why the cost of cheating will be nontrivial M eanwhile on the other side of the ledger there s another reason for the cost of legal copies to drop Many journalists will reach a much larger audience on the Web than they do now The magazine model of bringing information to the attention of readers is stunningly inefficient I hope it s not egotistical of me to think that when I write an article for say the New Republic I am not reaching nearly everyone who might have an interest in it Granted the Web is not yet a picture of efficiency itself Search engines for example are in the reptilian phase of their evolution But most observers certainly the Barlows of the world expect radical improvement I m not saying all journalists will see their audiences grow The likely trend when you will be for many obscure and semiobscure journalists to see their audiences grow while the few rich and famous journalists will see their audiences shrink Cool One much discussed cybertrend is especially relevant here the scenario in which various data brokers offer a Daily Me a batch of articles tailored to your tastes cheaply gleaned from all over the Web When this happens guys like me will be living the life of Riley We will wake up at noon stumble over to the keyboard in our pajamas hammer out 1 000 words and then without talking to a single bothersome editor make our work available to all data brokers Likely fans of my article will be shown say the first couple of paragraphs If they want to read more they deposit a quarter Will you try to steal a copy instead Do you steal Tootsie pops at checkout counters The broker and the electronic cash service will pocket a dime of that I take my 15 cents and head for the liquor store Of course this disaggregation of content may be ruinous for magazines like Slate But consider the upside Not only will the efficiency of the system permit rock bottom pricing that discourages cheating but the fluidity of content will disrupt channels of potential cheating If you subscribe to a regular old fashioned online magazine it s easy to split the cost of a subscription with a few friends and furtively make copies You wretched scum But if you subscribe to the Daily Me this arrangement makes no sense because every Me is different Sure you may e mail a friend the occasional article from your Me You wretched scum And in general this sort of leakage will be higher than in pre Web days But it would have to reach massive proportions to negate the overall gains in efficiency that will keep people like me in business This argument like all arguments about the future is speculative It may even be wrong But it is consistent with the history of the world The last half millennium has seen 1 data getting cheaper and easier to copy and 2 data creation occupying a larger and larger fraction of all economic activity Thus far in other words as the realm of information has gotten more lubricated it has become easier not harder to make a living by generating information Cyberspace is essentially a quantum leap in lubrication Barlow s insistence that intellectual property will soon be worthless is especially puzzling since he is one of the biggest troubadours of the Third Wave information economy Sometimes he seem to think it s possible for a sector of a market economy to get bigger and bigger even while the connection between work and reward in that sector breaks down He writes Humanity now seems bent on creating a world economy primarily based on goods that take no material form In doing so we may be eliminating any predictable connection between creators and a fair reward for the utility or pleasure others may find in their works Far out man
