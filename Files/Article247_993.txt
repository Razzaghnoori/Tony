 Clearing the Table of Yesterday s Crumbs Andrew You have a sly way of encoding your political slant in statements you then present as our shared views Very clever Thus just to clear this morning s table of yesterday s old toast crumbs I don t share your view of President Clinton as you breezily conclude if by that you mean your view that the President is close to evil uniquely immoral and irresponsible worse than Reagan or Bush whose hostility to gays and gelid indifference to AIDS I note don t seem to bother you as much as Clinton s fine words that butter no parsnips I also protest reverse racial discrimination as a way to characterize affirmative action which as I guess you know I support So really we don t have the same view of President Clinton we both dislike him but for different reasons I also don t want to leave our May Day thread without challenging your equation of Communists and Nazis Yes in some ways Stalin was as murderous as Hitler certainly to a Spanish anarchist and many ordinary citizens caught in their regimes they were equally bad news As my ultra leftist friend Jeff says when we speak of fascism we must not forget to include Red fascism But when you wonder why in this country a demonstration of communists is regarded more indulgently or as I would say with less alarm than one of fascists would be I think you are forgetting the very different domestic roles of these two political strains In this country the legacy of American Communists includes some good things opposition to segregation and racism for example going way back to the 30s The Old Left was very important in the civil rights movement which now even the far right concedes was a Good Thing but which at the time it bitterly opposed The Old Left stood for things that benefited lots of people and that lots of people who were quite anti communist also supported the New Deal unions the safety net civil liberties even just a little women s rights Note I m not saying all these things were without their complications or downsides or that there wasn t an element of self interest or calculation involved in the CP s advocacy of free speech for example which didn t extend to Trotskyists whom the CP was glad to see investigated by the govt in the late 40s I think it was I m just saying that the Old Left was active in a lot of very mainstream social causes often on what everyone now agrees was the right side But I can t think off hand of any great contributions to our polity made by members of the American Nazi party the German Bund the Ku Klux Klan or other fans of Hitler Can you Cheers Katha ps Just got your Vatican post More soon
