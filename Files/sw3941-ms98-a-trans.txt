                 okay you think health benefits probably the the most important   yes for because most people are aging getting older and the benefits uh the benefits are going up i mean the price is going up   thats true that   everything seems to go up   that thats the case or the problem i have im getting older and uh the wife and uh we use the doctors more have um more health problems and that is a very important benefit that uh   yeah see here where well here where i live all the benefits have been going up lately up on health and there are hospitals that have we have a one cent tax and then   what umhum   now Bush is coming up with this health plan so i dont know much much about it then   no ive i havent really studied that too much but uh that is one of the benefits that uh that i feel that uh is real good with uh the company i work for so far but uh it its uh you know whats gonna happen their costs keep going up as you say and its uh it could wipe a a family out or uh all your savings and everything one one serious illness   yes yeah one illness will do it   i think thats uh one of the benefits that we really need to our companies need really need to take a look at because theres so many Americans that are not covered at all thats uh quite a situation i think the other thing uh security and that thats getting pretty tough now a a a job with security   yes   uh especially if youre in uh department of defense or youre in the auto industry been working for fifteen or twenty years and all of a sudden uh because of changes in Europe this uh holidays holidays so many people are losing their jobs and uh i dont know how you can as as a benefit how you could have have security as one but most people like to have that security in their jobs   yeah i would i would think so well thats one of the main main i would think one of the main securities that you would need is health benefit   umhum ill say yeah it really is and uh its uh you really feel sorry for those who dont have it or they have a uh cancer or something real serious that uh could runs up their uh transplant heart transplant or something runs up into uh um  hundreds of thousands of dollars   yes   that could wipe you out in a hurry   well we i have my sister died and she had some benefits that helped through her well they had her hooked up and everything but that helped her helped us through it   good good good a good thing that uh they she had those i think theres other uh well theres other benefits that uh kind of or look at i guess uh need a vacation once in a while most jobs do that   really   uh give you some time off and uh thats something that uh each companys a little different on that but most of them are pretty good on those uh those type of benefits i think   umhum just just with the benefits going up its just theres not a whole lot you can do about it really   no there isnt and another one i think is uh quite important of course is retirement system that they they have   yes   and uh with social security and uh the way it is if thats all you got is social security by then   youre not gonna make it very far   right by the time i get up there uh in a few years and uh draw social security with the cost of living uh that benefit is just really not gonna help very much   no i dont think that would       uh the older the older you probably you would probably need more help   umhum   because you know a lot of elderly most of the elderly people dont have the money and the ones that do well they have insurance so   no umhum yeah   its its just a i think it they need to extend them because were were paying here a lot   umhum yes   and i think the elderly needs it more than anything     thats true and uh it seems like it goes up every year you have no control over the the cost to you and that just takes away your buying power also and uh the company of course i can see the companys side uh too because uh they have to pay uh an a proportion of whatever the the health cost is and it gets to the point where uh theyre not uh making money and uh   yeah   it uh i dont wanna see us to go socialized medicine like they are in England or places like that   no   but still uh i i hope that this plan that uh the Presidents come up with uh is gonna help all those or help some way bottom line though whos gonna pay for it   really have they got it have they already signed that or thats not signed yet is it   no no he he just uh proposed it and uh the republicans are saying hey its a great plan the democrats say its no good so     well they
