                do you have any   im trying to think off hand i cant think of anything you know   i have i have one its its and its a real pet peeve of mine it seems i i do work during the day and when im home uh you know im either cooking or running doing things or uh laundry or stuff and i hate when the phone rings   okay   uhhuh      and it turns out to be a telephone salesman   oh   and its real two therere two pet peeves about it number one i really feel that thats my private you know my own home   uhhuh   and i hate and if i want something i will get it i will go out and get it myself and i will never i never buy anything from a telephone salesperson   umhum oh i wouldnt either no   so i really feel that it is a real invasion theyre invading my time and my space by uh you know interfering in whatever im doing for and i it really bothers me   uhhuh uhhuh   um its a little bit like junk mail but except you cant you know ignore it uh quite as easily and i i try to be polite but at the same point   yeah   that doesnt always work   well i just say thank you very much for calling but im not interested and then i hang up before they can say anything   oh really   yes and it works very well  because you dont hear you dont have they can say anything they want its just but i just feel thats my big thing on the invasion of my thing on invasion of privacy   oh oh umhum   and um i have i sort of have a thought like you can prevent yourself from getting junk mail by getting yourself off of mailing lists i wish that there were a way that you could um get your telephone you know submit your telephone number to the phone company and have a penalty for anyone who calls you to sell things from a business   umhum well how do you get your name off the junk mailing list   uh you you you you do that by uh um the postal service has some information which you fill out and they send its for every company i mean you cant do it for any company   uhhuh   you know but you can then send it and they can prove they tell that companys not allowed to sent it you any junk mail if you get junk mail on a regular basis from any particular company you can   oh really oh i didnt even know that   yeah yeah you have to go to the post office and ask them for the form that you fill out to not to get you know junk mail from specific companies   oh wow   and i wish there were something like that where you can call the telephone company and you could say that uh have your name your number put in a registry and then anyone making these calls has to check that registry for that area   yeah umhum   and could not should and is not allowed under penalty of you know being reported or something to call you      yeah   so that would be one way of doing it   i cant really think of anything that invades my privacy but one of my pet peeves you came up with the telephone is when you have an answering machine and they hang up before they leave a message   umhum   i cant stand that       i think that is so stupid you know because   oh im guilty of that sometimes because ive called and there really wasnt any significant message and i and i wasnt going to be available to be called back   uhhuh   and it was sort of like oh the hell im not going to spend the time giving and leaving a message and uh ill call later  if im available the other thing that um that there is recourse to and thats another thing is     yeah   when you you use your credit card and then they ask for a telephone number   uhhuh   well legally legally now theyre not allowed theyre not you do not have to give a telephone number   oh really   yes and i dont really like announcing in public   uhhuh   you know when youre sitting there my telephone and i dont like the the the way telephone numbers can be used we once had a situation where someone was using a credit card number of ours and he actually had our phone number but it turned out it had to been my husbands office phone number   umhum   and uh we were able we werent actually able to trace it but we were able to to discard the charges um but it was   umhum i dont like how they ask the i i realize that this is your identification but i worked with someone that got hold of his charge cards and his social security number   umhum umhum yeah same with my husband it was a charge card and social security number   and you know i dont i dont like i dont get ever get anything over the phone because i dont want to give my social security number out   well you should never give the social security number uh if sometimes if you charge sometimes i charge theater tickets   umhum   over the phone and then you know because they pick them up at the box office will call but um thats the only thing i would ever have ever used it for the phone and that was because i initiated it   yes   uh and occasionally i do order things from catalogs   umhum   over the phone but again its i initiate it not the company the other thing is though you do not have to if youre buying something in a store and they ask and you pay for it by charge and they ask you for your telephone number you do not have to give it that is one thats a law that went into effect i dont know a year or two ago   oh i never even knew that   and uh you can just say im sorry that you uh im not required to give that by law and then they wont uh a lot of stores will still ask   umhum   but uh the credit card company you know accepts the charges i mean its a responsibility the credit cards company uh companys responsibility   umhum well is there any like pet peeves that you have that dont necessarily invade your privacy   so what and this um well this it would this is limited to the privacy issue the invasion of privacy   oh okay   yeah and i guess uh that was my thats probably my biggest one in terms of invasion of privacy for people outside the family of course ive got little pet peeves you know with my family       you you know but of course that that i guess that just comes with the uh with the territory with a family that does a mother you lose some privacy       i really cant think of any that would invade my privacy   but uh umhum nothing that you felt that you know any experiences youve had at work   you know hm no i you know other i i really cant say anything that would really bother me   so many things i think over the years have been um accepted i mean when you uh that are no longer done   umhum   i mean i can remember when i was very young much younger and i applied for a job they said well dont arent you planning to have children well i mean thats none of their business   yeah   and but of course now by law they cant ask that   yeah   so i mean there has been i think a lot to done to protect privacy   yeah especially between women and you know like age and all that stuff   how do you feel   you know with sex you know your sex with you know   umhum   theyve theyve gotten a lot with uh applications and stuff and theyre not allowed to ask   yeah thats right do you feel that drug testing is an invasion of privacy   no because i think its for the better of like it you mean like for working and stuff   or AIDS testing yeah umhum   no i dont because i think whenever and something like that theyre looking out for everyone theyre not you know i think its more safety than anything else   yeah i feel that way too i sometimes feel that you know sometimes individual rights including the right to privacy have to be sacrificed for a greater benefit   yeah because i know   you know for example  airline pilots i mean i do want my pilot to be sober     yeah because i know i worked at a still mill in this summer and i know that um ive covered for people that came in drunk you know on the late shift or something   uhhuh yeah yeah   and it and its dangerous i dont even like having them around i kind of do their work for them because they make it more hazardous than what it is without them you know   thats right yeah i know i yeah i feel you know i think some of the people that oppose you know mandatory drug testing for certain areas say well its not
