 Louis Louis Attorney General Janet Reno s refusal to appoint an independent counsel to investigate Clinton Gore or Hazel O Leary over the objections of FBI Director Louis Freeh was Topic 1 on the weekend shows Having unanimously predicted last week that Reno wouldn t appoint an independent counsel the commentarians briefly reiterated their positions On the attack Paul Gigot NewsHour With Jim Lehrer and Pat Buchanan The McLaughlin Group claimed that Reno presides over a politicized Justice Department that had changed her mind on appointing a counsel Fred Barnes The McLaughlin Group Defending Reno s decision was Margaret Carlson Capital Gang who said independent counsels are not independent because they re appointed by a partisan panel The pundits then moved on to this week s fresh meat Freeh Videotapes of Clinton press secretary Mike McCurry s icy comments about the rebellious Freeh were repeatedly unspooled The president s unveiled message to Freeh Don t let the door hit you on the way out Gwen Ifill Washington Week in Review Louie Freeh all of a sudden became free Louie said David Shribman Washington Week in Review who predicted that the director would leave the FBI in two months So outrageous was Freeh s dis of the president and the attorney general that Clinton ought to fire him said Jack Germond Meet the Press While the pundits simultaneously applauded Freeh s integrity as a prosecutor judge and now FBI director they insinuated that he had tilted against Reno to shore up his reputation with Republicans on Capitol Hill who still resent him for his handling of Filegate Ruby Ridge and the FBI crime lab snafu Shribman Eleanor Clift The McLaughlin Group Mara Liasson Washington Week in Review Mark Shields NewsHour Jane Mayer Washington Week in Review exonerated Freeh from the charges of gross politicking saying that his real campaign is to protect the FBI from criticism Brit Hume Fox News Sunday posited a wily Freeh who had deliberately written his memo in support of an independent counsel knowing that it would be leaked and or subpoenaed The pundits repeatedly denigrated Reno Evidence of their low regard for her Nobody hissed when Hume said she is not the sharpest knife in the drawer or the brightest bulb on the circuit Damning her with faint praise Steve Roberts Late Edition called Reno the least political figure in this town Tony Blankley Late Edition compared her to Capt Queeg in The Caine Mutiny obsessed with micro legal matters while neglecting macro legal matters Riffing off a recent New Yorker article which reported that Clinton administration officials refer to her as the Martian Shribman said now she s the administration s favorite Martian Gigot top cheerleader for an independent counsel confessed that he couldn t explain the Republicans mellow response to Reno s decision His befuddlement was enough to 1 make you think you had finally met an honest pundit or 2 make you reach for the channel changer The weekend s final consensus was that Reno and Freeh and the White House would all clash again but that an independent counsel would be appointed to investigate Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt and the investigation would come back to haunt Clinton and Gore because independent counsel investigations spread like cancer Hume Also Reno will survive As Mayer quoted a source as saying She s the perfect firewall because nobody can say that she s in the tank for Bill Clinton Issue 2 Latrell Sprewell s assault on and death threat against his coach moved across the shows like a fast break But because everybody was playing offense all condemned the assault nobody scored Inexplicably none of the pundits proposed the Solomonic principle of prosecuting Sprewell on criminal assault charges instead of suspending him for a year If a jury sends him to jail consider that his long term suspension If they find him innocent let him play again if any team will have him Rep Dick Gephardt s future of the Democrats speech at Harvard was Issue 3 The Democratic pundits sparred over Gephardt s intention Al Hunt Capital Gang said Gephardt was energizing the liberals for the 1998 contests Carlson called the speech a letter to Al Gore and Susan Page Late Edition backed Carlson calling it a broadside against Clinton The speech was bad politics ruled George Stephanopoulos This Week who has worked for both Clinton and Gephardt because it didn t give the president any credit President Clinton received low marks for his race round table in Akron Ohio Issue 4 especially for abruptly switching talk show styles from Oprah to Sam Donaldson Sam Donaldson This Week in order to bully author Abigail Thernstrom If the president wants a debate about affirmative action he can t just throw in a question at the end of the session He s got to structure it said Liasson Page noted that real dialogue about race in America is precipitated by presidential leadership Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson framed the race debate by integrating the armed services and passing the Civil Rights Act not by asking questions Pissy Fit at This Week ABC s This Week contributed not one word to the independent counsel decision the only show to hold its fire on the issue Were Sam Cokie and George demonstrating their superior news judgment or staging a pissy fit Halfway through the program and apropos of nothing host Donaldson explained that Reno had been invited to appear on the show but had set conditions that the show was not able to meet Reno didn t seem to receive any special treatment on Face the Nation where she appeared Sunday Reno didn t even rate a mention in This Week s closing round table Pundit Central demands an independent counsel investigation of this pundit malfeasance Jack Shafer
