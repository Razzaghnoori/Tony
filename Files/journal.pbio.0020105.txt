                            In the wake of declarations supporting open access to research literature from        international bodies including the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development        OECD and the United Nations World Summit on the Information Society WSIS advocates        and critics of the movement appear to have agreed that the issue warrants a robust ongoing        dialoguea development undoubtedly in the interest of the scientific community regardless        of its ultimate outcome        To the extent that listserv messages editorials and conference presentations are        representative of more widespread reactions to the debate there appear to be a number of        common misconceptions about what open access is and what problems it can or cannot solve        Over the next few months in         PLoS Biology  we plan to explore the more pervasive of these        misunderstandings in an effort to expose the real challenges that need to be overcome and        to identify some possible solutions Here we address the first of thesethe perception that        the publicationcharge model puts an unfair burden on authors Subsequently we will        address concerns about the longterm economic viability of the openaccess model the        integrity and quality of work published in openaccess journals and the effect that open        access will have on scholarly societies                    Publication ChargesNothing New        By charging authors a fee to have their work published in lieu of charging readers to        access articles openaccess publishers such as the Public Library of Science PLoS and        BioMed Central BMC have transformed the traditional publishing system This reliance on a        seemingly untested revenue stream has generated skepticism that authors will be both        willing and able to pay publication charges        Publication fees are not a phenomenon born of the openaccess movement Many authors        regularly pay several thousands of dollars in page charges color charges correction        costs reprint costs and other fees to their publisher even when such costs are entirely        voluntary In the         EMBO Journal  for example authors are allowed six pages of text free        but are then charged  per page beyond that A review of recent issues shows that almost        all authors exceed six pages voluntarily paying on average over  to publish their        articles        Furthermore in addition to paying other publication charges authors may be willing to        pay extra for their articles to be made open access as several publishers have recently        recognized A recent survey of authors in the         Proceedings of National Academy of Science         PNAS  found that although         PNAS already makes its content freely available after six months nearly         of         PNAS authors expressed a willingness to pay an openaccess surcharge of         or more to make their papers available for free online immediately upon        publicationthis above and beyond the  in page charges that the average         PNAS author already pays Cozzarelli et al         Although we recognize that authors who submit to         PLoS Biology may well be a selfselected group of enthusiastic        openaccess supporters we have found that nearly  of those who submit manuscripts do        not request a fee waiver and the few who do still offer to pay some portion of the        fee        The concern about authors ability to pay publication charges will become less pressing        as governments funding organizations and institutions increasingly support openaccess        publication on their researchers behalf More funding agencies are joining the Howard        Hughes Medical Institute the Wellcome Trust and others who have already designated funds        for openaccess publication For more information about these funders announcements and        other international policy statements relevant to open access see        httpwwwplosorgopenaccess        Universities too are supporting open access directly by setting aside funds for        openaccess publication through institutional memberships with BMC and PLoS or through        discretionary funds that faculty can tap into to pay publication charges Such approaches        reduce authors reliance on individual grants to support charges directly and ensure equal        access to publishing options that require such payments                    The Disenfranchised        Even with the steady increase in sources to pay publication fees detractors claim that        openaccess publishing may lead to a situation in which some authors are simply unable to        publish their work due to lack of funds The response to this concern is that the ability        of authors to pay publication charges must never be a consideration in the decision to        publish their papers To ensure that this happens PLoS has a firewall in place such that        neither the editors nor the reviewers know which authors have indicated whether or not they        can pay Because all work judged worthy of publication by peer review should be published        any openaccess business model should be designed to account for fee waivers just as        publishers have always absorbed some authors inability to pay page and color charges PLoS        grants full or partial publicationcharge waivers to any author who requests them no        questions asked        In part the savings to institutions hospitals nongovernmental organizations and        universities provided by openaccess publications could help to establish funds for        researchers who are less well supported In the developing world as free online access to        scientific literature is increasingly seen as a political imperative organizations such as        the World Health Organization the Oxfordbased International Network for the Availability        of Scientific Publications and Brazils SciELO are likely to become more willing to pay        openaccess publication charges for authors who cannot afford them The Open Society        Institute OSI already pays such costs for universities and other organizations in a        number of countries in which the foundation is active by way of a PLoS Institutional        Membership that grants waived publication charges to authors while providing compensatory        revenue for PLoS        Perhaps the real misconception about the unfair burden that open access places on        authors resides in the terminologythe term author charge is itself misleading        Publication fees are not borne purely by authors but are shared by the many organizations        whose missions depend on the broadest possible dissemination and communication of        scientific discoveries Some of those may provide funding for openaccess publication as        intermediaries between authors and journals as OSI does Othersincluding many        governmentfinanced funding agenciesdo so directly through their research grants to        scientists In both cases funding open access is an effective way to fulfill mandates for        public access to and accountability over scientific research and to ensure that all worthy        research is published
