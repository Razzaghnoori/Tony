                okay Ray what do you think about taxes   okay um too high obviously   umhum yeah i agree   but my property taxes have been going up repeatedly uh over the last uh well this is going to be the seventh year in a row that theyve increased   oh really   so um and theyre always saying if you know if they dont raise taxes then theyre going to have to lay off on uh the teachers theyre going to have to lay of uh firemen theyre going to have to lay off the police officers   humum   but yet they dont talk anything about the administration about cutting back on that end of it   umhum   they just theyve theyre in the middle of an expose now on the state and the City of Providence uh public works departments   uhhuh yeah   and theyve had TV cameras going around uh they wait at some of the yards and they follow the trucks as they come out uh at random   yeah   just to see what they do during the course of the day   uhhuh   and theres not much thats going on ill tell you i mean theyre going to gin mills and and spending half a day in there drinking or theyre going to other peoples homes and doing work     oh so youve got you have you have a little graft and corruption huh   uh i think thats in any city or town i dont think theres any that are free from graft and corruption   yeah   uh if they could eliminate something like that   um yeah you know the waste you know thats i think uh   yeah   i i think thats a big problem uh uh i dont do you think you get some good services for your taxes do you have a good school district do you have   um i thought we always did i grew up in a town it was its a small town   umhum yeah   its in Rhode Island actually i live in Rhode Island i work in Massachusetts   umhum   um but about uh six seven months ago they had a breakdown of all school systems and how many children actually once they once they get into the school system how many actually graduate   umhum   and i was kind of shocked at the amount of dropout in our town   yeah around fifty percent   uh not quite but it was up there it was the forty percentile range   yeah yeah thats thats pretty much i think nationwide its you know the average is about seventy five percent uh complete school you know twenty five percent dropout rate throughout the country   yeah thats   for school districts im not sure how they figure that out if they do per pupil or if they look at just averages per school district and things like that but some schools i i dont know see i i live in a small community  and um we dont pay much in taxes i dont uh this sets this is a farming community and the farmers control your property taxes basically and and in a sense you services we have uh probably whats considered the third worst maybe the fourth worst school district in uh in the in the state other than the city of Baltimore itself probably you know which is always i guess a low is a low streak so actually i think for the return on my taxes for my for my my uh state taxes that go to my school district and my services or whatever i think i get a pretty good return   yeah   but my employment tax you know the federal i dont think i get a good federal return at all i think locally i think property taxes on my house were twelve hundred dollars and that was that included state and local taxes so that was school district and snow plowing which isnt probably anything like that you have and that included my water and sewer um but i didnt think that was too bad   umhum yeah  mine are right now theyre two thousand dollars just a little over two thousand   uhhuh do you own a lot of property just a or a small lot   no uh a third of an acre   umhum   and uh its a colonial house that we have its a saltbox its uh twelve years old   yeah umhum yeah   the uh plus the plus the personal property tax we get taxed on our automobiles   oh do you   yeah   see we dont do that   and then the the town also has a fire tax   umhum   so we get a fire tax added to   the uh everything on top of that   yep and its the bulk of its going for the school system   yeah see i i yeah   but we had uh when i when i got out of school i i went up and i worked in a in a missile plant up in uh Buffalo   umhum     and up there they had like all our fire departments were volunteers   right yeah   they had uh the best of equipment and and the best of training a and it didnt really   you mean you have a fulltime fire department   no fulltime   is that what you have now though in your town   yes yes weve got all fulltime fire departments   oh how many about how my goodness see thats see thats down here um  being a member of we have we have a couple fulltime firemen but basically you know they well train the guys and they run the show and they live in the firehouse and you know and then most everybody else is volunteer   oh okay and then you have call yeah   so theres like a core of like each station has like two or four fulltime then everybody else is a volunteer   yeah we got volunteer i mean uh we used to have volunteer up here   yeah   and now theyre all paid   um   which is you know i dont know we can theres a lot of things that can be done because federal taxes are out of sight because of   yeah oh that just federal taxes just more and more and more and less and less services you know   thats it they just keep   umhum   they dont cut anything   right   and it just feeds on itself and i dont think theres anything that anyone ca n do anymore   umhum   its just grown to such proportions   yeah such its just out of hand i agree you know the the whole idea like around here um you know after Desert Storm or whatever we have a plant here that feeds one of the military contracts that should be cut you know that they advised on cutting   oh yeah   but because of Desert Storm now they said well we cant cut it so they put it back in action now granted everybody around here was happy because it keeps two or three hundred people employed   yeah   but you know if we dont cut some of these nationwide you know some of these expenses just have to be cut if we dont need such a large army and we dont need if the military comes out and says we dont need all these planes then why does Congress say tough take them anyway you know   well its like the the tanks now everyones after the tanks theyre the you know like the the Mach One is it the Mach One Abrams   yeah   um i dont know how much it costs lets lets round figure just say a million dollars now for a million dollars you can produce probably a thousand handheld antitank weapons   right   rockets   umhum   and you give them to a thousand peasants you dont even have to train them   right   and out of one of those thousands one of them is going to hit now you take out a million dollar tank with a with a you know   with a one thousand dollar antitank weapon   right but theyre but theyre still going with the with the mechanized  its like the its like the old days when they had the cavalry they didnt want to give up their horses to go for Jeeps or whatever they were doing then   yeah   and you know a million dollars do you know how many people that would feed and clothe and get off the welfare rolls and get and keep in school and you know if we  uh i just     right yep and   in some ways i just dont   you talk to them and you talk to like the big aircraft companies and all they say well if they didnt spend the money and they didnt then theyre overruns and if didnt cost a hundred dollars for a hammer uh you would put a lot of people out of work   umhum   but those people you put out of work you could you could rechannel their energies into making a rapid transit system in this country   thats right oh i agree with you a hundred percent you know our direction has really you know solar energy uh you know theres been some recent great discoveries in solar energy surprisingly because theres theres no money invested in it   thats right no um in fact in fact TI just announced some breakthroughs in solar energy   yeah a big thing uhhuh yeah   you know some flex   a flexible solar material that it can be woven over top of something it could be it could be put on the top of airplanes to help power the plane   yep yep yep   you know it uh it just it could be put on the top of automobiles to   its being channeled into special action groups by special action groups and they just keep the taxes keep going   right uh they just keep yeah it that just   just for those just for those groups and weve got like the the uh Groton Connecticut   umhum   where they make the subs   yeah   and weve got a division in uh in uh Quansett that does it that does the same thing so when they announced the contract up here for that latest   humum   uh sub i guess uh Newport News said they were going to sue the government because of you know blah blah this and blah blah that whatever it was but its generating jobs up here for us but its really its really not if you look at the whole you know its generating jobs for a few people   umhum   if they channeled their energies if they go back to like when Roosevelt put put in the C C C camps and they built border ways for the reservoirs and you know highways and bridges and yeah um   right   and highways see thats a big problem we have um im originally from Pennsylvania and the biggest problem we have in Pennsylvania is that almost every bridge   oh okay   that in Pennsylvania was built during the Eisenhower administration uh within was in the City of Pittsburgh   is that right   and there are yeah because see they Eisenhower put through money for uh though it probably didnt affect Boston it went the uh a highway from New Jersey west   was it was it funded by by special bonds or   im not sure what it was but it was uh Eisenhower i guess thought that you should be able to move tanks across the country
