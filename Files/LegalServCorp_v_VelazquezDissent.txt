 SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Nos 99 603 and 99 960 LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION PETITIONER 99 603 v CARMEN VELAZQUEZ ET AL UNITED STATES PETITIONER 99 960 v CARMEN VELAZQUEZ ET AL ON WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT February 28 2001 JUSTICE SCALIA with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE JUSTICE O CONNOR and JUSTICE THOMAS join dissenting Section 504 a 16 of the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 Appropriations Act defines the scope of a federal spending program It does not directly regulate speech and it neither establishes a public forum nor discriminates on the basis of viewpoint The Court agrees with all this yet applies a novel and unsupportable interpretation of our public forum precedents to declare 504 a 16 facially unconstitutional This holding not only has no foundation in our jurisprudence it is flatly contradicted by a recent decision that is on all fours with the present case Having found the limitation upon the spending program unconstitutional the Court then declines to consider the question of severability allowing a judgment to stand that lets the program go forward under a version of the statute Congress never enacted I respectfully dissent from both aspects of the judgment I The Legal Services Corporation Act of 1974 LSC Act 42 U S C 2996 et seq is a federal subsidy program the stated purpose of which is to provid e financial support for legal assistance in noncriminal proceedings or matters to persons financially unable to afford legal assistance 2996b a Congress recognizing that the program could not serve its purpose unless it was kept free from the influence of or use by it of political pressures 2996 5 has from the program s inception tightly regulated the use of its funds See ante at 3 No Legal Services Corporation LSC funds may be used for example for encouraging labor or antilabor activities 2996f b 6 for litigation relating to the desegregation of any elementary or secondary school or school system 2996f b 9 or for litigation which seeks to procure a nontherapeutic abortion 2996f b 8 Congress discovered through experience however that these restrictions did not exhaust the politically controversial uses to which LSC funds could be put Accordingly in 1996 Congress added new restrictions to the LSC Act and strengthened existing restrictions Among the new restrictions is the one at issue here Section 504 a 16 of the Appropriations Act 110 Stat 1321 55 to 1321 56 withholds LSC funds from every entity that participates in any way in litigation lobbying or rulemaking involving an effort to reform a Federal or State welfare system It thus bans LSC funded entities from participating on either side of litigation involving such statutes from participating in rulemaking relating to the implementation of such legislation and from lobbying Congress itself regarding any proposed changes to such legislation See 45 CFR 1639 3 2000 The restrictions relating to rulemaking and lobbying are superfluous they duplicate general prohibitions on the use of LSC funds for those activities found elsewhere in the Appropriations Act See 504 a 2 3 4 The restriction on litigation however is unique and it contains a proviso specifying what the restriction does not cover Funding recipients may represen t an individual eligible client who is seeking specific relief from a welfare agency if such relief does not involve an effort to amend or otherwise challenge existing law in effect on the date of the initiation of the representation The LSC declares in its brief and respondents do not deny that under these provisions the LSC can sponsor neither challenges to nor defenses of existing welfare reform law Brief for Petitioner in No 99 603 p 29 The litigation ban is symmetrical Litigants challenging the covered statutes or regulations do not receive LSC funding and neither do litigants defending those laws against challenge If a suit for benefits raises a claim outside the scope of the LSC program the LSC funded lawyer may not participate in the suit As the Court explains if LSC funded lawyers anticipate that a forbidden claim will arise in a prospective client s suit they may not undertake the representation ante at 9 Likewise if a forbidden claim arises unexpectedly at trial LSC funded attorney s must cease the representation at once ante at 10 See also Brief for Petitioner in No 99 603 at 7 n 4 if the issue arises at trial the lawyer should discontinue the representation consistent with the applicable rules of professional responsibility The lawyers may however and indeed must explain to the client why they cannot represent him See 164 F 3d 757 765 CA2 1999 They are also free to express their views of the legality of the welfare law to the client and they may refer the client to another attorney who can accept the representation ibid See 985 F Supp 323 335 336 EDNY 1997 II The LSC Act is a federal subsidy program not a federal regulatory program and t here is a basic difference between the two Maher v Roe 432 U S 464 475 1977 Regulations directly restrict speech subsidies do not Subsidies it is true may indirectly abridge speech but only if the funding scheme is manipulated to have a coercive effect on those who do not hold the subsidized position National Endowment for Arts v Finley 524 U S 569 587 1998 quoting Arkansas Writers Project Inc v Ragland 481 U S 221 237 1987 SCALIA J dissenting Proving unconstitutional coercion is difficult enough when the spending program has universal coverage and excludes only certain speech such as a tax exemption scheme excluding lobbying expenses The Court has found such programs unconstitutional only when the exclusion was aimed at the suppression of dangerous ideas Speiser v Randall 357 U S 513 519 1958 internal quotation marks omitted see also Regan v Taxation With Representation of Wash 461 U S 540 550 1983 Proving the requisite coercion is harder still when a spending program is not universal but limited providing benefits to a restricted number of recipients see Rust v Sullivan 500 U S 173 194 195 1991 The Court has found such selective spending unconstitutionally coercive only once when the government created a public forum with the spending program but then discriminated in distributing funding within the forum on the basis of viewpoint See Rosenberger v Rector and Visitors of Univ of Va 515 U S 819 829 830 1995 When the limited spending program does not create a public forum proving coercion is virtually impossible because simply denying a subsidy does not coerce belief Lyng v Automobile Workers 485 U S 360 369 1988 and because the criterion of unconstitutionality is whether denial of the subsidy threatens to drive certain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace National Endowment for Arts v Finley supra at 587 internal quotation marks omitted Absent such a threat the Government may allocate funding according to criteria that would be impermissible were direct regulation of speech or a criminal penalty at stake 524 U S at 587 588 In Rust v Sullivan supra the Court applied these principles to a statutory scheme that is in all relevant respects indistinguishable from 504 a 16 The statute in Rust authorized grants for the provision of family planning services but provided that n one of the funds shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning Id at 178 Valid regulations implementing the statute required funding recipients to refer pregnant clients for appropriate prenatal services by furnishing a list of available providers that promote the welfare of mother and unborn child but forbade them to refer a pregnant woman specifically to an abortion provider even upon request Id at 180 We rejected a First Amendment free speech challenge to the funding scheme explaining that t he Government can without violating the Constitution selectively fund a program to encourage certain activities it believes to be in the public interest without at the same time funding an alternative program which seeks to deal with the problem another way Id at 193 This was not we said the type of discriminat ion on the basis of viewpoint that triggers strict scrutiny ibid because the decision not to subsidize the exercise of a fundamental right does not infringe the right ibid quoting Regan v Taxation With Representation of Wash supra at 549 The same is true here The LSC Act like the scheme in Rust see 500 U S at 200 does not create a public forum Far from encouraging a diversity of views it has always as the Court accurately states placed restrictions on its use of funds ante at 3 Nor does 504 a 16 discriminate on the basis of viewpoint since it funds neither challenges to nor defenses of existing welfare law The provision simply declines to subsidize a certain class of litigation and under Rust that decision does not infringe the right to bring such litigation Cf Ortwein v Schwab 410 U S 656 658 660 and n 5 1973 per curiam government not required by First Amendment or Due Process Clause to waive filing fee for welfare benefits litigation The Court s repeated claims that 504 a 16 restricts and prohibits speech see e g ante at 10 11 and insulates laws from judicial review see e g ante at 13 are simply baseless No litigant who in the absence of LSC funding would bring a suit challenging existing welfare law is deterred from doing so by 504 a 16 Rust thus controls these cases and compels the conclusion that 504 a 16 is constitutional The Court contends that Rust is different because the program at issue subsidized government speech while the LSC funds private speech See ante at 7 8 This is so unpersuasive it hardly needs response If the private doctors confidential advice to their patients at issue in Rust constituted government speech it is hard to imagine what subsidized speech would not be government speech Moreover the majority s contention that the subsidized speech in these cases is not government speech because the lawyers have a professional obligation to represent the interests of their clients founders on the reality that the doctors in Rust had a professional obligation to serve the interests of their patients see 500 U S at 214 Blackmun J dissenting ethical responsibilities of the medical profession which at the time of Rust we had held to be highly relevant to the permissible scope of federal regulation see Thornburgh v American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 476 U S 747 763 1986 professional responsibilities of physicians overruled in part on other grounds Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa v Casey 505 U S 833 1992 Even respondents agree that the true speaker in Rust was not the government but a doctor Brief for Respondents 19 n 17 SCALIA J dissenting The Court further asserts that these cases are different from Rust because the welfare funding restriction seeks to use an existing medium of expression and to control it in ways which distort its usual functioning ante at 8 This is wrong on both the facts and the law It is wrong on the law because there is utterly no precedent for the novel and facially implausible proposition that the First Amendment has anything to do with government funding that though it does not actually abridge anyone s speech distorts an existing medium of expression None of the three cases cited by the Court mentions such an odd principle In Rosenberger v Rector and Visitors of Univ of Va the point critical to the Court s analysis was not as the Court would have it that it is part of the usual functioning of student newspapers to expres s many different points of view ante at 9 it surely is not but rather that the spending program itself had been created to encourage a diversity of views from private speakers 515 U S at 834 What could not be distorted was the public forum that the spending program had created As for Arkansas Ed Television Comm n v Forbes 523 U S 666 1998 that case discussed the nature of television broadcasting not to determine whether government regulation would alter its usual functioning and thus violate the First Amendment no government regulation was even at issue in the case but rather to determine whether state owned television is a public forum under our First Amendment jurisprudence Id at 673 674 And finally the passage the Court cites from FCC v League of Women Voters of Cal 468 U S 364 396 397 1984 says nothing whatever about using the forum of public radio in an unconventional way to suppress speech inherent in the nature of the medium ante at 8 9 It discusses why the Government s asserted interest in preventing public radio stations from becoming a privileged outlet for the political and ideological opinions of station owners and managers 468 U S at 396 internal quotation marks omitted was insubstantial and thus could not justify the statute s restriction on editorializing Even worse for the Court after invalidating the restriction on this conventional First Amendment ground League of Women Voters goes on to say that o f course the restriction on editorializing would plainly be valid if Congress were to adopt a revised version of the statute that permitted public radio stations to establish affiliate organizations which could then use the station s facilities to editorialize with nonfederal funds Id at 400 But of course that is the case here Regulations permit funding recipients to establish affiliate organizations to conduct litigation and other activities that fall outside the scope of the LSC program See 45 CFR pt 1610 2000 Far from supporting the Court s nondistortion analysis League of Women Voters dooms the Court s case The Court s nondistortion principle is also wrong on the facts since there is no basis for believing that 504 a 16 by causing cases to be presented by LSC attorneys who can not advise the courts of serious questions of statutory validity ante at 11 will distort the operation of the courts It may well be that the bar of 504 a 16 will cause LSC funded attorneys to decline or to withdraw from cases that involve statutory validity But that means at most that fewer statutory challenges to welfare laws will be presented to the courts because of the unavailability of free legal services for that purpose So what The same result would ensue from excluding LSCfunded lawyers from welfare litigation entirely It is not the mandated nondistortable function of the courts to inquire into all serious questions of statutory validity in all cases Courts must consider only those questions of statutory validity that are presented by litigants and if the Government chooses not to subsidize the presentation of some such questions that in no way distorts the courts role It is remarkable that a Court that has so studiously avoided deciding whether Congress could entirely eliminate federal jurisdiction over certain matters see e g Webster v Doe 486 U S 592 603 1988 Bowen v Michigan Academy of Family Physicians 476 U S 667 681 n 12 1986 would be so eager to hold the much lesser step of declining to subsidize the litigation unconstitutional under the First Amendment Nor will the judicial opinions produced by LSC cases systematically distort the interpretation of welfare laws Judicial decisions do not stand as binding precedent for points that were not raised not argued and hence not analyzed See e g United States v Verdugo Urquidez 494 U S 259 272 1990 Hagans v Lavine 415 U S 528 533 n 5 1974 United States v L A Tucker Truck Lines Inc 344 U S 33 37 38 1952 United States v More 3 Cranch 159 172 1805 Marshall C J The statutory validity that courts assume in LSC cases will remain open for full determination in later cases Finally the Court is troubled because in cases where the attorney withdraws from a representation the client is unlikely to find other counsel Ante at 12 That is surely irrelevant since it leaves the welfare recipient in no worse condition than he would have been in had the LSC program never been enacted Respondents properly concede that even if welfare claimants cannot obtain a lawyer anywhere else the Government is not required to provide one Brief for Respondents 16 accord Goldberg v Kelly 397 U S 254 270 1970 government not required to provide counsel at hearing regarding termination of welfare benefits It is hard to see how providing free legal services to some welfare claimants those whose claims do not challenge the applicable statutes while not providing it to others is beyond the range of legitimate legislative choice Rust rejected a similar argument Petitioners contend however that most Title X cli SCALIA J dissenting ents are effectively precluded by indigency and poverty from seeing a health care provider who will provide abortion related services But once again even these Title X clients are in no worse position than if Congress had never enacted Title X The financial constraints that restrict an indigent woman s ability to enjoy the full range of constitutionally protected freedom of choice are the product not of governmental restrictions on access to abortion but rather of her indigency 500 U S at 203 internal quotation marks omitted The only conceivable argument that can be made for distinguishing Rust is that there even patients who wished to receive abortion counseling could receive the nonabortion services that the Government funded clinic offered whereas here some potential LSC clients who wish to receive representation on a benefits claim that does not challenge the statutes will be unable to do so because their cases raise a reform claim that an LSC lawyer may not present This difference of course is required by the same ethical canons that the Court elsewhere does not wish to distort Rather than sponsor truncated representation ante at 11 Congress chose to subsidize only those cases in which the attorneys it subsidized could work freely See e g 42 U S C 2996 6 A ttorneys providing legal assistance must have full freedom to protect the best interests of their clients And it is impossible to see how this difference from Rust has any bearing upon the First Amendment question which to repeat is whether the funding scheme is manipulated to have a coercive effect on those who do not hold the subsidized position National Endowment for Arts v Finley 524 U S at 587 quoting Arkansas Writers Project Inc v Ragland 481 U S at 237 SCALIA J dissenting It could be claimed to have such an effect if the client in a case ineligible for LSC representation could eliminate the ineligibility by waiving the claim that the statute is invalid but he cannot No conceivable coercive effect exists This has been a very long discussion to make a point that is embarrassingly simple The LSC subsidy neither prevents anyone from speaking nor coerces anyone to change speech and is indistinguishable in all relevant respects from the subsidy upheld in Rust v Sullivan supra There is no legitimate basis for declaring 504 a 16 facially unconstitutional III Even were I to accept the Court s First Amendment analysis I could not join its decision to conclude this litigation without reaching the issue of severability That issue although decided by the Second Circuit was not included within the question on which certiorari was granted and as the Court points out was not briefed or argued here I nonetheless think it an abuse of discretion to ignore it The Court has said that w e may consider questions outside the scope of the limited order granting certiorari when resolution of those questions is necessary for the proper disposition of the case Piper Aircraft Co v Reyno 454 U S 235 246 247 n 12 1981 I think it necessary to a proper disposition here because the statute concocted by the Court of Appeals bears little resemblance to what Congress enacted funding without restriction welfare benefits litigation that Congress funded only under the limitations of 504 a 16 Although no party briefed severability in Denver Area Ed Telecommunications Consortium Inc v FCC 518 U S 727 1996 the Justices finding partial unconstitutionality considered it necessary to address the issue Id at 767 plurality opinion W e must ask whether 10 a is severable accord New York v United States 505 U S 144 186 1992 I think we have that same obligation here Moreover by exercising our discretion to leave the severability question open we fail to resolve the basic realworld dispute at issue whether LSC attorneys may represent welfare claimants who challenge the applicable welfare laws Indeed we leave the LSC program subject to even a greater uncertainty than the one we purport to have eliminated since other circuits may conclude as I do that if the limitation upon welfare representation is unconstitutional LSC attorneys cannot engage in welfare litigation at all The inquiry into whether a statute is severable is essentially an inquiry into legislative intent Minnesota v Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians 526 U S 172 191 1999 If Congress would not have enacted those provisions which are within its power independently of that which is not then courts must strike the provisions as a piece Alaska Airlines Inc v Brock 480 U S 678 684 1987 internal quotation marks omitted One determines what Congress would have done by examining what it did Perhaps the most that can be said on the subject is contained in a passage written by Chief Justice Shaw of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts that we have often quoted I f a statute s provisions are so mutually connected with and dependent on each other as conditions considerations or compensations for each other as to warrant a belief that the legislature intended them as a whole and that if all could not be carried into effect the legislature would not pass the residue independently and some parts are unconstitutional all the provisions which as thus dependent conditional or connected must fall with them Warren v Mayor and Aldermen of Charlestown 68 Mass 84 99 1854 It is clear to me that the LSC Act s funding of welfare benefits suits and its prohibition on suits challenging or defending the validity of existing law are conditions considerations and compensations for each other that cannot be severed Congress through the LSC Act intended to provide high quality legal assistance to those who would be otherwise unable to afford adequate legal counsel 42 U S C 2996 2 but only if the program could at the same time be kept free from the influence of or use by it of political pressures 2996 5 More than a dozen times in 504 a Congress made the decision that certain activities could not be funded at all without crippling the LSC program with political pressures See e g 504 a 1 reapportionment litigation 504 a 4 local state and federal lobbying 504 a 7 class action lawsuits 504 a 12 training programs for inter alia boycotts picketing and demonstrations 504 a 14 litigation with respect to abortion The severability question here is essentially whether without the restriction that the Court today invalidates the permission for conducting welfare litigation would have been accorded As far as appears from the best evidence which is the structure of the statute I think the answer must be no We have in some cases stated that when an excepting proviso is found unconstitutional the substantive provisions which it qualifies cannot stand for to hold otherwise would be to extend the scope of the law so as to embrace situations which the legislature passing the statute had by its very terms expressly excluded Frost v Corporation Comm n of Okla 278 U S 515 525 1929 see also Davis v Wallace 257 U S 478 484 1922 Where an excepting provision in a statute is found unconstitutional courts very generally hold that this does not work an enlargement of the scope or operation of other provisions with which that provision was enacted and which it was intended to qualify or restrain I frankly doubt whether this approach has been followed consistently enough to be called the general rule but if there were ever an instance in which it is appropriate it is here To strike the restriction on welfare benefits suits is to void 504 a 16 altogether Subsection a 16 prohibits involvement in three types of activities with respect to welfare reform lobbying rulemaking and litigation But the proscriptions against using LSC funds to participate in welfare lobbying and rulemaking are superfluous since as described above subsections a 2 a 3 and a 4 of 504 withhold LSC funds from those activities generally What is unique about subsection a 16 the only thing it achieves is its limit on litigation To remove that limit is to repeal subsection a 16 altogether and thus to eliminate a significant quid pro quo of the legislative compromise We have no authority to rewrite the statute and give it an effect altogether different from what Congress agreed to Railroad Retirement Bd v Alton R Co 295 U S 330 362 1935 quoted in Carter v Carter Coal Co 298 U S 238 313 1936 It is illuminating to speculate how these cases would have been decided if Congress had enacted 504 a 16 without its proviso prescribing only the general ban against litigation lobbying or rulemaking involving an effort to reform a Federal or State welfare system and if the positions of the parties before us here were reversed If the LSC funded lawyers were here arguing that the statute permitted representation of individual welfare claimants who did not challenge existing law I venture to say that the Court would endorse their argument perhaps with stirring language about the importance of aid to welfare applicants and the Court s unwillingness to presume without clear indication that Congress would want to eliminate it And I have little doubt that in that context SCALIA J dissenting the Court would find its current First Amendment musings as unpersuasive as I find them today Today s decision is quite simply inexplicable on the basis of our prior law The only difference between Rust and the present case is that the former involved distortion of that is to say refusal to subsidize the normal work of doctors and the latter involves distortion of that is to say refusal to subsidize the normal work of lawyers The Court s decision displays not only an improper special solicitude for our own profession it also displays I think the very fondness for reform through the courts the making of innumerable social judgments through judgepronounced constitutional imperatives that prompted Congress to restrict publicly funded litigation of this sort The Court says today through an unprecedented and indeed previously rejected interpretation of the First Amendment that we will not allow this restriction and then to add insult to injury permits to stand a judgment that awards the general litigation funding that the statute does not contain I respectfully dissent
