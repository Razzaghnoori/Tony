 Introduction Cystic fibrosis CF is a generalized exocrine disease resulting from the defective regulation of epithelial chloride ion transport within various organ systems most importantly the lungs 1 2 3 4 This dysfunction can arise from a variety of mutations within the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator CFTR gene on chromosome 7 which encodes the transmembrane pump responsible for regulating transepithelial ion levels 1 2 4 This defect is associated with an increased viscosity of the airway surface fluid and according to some studies an altered salt concentration 5 6 These and other pleiotropic effects of the CF gene abnormality increase the susceptibility of CF patients to bronchopulmonary bacterial infection by opportunistic pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common pathogen recovered from the lungs of CF patients 2 3 This predisposition to P aeruginosa infection has been attributed to several factors For example an increase in asialo GM 1 glycoproteins on the apical surface of CF airway epithelial cells provides greater opportunity for adhesion by the type IV pili of P aeruginosa 3 7 8 Furthermore the first extracellular domain of wild type CFTR has been found to act as a P aeruginosa specific receptor which is involved in the clearance of P aeruginosa from the airways via epithelial cell desquamation 9 10 11 a process greatly impaired in the CF lung Other conditions that abet colonization of the CF lung include impairment of the mucociliary escalator and macrophage mediated phagocytosis by the viscous airway secretions If elevated salt concentrations exist within these secretions 5 6 they would inhibit and defensins endogenous antibacterial peptides produced by neutrophils and airway epithelia respectively 2 3 12 13 14 15 This last point is still under review as recent evidence suggests that CF airway surface fluid may be isotonic not hypertonic 16 In recent years Burkholderia cepacia has become the second leading cause of death in patients with chronic granulomatous disease CGD The phagocytes of such patients are deficient in their capacity to kill organisms by oxidative means because of a defective NADPH oxidase 17 18 B cepacia also poses a threat to patients with CF either cocolonizing those already infected with P aeruginosa or as the sole infecting agent 2 18 Although rates of colonization can vary widely between 5 and 70 B cepacia is isolated from sputum in only 10 20 of patients with CF 2 3 B cepacia a very diverse species has been divided into several classes of bacteria i e genomovars collectively referred to as the B cepacia complex Genomovar III is the most common B cepacia genomovar isolated from CF patients accounting for approximately 80 of B cepacia isolates in CF patients Genomovars II and V have also been recovered from CF patients 18 Of critical concern are B cepacia s transmissibility from one patient to another and its propensity to give rise to the B cepacia syndrome which results in a rapid decline in pulmonary function 2 18 The ability of B cepacia as well as P aeruginosa to cause chronic bronchopulmonary infections in CF patients is exacerbated by their intrinsic or acquired resistance to many conventional antibiotics Peptide antibiotics including protegrins are currently under consideration as novel agents for treating pulmonary infections in CF patients Antimicrobial peptides are synthesized either nonribosomally or ribosomally 19 Protegrin 1 PG 1 a 2 kDa cationic octadecapeptide RGGRLCYCRRRFCVCVGR amide was originally isolated from porcine leukocytes 20 and falls into the latter category We selected it for this study because it is rapidly bactericidal functions well at elevated physiological salt concentrations such as those that may occur in the CF lung and has a broad spectrum of activity 21 22 23 PG 1 s antiparallel hairpin structure and antimicrobial activity in physiological and elevated salt concentrations are maintained by its two intramolecular cystine disulfide bonds 21 24 25 26 27 28 The antimicrobial spectrum of PG 1 includes Chlamydia trachomatis Candida albicans Escherichia coli Fusobacterium nucleatum Haemophilus ducreyi Listeria monocytogenes Neisseria gonorrhoeae Porphyromonas gingivalis Prevotella intermedia P aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus 20 22 25 29 30 31 32 This study tested the hypothesis that the relative sensitivity or resistance of P aeruginosa and B cepacia strains to PG 1 correlates to the extent of peptide binding A previously described two stage radial diffusion technique designed for peptide antibiotics was used to determine susceptibility Binding of protegrins to intact P aeruginosa and B cepacia cells and to purified lipopolysaccharide LPS and lipid A prepared from these organisms was measured by three different techniques Materials and methods Bacterial strains and growth media Two sets of genetically related P aeruginosa strains were studied Strain 144M a serum sensitive mucoid isolate from a CF patient contains short O side chain LPS while its serum resistant derivative 144M SR which is also mucoid has long O side chain LPS 33 Strain FRD 1 is a mucoid CF isolate 34 and FRD 2 is its spontaneous nonmucoid derivative 35 P aeruginosa ATCC strains 10145 and 9027 are nonmucoid strains with long O side chain LPSs N L Schiller unpublished results We also studied B cepacia ATCC strains 25416 and 25609 as well as three clinical strains isolated from patients with CF in Vancouver Canada kindly provided by David P Speert University of British Columbia These strains included C4813 genomovar IIIa B cepacia epidemic strain marker BCESM positive cable pilin subunit gene A cable A negative C4878 genomovar IIIa BCESM positive cable A negative and C6159 genomovar IIIb BCESM and cable A negative BCESM and cable A are putative transmissibility markers 36 Log phase cultures were grown at 37 C with shaking in trypticase soy broth TSB Becton Dickinson Microbiology Cockeysville MD Protegrin PG 1 was prepared as previously described 25 and was approximately 96 5 pure PG 1 was dissolved in and diluted with filter sterilized acidified water 0 01 acetic acid supplemented with 0 1 human serum albumin Sigma St Louis MO The albumin in the PG 1 vehicle helped reduce nonspecific adsorption of protegrins when the stock solutions were serially diluted 22 37 These PG 1 stock solutions were filter sterilized prior to storage at either 20 C for short term 3 months or 80 C for long term storage Radial diffusion assay The two stage radial diffusion assay protocol as described by Steinberg and Lehrer 37 and Lehrer et al 38 was altered by supplementing the underlay agar with 150 mM NaCl to ascertain PG 1 s ability to kill P aeruginosa and B cepacia at an elevated salt concentration These assays were interpreted as described below The sample wells received 5 l of PG 1 various concentrations or its vehicle We analyzed the radial diffusion assay results in two ways In one we calculated the lethal concentration C L as described by Hultmark et al 39 40 from wells surrounded by net clear zones of 1 to 2 5 mm In the other we defined the minimal active concentration MAC as the lowest concentration of PG 1 that produced a measurable totally clear inhibition zone around the well Whole cell binding assay Binding of PG 1 to intact cells was measured with a monoradioiodinated variant of PG 1 This protegrin variant differed from PG 1 in two ways Phe7 replaced Tyr7 in the protegrin domain and an N terminal glycine rich hexapeptide extension GGGYGG with a single tyrosine residue was present In this report the modified peptide and its monoiodinated variant will be called GGPG and I GGPG respectively The full sequence of GGPG is GGGYGGRGGRLCFCRRRFCVCVGR CONH 2 In preliminary experiments we determined that PG 1 GGPG and I GGPG exhibited virtually identical antimicrobial potency and kinetics data not shown GGPG was iodinated with NaI or Na 125I Pierce Rockford IL by the iodobead method 41 42 Unincorporated NaI or Na 125I was removed by solid phase extraction on a Sep Pak C 18 Plus Cartridge I GGPG was purified from uniodinated and di iodinated GGPG by reverse phase HPLC Vydac Hesperia CA Binding assays were done with stationary phase P aeruginosa 9027 or B cepacia 25416 both typically at 2 5 10 7CFU ml The bacteria were incubated with 125I GGPG at 0 C for 60 min at pH 7 4 in a 10 mM Tris acetate buffer containing 100 mM NaCl 1 TSB and 1 BSA Samples were layered over 0 3 ml of a cushion composed of 5 parts of dibutyl phthalate and 3 parts of di isodecyl phthalate density 20 1 01 and centrifuged at approximately 14 000 g After removing the supernatant and phthalate oil the base of the tube was severed with a razor blade and the stub which contained the pellet was recovered for radioactivity counting LPS and lipid A extraction and analysis Bacterial LPS was isolated according to the protocol of Darveau and Hancock 43 with some modifications as described below Strains were grown overnight in TSB collected via centrifugation 10 000 g for 20 min at 0 C and suspended in a pH 8 0 buffer 5 0 g of wet weight bacteria 30 ml of buffer that contained 10 mM Tris hydrochloride 2 mM MgCl 2 100 g ml DNase I and 25 g ml RNase I The slurry was passed twice through a French Press set at 20 000 lbs in 2 DNase and RNase were again added and the mixture was incubated at 37 C for 2 hours Then to each 15 ml of suspension the following were added 5 0 ml of 0 5 M tetrasodium EDTA in 10 mM Tris buffer 2 5 ml of 20 SDS in 10 mM Tris buffer and 2 5 ml of 10 mM Tris buffer The preparation was mixed and centrifuged at 50 000 g for 30 min at 20 C to remove the peptidoglycan Protease Sigma P5147 at 200 g ml was added to the supernatant and incubated at 37 C overnight with agitation On the next day 0 375 M MgCl 2 in 95 ethanol was added and the suspension was cooled to 0 C before centrifugation at 12 000 g for 15 min at 0 C The resulting pellet was resuspended in 2 SDS 0 1 M tetrasodium EDTA in 10 mM Tris buffer and sonicated This solution was incubated at 85 C for 30 min and cooled to room temperature before protease 25 g ml was added and incubated overnight at 37 C After re precipitation the following day with ethanol the pellet was resuspended in 10 mM Tris buffer and centrifuged at 200 000 g for 2 hours at 20 C in the presence of 25 mM MgCl 2 The final LPS extract was suspended in 10 ml dH 2 O and dialyzed overnight against dH 2 O to remove any residual salt and SDS prior to being lyophilized Contamination of the LPS samples by protein represented no more than 3 6 0 21 as estimated by measuring the dry weight and protein concentration with the Bio Rad Protein Assay Kit Nucleic acid contamination was considered to be minimal due to the repeated DNase and RNase treatments LPS preparations were diluted using the PG 1 vehicle prior to assaying with PG 1 Lipid A was extracted from isolated LPS preparations via acid hydrolysis 44 45 Isolated LPS 25 30 mg was suspended in 4 ml of a 1 acetic acid solution and heated in a water bath to 100 C under refluxing conditions for 3 hours Once the lipid A was hydrolyzed it precipitated out of solution and was extracted with five sequential 4 ml aliquots of chloroform Lipid A extracts were collected and washed three times with 10 ml aliquots of dH 2 O before being lyophilized Lipid A was dissolved in 100 dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO which was diluted to 2 5 with the PG 1 vehicle before application in the radial diffusion assay In order to measure the ability of LPS and lipid A to bind PG 1 we modified the two stage radial diffusion assay so that we could ascertain the amount of LPS or lipid A in ng that reduced the antimicrobial activity of 50 ng of PG 1 by 50 percent called the effective concentration 50 or EC 50 Briefly 2 5 l of a 20 g ml PG 1 solution and 2 5 l of LPS or lipid A at various concentrations based on their dry weight were combined and added to the radial diffusion wells After a 3 hour incubation a nutrient rich overlay gel was poured and the plates were incubated overnight The following day zone diameters including the wells were measured in mm Since the height h of the underlay gel was always 1 2 mm the zone diameters were converted to volumes cleared of viable bacteria with the formula for the volume of a cylinder V r 2h Since the 3 mm diameter sample well was devoid of both bacteria and peptide its volume 8 5 l was subtracted from the gross clear zone volume r 2h to derive the net volume rendered free of bacteria As will be shown below this net volume was a linear function of the amount of PG 1 placed in the well for amounts of protegrin between 0 50 ng well Surface plasmon resonance Binding of LPS or lipid A to PG 1 was assessed with a Biacore 2000 system BiaCore AB Piscataway NJ a very similar approach was used to study LPS binding by peptide domains of horseshoe crab factor C 46 This innovative technology uses surface plasmon resonance to study biomolecular interactions in real time Briefly the binding takes place on a small chip coated with a thin layer of metal It is monitored by monochromatic p polarized light whose electric vector component is parallel to the plane of incidence Under these conditions the intensity of the reflected light is markedly reduced at a specific incident angle producing a sharp shadow This phenomenon is called surface plasmon resonance SPR and the incident light angle at which the shadow is observed is the SPR angle Detection of the SPR angle depends on changes in the refractive index RI of the medium on the nonilluminated side of the chip Since this RI depends on the mass concentration of macromolecules at this surface monitoring the SPR angle provides a real time measure of changes in the surface concentration The SPR spectrum is a plot of the SPR angle against time and displays the interaction s progress at the sensor surface The SPR signal is expressed in resonance units RU and 1000 RU is equivalent to a change in surface protein concentration of about 1 ng mm 2or of about 6 mg ml in the bulk protein concentration In our study LPS and lipid A samples from P aeruginosa 9027 and B cepacia 25416 were immobilized on a hydrophobic HPA sensor chip BR 1000 30 Biacore AB that was found in our preliminary experiments to provide an optimal matrix for LPS and lipid A The surface of HPA sensor chips is composed of long chain alkanethiol molecules that form a flat quasi crystalline hydrophobic layer that facilitates hydrophobic adsorption of liposomes or micelles on a user defined polar lipid monolayer The chip was precleaned and conditioned by washing twice with 40 mM n octyl glucoside Sigma Chemical Co To immobilize the LPS 60 l of a 1 mg ml LPS preparation was dispersed in 100 mM NaCl containing 10 mM HEPES buffer pH 7 4 and passed across the chip s surface for 30 min at flow rate of 2 l min Lipid A was dissolved and immobilized similarly except that its concentration was reduced to 0 2 mg ml Residual unbound LPS and lipid A were washed away with 0 1 M HCl and 0 1 M NaOH BSA 0 1 mg ml was used to detect nonspecific binding on the surfaces coated by LPS or lipid A PG 1 binding was measured by observing the change in the SPR angle of the sample bound to the chip as 30 l of PG 1 20 M 10 M 6 M 3 M 2 M and 1 M flowed over the sample for 3 min at a rate of 10 l min These PG 1 solutions were also prepared in 100 mM NaCl containing 10 mM HEPES buffer pH 7 4 Each binding study was done in triplicate and the chip was regenerated between trials by washing it with 0 1 M HCl and 0 1 M NaOH Results Activity of PG 1 on P aeruginosaand B cepaciastrains The C L and MAC for PG 1 on P aeruginosa and B cepacia were determined in two stage radial diffusion assays Table 1 The mean C L of PG 1 for the six P aeruginosa strains was 0 30 g ml and the mean C L for the five B cepacia strains was 5 02 g ml a 16 7 fold difference The mean MACs for P aeruginosa and B cepacia were 0 17 g ml and 8 40 g ml respectively The C L and MAC values for P aeruginosa and B cepacia differed significantly P exact 0 004 when the data were analyzed by the Mann Whitney test We also compared two sets of genetically related P aeruginosa strains 144M 144M SR and FRD 1 FRD 2 Whereas the LPS of strain 144M has a very short O antigen side chain LPS from strain 144M SR has a very long O antigen side chain However despite these differences both strains had comparable C L and MAC values Similarly comparison of the alginate producer FRD 1 with FRD 2 its spontaneous nonmucoid derivative revealed that both strains had very similar C L and MAC values Intact whole cell binding Incubation of 125I GGPG with intact P aeruginosa 9027 PG 1 sensitive and B cepacia 25416 PG 1 resistant cells demonstrated a marked difference in protegrin binding between the two strains Fig 1 When the bacteria were exposed to 12 5 g 125I GGPG ml approximately sixfold more protegrin molecules bound to P aeruginosa than to B cepacia and at an 125I GGPG concentration of 25 g ml 12 times as many protegrin molecules bound to P aeruginosa Another factor also merits mention in this regard By light microscopy the B cepacia cells appeared larger than the P aeruginosa cells By electron microscopy we found that the mean cross sectional diameters and lengths of B cepacia 25416 cells were 0 755 m 2 55 m The corresponding values for P aeruginosa 9027 cells were 0 615 m 2 35 m Assuming a cylindrical structure for both we calculated that the surface area of the B cepacia cells 6 00 m 2 was approximately 33 larger on average than that of P aeruginosa 4 54 m 2 Binding of PG 1 to LPS and lipid A To compare binding of PG 1 to LPS and lipid A from P aeruginosa 9027 and B cepacia 25416 we devised a simple bioassay based on the radial diffusion assay As shown in Fig 2 for protegrin amounts between 0 and 50 ng the volume of underlay gel that was rendered completely free of viable bacteria was linearly related to the amount of peptide introduced into the well By mixing a constant amount of protegrin within this linear range with graded amounts of purified LPS and lipid A we could readily determine how much of these ligands were needed to reduce the activity of 50 ng of PG 1 by 50 the EC 50 values The results of our assays with LPS and lipid A purified from the strains we used in the above 125I GGPG binding studies are shown in Fig 3A The EC 50 values for LPS isolated from P aeruginosa and B cepacia differed by 4 6 fold 100 ng versus 460 ng while the EC 50 values for lipid A isolated from the same strains differed by approximately 16 7 fold 60 ng versus 1000 ng To ascertain if these findings were representative we prepared LPS and lipid A from another pair of bacteria P aeruginosa FRD 2 and B cepacia C4813 and repeated the studies The EC 50 values for both LPS and lipid A obtained from P aeruginosa FRD 2 were each 120 ng The values for B cepacia LPS and lipid A were estimated as approximately 2050 ng for both Fig 3B a difference of 17 1 fold when compared to P aeruginosa FRD 2 LPS and lipid A Surface plasmon resonance studies We also used SPR spectroscopy to compare the binding of PG 1 to LPS and lipid A purified from P aeruginosa 9027 and B cepacia 25416 Injection of LPS or lipid A from both strains was stopped when the increase in RU of both reached 1000 Loosely bound molecules were washed away by increasing the flow rate to 100 l min followed by two one minute short pulse injections of 100 mM NaOH Injections of 0 1 mg ml BSA prepared in the eluent buffer were passed across the LPS or lipid A coated surfaces for a five minute period and showed an increase of around 100 RU whereas the same amount of BSA passed across the uncoated n octyl glucoside washed surface showed an increase of roughly 1000 RU This demonstrated that the surface of the chip was fully covered by LPS or lipid A Since similar amounts of these ligands had bound to the chip the response unit differences seen at concentrations between 1 and 20 M indicate that approximately twice as much PG 1 bound P aeruginosa lipid A as bound lipid A from the B cepacia strain Fig 4 Binding differences were less marked when we studied LPS from these organisms Fig 5 Although up to one third more protegrin molecules bound to P aeruginosa LPS than to B cepacia LPS at protegrin concentrations of 1 6 M these differences disappeared when we tested higher PG 1 concentrations At 10 M PG 1 LPS from P aeruginosa and B cepacia bound PG 1 equally 750 response units Equal binding was also seen at 20 M PG 1 1000 response units Discussion In this study we compared the sensitivity of P aeruginosa and B cepacia strains to protegrin PG 1 with the ability of the intact bacteria and key components of their outer membranes LPS and lipid A to bind this peptide The indices of susceptibility C L and MAC values obtained from our radial diffusion assays established that P aeruginosa was considerably more sensitive to PG 1 than B cepacia We also found that at any given peptide concentration many fewer protegrin molecules bound to intact B cepacia and its lipid A than to the corresponding P aeruginosa preparations In model systems the ability of protegrins to permeabilize membranes shows pronounced concentration gating an indication that it is influenced by the density of bound protegrin molecules per unit area of membrane 47 As prior quantitative studies of peptide binding are few in number some readers may be surprised to note that Fig 1shows many millions of protegrin molecules are bound to an average bacterial cell even at concentrations around the minimal active concentration To acquire an equivalent density of surface bound PG 1 molecules B cepacia needed exposure to much higher concentrations of PG 1 than P aeruginosa Thus it is a reasonable inference that the relative resistance of B cepacia to PG 1 is a consequence of the smaller number of protegrin molecules bound per unit area of bacterial surface Earlier studies have shown that certain structural differences in the LPS of Gram negative bacteria correlate with their susceptibility or resistance to antimicrobial lipo peptides 19 23 48 49 50 51 Particular attention has been given to alterations of the outer membrane that could modify binding to the cell surface For example sensitivity to the antibacterial lipopeptide polymyxin B is affected by the PmrA PmrB regulon which mediates substitution of 4 aminoarabinose on the 4 phosphate of lipid A 52 53 By reducing the negative charge of lipid A this modification decreases its electrostatic interaction with cationic peptides Resistance to polymyxin B is also imparted by the absence or masking of critical binding sites required for polycation mediated permeabilization of the outer membrane 54 Thus attachment of polymyxin B to Yersinia enterocolitica is reduced by steric hindrance generated by the size and or branched shape of the outer core region of its LPS macromolecule 55 Additionally resistance to cationic peptides can be due to cytoplasmic clearance of the antimicrobial peptide by an efflux pump e g Yersinia resistance to polymyxin B caused by the RosA RosB efflux pump potassium antiporter 56 and Neisseria gonorrhoeae resistance to protegrin PG 1 via an energy dependent efflux system termed mtr 57 Given the notorious resistance of B cepacia to conventional antibiotics 2 its relative resistance to PG 1 was not unexpected What bacterial properties influenced sensitivity to protegrins Certainly the striking correlation with the extent of protegrin binding must be one of these Our studies with genetically related P aeruginosa strains did not implicate the length of the O antigen side chain as a key factor Furthermore genetically related P aeruginosa strains that differed in alginate production were equally sensitive to PG 1 Both results were somewhat surprising since long O side chain and alginate molecules should both bind PG 1 Perhaps limited alginate production under our experimental conditions explains its failure to influence susceptibility to PG 1 Additional studies focusing on the influence of alginate on PG 1 activity in a biofilm model are in progress Why did fewer protegrin molecules bind to B cepacia than to P aeruginosa Our radial diffusion binding and SPR studies strongly implicated lipid A as a prime suspect in the case The acyl chains of lipid A form an integral part of the outer membrane bilayer and electrostatic or hydrophobic binding of protegrin to lipid A could easily disturb the organization and acyl chain packing of the outer membrane both vital in maintaining its integrity and barrier function Accepting a direct proportionality between measured plasmon resonance RU and the extent of peptide bound to the sensor surface the responses shown in Fig 4indicate that at saturation 20 M lipid A from B cepacia bound almost exactly one half as many protegrin molecules as lipid A from P aeruginosa How might this be rationalized Lipid A typically contains two phosphate groups one on each glucosamine residue In the lipid A of B cepacia one of these phosphates is modified by a phosphodiester linked 4 amino 4 deoxyarabinose residue 58 59 It is noteworthy that a previous study reported that the phosphate content of B cepacia LPS was only one third of that of P aeruginosa 60 If most of the P aeruginosa lipid A phosphates are unmodified and if these phosphates are principal protegrin binding sites then one would expect exactly the results shown in Fig 4 This is also consistent with the suggestion made in a recent report showing that cystic fibrosis isolates of P aeruginosa had lipid A isoforms derivatized with aminoarabinose or palmitate that these structural modifications could enhance resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides 61 Although the acyl chains of lipid A might also provide alternative binding sites for protegrin the orientation of lipid A on the HPA sensor chip butter side down probably removes them from consideration at least under our study conditions The core and outer polysaccharide regions of LPS should provide additional binding sites including the carboxylate moieties of KDO or KO D glycero D talo oct 2 ulopyranosylonic acid 62 This could explain why B cepacia LPS binds about as much PG 1 as P aeruginosa LPS Fig 5 especially at peptide concentrations of 10 20 M which allow binding to lower affinity sites This interpretation helps explain why Fig 3suggests that B cepacia LPS binds protegrin less effectively than the corresponding P aeruginosa preparation while the SPR results in Fig 5show that B cepacia and P aeruginosa LPS bound equivalent amounts of PG 1 at high 10 20 M protegrin concentrations To resolve these seemingly discrepant results it is important to recall that in SPR assays the sensor chips were constantly bathed with a fixed protegrin concentration ranging from 1 20 M and that in radial diffusion assays the wells received a fixed initial amount of protegrin 50 ng In the latter assays the peptide was dispersed in a total volume of 10 l making its maximal initial concentration approximately 2 3 M well below the 10 20 M concentrations needed to saturate LPS Moreover in addition to binding the LPS or lipid A molecules we added to the well some of the initially added protegrin could diffuse radially into the underlay gel Both initial binding and radial diffusion will decrease the concentration of free i e unbound protegrin that remains in the well and further skew its binding towards higher affinity binding sites on lipid A Although our data clearly establish the presence of a reduced number of binding sites for protegrin in lipid A from B cepacia as compared to lipid A from P aeruginosa they do not identify the cause of this phenomenon These alterations could result from 4 aminoarabinose substitutions on the lipid A from other changes that reduce the number of ion binding sites or from changes that affect hydrophobic interactions or membrane insertion Additional studies that characterize B cepacia LPS and lipid A can help pinpoint the exact structural differences that relate to the relative resistance of B cepacia to protegrins and to endogenous antimicrobial peptides of humans Conclusion Our studies demonstrate a correlation between protegrin sensitivity resistance and protegrin binding in P aeruginosa and B cepacia and support a hypothesis that the relative resistance of B cepacia to protegrin is due principally to a reduced number of protegrin binding sites on the lipid A moiety of its LPS Abbreviations
