RULE ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION ENTITLED FLEXIBLE SERVICE OFFERINGS IN THE COMMERCIAL MOBILE RADIO SERVICES WT Docket No 96 6 i Cost benefit analysis The Commission indicated in its submission that it was not required to prepare a cost benefit analysis of the rule ii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 U S C 603 605 607 and 609 Section 603 Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Pursuant to section 603 of the Act the Commission incorporated an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis IRFA in its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and written comments were requested The preamble to the rule states that no comments were received specifically in response to the IRFA but that issues were raised that might affect small business entities In particular a small business commenter argued that the proposed flexibility in the use of the CMRS bands not be extended to cellular providers initially in order to give Personal Communications Service PCS licensees an opportunity to establish themselves The Commission also reports that it forwarded a copy of its initial regulatory flexibility analysis to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration SBA as required by the Act Section 604 Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The Commission prepared a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis pursuant to section 604 That analysis notes that the rule will carry out the Congress intent to establish a consistent regulatory framework for all commercial mobile radio services and that the rule will assist in the development of competition between wireless and wireline services for the benefit of consumers The analysis notes that the rulemaking applies to providers of cellular narrowband and broadband PCS CMRS specialized mobile radio services CMRS paging commercial 220 MHz services and for profit interconnected business radio services Each category of services was analyzed separately GAO OGC 96 40 Cellular In absence of its own standards the Commission defined small business with respect to cellular services by utilizing the SBA definition for radiotelephone companies e g an entity employing less than 1 500 persons Because of the absence of meaningful data concerning the number of entities which are small the Commission used the 1992 Census of Transportation Communications and Utilities conducted by the Bureau of the Census as the most recent information available That census indicated that only 12 of the 1 178 radiotelephone firms had 1 000 or more employees That data does not however indicate the number of cellular providers among the 1 178 firms Based on the above the FCC concluded that for the purpose of the final regulatory flexibility analysis all cellular licensees are small businesses as defined by the SBA PCS The FCC with the approval of the SBA has defined small business in this category to mean businesses who have gross revenues not to exceed 40 million per year for the prior 3 calendar years Broadband PCS licenses were auctioned for Blocks A B and C No auction has been held for blocks D E and F The FCC asserts that it has insufficient information upon which to determine whether any small businesses within the SBA approved definition were successful bidders for blocks A and B For block C the FCC estimates that 89 of the 90 nondefaulting bidders are small businesses For blocks D E and F the FCC has switched from the 40 million criteria to the under 1 500 employee category Given that nearly all radiotelephone companies have less than 1 500 employees the FCC concludes that all of the 1 479 licenses for these blocks will be awarded to small businesses Because of a similar lack of meaningful data the Commission has concluded that all of the 30 regional licenses for narrowband PCS and all of the 11 licenses for narrowband nationwide PCS licenses have been awarded to small business SMR The FCC has created two tiers of small business for this service with the approval of the SBA Firms with not more than 3 million gross revenue for each of the three preceding calendar years are categorized as very small with not more than 15 million for the same period are small According to the analysis 60 winning bidders for the 900 MHz licenses qualify as small entities no breakdown of small vs very small There has been no auction for the 800 MHz licenses Interconnected business services According to the FCC there is no meaningful data as to the number of for profit interconnected business service IBS licensees that are small business although the Commission concludes that all of the current license holders are small based on the 1 500 employee SBA criteria The FCC notes that while there are in excess of 13 000 for profit IBS licenses a single licensee may hold multiple licenses so that it is not possible to determine the actual number of individual licensees for the service The analysis concludes that the rules do not impose additional reporting record keeping or other compliance requirements Section 605 Avoidance of duplicative or unnecessary analysis The Commission did not invoke any of the exemptions or special procedures authorized by section 605 in preparing its regulatory flexibility analysis Section 607 Preparation of Analysis Under section 607 the Commission s submission does not specifically indicate the potential economic impact on the small entities affected However the regulatory flexibility analysis indicates that the rule will benefit all CMRS small business licensees by providing them greater flexibility to determine which service they will provide to the public Section 609 Participation by small entities Based on the information before us it appears that there were no special efforts made by the Commission to involve small entities in the rulemaking process other than the actions required by 5 U S C 553 iii Agency actions relevant to sections 202 205 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 2 U S C 1532 1535 As an independent regulatory agency the Commission is not subject to Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 iv Other relevant information or requirements under
