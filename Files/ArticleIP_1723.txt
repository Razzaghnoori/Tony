 Canadian tycoon Conrad Black s Daily Telegraph of Britain expanded its campaign against Rupert Murdoch Wednesday by accusing him of censoring coverage of China in his London newspaper and Telegraph rival the Times In a front page lead story the Telegraph quoted the Times veteran China specialist American academic and journalist Jonathan Mirsky as saying that the Times has simply decided because of Murdoch s interests not to cover China in a serious way His comments were taken from the transcript of a forum on press freedom that took place in London in January For three months after the hand over of Hong Kong to China last June readers of the Times would have thought that Hong Kong had been airlifted up to Pluto that it had simply vanished Mirsky said We have here what is arguably the traditionally most famous newspaper in the world and it has just decided it has taken not an executive decision but an owner s position to leave China and Hong Kong alone he added The beleaguered editor of the Times Peter Stothard replied in a statement that the China coverage of the Times is wholly and solely in the hands of the editor adding I have never taken an editorial decision to suit Mr Murdoch s interests Nor have I ever been asked to The next day in a signed op ed piece Stothard asked Times readers to accept the Editor s word that none of Mirsky s accusations against him were true Meanwhile the Times already under attack for failing to cover Murdoch s cancellation of a book contract with the former British governor of Hong Kong Chris Patten had tracked down Murdoch in a

executives of his London publishers HarperCollins saying they had chickened out and left him in a completely inexcusable position Murdoch admitted he had asked HarperCollins to drop the book but said the executives should have been forthright about it instead of inventing nonsensical reasons They claimed that Patten s manuscript wasn t up to the mark when its editor at HarperCollins Stuart Proffitt was already on record as finding it the most lucid and intelligent book he had ever received from a politician Thursday the Telegraph returned to the fray reporting on its front page that HarperCollins Chairman Eddie Bell was very low and contemplating resignation after Murdoch s attack and on an inside page that outrage is bubbling to the surface in America over Murdoch s dumping of the Patten memoirs The Telegraph quoted New York Times and Los Angeles Times attacks on Murdoch and Rep Nancy Pelosi D Calif as saying Murdoch was China s willing accomplice in suppressing the truth
