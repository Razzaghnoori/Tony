 What to Do Sports In California you can enjoy all kinds of sports from jogging to hang gliding from cycling to snorkeling and in winter you can even squeeze a morning s surfing and an afternoon s downhill skiing into one day The Golden State is a paradise for outdoor activities but we start with what must be California s favorite Watersports If you get no other exercise while you re in California it would be difficult to go without at least one day of swimming at the beach It s no coincidence that most of the United States champion swimmers come from Southern California In the middle class neighborhoods of Los Angeles county it seems that every other house has its own swimming pool from the air you see the mass of turquoise blobs as you fly into the airport Surfing snorkeling scuba diving sailing fishing waterskiing and windsurfing can all be enjoyed at various points on the coast Everyone has their favorite beach or bay and some are better for one sport than another Good beaches in the San Diego area can be found at Silver Strand Mission and La Jolla In Los Angeles the best beaches are Redondo Santa Monica Hermosa Manhattan Venice Malibu and Zuma One warning to swimmers farther north however at the resort village of Carmel by the Sea and up past San Francisco the beaches are fine for sunbathing but strong undercurrents make the sea too dangerous for swimming Surfing Surfers have been riding California s waves since 1907 although the sport achieved legendary status in the 1960s through the songs of the Beach Boys California rates second only to Hawaii for surfing though some Australians may argue the point The best waves for surfing are at Malibu on Point Duma Surfrider at Santa Monica State Beach north of the pier La Jolla on Windansea
