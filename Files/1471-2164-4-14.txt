 Background The history of the T locus began with the discovery in 1927 of a semi dominant mutation in mice named Brachyury or T for tail that affects both embryonic viability in homozygotes and tail development in heterozygotes 1 This original T allele represents a deletion spanning 160 200 kb reviewed in 2 the developmental effects of which have been well characterized 3 4 5 6 7 8 Homozygous mutant embryos show a developmental failure of the notochord and posterior mesoderm and die at midgestation Heterozygous mutant mice are born with shortened tails and malformed vertebrae In 1988 another spontaneous Brachyury mutation called T Wis was reported 9 The T Wis homozygous and heterozygous mutant phenotypes are more severe than those of the T deletion suggesting that the T Wis allele acts as a dominant negative Homozygous mutants have no somites at all and heterozygotes have no tail rather than a shortened tail reviewed in 2 The T gene was cloned in 1990 10 and its expression pattern was found to correlate with the tissue types affected in T mutants 8 Subsequently T protein was shown to bind specifically to DNA and its preferred in vitro target sequence was identified 11 It was further shown that T encodes a transcription factor capable of regulating expression of a reporter via the identified target sequence 12 In their report describing the initial cloning of the T gene Herrmann et al 10 also demonstrated that the T Wis allele of T results from the insertion of an endogenous retrovirus like early transposon ETn element into the splice donor site of exon 7 of the 8 exon T locus They showed that the splice site at the 3 end of exon 7 was mutated from TAG GTATGT to TAG GTGTTG where underlined sequence is the 3 end of exon 7 and ETn insertion sequence is in bold and predicted that this site would be nonfunctional thereby abolishing splicing of exon 7 to exon 8 They proposed that the T Wis allele would produce a transcript comprised of exons 1 through 7 followed by read through transcription of the ETn element resulting in a modified C terminal end or alternatively that upstream splice donor sites would be used shortening the transcript and protein product In later whole mount in situ analysis Herrmann 13 confirmed expression of a T locus derived transcript in T Wis T Wis embryos but did not examine its exact nature The position of the ETn insertion see Figure 3A is compatible with the idea that a modified protein could still bind DNA but might compete with the wild type protein or form an inactive complex with it thus leading to a dominant negative effect The aim of this study was to characterize the sequence and structure of the T Wis allele transcript s with an eye towards understanding the specific molecular consequences of disruption of the exon 7 splice donor site by the inserted ETn element Using an RT PCR based approach we have shown that at least 8 different transcripts are produced from the T Wis allele of T In addition to the mutant transcript predicted by Herrmann et al 10 4 transcripts composed solely of T exonic sequences and 3 transcripts containing ETn sequences spliced between T exonic sequences were identified All T Wis transcripts bypass the mutated exon 7 splice donor site such that wild type T transcripts cannot be produced from the T Wis allele Results and Discussion Identity of the T WisETn element As a first step in characterizing the molecular nature of the T Wis allele of T the exact identity of the ETn element inserted into the locus was determined The primer ETn1 was designed to a region of conservation across related but different ETn PCR was performed on yolk sac lysates from e9 5 T Wis T Wis mutant embryos using the primer set F3 ETn1 Figure 1A Sequence analysis of the 1300 bp PCR product amplified from T Wis T Wis DNA in two independent reactions showed that the ETn element of the T Wis allele is identical to the 5542 bp ETn sequence Genbank accession Y17106 with the T Wis ETn element inserted in reverse orientation relative to the direction of transcription of the T locus data not shown Transcripts produced from the T Wisallele of T The next step in characterizing the molecular nature of the T Wis allele was to identify the aberrant transcripts produced from this allele RT PCR was performed on RNA from T T Wis and T Wis T Wis embryos using forward and reverse primers located in different exons of the T locus as well as a reverse primer specific to the ETn element of the T Wis insertion Table 1and Figure 1B The RT PCR products were excised purified and sequenced twice on each strand with the primers used to generate them The F2 R1 products were additionally sequenced one time each with primers F1 and R2 The F1 R1 and F2 R1 primer pair products F1 R1a and F2 R1a amplified from a T embryo represented the expected wild type T RNA species 6 7 8 and 4 5 6 7 8 Figure 1B Table 2 and Figure 3B while those amplified from a T Wis T Wis embryo together comprised 5 aberrant transcripts Figure 1B Table 2 and Figure 3C Transcripts representing an exon 4 to exon 8 splice 4 8 an exon 5 to exon 8 splice 4 5 8 and an exon 6 to exon 8 splice 6 8 were all identified in T Wis T Wis embryos An additional mutant transcript resulted from an aberrant splicing event from exon 7 to exon 8 such that 35 nucleotides nt of the 3 end of exon 7 were deleted 6 7 35 8 and 4 5 6 7 35 8 Another mutant transcript included an aberrant mini exon of 37 nt of ETn derived sequences inserted between the 3 deleted exon 7 to exon 8 splice 6 7 35 37ETn 8 and 4 5 6 7 35 37ETn 8 As expected the F1 BGH037 primer set failed to amplify from T embryo RNA Figure 1B In the T Wis T Wis embryo this primer set detected a mutant transcript representing read through transcription from exon 7 into the immediately 3 ETn insertion 6 7 Etn Figure 1B Table 2 Figure 3C In this preliminary analysis no wild type T transcript was identified in T Wis T Wis RNA using any of the primer sets These results suggest that no T Wis transcripts maintain normal exon 7 to exon 8 splicing as postulated by Herrman et al 10 To further clarify this issue the splicing of exon 7 to exon 8 was specifically examined using the forward primer F3 This primer is located within the last 35 bp of exon 7 and therefore is deleted in all of the exon 7 containing mutant transcripts already described see Table 1 Table 2 and Figure 3 RT PCR analysis with this primer confirmed that while the F1 BGH037 transcript is only produced off the T Wis allele the F3 R1 transcript is only produced off of the wild type T allele Figure 2 In some cases a prominent band larger than the expected wild type size was amplified by the F3 R1 primers from T Wis T Wis embryo RNA Figure 2 Sequence analysis showed that this larger T Wis T Wis specific band represented two additional aberrant transcripts Table 2and Figure 3C Notably these two products were never observed in T Wis RNA Figure 2 A shorter variant contained the intact 3 end of exon 7 and 60 nt of read through transcription into the ETn element spliced to exon 8 7 60ETn 8 Given that the BGH037 primer is contained within the 60 nt of ETn read through this species is not necessarily distinct from the 6 7 ETn transcript amplified by F1 BGH037 as both could be amplified from the same hypothetical RNA 6 7 60ETn 8 The longer variant contained the intact 3 end of exon 7 and 60 nt of read through into the ETn element spliced to a 37 nt mini exon of ETn sequence then spliced to exon 8 7 60ETn 37ETn 8 The 37 nt ETn mini exon was the same sequence found in the 4 5 6 7 35 37ETn 8 and 6 7 35 37ETn 8 products described above This species is also not necessarily distinct from the 6 7 ETn transcript amplified by F1 BGH037 as both could be amplified from the same hypothetical RNA 6 7 60ETn 37ETn 8 Alternatively the 6 7 ETn product might have amplified from an RNA 6 7 ETn where an unknown amount of the ETn insertion was transcribed and the transcript terminated in ETn sequence without being spliced to exon 8 Overall wild type exon 7 to exon 8 splicing was never identified in transcripts produced from the T Wis allele of T The characterization of T Wis allele transcripts presented here confirms that the intron 7 donor splice site is indeed non functional such that wild type T mRNA is never produced Furthermore the exon 1 7 ETn transcript predicted by Herrmann et al 10 was identified However at least 7 other T Wis mutant transcripts are also produced Figure 3C All of these transcripts serve to bypass the mutated splice donor site either by splicing over exon 7 activating a cryptic splice site within exon 7 or transcribing through exon 7 into the adjacent ETn sequences The cryptic exon 7 splice site used CCT GTGAGT is a strong match to the C A AG GT A G AGT splice donor consensus It is important to note that in addition to the exon 4 to 8 exon 5 to 8 and exon 6 to 8 splicing events detected here the potential remains that transcripts resulting from exon 1 to 8 exon 2 to 8 and or exon 3 to 8 splicing events are produced but were not discovered Genetically the T Wis allele acts as a dominant negative in that T Wis T Wis embryos have a more severe phenotype than the null T T embryos However the biochemical nature of this dominant negative effect is not known This study confirms previous work 13 showing the existence of a transcript that would result in a truncated protein if translated Because the DNA binding T domain would be intact this hypothetical protein could compete with the wild type protein producing a dominant negative effect Alternatively the presence of heterologous Etn element sequences in T Wis transcripts may stimulate posttranscriptional gene silencing by an RNA induced silencing complex RISC based RNAi degradation pathway which could target degradation of wild type transcripts 14 Conclusions We have shown that disruption of a single splice donor site within a multi exon locus can lead to a dramatic misregulation of RNA splicing A straightforward prediction suggests that in T Wis transcripts splicing out of exon 7 would simply fail and result in a transcript terminating with the ETn element In reality the effect is much more complex cautioning against the use of straightforward assumptions in predicting the molecular consequences of genetic alterations Methods T
