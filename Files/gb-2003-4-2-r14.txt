 Background Lateral gene transfer Lateral gene transfer LGT has been generally accepted for some time as exemplified by the endosymbiotic hypothesis of organelle origin 1 2 Nevertheless a long standing background of general conviction has held that LGT is rare especially between distant organisms However the modern era of genomics has been accompanied by increasingly numerous claims that LGT is frequent 3 4 5 6 and there now seems little doubt that LGT exerts a significant influence upon evolutionary histories Indeed it has even been asserted that vertical evolutionary patterns of descent might be impossibly masked by rampant events of LGT and that in fact instead of bifurcating phylogenetic trees a reticulate net like pattern exists 7 8 9 On the other hand others urge a more balanced perspective pointing out that alternative explanations for apparent cases of LGT have not always been considered 10 11 12 13 14 The rationale for explanations other than LGT for genealogical incongruities such as hidden paralogies and reconstruction artifacts have been presented in comprehensive detail by Glansdorff 15 Woese 16 contends that the rRNA tree is a valid representation of organismal genealogy that LGT was rampant only before the initial bifurcation of the universal phylogenetic tree and that LGT has become progressively more restricted as a function of elapsed evolutionary time Using the aminoacyl tRNA synthases as an example of the modular type entities asserted to be most amenable to LGT Woese concludes that the genealogical trace of vertical gene flow is readable despite a significant jumbling influence of LGT If correct this allows the optimistic viewpoint that the complex interplay of vertical gene descent and LGT can be deciphered to yield correct evolutionary histories provided that sufficiently detailed studies are done Approaches for detection of LGT events are either phylogenetic or parametric Phylogenetic approaches depend on congruence of phylogenetic trees Aside from technical difficulties of inferring high quality trees conflicts between trees under comparison are not necessarily due to LGT but can arise from coincidental loss of divergent paralogs in different widely spaced lineages or from convergent evolution Parametric approaches for detection of LGT include but are not limited to the analysis of nucleotide composition dinucleotide frequencies and codon usage biases Lawrence and Ochman 17 used such parametric analysis to identify a set of Escherichia coli genes 17 5 of the genome having putative origin by LGT and this has stimulated much discussion High rates of both false positives and false negatives have been asserted by others 18 19 but this is tempered by presentation of a rationale for why phylogenetic and different parametric methods detect different gene subsets 20 21 22 A consensus seems to be emerging that the most proficient attempts to reconstruct evolutionary events will employ a multifaceted approach that combines tree inference with parametric analysis in a biological context 21 22 Lawrence and Ochman 21 provide a number of examples of how the context of biological information can assist the analysis and this approach is implemented herein If each member of a linked group of genes is already represented elsewhere in a genome their origin by LGT is a distinct possibility as their transfer en bloc as an operon unit would have required only a single evolutionary event During an ongoing analysis of the genomic distribution of tryptophan pathway genes we observed two such cases that is where one set of genes was phylogenetically congruent in contrast to the incongruence of redundant gene copies that were linked to one another We have evaluated the evidence for the alternative possibilities of LGT or ancient paralogy as reported here A block of Trp pathway genes in Xylella The phylogenetic incongruence of trpR a regulatory gene in Xylella fastidiosa led to recognition of a low GC gene block in X fastidiosa The tryptophan repressor TrpR is quite limited in its phylogenetic distribution being consistently present only within the enteric lineage as shown in the protein tree of Figure 1 Here TrpR of Shewanella putrefaciens marks the outlying sequence of the enteric lineage shown in gray Outside the boundaries of the enteric lineage only Coxiella burnetii X fastidiosa and two chlamydial species are thus far known to possess trpR The distribution of trpR in the later three lineages is phylogenetically incongruent because they are widely spaced from one another on the 16S rRNA tree In Chlamydia trachomatis and Chlamydophila psittaci trpR is positioned near structural genes of tryptophan biosynthesis but no indication of recent origin by LGT of genes in this region was obtained 23 X fastidiosa trpR is separated by three genes from two structural genes of tryptophan biosynthesis These latter genes do not appear to be essential for the primary task of tryptophan biosynthesis as all seven genes of tryptophan biosynthesis are represented elsewhere in the genome within one of two operons Thus in X fastidiosa the incongruous phylogenetic position of trpR the redundancy of the trp linked genes encoding trpAa and trpAb and the distinct phylogenetic incongruence of the latter gene pair all supported a reasonable possibility of origin by LGT The tryptophan supraoperon of Anabaena Nostoc All cyanobacteria possess each of the seven Trp pathway genes at dispersed loci and individual trees of proteins corresponding to these dispersed genes are phylogenetically congruent Although this generalization also applies to Anabaena Nostoc this latter lineage is unique among cyanobacteria in its possession of an additional set of Trp pathway genes lacking only trpC that coexist within an apparent operon As shown in Figure 2 both Anabaena and Nostoc exhibit the same relative order of operonic trp genes trp Aa trp Ab trp D trpEa trpEb trpB trpAa and trpAb are fused as indicated in Figure 2with a filled bar and in the text by the bullet in the notation trpAa trpAb In Anabaena qor encoding NADPH quinone reductase has been inserted between trpD and trpEa Another qor paralog is present elsewhere in the genome of Anabaena Nostoc also has two qor paralogs but neither resides within the tryptophan operon Other cyanobacteria lack qor homologs altogether In Nostoc tyrP1 encoding tyrosinase has been inserted between trpEa and trpEb All other cyanobacteria including Anabaena lack tyrP1 The two trp operons are less compact than frequently observed elsewhere and relatively large intergenic spacing exists especially in N punctiforme The only instance of translational coupling is between trpAa trpAb and trpD in N punctiforme The tryptophan operons appear to be nested within what could be a larger unit of transcription that is reminiscent of what has been called a supraoperon in Bacillus subtilis 24 The genes comprising the supraoperon of B subtilis are aroG aroB aroH trpAaBDCEbEa hisH b tyrA p aroF A hierarchy of internal promoters and terminators exists for differential control of the B subtilis supraoperon The Anabaena Nostoc linkage group is additionally reminiscent of the B subtilis supraoperon in the presence of aroB and tyrA Although B subtilis does not have aroA I represented in its supraoperon as do Anabaena and Nostoc aroA I is the homology class of three possible DAHP synthase homologs distributed in nature 25 26 27 that is utilized by B subtilis A number of supraoperon gene insertions have occurred outside of the trp operon as well These differ for Anabaena and Nostoc as depicted in Figure 2 Anabaena has genes encoding aph and a hypothetical gene open reading frame ORF inserted between aroB and the trpAa trpAb fusion The aph gene encodes an uncharacterized protein of the defined alkaline phosphatases metalloenzyme superfamily group COG1524 in the COGS database Among cyanobacteria only Nostoc has homologs of these two Anabaena genes although they are not inserted in the Nostoc supraoperon Nostoc has frnE encoding a thiol disulfide isomerase inserted between tyrA p and aroB Four subclasses of tyrA are defined according to the substrate specificities of the TyrA gene product tyrA p specific for prephenate tyrA a specific for arogenate tyrA c accepts either prephenate or arogenate and tyrA p has broad specificity but exhibits a distinct preference for prephenate Among all cyanobacteria only Nostoc possesses frnE In their genomes outside the supraoperon boundaries Nostoc and Anabaena possess a full complement of genes for biosynthesis of tryptophan tyrosine and phenylalanine Even these extra supraoperonic genes of the Anabaena Nostoc lineage are represented by multiple paralogs in many cases Figure 2 If one considers the single copy assemblage of aromatic pathway genes present in the Synechocystis Synechococcus Prochlorococcus lineage as a fundamental complement of genes common to all cyanobacteria the Anabaena Nostoc genomic repertoire contains substantial redundancy Thus Anabaena has two additional extra operonic paralogs of aroA I and trpD In addition to extra operonic free standing copies of trpAa and trpAb a second fused gene trpAa trpAb_2 encoding the two domains of anthranilate synthase is present in Anabaena Nostoc has two extra operonic copies of aroA I aroB and trpD All cyanobacteria possess AroA of the I class aroA I While this is also true of the Anabaena Nostoc lineage in fact having multiple copies both Anabaena and Nostoc possess an additional gene encoding AroA of the I class aroA I All cyanobacteria possess a tyrA gene of the arogenate specificity class tyrA a but the Anabaena Nostoc supraoperons also possess a tyrA gene deemed to be a cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase 28 with a favored specificity for prephenate tyrA p C A B R A J N K and McNally A unpublished observation Figure 3shows an evolutionary scenario using a Fitch diagram 29 that depicts the suggested origin of trpD paralogs via two gene duplication events Dp1 and Dp2 that preceded the node of speciation divergence Sp4 to Nostoc Npu and Anabaena Asp Consistent with the latter conclusion Npu TrpD_1 exhibits greater identity with its ortholog Asp TrpD_1 than with its paralogs Npu TrpD_2 and Npu TrpD_3 Likewise Npu TrpD_2 and Npu TrpD_3 exhibit greater identity with their Asp orthologs than with their Npu paralogs Since the basic single copy repertoire of dispersed aromatic pathway genes shown in Figure 2for Synechocystis Ssp is representative of other cyanobacteria such as Synechococcus Syn and Prochlorococcus Pmu and is also present at dispersed extra operonic loci of Anabaena and Nostoc an obvious possibility would seem to be that the genes of the supraoperon originated by LGT in a common ancestor of Anabaena and Nostoc If so speciation was followed by different species specific gene insertion events Because the divergence of Anabaena and Nostoc was relatively recent evidence for LGT by analysis of GC content codon usage or dinucleotide frequency might be forthcoming A number of distinctive properties of the supraoperon gene block represent items of biological context as discussed by Lawrence and Ochman 21 that potentially could provide excellent tracking clues about the identity of the putative donor in LGT These include the overall gene organization of the trp operon for which many microbial patterns are known the extremely rare gene order of trpEa trpEb instead of the typical order trpEb trpEa the fusion of genes encoding the alpha trpAa and beta trpAb subunits of anthranilate synthase a fusion that exists in only a limited number of other taxa and the presence of operonic genes exhibiting distinctive homology subtypes aroA I and tyrA p Results and discussion Lateral gene transfer of a block of genes in Xylella The trpR gene in X fastidiosa was previously noted 23 to have anomalously low GC content relative to that of the genome Low GC blocks of genes have been attributed to LGT before for example argF present in E coli K 12 but not in other strains is bracketed with unidentified high GC 59 genes that together comprise a distinctive block of LGT genes 30 The flanking genes of trpR were accordingly analyzed for GC content Figure 4shows that trpR in X fastidiosa is at one end of a block of seven genes all of which have a distinctively low GC content highlighted in green compared to the flanking genes highlighted in yellow If the block of low GC genes in Xylella really reflects an alien origin differences in dinucleotide frequencies might be expected as such context biases differ from organism to organism A 3 1 dinucleotide bias third nucleotide position in a codon analysis algorithm followed by the first nucleotide position in the succeeding codon was utilized as it is the dinucleotide that is least restricted by amino acid preference and codon usage in individual genes 31 The 3 1 dinucleotide frequencies were calculated for the entire block of low GC genes as well as for the immediately flanking genes These results presented in Figure 5with a set of four selected dinucleotides shows that dinucleotides frequencies of the flanking genes were within a variance of about 4 from genomic frequencies whereas the low GC block of genes exhibited recognizably greater variances from the genomic dinucleotides frequencies of X fastidiosa The co variation of 3 1 dinucleotide frequencies of genes in the low GC gene block of Xylella with the corresponding genomic frequencies was also evaluated using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient Table 1illustrates the data used to compare the Xylella trpR gene and the Xylella genome A p value of 0 730 indicated that the 3 1 dinucleotide frequencies of trpR from Xylella did not exhibit significant co variation with the frequencies of the Xylella genome In contrast the 3 1 dinucleotide frequencies of trpR from Chlamydia trachomatis did exhibit significant co variation with the frequencies characteristic of the C trachomatis genome p value 0 031 These analyses are consistent with occurrence of recent LGT in X fastidiosa What is the origin of the LGT gene block Gene organization is subject to constant change For precisely this reason the overall gene organization within the low GC gene block might implicate a donor organism because the LGT event is inferred to be recent Because the enteric lineage is a reasonable source of the LGT gene block it is pertinent that the gene organization around trpR is highly conserved in the enteric lineage Without exception trpR in the enteric lineage is preceded upstream by a gene encoding soluble lytic murein transglycosylase slt hemK is usually positioned directly downstream except for the Haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans H influenzae Pasteurella multocida grouping where the downstream gene encodes a monofunctional biosynthetic peptidoglycan transglycosylase mtgA No genomes of the enteric lineage were found to possess trpR in a context of flanking genes that resembled the X fastidiosa gene organization The LGT block of Xylella genes conceivably could have originated from a donor similar to a common ancestor of the chlamydiae before the massive gene reduction associated with the chlamydial lifestyle This would be consistent with the low GC content of both the chlamydial genome and the LGT block of genes as well as with the observation that chlamydiae and Xylella are the only two known taxa where trpR is positioned near structural genes of the tryptophan pathway Direct comparison of chlamydial trpAa and trpAb genes with those of the Xylella operon is not possible because all chlamydial genomes thus far mapped lack trpAa and trpAb 23 In this context sequencing of genomes from closely related free living relatives of the chlamydiae could be informative The currently available chlamydial genomes also lack other genes of the low GC block C burnetii was also considered as a possible source of the low GC gene block in X fastidiosa because it possesses trpR This potential LGT event seems ruled out because trpR is not near any structural genes encoding TrpAa and TrpAb in C burnetti C burnetii TrpAa and TrpAb are not close to the corresponding X fastidiosa enzymes on phylogenetic trees and C burnetii lacks the remaining genes in the low GC gene block of X fastidiosa If LGT accounts for the low GC gene block in X fastidiosa how recent was this event Presumably it was sufficiently recent that significant amelioration to the genomic GC content has not yet occurred The closest sequenced genome to Xylella is Xanthomonas Genomes representing two species of the latter genus have been sequenced and both lack the low GC gene block Therefore the putative LGT event occurred some time after lineage divergence of Xylella and Xanthomonas On the other hand LGT presumably has predated speciation in the Xylella genus as all three strains of Xylella in the National Center for Biotechnology Information NCBI database possess the low GC gene block The T 2score of Hooper and Berg 31 measures the covariance of 3 1 dinucleotide signatures and is designed to recognize very recent imports of alien genes by LGT T 2scores calculated for the low GC gene block of X fastidiosa were not above the required threshold for very recent gene imports What is the function of the low GC block of genes in Xyella Within the low GC block trpR is separated by four ORFs from genes encoding the two subunits of anthranilate synthase trpAa and trpAb These probably do not function for general tryptophan biosynthesis since paralogs of these genes which exhibit a phylogenetically congruent context of gene organization exist elsewhere in the genome Figure 6 The latter genes are located within either of two separate operon clusters Figure 6 with the GC content characteristic of X fastidiosa The GC content values for the latter genes trpAa trpAb trpB trpC trpD trpEa and trpEb are 52 49 54 55 51 59 and 55 respectively Furthermore Figure 6shows that the organization of the full complement of trp pathway genes into two operons in X fastidiosa is similar or identical to that of some of its nearest neighbors on the 16S rRNA tree although the Xylella operons exhibit atypically large intergenic spacings None of these neighbors possesses the low GC block of Xylella genes illustrated in Figure 4 Hence the two operons shown in Figure 6can be inferred to be responsible for primary tryptophan biosynthesis throughout this clade Genes encoding the two anthranilate synthase subunits trpAa and trpAb and aryl CoA ligase acl surely belong to an operon as translational coupling is evident from the overlap of start and stop codons Figure 4 Acl exhibits strong similarity to coenzyme F390 synthetase of methanogenic archaea as well as to phenylacetate CoA ligase of E coli As Xylella does not appear to make the F420 cofactor that is the substrate of F390 synthetase the function of Acl is likely to be closer to phenylacetate CoA ligase The aromatic ring is highly stable and CoA thioesterification can provide chemical activation allowing cleavage of the aromatic ring as exemplified by catabolism of benzoate 4 hydroxybenzoate and anthranilate 32 Because acl is tightly organized with trpAa and trpAb it seems feasible that anthranilate might be the substrate of acl An anthranilate CoA ligase has been described recently in Azoarcus evansii by Schuhle et al 33 The Xylella Acl exhibited greater identity with phenylacetate CoA ligase of E coli than with anthranilate CoA ligase of A evansii but a given substrate specificity within homology groups often can be associated with different subgroupings 25 34 If anthranilate is indeed the substrate of Acl in Xylella it would be a futile cycle if anthranilate were formed biosynthetically only to be subsequently catabolized Therefore it seems more likely that the activation of anthranilate could be a step in the formation of a siderophore or antibiotic compound that is assembled by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase mechanism see Quadri et al 35 and references therein for numerous examples Pyochelin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa exemplifies an iron siderophore whose peptide based synthesis depends on CoA activated salicylate closely related to anthranilate as a starter unit 36 While it appears likely that trpR aryl CoA ligase trpAa and trpAb belong to a common functional unit the possible roles of the remaining three genes downstream of acl are problematic at the present time The Anabaena Nostocgene blocks The large gene blocks in Anabaena and Nostoc that begin with aroA I and end with tyrAr p exhibited GC ratios that were similar to that of the host genome Table 2 This is not necessarily inconsistent with their possible origin by LGT because the GC ratio of a putative donor genome could have been coincidentally similar to that of Anabaena and Nostoc Accordingly the 3 1 dinucleotide frequencies of the aroA I tyrA c gene block and the immediately flanking genes were analyzed but these dinucleotide frequencies also did not suggest LGT Figure 7shows that dinucleotide frequencies did not deviate more than 5 from the genomic frequencies across the aroA I tyrA c gene block This contrasts with the distinctly greater deviation of 3 1 dinucleotide frequencies within the low GC gene block of Xylella which is shown on the same scale as the Anabaena data Codon usage was analyzed throughout the gene block and also failed to implicate LGT Figure 8exemplifies this with a comparison of the pair of TrpAa domains in Anabaena one encoded from within the gene block and the other outside As Xylella also possesses a TrpAa pair one encoded from within the low GC gene block and the other outside the analyses of these are also included in Figure 8as a kind of positive control In Anabaena two bars on the right of each panel the codon usage for leucine serine arginine glycine valine and proline was very similar for the TrpAa domain of TrpAa TrpAb in the aroA I tyrA p gene block and for the stand alone TrpAa protein This contrasts with the results obtained for the two Xylella TrpAa proteins one in the low GC gene block on the far left and the other second bar in each panel encoded by the gene in the trpAaAbBD operon Figure 6 Thus in contrast to the Anabaena TrpAa pair the Xylella TrpAaAb pair exhibited distinctly different codon usage Although this result is certainly consistent with an explanation of LGT in Xylella one cannot be certain that the different functional roles of TrpAa domains might be associated with differing intra genomic patterns of codon usage that are not yet well characterized 37 Analysis of protein trees We evaluated whether the closest BLAST hits using as queries the amino acid sequences corresponding to the operonic genes of Anabaena or Nostoc would be with other cyanobacteria and therefore consistent with origin by gene duplication or with another taxon grouping consistent with LGT In either case one would expect that the sequences encoded by the operonic genes of Anabaena would be the best matches for the operonic genes of Nostoc as was indeed the case For all of the operonic Anabaena Nostoc Trp pathway proteins used as queries homolog sequences from other cyanobacteria Synechocystis Synechococcus Prochlorococcus were the remaining top hits returned in the BLAST queue As BLAST hits must be considered imperfect indicators of nearest neighbor homologs 38 the conclusion that the operonic trp pathway genes are of cyanobacterial lineage origin was confirmed more rigorously by examination of extensive trees available upon request constructed for each trp protein of Anabaena and Nostoc For the Trp pathway proteins all the cyanobacterial proteins clustered together regardless of whether they were Anabaena or Nostoc paralogs or whether they were the singly represented proteins of Synechocystis Synechococcus or Prochlorococcus The same result was obtained for AroA I protein trees All the redundant genes exhibited identity relationships that suggested their origin by one or more gene duplication events in the common ancestor of Anabaena and Nostoc that is exactly as diagrammed in Figure 3 A different result was obtained for genes encoding AroB and TyrA AroB sequences in nature are rather divergent All of the cyanobacterial AroB proteins form a compact cluster in the AroB tree including the non operonic Anabaena Nostoc aroB genes except for those encoded by the Anabaena Nostoc supraoperons The supraoperonic AroB proteins occupy a tree position that is not particularly close to other AroB proteins the closest matches being on the order of 30 35 identity with some enteric bacteria A similar situation applies to TyrA p All cyanobacteria possess the arogenate dehydrogenase specificity class denoted TyrA a of the TyrA superfamily The additional TyrA p present only in Anabaena and Nostoc and located as the carboxy terminal gene of the supraoperon exhibits identities of 39 43 with the TyrA p proteins of some enteric bacteria These results for supraoperonic aroB and tyrA p could be consistent with LGT but with no clear donor candidates available On the other hand origin as ancient paralogs is also a possibility The trpAa trpAbfusion A particularly fortuitous gene that could favor or disfavor the hypothesis of LGT of the aroA I tyrA p gene block in Anabaena Nostoc is trpAa trpAb a fusion corresponding to two genes that are usually separate free standing As only a limited number of trpAa trpAb fusions are known possible LGT donors can be evaluated Organisms known to possess the trpAa trpAb fusion are listed at the top of Table 3 Another small group of trpAa trpAb fusions are known which are dedicated to phenazine biosynthesis and which form a distinct cluster These are denoted trpAa trpAb_phz in Table 3 Thus far the trpAa trpAb_phz fusions are limited to species of Pseudomonas and Streptomyces pabAa and pabAb are homologs of trpAa and trpAb and the distribution of fusions involving these domains are also listed in Table 3to give a general sense of the frequencies of such gene fusions A variety of data G X and R A J unpublished observation indicates that equivalent fusions often arise independently of one another in widely spaced lineages Figure 9shows a segment of the 16S rRNA tree that contains all of the trpAa trpAb fusions which are known so far Cyanobacteria other than Anabaena Nostoc lack the fusion as do all nearby lineages The fusion is present in the cluster that includes Rhodopseudomonas palustris Rhizobium loti Brucella melitensis Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Sinorhizobium meliloti A tumefaciens which is not shown in Figure 9 is virtually identical to S meliloti Additional phylogenetically spaced fusions are present in Thermomonospora fusca Azospirillum brasilense and Legionella pneumophila Other fusions that involve trpAa or trpAb homologs also occur in nature as shown in Table 3 and a degree of care is needed to avoid confusion between them A phylogenetic tree consisting of all free standing TrpAa and TrpAb proteins was constructed together with the corresponding two domains of the TrpAa TrpAb fusions available upon request Surprisingly each of the 10 fusion domains clustered tightly on the TrpAa and TrpAb trees to the exclusion of the free standing TrpAa and TrpAb domains This is consistent with a single ancestral fusion event but requires the assumption of multiple LGT events However it is surprising that no free standing domains that is close homologs of the original fusion partners cluster with either of the two sets of 10 fusion domains This might suggest an alternative to LGT namely that there has been extreme sequence convergence because of strong selection for appropriate residues mediating domain domain interactions If so it is possible that trpAa trpAb fusions occurred as a number of independent events followed by strong convergence Figure 9shows the individual genomic organization of trp pathway genes in the 16S rRNA tree sector that is relevant to the trpAa trpAb fusion The Anabaena Nostoc lineage is unique in having trpAa trpAb linked to other trp pathway genes and is further unique in having an additional set of freestanding genes encoding TrpAa and TrpAb Although generally uncommon complete dispersal of Trp pathway genes is characteristic of the non filamentous cyanobacteria Aquifex aeolicus and Chlorobium tepidum The ancestral state of trp gene organization has been asserted G X C B N K and R J unpublished work to be trpAa Ab B D C Eb Ea an operon organization seen in contemporary Cytophaga hutchinsonii Desulfovibrio vulgaris and Coxiella burnetii Figure 9 Dynamic gene reorganization events that involve gene insertions gene scrambling gene duplications and gene dispersal are apparent from inspection of Figure 9 It is expected that LGT would most easily be recognized if it occurred relatively recently before passage of sufficient time for amelioration of alien characteristics to those of the host genome for example GC content In the case of each of the known trpAa trpAb gene fusions the absence of the gene fusion in a closely related genome implies that the gene fusion event or the LGT event occurred recently that is in the one lineage following the time of its separation from the other by speciation Thus the acquisition of trpAa trpAb by Thermomonospora fusca must have occurred by fusion or by LGT relatively recently that is after the speciation event that generated the Streptomyces lineage see Figure 9 In each of the remaining cases of trpAa trpAb fusion a relatively near time of fusion shown in Figure 9origin can be identified These are defined by points of speciation divergence between Anabaena Nostoc and other cyanobacteria between the Rhodopseudomonas Sinorhizobium cluster fusion and Caulobacter no fusion between Azospirillum brasilense fusion and Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum no fusion and between Legionella pneumophila fusion and Coxiella burnetii no fusion If any of the trpAa trpAb fusions other than the Nostoc Anabaena pair have a common origin similar flanking regions of gene organization might be expected since all of the fusions are of relatively recent origin On this criterion only R loti B melitensis A tumefaciens and S meliloti exhibited similarities of flanking gene organization and this is phylogenetically congruent These observations imply that within the span of phylogeny shown in Figure 9 the trpAa trpAb fusion may have occurred independently as many as seven times Interdomain linker regions In fusion proteins an interdomain linker region of critical length and mobility is important to facilitate specific domain domain interactions Fusions of independent origin might be expected to exhibit a variety of linker regions Particular constraints undoubtedly limit this variety and such constraints might be more stringent for some domain combinations than others In the case of particularly stringent constraints similar linker regions would not necessarily demonstrate a common origin Figure 10shows an alignment of the carboxy terminal region of the TrpAa domain the linker region and the amino terminal region of the TrpAb domain for all of the fusion proteins depicted in Figure 9 as well as that from A tumefaciens Only the two operonic fusion proteins from Anabaena and Nostoc and the four rhizobial fusion proteins Mlo Bme Rme and Atu exhibit linker regions of identical length and obvious similarity The paralog TrpAa TrpAb protein of Anabaena sp Asp_2 seems to have a distinctly different linker and it maybe that the two fusions in Anabaena arose as two independent events The partial sequences shown in Figure 10are spaced to indicate the seven independent events of gene fusion that are suggested Function of the Anabaena Nostocgene blocks The gene blocks shown in Figure 2encode the entire tryptophan pathway except for trpC as well as the first two enzymes of the common aromatic pathway and the key enzyme of tyrosine biosynthesis Multiple enzymes catalyzing the same reaction have been described in developmental systems where differential regulation of isoenzymes are deployed in different temporal and spatial contexts Filamentous cyanobacteria such as Anabaena and Nostoc subscribe to a developmental program of heterocyst formation that is widely considered the primitive state and that correlates with their exceedingly large genomes Unicellular cyanobacteria such as Synechocystis Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus have far smaller genomes and lack the ability to fix nitrogen heterocyst formation It therefore seems to be a distinct possibility that the gene blocks diagrammed in Figure 2 as well as additional gene duplicates are specifically involved in specialized capabilities of Nostoc Anabaena that do not exist in other cyanobacteria In terms of the evolutionary scenario the Anabaena Nostoc lineage may reflect the ancestral state and modern unicellular cyanobacteria may be derived genomes that are smaller and more streamlined reductive evolution Conclusions Operon displacement Alien genes that may be subject to possible LGT can generally expect a hostile reception in that they lack a history of functional integration with the resident genome Genes that offer immediate selective advantages for example antibiotic resistance are likely to persist The acquisition of a completely new functional capability will often require an entire suite of novel genes and such recruitment is certainly easier to envision if all of the genes arrive en bloc that is as an operon Once a primary biosynthetic pathway such as that responsible for tryptophan formation has been established and integrated with the individualistic metabolic circuitry of a given organism one does not expect facile displacement of resident genes This should apply even if the incoming genes all coexist as an operon We have found only two examples of LGT of whole Trp operons that of trpAa Ab B D C Eb Ea from the enteric lineage to coryneform bacteria and to Helicobacter as discussed earlier Has there been separate lateral gene transfer of individual genes According to the foregoing rationale isolated genes that participate in multi step processes would not generally be expected to have much success in LGT In some cases analog genes encode enzymes that catalyze the same reaction in a multi step pathway and one analog gene might conceivably displace another Lack of enough information about genomic representation of such analog genes can lead to incorrect inferences of LGT For example the initial discovery of plant type AroA II in bacteria led to the assumption of LGT from plant to bacterium Elucidation of the fuller genomic representation of aroA II 27 and refs therein demonstrated the origin of aroA II in Bacteria and plants probably have received aroA II from the Bacteria via endosymbiosis A similar outcome seems quite possible with respect to the eukaryotic fructose 1 6 bisphosphate aldolase in Xylella species Phylogenetic incongruities that involve such analogs can pose great difficulties in distinguishing LGT from vertical progressions of differential analog losses in different lineages Specialized Trpgenes not required for primary biosynthesis In this article we focus on a number of cases where at least several trp genes are linked thus providing analytical advantages offered by the analysis of more than one gene These genes are also redundant and phylogenetically incongruent in contrast to coexisting homolog genes that are part of a full phylogenetically congruent set Both of the latter are consistent with origin by LGT but unrecognized ancient paralogy is also possible In the first case the homologs coexisting in one organism are xenologs whereas in the latter case they are paralogs A relatively simple example is the trpAa trpAb pair originally denoted phnA phnB in Pseudomonas aeruginosa 39 This comprises an anthranilate synthase that is not strictly required for primary tryptophan biosynthesis and that is uniquely expressed during stationary phase physiology 40 Why the generation of anthranilate under these conditions would be of value is unknown but phylogenetic trees clearly show phnA phnB to be xenologs originating from the enteric lineage via LGT G X and R A J unpublished data In this case genes that function for primary biosynthesis in the donor genome did not displace the corresponding genes in the recipient genome but have instead been recruited to a specialized function In Streptomyces coelicolor trpAa trpAb trpB trpD aroA II are contained within a large cluster dedicated to antibiotic synthesis 41 Calcium dependent antibiotic CDC contains tryptophan and presumably the feedback resistant variety of enzyme encoded by aroA II ensures enhanced precursor flow to tryptophan during antibiotic production Detailed studies have not yet been done to see whether the CDC gene cluster originated via LGT or reflects ancient paralogy In this article we have discussed at length the Xylella and cyanobacterial gene blocks that seem likely to have specialized functional roles other than primary biosynthesis The Xylella genes are associated with other genes that presumably dictate a fate for anthranilate other than as a primary precursor of tryptophan We suspect that selective advantages conferred by this specialized operon accommodated successful LGT to Xylella The Anabaena Nostoc supraoperon is reminiscent of the S coelicolor system in the inclusion of AroA I which might enhance precursor flow to chorismate Although the Anabaena Nostoc operon only lacks trpC its features of gene fusion and gene organization are novel It might perhaps have an unknown physiological function related to the complex developmental programs unique to heterocystous cyanobacteria We conclude that in this case the operonic trp genes are ancient paralogs of a dispersed set of trp genes engaged in primary biosynthesis Against a backdrop where organisms generally possess highly efficient and integrated pathways of tryptophan biosynthesis displacement of resident genes by LGT of the corresponding genes is relatively infrequent Aside from the broadly distributed primary pathway highly specialized pathways are known that utilize some or all tryptophan pathway enzymes and these pathways can originate by recruitment of paralog genes derived from the primary pathway genes 42 The genes of such specialized operons may diverge considerably to meet the demands of a novel functional role In a contemporary organism this might have the status of unrecognized or recognized paralogy as we suggest for the Anabaena Nostoc gene block However such an operon module also has strong potential for xenologous transfer because of its specialized functional potential The tryptophan pathway exemplifies the situation where paralogs can be engaged in primary amino acid biosynthesis widespread or in a variety of specialized pathways narrowly distributed Aside from the extent to which the specialized pathways may be individually intriguing and important this study illustrates that case by case analysis can distinguish paralogs or xenologs from their homologs engaged in primary biosynthesis This conclusion is encouraging as it shows that both vertical and horizontal events of gene transfer can be deduced to track evolutionary history Materials and methods Dinucleotide frequencies The CODONW program 43 was used to calculate 3 1 dinucleotide frequencies third base of a given codon followed by the first base of the next codon For whole genome calculations genome nucleotide sequences ffn file were obtained from GenBank 44 Perl scripts were used to eliminate the defline and assemble all genomic ORFs together for CODONW calculation The length from UNIX wc command divided by 3 was used to validate the absence of frameshift errors Pairwise covariation of 3 1 dinucleotide frequencies was assessed by the Spearman rank correlation coefficient 45 a nonparametric rank statistic for testing monotonic relationships T 2values were kindly provided by Hooper 31 Codon usage Codon usage for individual genes was computed with the CDONTREE program 46 Codon usage values for whole genomes were obtained from the Codon Usage Database 47 48 Phylogenetic trees 16S rRNA subtrees were derived from the Ribosomal Database site 49 50 Unrooted phylogenetic protein trees were derived by input of the indicated homolog amino acid sequences into the ClustalW program Version 1 4 51 Manual alignment adjustments were made as needed with the assistance of the BioEdit multiple alignment tool of Hall 52 The refined multiple alignment was used as input for generation of a phylogenetic tree using the program package PHYLIP 53 The neighbor joining and Fitch programs 51 were used to obtain distance based trees The distance matrix was obtained using Protdist with a Dayhoff Pam matrix The Seqboot and Consense programs were then used to assess the statistical strength of the tree using bootstrap resampling Neighbor joining and Fitch trees yielded similar clusters and arrangement of taxa within them Bootstrap values indicate the number of times a node was supported in 1 000 resampling replications Identification of linker regions Fusion proteins were aligned ClustalW with one another and with the assemblage of free standing proteins corresponding to the amino terminal and the carboxy terminal domains of the fusion proteins The boundaries of each domain were defined by the last highly conserved residues of the amino terminal domain and the early highly conserved residues of the carboxy terminal domain The Conserved Domain Database was useful as a reference guide 54 55 Comparative genome analysis Most of the comparative genome analysis was carried out using the database and tools of ERGO 56
