 We Are Pragmatic Let us pause during the New York Times year long celebration of its 100 year march to journalistic dominance to glance at the newspaper that may dominate the next century of print journalism if there is one USA Today a newspaper that scarcely needs a Web site though of course it has one because its front is a home page in print For all its obvious yearning for marketability and user friendliness USA Today built its circulation without resorting to tabloid sensationalism From the law courts to the tennis courts it covers the news straightforwardly But what does McPaper stand for What is the philosophy of USA Today Large circulation American newspapers to be sure don t market philosophy except sideways A major newspaper is supposed to be a team effort a nonideological pursuit of the objective truth Asking for its official philosophy is like demanding the creed of the Chicago Bulls The likeliest payoff is a slogan on the order of Get it Over With a newspaper Get it Out is about the best you can hope for But USA Today is the lengthened byline of one man former Gannett CEO Al Neuharth and the flamboyant South Dakotan spent years preaching the philosophy of his paper both before and after its September 1982 launch Neuharth it turns out is a more important 20th century philosopher than anyone expected We Find Al Philosophical the in house headline might read His struggle through the start up and red ink of USA Today succeeded in bending daily journalism to the principles of classical American pragmatism For years media critics pounded USA Today An explosion in a paint factory the flashdance of editing the junk food of journalism Asked early on if USA Today could qualify as a top newspaper the Washington Post s Ben Bradlee replied If it can then I m in the wrong business Post literary critic Jonathan Yardley condemned USA Today for giving its readers only what they want No spinach no bran no liver Critics cast Neuharth as the disreputable heir of William Randolph Hearst But try a different succession William James John Dewey Al Neuharth No William James didn t take off on Buscapades And John Dewey didn t festoon the Columbia philosophy department with the white onyx and black marble of USA Today s Rosslyn Va headquarters But what after all were the beliefs of the pragmatists those American heroes whose comeback in the intellectual world through present day scions like Richard Rorty and Donald Davidson now makes them founts of wisdom to philosophers around the world James urged us to think of true beliefs as those that point to successful actions most of which result in the sense of pragmatism s coiner Charles Sander Peirce from a convergence of belief among our community of inquirers James didn t mind if our beliefs occasionally took us a bit ahead of the evidence see his Will to Believe particularly if that passionate optimistic confidence stirred us to make the world better than it is Such sentiments are practically the anthem of USA Today which brings together the USA s community of inquirers faster than Jerry Springer unites addled families Some may see a latent liberalism in today s sense in USA Today s editorial line its espousal of gun control or publicly financed elections to name to editorial positions taken by the paper in recent weeks But the argument on these topics is no less practical in tone and substance than its more conservative recent stands in favor of public shaming as judicial punishment or its endorsement of hunting Policies are to be preferred if in proven practice they save lives or dollars On the contentious issue of gerrymandering racial or otherwise The practice is to be deplored not on grounds of high principle but because by creating safe seats for one or another party or interest group it makes elections meaningless Moreover in pursuing racial fairness there are better alternatives available James declared There can be no difference anywhere that doesn t make a difference elsewhere What paper better embodies that belief than USA Today which recently ran a graph on Rain and Drizzle The Difference The difference is the size of the drops with drizzle drops less than 0 02 inches in diameter falling close together and rains drops larger than 0 02 inches in diameter widely separated As for Dewey he threw out the false distinction between theoretical inquiry and practical decision making proclaiming that all thinking amounts to problem solving For the author of Experience and Nature and A Common Faith the smartest way to educate people was to give them the information and skills necessary to solve their problems not to point them to an authority who d tell them what to think or solve their problems for them Which would be the paper of choice for a man with such a mind set the New York Times or USA Today Dewey himself liked Peirce s definition of truth as the opinion on which all investigators are fated to be agreed More than most papers USA Today steps aside and delivers the experience that Dewey considered necessary to that convergence on solutions statistics direct lengthy quotations complete box scores Why it even runs pages entitled Solutions Trucks What Needs to Be Done Mindful of the fragility of truth and trustful of how a better truth might emerge from experimentation and debate Dewey thought we might well drop the whole concept of truth and speak more usefully of warranted assertibility Does any editorial page so clearly reflect that belief as USA Today s with its regular Opposing Opinion and cross section of positions One of Neuharth s first articulations of his metaphysics came in October 1983 in a speech to the Overseas Press Club in New York As recalled by Peter Prichard in his book The Making of McPaper Neuharth condemned the old journalism of despair a derisive technique of leaving readers discouraged or mad or indignant In its place Neuharth declared USA Today delivered a journalism of hope an enterprise one can imagine James franchising under his Will to Believe It offered reportage that chronicles the good the bad and the otherwise and leaves readers fully informed and equipped to judge what deserves their attention and support Neuharth imposed his philosophy on the newsroom Stories deliver facts and information with minimal interference from reporters eager to be literary As a result sentences are short and clear often brilliantly compressed USA Snapshots and other regular graphs abound Lengthy quotations from transcribed interviews let readers hear newsmakers directly USA Today s modular layout and bold type anticipated the typical multidimensional Web page almost inviting the finger to point and click to follow Christine Royal through the process of her cosmetic surgery to jump to the daily profiles of Olympic athletes to explore the depths of the Bosnia power struggle See displayed picture of July 1 1996 front page Headlines are supposed to emphasize the positive About the crash of a charter plane in Malaga Spain Miracle 327 survive 55 die Neuharth criticized a headline about a health study that read Death Rate Drops saying it should have read We re Living Longer Other devices ensure that USA Today s editors keep the focus on the exact community the paper covered the USA To Neuharth that meant the USA not America In a 1985 memo Neuharth threatened to transfer out of the country any editors who sloppily allowed America or Americans into the paper when they meant citizens and residents of the United States Personal pronouns anchor the headlines as they drive home an idea James and Dewey would have welcomed the USA as one big first person plural community Classics included We Move Less Often and We re in the Mood to Buy If the New York Post s candidate for immortality was Headless Body in Topless Bar USA Today s might have been USA is Eating its Vegetables Yet even in USA Today s recent in the black years the paper has been a magnet for negative media critic boilerplate In Read All About It 1995 an attack on newfangled newspapering by ousted Chicago Tribune editor James Squires the poppin mad former honcho railed that USA Today adopted an editorial philosophy designed to avoid all controversy In Who Stole the News 1995 veteran AP correspondent Mort Rosenblum recycled the standard yuck that USA Today is for people who find television too difficult Balderdash a turn of the century Deweyean might have replied Is USA Today uncontroversial because it opens up its agora presuming truth will rise from a clash of diverse debaters from all regions and classes of the national polis Can it be more simplistic than television when its front page alone regularly presents or capsulizes more than 30 different news matters far more than you ll hear about on one edition of World News Tonight USA Today s journalism fulfills the political philosophy of the Framers themselves heavily influenced by the ancient rhetoricians see Carl J Richard s The Founders and the Classics Both groups favored the Isocratic notion of a truth emerging from ongoing debate over the Socratic notion of The Truth emerging from an old kibitzer s endless dialectical probing USA Today weds that impulse to the pragmatist program If you give the people facts if they identify an authentic problematic situation in their environment if you permit them to hear multiple views they ll converge on a truth that works And so it happens every day in USA Today as much as it can in a paint factory explosion Big and small explanatory facts how airport security works the percentage of people who screen each phone call why women reject technology jobs and problematic issues animal rights standards for criminal punishment come together in a virtual Journal of Pragmatism You say the New York Times is a century old and we ought to join its celebration Nah too Cartesian Back in his early Chicago days John Dewey tried to start a newspaper He failed Al Neuharth hasn t He like James knows the meaning of cash value If James and Dewey lived today they d be reading Snapshots absorbing the blooming buzzing confusion of Across the USA and probably arranging for Al Neuharth to give a few lectures at Columbia and Harvard
