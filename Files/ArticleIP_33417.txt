 Cat Sitters Who Love Too Much Please send your questions for publication to prudence slate com Dear Prudence This question may be more of a moral or ethical sort but my behavior is being called into question and I d like it if you could answer this for me A friend asked me to watch his cat while he was abroad for two weeks I came by every day and noticed that the cat was looking a little under the weather I wasn t concerned though and thought the cat was just missing his owner I m not much of a cat person The situation got rapidly worse and one day when I came to the house the cat was obviously very very sick It could barely walk I called the owner in Europe and explained the situation and asked if I should take Kitty to the vet He said No I explained again that the cat looked to be at death s door The owner said he d take care of it when he got home in three days After I got off the phone I just couldn t leave the pathetic animal there to suffer so I took Kitty to an animal hospital where he was treated for a deadly cat stomach problem I saved the cat s life And paid a couple thousand dollars to do so The owner is refusing to reimburse me and is saying that I shouldn t have gone against his wishes I feel like I did the right thing Of course I ve written off this friendship but am I within the limits of proper behavior to demand reimbursement for Kitty s operation Or did I as the owner says intrude into an area where I didn t belong Thank you ZM Dear Z How unfortunate that you wound up looking after a pet whose owner decreed it was a Christian Science cat Let s wait three days indeed Your experience alas is a perfect example of the old saying No good deed goes unpunished Prudie is on your side however and the side of Kitty There are animal cruelty statutes which are criminal which differ from state to state but Prudie thinks your best avenue is a civil suit probably in small claims court The vet s records should attest to the cat s precarious condition You did the only humane thing One wonders what the outcome would have been had The Traveler been in residence when his pet s condition was moving toward well catatonic In any case Prudie hopes you prevail in court and that Kitty s remaining eight lives will be uneventful Prudie litigiously Dear Prudence A former almost significant other thinks I m stalking her but I m really not I need a way of conveying that without seeming like a stalker Telephone letter and direct contact are all out of the question Also it needs to fit into my budget 15 so no airplane stunts And what exactly is the line between stalking and not stalking anyway Caught 22 Dear Caught Prudie thinks you meant your signature to be Catch 22 which suggests either English is not your first language or you have made quite a Freudian slip When you say that phone letter and direct contact are out of the question Prudie infers that there may be a restraining order The line of stalking not stalking in general nonlegal terms would probably be drawn where the person feels he or she is receiving unwanted attention Being in the general proximity of such a person would be unwelcome as would written communications even skywriting Prudie suggests you convey your nonstalking status by forgetting this girl exists which means not trying to be where she is and stopping all communications of any kind That is the surefire way for her to know you are not stalking her And Prudie just saved you 15 Prudie definitively Prudie dear Don t you get just the least bit uncomfortable presuming to explain and comment on the motives of folks who choose to Are you saying you wouldn t let yourself be found in that situation Good for you Some might wonder if you would ever be invited to be in that situation but that would be very catty of them I thought the general rule was If it s not affecting you or anyone else adversely then your reactions to it are not of interest and should not be shared Or as Dear Abby might say MYOB Speaking of Hef s Harem Dear Speak To borrow a technique of our president the answer to your question depends on what the meaning of situation is Prudie has never been asked to share Hef s bed but she has been invited to both his mansions as he likes to call them And she has gone Yes Prudie is that old And the parties were quite sufficient for Prudie if you receive her drift As for the MYOB rule originated by Ann Landers a woman of whom Prudie is extremely fond Prudie must point out that her job description is specifically to mind other people s business Granted it s a thankless task but she s got a lot of karma to burn Prudie busily Dear Prudence I d like to quibble with your response to My mother taught me that one excuse is plausible Four excuses sound like you re holding back the real reason I can t go out Friday night because I have to wash my hair Besides my grandmother is sick Also I have a lot of homework Oh yes and I promised my dad I d clean the garage Universally understood translation I wouldn t be seen in public with you for a million dollars Ohio should stick with Let s do dinner instead MMD a wise woman s daughter Dear MM Your mother is wise indeed and Prudie laughed at your wonderful example In the main you are correct though there are occasions when stringing together emotionally sequential reasons as it were is useful Prudie leaves this decision to the discretion of each excuse maker Prudie plausibly
