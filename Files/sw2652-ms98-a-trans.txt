            okay guess we can go ahead um well i guess you know its you know since living in Dallas its always so hot so in the summertime i just i wear lots of shorts so because i dont work during the day   umhum   so do you work   yes uhhuh yeah i do work um   oh   and but i work at a manufacturing plant so i wear a lot of blue jeans and Tshirts   uhhuh uhhuh   but occasionally i have to get dressed up and wear panty hose and a dress and high heel shoes and i feel really uncomfortable doing that and in the plant so uh its its a problem for me   uhhuh yeah uhhuh   but normally i just wear blue jeans and a Tshirt very very comfortable i like that so much better than having to wear dress clothes   uhhuh yeah yeah and buying suits and stuff yeah because just being at home and i work at home so   umhum   i just have you know i just wear my you know my shorts and stuff like that i dont go out and spend lots of money on uh different you know suits and stuff you know   umhum umhum   but when i before i got married you know i was working so i uh   you know i had more suits and stuff then but   right   worry about all that kind of stuff   well i have plenty of suits and dress clothes because im like you when i first started working um   uhhuh   i have all these suits and blouses and skirts and mix and match and that kind of stuff   uhhuh   but now that i you know work in the manufacturing plant then its just its so much more difficult for me to to actually get dressed up to come in to work like that   right   um but occasionally i have to because uh part of my job is teaching and training and uh so you have to look just a little bit nicer than your normal grab   uhhuh when youre training right yeah   than your normal garb but im like you too uh i moved from Ohio down to here   uhhuh moved somewhere i mean   and i had mostly polyesters and wools and winter clothes and buying all these cotton clothes and then of course you have to iron them all the time thats really thats been a problem for me   winter uhhuh uhhuh yeah because i came from Wyoming and i had wool suits and wool skirts and       you know ive got all these clothes that i never wear because you cant wear them here and um   right right   the seasons are just so much different you have so much summer   umhum   and uh so then when i you know i finally get a chance to go out with my husband its like a real chore to find something nice to wear     thats true thats true   yeah   well i know i was just now um uh putting away a lot of my winter clothes     uhhuh   and i was going through here and i was thinking i havent worn this in three years   yeah   and because its a wool skirt and theres just not that many opportunities to wear it and i have five or six wool skirts   yeah uhhuh   so i was thinking well maybe you know i need to think about getting rid of them but no i folded it up neatly and put it away  maybe next year   yeah you hate to get rid of it because you know how much you spent on them     umhum umhum   and its real hard to get rid of some of that stuff i know   i know i agree with you   so   well i know last year uh well this past winter it wasnt that cold   uhhuh   but the previous winter we had more uh cold weather where i was able to actually wear your double and triple layerings of uh clothes yeah like you would when youre up north so   uhhuh clothes yeah uhhuh   thats really interesting   yeah yeah and i i just dont spend you know right now my clothes come from Target you know   yes yes yes and theyre all one hundred percent cotton and   yes and they you take them out of the drier and theyre wadded up in a ball     yes yes i know so i uh i have my ironing board sitting out all the time i never put mine away   oh im so glad to meet somebody that that their iron board is their permanent fixture in their house     it is it is   you know i have very little furniture but  my ironing board is part of my decor so     thats true and and ive been looking at these um uh like in Home Depot where you can go and theyve got that ironing boards that will just flip right down off of the um uh what the the the door and uh and then you can have actually have one where you can put it inside of a wall you know to have it permanently attached and thats what im thinking im going to have to do because mines sitting right out in front of my bedroom and its just   uhhuh uhhuh   its just an eyesore i think with all the   well yeah it is it is but its like uh i just dont want to do it   humum humum  no ive been thinking about putting the ironing board in the closet   yeah uhhuh   and and running you know a line in there for my iron so i could do it in there and i wouldnt have to have that eyesore   yeah       thats an idea oh yeah   yeah so i have a big closet   yeah i you know if i have if i know im having somebody come over to the house and theres a possibility they might be going back into my room i will put it away but   umhum yeah   i iron our clothes as we go along so you know   umhum i no longer do that weekly thing because i have so many and im like you i the night before or that day i will iron whatever it is that we need and thats it because its too many hundred percent cotton   right no uhhuh uhhuh   uhhuh you cant iron it all and   umhum   yeah and then with my kids theyre always getting into you know they cant decide what they want to wear so they change their minds you know i know i mean my oldest is only four but shes   umhum umhum     changes her mind two or three times before she figures out what shes going to wear so   right right oh i know i know   and then they never put anything back   no no of course not no that uh that would be too simple   so uhhuh       yeah that that thats called smart you know they dont we dont do that kind of stuff you know   absolutely not   thats called too easy on mom     thats right   our lot in life is to make her life miserable so     uhhuh absolutely absolutely   um   oh   yeah  well thats its been good talking to you to see somebody hear somebody that does the same thing i do because i tell people what i do and they just go oh how do you do that its like its easy you just do it you know       thats right thats right you do you do so uh but yeah i uh i know several of my girlfriends though we uh we all keep our ironing boards out and just uh an ever present thing in our household so   uhhuh yeah yeah i dont think id know what to do if it wasnt there you know my husband wouldnt know where to hang his dirty clothes       you know   there you go things that need to be mended things that have to get ironed umhum umhum umhum thats true   yeah he wouldnt know where to put things so yeah so   oh well it was nice talking with you   oh it was nice talking with you too   okay take care uhhuh byebye   take care byebye
