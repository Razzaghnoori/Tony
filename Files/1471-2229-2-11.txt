 Background Certain genetic loci are known to modify the expression of other allelic or non allelic partner loci in a meiotically heritable fashion If allelic such non Mendelian interactions are referred to as paramutation In the non allelic case the term heritable trans silencing may be used Paramutation has been studied extensively for four maize loci that encode transcriptional regulators of pigment biosynthesis 1 Paramutation has also been investigated in the Arabidopsis PAI gene family at the a1 and chalcone synthase CHS transgene loci in petunia and in a number of other cases 2 3 4 The Arabidopsis resistance gene BAL CPR1 displays a related form of epigenetic instability 5 6 Interactions resembling paramutation also occur among non allelic transgene loci with DNA sequence homology In these cases one master locus tends to suppress the expression of its target locus trans silencing 7 8 9 10 11 Paramutation and trans silencing are related processes For example an inverted repeat allele of the tryptophan biosynthetic gene PAI resident in the WS ecotype of Arabidopsis silences homologous PAI alleles as well as unlinked PAI genes from the Columbia ecotype 2 Likewise complex synthetic transgenes composed of PAI inverted repeats were able to trans methylate homologous yet non allelic target loci 12 Similar events have been observed in other species e g 13 Epigenetic activity defined here as partnership in heritable trans silencing or paramutation is not predictable from the DNA sequence alone and its molecular basis is incompletely understood Arguably the most widely implicated factor is the presence of complex DNA sequence repeats These repeats are often part of the trans silencer locus or paramutagenic locus or its target 10 14 15 16 17 However the repeat can sometimes be located at a considerable distance from the affected locus itself as has recently been shown for the single copy maize b1 gene 18 Other than transcriptional gene silencing paramutation is only weakly correlated with DNA methylation The methylation status of the maize r1 genes and Arabidopsis PAI genes is altered upon paramutation 12 19 while that of maize b1 is not 1 except in the non conventional way in the distal paramutation control region of b1 18 Conversely extensive exposure of a wild type Arabidopsis SUPERMAN allele to a heavily methylated and transcriptionally silenced epiallele did not reveal any trans silencing 20 The stochastic nature of gene silencing has been documented on numerous occasions e g 9 21 including in one of the initial descriptions of cosuppression 22 However with specific regards to epigenetically active transgene loci it is often not transparent whether their silencing behavior was stable over successive generations nor when and how individual loci acquired their epigenetic activity Certain loci are known to acquire their epigenetic activity spontaneously 4 suggesting an epigenetic control mechanism For instance at the b1 locus one specific allele can switch spontaneously from a non paramutagenic transcriptionally active state to a paramutagenic transcriptionally silenced state 23 Whether the same is true for trans silencing is not well established Whether the imprint imposed by a paramutagenic locus is relayed effectively from the first target locus to a secondary target locus is a variable characteristic of paramutation systems and this has implications for the speed of epiallele conversion within outcrossing populations Paramutable maize alleles of b1 and pl1 are highly effective in relaying such an imprint 24 25 also see 3 whereas other loci although sensitive to imprinting are less effective 26 or apparently ineffective 8 in relaying the imprint to secondary targets Likewise Arabidopsis PAI2 and PAI3 genes that have been trans methylated by the PAI1 PAI4 locus do not transfer their methylation status to naive singlet genes 12 In fact there are few well documented cases for the non allelic relay of trans silencing ability 11 24 Does this amount to an operational difference between allelic paramutation and non allelic trans silencing interactions or does it simply reflect a lack of data A translational fusion between green fluorescent protein GFP and the Arabidopsis Constitutive Photomorphogenesis1 protein COP1 has been established as a reporter for trans silencing events in Arabidopsis 27 A cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter driven GFP COP1 locus named C73 exemplifies an epigenetically active trans silencer locus C73 contains at least three copies of a T DNA comprising the 35S GFP COP1 gene as well as a kanamycin resistance gene driven by the nopaline synthase promoter nos nptII The C73 locus is silenced transcriptionally TGS but retains partial expression of both nptII and GFP COP1 GFP COP1 remains expressed in the seedling root but is largely silenced in the shoot Other 35S GFP COP1 loci become transcriptionally silenced upon exposure to the C73 locus Fig 1 The trans silencing activity of C73 is conveniently visualized by its negative effect on the cop1 like cosuppression phenotype that is associated with the target locus For example L91 is a single T DNA locus that causes homozygosity dependent cosuppression of its GFP COP1 transgene and of the endogenous COP1 gene at the rosette stage of development type L late silencing which in turn results in a characteristic dwarfing and other aspects of a cop1 like phenotype 28 In contrast E82 type E early is an oligomeric T DNA locus that causes homozygosity dependent COP1 endogene silencing at the seedling stage in particular deetiolation in dark grown seedlings E82 also causes essentially dominant cosuppression at the adult stage Both L91 and E82 are silenced posttranscriptionally PTGS and both are representative for a larger group of loci with similar transgene silencing characteristics Note that PTGS is often homozygosity dependent 29 The trans silencing of the PTGS loci L91 or E82 by the C73 silencer locus is most easily apparent by the loss of the typical cop1 like cosuppressionphenotype Fig 1 27 Similar results were obtained for another trans silencer locus C97 The experimental strategy of monitoring heritable epialleles via their effect on visible cosuppression patterns has been pioneered in the chalcone synthase CHS family of petunia and Arabidopsis 4 10 30 For comparison CHS trans silencing offers exquisite sensitivity in part due to the cell autonomy of its pigmentation phenotype whereas COP1 essentially yields a whole plant phenotype Petunia CHS also lends itself to detect somatic transitions in epialleles due to its indeterminate growth habit whereas Arabidopsis COP1 is more suitable for monitoring early epigenetic activity in seedlings and rosette plants We have begun to define the determinants of epigenetic activity of the GFP COP1 loci The trans silencers as well as their targets reside in single copy gene rich regions that are only sparsely populated with repetitive or transposable elements features that have been shown to mediate epigenetic activity in other cases 18 31 32 Therefore trans silencing of GFP COP1 is probably not mediated by transgene flanking sequences 27 In contrast as with other genes cited above trans silencing ability is correlated with transgene locus structure given that the C73 and C97 trans silencers contain multiple T DNAs while their targets E82 and L91 are essentially dimeric and monomeric respectively Here we report that the Arabidopsis C73 and C97 trans silencer loci displayed TGS and trans silencing after first passing through a transitory phase of PTGS over the course of the first two transgenic generations A similar epigenetic instability of the initial PTGS phenotype was typical for a subset of other oligomeric loci but was never observed with monomeric 35S GFP COP1 loci It is this instability of cosuppression that originally prompted us to categorize certain loci as type C rather than type E We also characterized the heritability of the imprint imposed by the C73 trans silencer locus with respect to a cosuppression of the COP1 endogene and b a characteristic yet unusual expansion of transgene expression at the target locus Finally our data suggest that the L91 target locus acquires limited trans silencing activity of its own after exposure to C73 which is an unusual case for transgenes However these data must be interpreted in light of another novel observation namely that even relatively simple transcriptionally active transgene loci can interact with nonlinear gene dosage effects that have characteristics of epigenetic trans silencing Results The silencing phenotypes of C73 and C97 were acquired epigenetically Many of the most potent epigenetically active loci are endogenous rather than transgenic and therefore their early epigenetic history is not completely known In contrast transgenes have a defined date of origin within a plant lineage In our transgene based system the silencer loci GFP COP1 C73 and C97 underwent an apparently spontaneous transition in their silencing behavior between the T2 and T3 generations Fig 2A In detail the progeny of the primary transgenic plant T1 plant C73 which possessed a single transgene locus as determined by segregation of antibiotic resistance segregated almost one quarter cop1 like seedlings in the dark grown T2 generation This dosage dependence of endogene silencing was the same as for the PTGS locus E82 Fig 1 Unambiguous evidence for a cosuppression of transgene and endogene as opposed to a dominant negative effect of the transgenic protein has previously been shown for line L4 and others 27 and COP1 endogene suppression was also associated with GFP COP1 silencing in T2 generation type C lines not shown At the adult stage 12 of T2 plants in line C73 were visibly cosuppressed In contrast the T3 generation derived by selfing of T2 plants and known by run on transcription assay to be silenced by TGS 27 had few cop1 like seedlings and no cop1 like adult plants Similar results were obtained for line C97 The C97 line is the only line in this work that contains two unlinked loci 27 which may have contributed to the high incidence of PTGS in T2 seedlings Neither of these loci retained its endogene silencing ability in the T3 Fig 2 No COP1 cosuppression was observed beyond the T3 generation of C73 or C97 not shown Two additional oligomeric GFP COP1 loci C11 and C71 which have not been tested for their trans silencing behavior also changed from a cosuppressing state in the T2 generation to a non cosuppressing state in the T3 Fig 2A In contrast none of four single T DNA type L loci lost their endogene silencing ability Fig 2B The apparent increase in adult COP1 cosuppression from the T2 to the T3 of some type L lines was not statistically significant The type E loci E82 and E83 were also stable Fig 2C Together these results suggest that PTGS in certain oligomeric T DNA loci is unstable and has a tendency to progress to TGS In line C73 the transition probably began in T2 seedlings as suggested by the small fraction of adult T2 plants with a cop1 like PTGS phenotype Transgene locus structure of the E82 locus In order to distinguish the L91 and E82 loci more confidently in subsequent experiments we defined the structure of the E82 locus in more detail The L91 locus is a simple T DNA locus at a defined chromosomal location In contrast Southern blots probed with the T DNA right border RB revealed two fragments for E82 27 Early attempts to isolate the E82 flanking sequence by TAIL PCR repeatedly recovered a fortuitous junction between a left border LB and a partial T DNA truncated near the 3 end of the GFP COP1 gene A schematic drawing of the E82 locus structure incorporating all of these data as well as data from blots probed with LB and COP1 sequences not shown is presented in Fig 3 This model was subsequently confirmed in two ways an NdeI restriction site predicted from Southern blots was confirmed in the flanking sequence 27 and PCR amplification with specific primers across the flanks of the transgene and across the internal LB RB junction resulted in the expected product lengths Fig 3 Thus we propose that the E82 locus consists of a direct repeat which is joined at the tail end by a partial T DNA in an inverted orientation Trans silencing by C73 results in variable novel transgene expression patterns including spatial expansion of transgene expression The C73 trans silencer locus caused transcriptional silencing of two target loci tested L91 and E82 which is most easily detected by a suppression of the typical endogene cosuppression of the target loci Fig 1 27 As expected the spatial expression pattern of L91 s GFP COP1 gene was restricted though not completely abolished upon exposure to C73 not shown see Fig 5Dbelow In contrast F2 families segregating for C73 and E82 contained many plants with an expanded spatial pattern of expression namely reactivation of transgene expression in the cotyledons and the first two pairs of leaves especially in trichomes Fig 4panels B E H and K For comparison the naive E82 locus as well as C73 alone were silenced in the leaves Fig 4A 4D 4Gand 4Jand Fig 4C 4F 4Iand 4M Such a reactivation had previously been observed in the dihybrid C73 E82 F1 parent plants 27 The reactivated expression was subsequently ascribed to the E82 locus rather than C73 by testing F2 segregants lacking C73 see Figure 5below In summary silencing of L91 and E82 by C73 was incomplete as especially E82 recovered partial transgene expression in organs where it was not normally expressed These results underscore the similarity between trans silencing and paramutation because in both cases epialleles are often silenced incompletely and may also adopt novel regulatory patterns 4 10 for example light inducibility 33 Perhaps silencing at the dimeric E82 locus involves a hierarchical relationship between its two intact T DNAs The C73 locus may preferentially target a postulated master T DNA which in turn loses its ability to post transcriptionally silence the subordinate T DNA within the E82 locus Two target loci of C73 maintain their epigenetic imprint heritably for up to five generations A diagnostic PCR assay was developed for the L91 E82 and C73 loci to unambiguously identify F2 segregants containing a trans silenced L91 or E82 target locus but lacking the C73 silencer locus Fig 5B compare lanes 1 4 with lanes 5 8 In addition hemizygous segregants were distinguished from homozygotes by segregation of the kanamycin resistance gene in their selfed progeny compare lanes 1 2 with 3 4 Subsequently the rate of phenotypic reversion from trans silencing was observed for hemizygous and homozygous lineages of E82 and L91 A legend for scoring the cop1 like cosuppression and GFP COP1 transgene silencing patterns is shown in Fig 5A Unless exposed to C73 E82 plants are always cop1 like and silenced for GFP COP1 and the same is true for homozygous L91 plants In contrast E82 plants and homozygous L91 plants were wild type like rather than cosuppressed in the F2 if the transgene had been exposed to C73 in the F1 Fig 5Cand 5D previously summarized in 27 Both the reactivation of E82 s GFP COP1 transgene expression as well as suppression of endogene silencing were maintained for up to four additional generations in the absence of C73 in hemizygous and homozygous families while C73 remained silenced Fig 5C The L91 lineage also maintained its imprint from C73 over up to five generations Specifically the cop1 like cosuppression phenotype typical for homozygous L91 plants remained suppressed Fig 5D Although the imprints on the E82 and L91 loci proved to be fairly stable reversion was observed in two ways First a small fraction less than 20 expected for full reversion of cop1 like E82 plants and L91 plants appeared in the F4 generation not reflected in Fig 5 and second the GFP COP1 expression of E82 gradually reverted back from the reactivated pattern to the silenced pattern especially in hemizygous families Fig 5C The transgene expression data for the imprinted L91 lineage were less informative However it appears that the hemizygous L91 lineage gradually recovered its GFP COP1 expression but without reaching the threshold required for posttranscriptional cosuppression of the COP1 gene Imprinting relay Do trans silenced E82 and L91 loci acquire trans silencing ability Our data suggested that the C73 locus may have acquired its trans silencing activity as part of an epigenetic transition from type E to type C silencing between the T1 and T3 generations Thus it is reasonable to ask whether the trans silencing activity be farther transferable from the type C locus to other loci It seemed problematic to test whether the trans silenced L91 locus henceforth termed L91 can paramutate a naive L91 allele because we cannot distinguish between the L91 master and the L91 target at the molecular level Instead L91 was tested for its effect on a naive E82 locus and E82 was tested against L91 because these loci are distinguishable by diagnostic PCR assays Because L91 and E82 no longer cause COP1 cosuppression it was easy to monitor the interaction by following the cosuppression phenotypes of the naive E82 and L91 loci Figure 6provides an overview over the crossing scheme and experimental data are presented in Tables 1to 3 Significantly the L91 locus suppressed the COP1 endogene silencing by the E82 target locus in the majority of F1 dihybrid plants whereas a naive L91 locus did not Table 1 Although only four relevant plants were recovered by genotyping in the L91 E82 control experiment the entire L91 E82 family contained a large fraction of silenced plants larger than with L91 and E82 which was compatible with an additive interaction between L91 and E82 not shown As expected at the level of transgene expression both L91 E82 and L91 E82 plants were silenced Table 1 Fig 6 Likewise in the F2 progeny L91 continued to suppress the endogene silencing by E82 Table 2 Fig 6 which is normally expected to affect about three quarters of F2 progeny Importantly upon genotyping of individual F2 plants five wild type like plants were identified that carried only E82 and no L91 locus confirming that L91 can leave a heritable imprint on E82 Table 3 However two additional pieces of data distinguish the trans silencing activity of L91 from that of C73 First the F2 families clearly contained plants displaying endogene silencing In the one case tested this was due not surprisingly to an E82 locus that had escaped from L91 and resumed its endogene silencing Table 3 Therefore L91 is a less effective trans silencer than C73 27 Second and more surprisingly even naive L91 and E82 loci which had shown no trans silencing in the F1 displayed a loss of the E82 cosuppression phenotype in the F2 Table 2 Instead of an expected Mendelian ratio of 87 cop1 like plants only 38 were observed a significant shortfall Genotyping of individual F2 plants revealed a stochastic escape from COP1 endogene silencing in plants containing both E82 and L91 and including even a single E82 plant that lacked L91 Table 3 Such a loss of cosuppression has not been observed among hundreds of plants containing just E82 alone our unpublished data These data suggest an epigenetic modification of E82 after exposure to a naive L91 locus In contrast to the epigenetic activity of trans silenced L91 E82 had no such activity When E82 was combined with L91 both loci cooperated to cause endogene silencing as seen with unmodified E82 and L91 Table 1 This was unexpected given that E82 caused little or no endogene cosuppression with L91 or on its own Cooperative cosuppression between bona fide imprinted E82 and a naive L91 locus was again detected in the F2 progeny Table 2 Thus E82 was clearly unable to trans silence a naive L91 locus and in fact seemed to lose its imprint when exposed to L91 therefore these families were not analyzed further E82 also did not trans silence a naive E83 locus not shown Taken together these data allow three conclusions First experiments with naive L91 and E82 demonstrated that even relatively simple transgene loci associated with PTGS can display non additive gene dosage effects as apparent by heritable suppression of PTGS Second the imprint left on the L91 locus by the C73 trans silencer did modify L91 s epistatic interaction with a non allelic target locus E82 as seen in the F1 generation However it remains to be determined whether this trans silencing effect is more likely to be heritable when L91 is in an imprinted state L91 than in the naive state L91 Third the imprint on the E82 locus E82 was more labile than the imprint on L91 and showed no evidence of being transferable Discussion Epigenetic imprints affecting the expression of nuclear genes differ in the efficiency with which they are relayed onto homologous sequences In the classical case of paramutation at the maize b1 locus the imprint is relayed with 100 efficiency 24 That is a paramutated allele is turned into a paramutagenic allele In contrast to our knowledge no trans silenced transgene has been shown to acquire heritable trans silencing ability suggesting that perhaps trans silencing ability is more difficult to relay between non allelic transgenes than between allelic loci However the endogenous p1 rr allele of maize did acquire paramutagenicity after exposure to a specific P1 enhancer transgene 11 Against this background we investigated the possible relay of an imprint triggered by the Arabidopsis C73 trans silencer locus asking specifically whether targets trans silenced by the C73 locus a acquired trans silencing activity and b were able to pass their imprint on to a naive target locus in a heritable fashion In summary the imprinted E82 locus E82 displayed no significant ability to trans silence a naive L91 locus In contrast L91 was initially able to trans silence E82 as judged by suppression of the endogene cosuppression phenotype associated with naive E82 importantly the unmodified L91 control locus did not have this ability Table 1 Thus we demonstrated aspect a of the imprinting relay Moreover the suppression of silencing at the E82 locus was partially but not fully heritable given that some but not all E82 segregants lacking L91 were wild type Table 3 Yet these data fall short of proving aspect b of the imprinting relay because surprisingly the combination of naive L91 and E82 loci also caused non linear gene dosage effects that could result in the heritable trans silencing of the E82 locus in at least one instance Whether L91 might paramutate an allelic L91 locus remains to be tested The non linear gene dosage effects between L91 and E82 were surprising to us because in tobacco similar experiments conducted with 35S GUS transgenes did not raise the suspicion of epigenetically heritable effects 34 It is informative to compare the epigenetic interactions of the 35S GFP COP1 transgenes with those of the PAI trans genes the only other well characterized system in Arabidopsis 12 Both gene sets consist of relatively simple repeat structures and singlet loci which reside in essentially single copy environments of Arabidopsis 27 and unpublished observations The first comparison relates to the speed of epigenetic change Here combining a master locus C73 with a non allelic singlet locus possessing 100 sequence identity L91 resulted in immediate trans silencing as seen by a reduction of GFP COP1 expression and block of cosuppression which was stably maintained in the presence or absence of the master locus In contrast in the PAI gene family combining the master locus WS ecotype PAI1 PAI4 with a non allelic singlet target locus possessing 100 sequence identity Columbia PAI2 resulted in methylation after two generations of heterozygous contact and methylation became more pronounced after another two generations 12 Likewise in the petunia CHS gene family interaction between an epiallele of the direct repeat locus CHS41 with two types of target loci either an unlinked inverted repeat locus or a more na ve allele of CHS41 was initially additive and only became suppressive in the second generation 4 10 The second comparison relates to the relay of epigenetic activity In our system a trans silenced singlet gene L91 was able to trans silence a naive homolog E82 within a single generation In contrast a trans methylated singlet PAI2 gene did not trans methylate a naive allelic PAI2 gene within three generations 12 Additional experimentation may eventually provide an answer to the question of what controls the efficiency of such epigenetic interactions Cosuppression of the endogenous COP1 gene is a consequence of posttranscriptional silencing while transcriptionally trans silenced loci do not cosuppress COP1 27 In our hands a subset of four 35S GFP COP1 transgene loci shifted from a cosuppressing state bona fide PTGS to a non cosuppressing state i e TGS within two transgenic generations These loci are therefore referred to as complex loci Note that type L and type E loci did not lose their PTGS phenotype Fig 2B This includes the L72 locus which has a reduced penetrance of cosuppression that may be attributable to its pericentromeric location 27 Intriguingly both trans silencer loci C73 and C97 belong to the complex group adding weight to the proposition that like paramutagenicity trans silencing activity is encoded epigenetically Vice versa this transition raises the question whether the originally strong transcription of the GFP COP1 genes or perhaps the ensuing PTGS phase somehow sets the stage for the subsequent trans silencing activity especially if multimeric T DNA loci are involved PTGS and trans silencing are similarly intertwined in other cases for example in the epimutable petunia CHS41 locus 10 PTGS often leads to DNA methylation although primarily in coding regions 35 However DNA methylation of promoters more easily aligned with transcriptional silencing can be RNA mediated if suitable double stranded RNA versions of the promoter sequence are transcribed either fortuitously or by design 36 37 38 39 40 Therefore there may be a natural tendency for PTGS loci to mature to TGS and associated trans silencing which in turn could prove problematic in applying PTGS in commercial plant breeding programs Our data are certainly consistent with this notion Such hypotheses are testable with the model system we have established Conclusions 1 Posttranscriptional gene silencing by structurally complex transgenes loci may be unstable and may be supplanted by transcriptional gene silencing over the course of a few plant generations 2 Heritable modifications of transgene expression caused by exposure to a trans silencer locus may be stable for five generations or more 3 Upon exposure to a trans silencer locus certain Arabidopsis transgenes display an alteration in their epistatic interaction with other transgenes These data suggest that the competence for trans silencing may be transferred between non allelic transgenes reminiscent of the allelic transfer of epigenetic activity during paramutation 4 Cosuppression phenotypes can serve as sensitive indicators of epigenetic interactions between transgenes in Arabidopsis thaliana Methods Transgenic Arabidopsis lines and plant growth The GFP COP1 expression cassette contains a double 35S enhancer translational enhancer and 35S terminator Most GFP COP1 lines and the GUS COP1 line L4 have been described 27 41 42 Unsilenced GUS COP1 and GFP COP1 transgenes complement the cop1 mutation 42 43 The C11 and C71 loci contain at least three and two linked T DNAs respectively as seen by Southern blotting not shown Plants were germinated on agar solidified MS medium containing 1 sucrose in either constant light or constant darkness and subsequently grown in soil in growth chambers at 22 C under constant white light from fluorescent tubes Test for acquired trans silencing activity Trans silenced L91 and E82 plants that lacked the C73 silencer locus prime label were crossed in pairwise combinations with naive E82 and L91 plants Because trans silencing of E82 was observed regardless of whether L91 was the male or the female parent data from reciprocal crosses were pooled Individual F1 dihybrid plants were inspected for GFP COP1 and COP1 endogene silencing phenotypes Representative F1 dihybrids were checked for the presence of two different transgene loci by diagnostic PCR assay and by segregation analysis F2 segregants containing only the target locus were identified by PCR based genotyping analogous to the strategy exemplified in Fig 5 Plants in which GFP COP1 expression was restricted to roots and cotyledons were regarded as silenced whereas plants with GFP COP1 visible beyond the cotyledons were considered active PCR assays The diagnostic PCR assays for the C73 and E82 loci display unique PCR products arising from fortuitous and distinct junctions between the T DNA right border and the COP1 cDNA which we recovered in early attempts to isolate flanking sequences For E82 the
