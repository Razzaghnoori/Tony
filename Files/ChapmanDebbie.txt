 OK Am I sitting in the right spot You re fine What stories or books do you remember reading as a child Was there a favorite So that s two questions What stories or books do you remember reading My favorite books were all about The Boxcar Children OK Did you have a favorite I mean of any of those did you have a favorite No I just couldn t wait to get my hands on the next one that would come out And and now today they have a lot more than they ever had available when I was little Do you remember a particular color Right now they re all beige Right if I m not mistaken Seems to me like a lot of them were yellow It was like a goldish yellow Not a bright sunshine yellow a warm gold looking What age were you when you started reading those approximately Those books Uh huh It would have been the first grade Did they have any illustrations I don t think they have any illustrations do they No Not many at all All right This might sound like a different kind of question but is there a certain type of smell that they had to them Just um just an old musty library type smell you know Hmm OK Was there a particular place for reading that you had when you were a child I loved to go outside Our neighbors had a big pasture So actually I d go sit in the pasture and read Sun or freezing I loved it All right What stories or books do you remember somebody reading to you Well my cousin helped me learn to read before I ever started school and most of those were just your little basic I Can Read books That s what they re called now I don t I don t know what they were called then but the Dick and Jane type books Yeah See them run Yeah Exactly All right Did you have a favorite Let me think I can remember her helping me to read the the books The main ones were like the Emperor with no clothes Yeah You know that type books Absolutely All right Um are there any illustrations that you remember from books that other people read to you Um the one that stands out in my mind are the fables I can remember as a child looking at all the fable pictures OK Um all right Is there a particular person that you liked to I mean that read to you that you liked to hear Yes yes My um cousin Roseanne She lived with us at the time She s the one who got me interested in reading How old was she She was nine years older than me So you know it was really a good age to Is there a place that she read to you We would sit on the living room couch by the lamp What stories do you remember family members telling you Hmm There again a lot of them were the fables mostly stories that had some type of moral or a catch to it you know Right Um were there any associations with events the stories that they told you with anything that happened in real life It doesn t have to be like stories from a book any story I had an uncle that would tell me like WWII stories and that type of thing you know And things that they remembered from you uh like from the Great Depression or the Holocaust or you know even though they weren t directly involved in that That type thing Um do you remember any of those I mean can you remember enough to tell any of it If you can t it s not a big deal Well my mother she was just a little girl when during the Depression She told about how you know it was so hard for them to get anything They had to grow everything they ate and they had nothing And of course her parents weren t one of these that had money in the bank that they actually lost anything anyway But of course when all the surrounding the stores or whatever everybody had lost money and so the whole economy was totally poor whether they actually lost money or not That s uh my grandfather talks about that or used to talk about that Yeah They had nothing and of course he looks like All right Um who is the best storyteller in your family The best storyteller in my family I would have to say it would have been my Aunt Lizzy she s deceased now but Do you know why She I can remember as a child that in the it was like she was ageless And it was like she was old but she was ageless As a child she never changed And she would like dance a little jig you know while she was telling stories She was oh She was my favorite That s who Sara s named after Oh OK What kind of stories um did she tell Just a lot of times I think she would make up some of them you know Or just really embellish you know She would definitely add on But uh and and there again most of hers had morals too Like she would say Now what did we learn from that Debbie you know And I would say Uh And she would say Now that told you that and she would go on But she would if she was talking about rabbits she would jump around and she s up there and she s put socks on some kind of wires and made little rabbit ears out of them and you know Yes Just things that my mother would never have done That s funny Aunt Lizzy would always do it so So what kind of reaction would she get from you or other people that heard her Belly laughs Roll on the floor laughing Did they ever request for her to re tell something Oh yeah Yeah If we had a family reunion or something a lot of us would get her to re tell a story Is there a particular story that you remember her telling There was one about a rabbit and this I can t remember all of it and in fact we were talking about it at a family reunion not too awfully long ago and a lot of them were adding bits and pieces to it Because I can just remember her getting up and jumping around and have you heard uh it s like a version of the Little Bunny Foo foo Uh huh That type thing OK What stories do you tell yourself to keep going through hard times Funny sad whatever I guess it s um maybe a daily thing just whatever depending on whatever your mood is If it s sad you can always you could always remember a story where you know somebody who has it a lot worse than you do Or if it s happy it s a I don t know it s just recalling memories Yeah I really like them I can be reading a book and be totally lost in it and think Wow I thought I was having a bad day Or you know or you could be reading a really good book and thinking I wish my life were that easy you know Yes Absolutely so Is there one that um you ve read lately that s like that you re kind of lost in it Oh The best books that I ve read recently were the uh Left Behind series Yeah Timothy LaHaye and Jenkins Jenkins Yeah Oh I ve only we ve only started the kids version of that but um what what I ve had so far is good It s absolutely a lesson for you know Oh absolutely I d like to read the kids version too just to Yeah we need to read it OK well I mean can you sum up one of those books or something that meant something to you in the book Well all of them You know of course it s talking about being raptured and it s just such a good follower of the Bible I mean it it follows really closely and um you can t wait till the next one comes out Uh I think one of my favorite parts is when the two prophets you know they had the two You know Elijah and Moses are at the the Wailing Wall You know if you haven t read it I don t want to tell you about it yet but oh I mean it s it s just it s just wonderful You know it s it s just like when the Bible says it says that they will be there and nothing I mean if somebody threatens them or tries to harm them at all they re immediately consumed in uh in uh burst of fire Uh huh Well you know and then of course the Antichrist is trying to trying to say that well you know that they have machine guns hidden under their clothing and but they re they re absolutely wearing their tattered same tattered clothes that they would wear in the Bible And it talks about them having the long scruffy beards and they ve been standing outside for days and days and days and months and um you know without bathing and without doing anything Oh And uh of course then like the Bible says they re put to death again But I mean it s you know God let s them all of a sudden one day they have no protection and and they re killed And then their bodies are put out in the streets and I mean everything is just as an example Right But then you know they come back to life again and God takes them up to heaven Yeah Yeah Is there a particular story you like from the Bible Hmmm I like a lot of them from the Bible Umm I think one of my favorite ones would have to be oh goodness I guess one of my favorite ones would have to be uh the one about Meshach Shadrach and Abednego I love that one Um could you tell us why Just the fourth man in the fire you know It s just cool to think that there s a fourth man in there Absolutely OK well is there a story that you could tell us like you know from your life now Something that isn t doesn t have to be you know relevant Hmm I mean my favorite in the jalapeno story but I don t think we ll put that on tape They both Laugh Yeah Really For the whole world to know I don t want them to know about the jalapeno story OK a favorite story Hmmm I m trying to think Oh I ve got plenty of stories You know it s just a matter of thinking about one of them Uh I can t think of one It d be easier if we were all sitting around Oh absolutely If somebody if somebody brings up a topic it s like well I can do better than that You know Let me tell you this Umm well I could tell you that you know my husband is always saying that he thinks I m a witch because I can say something and then it happens You ve probably heard that story before Uh we hadn t been married long and and we were driving down the road one day I saw a box in the middle of the road you know and I looked over at him and you know men always automatically you can just see them lining up like they re going to hit that you know Yep Like it s a point system or something I mean like they ll get some points for it And I said Don t hit the box And he said Why I said Well if it gets if it doesn t come out from under the car and it gets under the exhaust pipe and catch on fire And he s like Well that is the dumbest thing I ve ever heard in my life OK and I didn t say another word and about two miles down the road of course you know it was fwapp fwapp fwapp you know Yeah About two miles down the road he pulled over and I said What are you doing He said I ve got to get out and get that stupid box It s on fire And it was Um just little things like that So to this day he ll about three weeks ago he called me and he said You ll never guess what happened to me now And I said What He said I s driving down the road And he said I saw this bag in the road It wasn t even a box and he said I thought That s weird And he said I couldn t it was like interstate and I couldn t could not move over either way I knew I was going to run over it And he said I thought Now just wait and see if it does anything And he said he looked in his mirror and it didn t clear And so he said just a few minutes later he could smell something He pulled over and it was hung on his exhaust pipe Then Just just little things like that through the years He um we were in CA and we had been in San Francisco for about three days and this is my first trip to CA And I was just fascinated with the big city San Francisco life so many cars and and the day that we were going the shuttle bus was taking us back to um the airport LAX We were going to L A Well we got on the shuttle bus and it just dawned on me you know And I said and I told him You know I ve been here three days and as many police cars as I ve seen I said you know I ve not seen a single accident And he was like Oh don t say that don t say that You ll jinx us I was like you know So we get to the airport We fly to L A We rent a car and he decides he wants to take me to Hollywood drive down Rodeo Dr in Beverly Hills because he s been there before So I m like OK you know I m all for it We get in the car We re headed down San Diego Freeway Stop Bap And we get hit And he s like you know without saying Oh goodness you know Are you all right His head whips around and he says How s that Is that a good enough accident for you And of course it was all my fault because I could have said something about it earlier Of course I was in the the um the earthquake the last earthquake from CA Oh really Uh huh I didn t know that Oh you didn t No I didn t know anything about that I m trying to remember what year that was Was Sarah two Was either 94 Ridgecrest Not Ridgecrest Ridge I can t remember the name of that We were in Long Beach when it happened Northridge Northridge Yeah um and there again I m such a sound sleeper that it was 4 30 in the morning and Tony woke me up He was saying Debbie Debbie Wake up Wake up you know It s an earthquake I m like You would say anything to wake me up you know And then I I realized that he s on his knees and the whole building is shaking And I didn t know it at the time but we were on the fifteenth story of a sixteen floor building And I did not know it at the time but the hotel was built on six foot rollers I mean it s built to sway and give Yeah but still Yeah but I mean the the then that s another reason I know now that everything is bolted to the walls Everything you know Because you d hear furniture crashing but I can remember we went straight over to the window and we still had power but we went straight to the window and it was just I honestly I think thought we were going to die All right you could see transformers popping everywhere Just looking that s all you could see were lights It looked like big flashes of light everywhere And uh we immediately got on our knees and started praying buddy because I knew we were goners Yeah I would Absolutely So I didn t know you all were in that Oh yeah yeah It didn t really it didn t really hit me but later on that day we were flying to San Francisco Uh huh And it didn t really hit me until we got to the airport Well our shuttle the hotel shuttle bus took us to the airport and on the way over there I can remember he stayed on on his little CB thing the entire time with the dispatcher It was so foggy or smoggy probably fog that early in the morning It was so foggy you couldn t see three feet in front of you no more that ten And he was like I m heading down to Ventura Blvd or whatever And she d say well Don t go past such and such because the the bridge is out There were reports and and after I got home I d see film clips on TV where like a policeman got killed He was going across the bridge and you know it was so foggy he didn t know the bridge was out and it was just there you know and the entire surrounding area around us was like that There were bridges out just and not necessarily just a bridge Just all of a sudden there would be a sinkhole in the middle of the highway and cars were just going down into it you know that didn t know that it was there So if it hadn t been for that guy and that radio we would never have made it to the airport But when we got to the airport we were the first flight that they let leave that day and we were sitting in the US Air club lounge Uh huh There s other people coming in and they were waiting on flights and you know We were all sitting there Everybody was reliving their experiences and some talked about what happened to them And they were talking about armoires that were falling across their bed that weren t you know bolted Bolted bolted down and all of the sudden I noticed that everybody we were just all sitting there just like like this right here like we were old people in a room full of rocking chairs you know Ooh And then I realized I mean that was that was just aftershocks and tremors from the you know And I thought What magnitude of power it would take to move the LAX airport Here we were all sitting there you know And for days we felt we felt aftershocks and tremors It s like a really bad case of vertigo you know Yeah And you just just sitting there and you just get light headed and you just think Oh it s my equilibrium that s all messed up It was definitely an earthquake Were the girls with you No No they were here with my mother In fact I had called my mother and it s it s lucky I called her as soon as I did because later on the phones were down for hours But I called her and I said Now mother I just wanted to let you know that we re all right and she was like OK That s good And I thought you know We re three hours behind them out there you know She had no idea And I was We just had an earthquake I want you to know I m fine And she s like Oh my God Measured ten on the Richter Scale It s all right Absolutely It s a good thing that I called her when I did because later on when if she had heard about it on the news then she would have been terribly upset So Yeah bet so I m sure But yeah You remember um Hurricane Hugo Oh yeah You d never forget it Were you guys here Yes we d been here since July that year 89 Welcome present I was at work when it happened It tore my van all to pieces Oh really Yeah We had to stay in a hotel a ratty hotel at that because there was no power no The only place that was open in Hickory was uh Domino s Pizza That was really scary We only had power off for like three days here Right There were a lot of Duke Power people who lived down here so I think that kind of helped us a little bit but oh my worse I kept putting off the laundry kept putting off the laundry and I said I can t take it anymore Drove it to the laundromat and that day our power came back on You know and and coffee I couldn t get any coffee I was dying for coffee That s all I wanted was coffee But yeah when Hugo hit I was at work that day and I worked third shift at Coca Cola And there was only me and one other girl were the only two people in the whole building Of course we were in the computer room Uh huh And we had the generator The rest of the building was totally out She was 7 months pregnant Had to go to the restroom every ten minutes Finally I said Look you know we got to scrounge up the flashlight because you know there were no lights in the bathroom no anything And and you know we had a pretty good walk too So I told her I said Look we have the little area where we have all the supplies that little computer room Uh huh I said Well go up there You can use the bathroom right there instead of going you know And so that s what we did And she said What if somebody drives by I m like Well you know who do you expect to drive by in the hurricane In the storm That s right And I thought No security patrol s going to be out here But uh you know my and and when I got out there to where the little dock was at for the paper I could see my van I parked right beside this great big tree and all that while I worried about my van but not enough to where I was going to go out there and move it You know No And the whole time we were in there all you could hear was That s all you can hear Uh huh And so every little bit I would go and stick my head out the door and The van s OK Well of course I worked twelve hour shift three days a week or three nights a week and that I guess about seven o clock was when the the when the next people were supposed to come in It was about 7 30 and here come Richard And that s I ll never forget it He came and then he said Shh what happened to your van I m like Nice try Richard but my van is fine I ve been going over there all night long Been checking He said No man it s just awful I m like Right Well I went out there and I looked and was like You know The president of the company s room or uh office up on the top floor was on the end and I don t know if you know where the Coca Cola building is in Charlotte but it s kind of I don t know like an oval and arc type shape Uh huh Well his office was like right here in the middle like right here on the end and the windows were blown out All these metal aluminum blinds were wrapped around the wheels of my van Oh my God A piece of sheet rock I don t know how large this sheet rock was but it had blown around the curve of the building like his office is here and mine was back here It had blown around slapped the the driver s window or my side For years every time I d put my window down and come back up you would see little slivers little pieces of sheet rock on the side of my window I mean it was awful And I had pieces of it the driver s side door was all dented in And and little later on I didn t know it until later on that uh I guess probably within a year after the hurricane hit then you could start seeing little spots all over the side of the van Yeah That was glass You know where it had just made little things that would How weird that didn t show up immediately Oh my gosh Yeah Oh yeah it was like 1600 00 worth of damage to my van because of Hurricane Hugo And then when uh I ended up staying at Coke like sixteen hours that day because you know the roads were shut down and nobody was coming in Finally I got to come down Tyvola the new Tyvola above the Coliseum was pretty new at that time And I I drove home that way and we d only been here a couple of months I got all the way out here to the Eagle Rd at that mill Uh huh And there was a huge tree across the street I couldn t make it any farther And I didn t know any back roads I didn t know how to go around and try and find So I just pulled the van over and at the plant parking lot and I got out and started walking and I was just I can remember live wires being everywhere crackling and popping And the first thing I saw when I got home was my neighbor over here two houses over He was outside he was it was really funny He was out and here I come walking up and looking like something the cat drug in And he s like Debbie Have you seen my shutters Every shutter on his house had blown away He was like All of a sudden we were in KS And this was Dorothy It was like No Jerry I haven t But it was it was really scary the just the scary I mean I I it s weird it s like I during the hurricane I really felt safe in that building but driving home and all the trees that were down It was like I was the only person on the road And when I finally got here it s like you know just seeing everything and the house One of the first things I noticed was when I come up from the top of the hill was my house it looked like it had ivy growing all over it Oh really Leaves from trees everywhere were up against the house Uh Stuck on the Yeah I mean it was just like moss or something grown on everybody s houses overnight And all of these houses around here were new And this house right here was just being built and parts of the roof had blown off if it I m surprised it didn t damage this over here I know We were really really lucky Yeah You all didn t have a lot of big trees so that s good No Uh huh No We had had um even our little peach tree made it through everything Everything that ever we had a creek in the back of the house and whenever it stormed small storm or big storm it just floods come straight up Get under the bed Mike going to say Get under the bed Right You know I don t know why she did that I think because we were all pretty fascinated with um storms outside of the window We have sliding glass doors in our living room Right And we d sit there and just watch But now I wasn t stupid or nothing when the lights were going shz shz you know but she s Get under the bed in her bedroom She s got one of those tall four poster beds like that w as going to save us but we had to get under there a lot when I was growing up bad storms Yeah But no Hugo we had to go to Howard Johnson s or something No the Hickory Motor Inn To take a shower I ll tell you what I would have gone just to get a cup of coffee That s about three more days of not taking a shower Oh I know Absolutely That s funny Um I m trying to think um some stories that you told me that you know can be aired Without offending any members of the family That s right Which is the most important thing here I m trying to think because you re always telling stories and I just can t my mind is gone like your mind is gone on a Saturday Did Ida ever tell you any stories Or was she not more My aunts read to me in my family Not my Mom a whole lot Well same here I mean it s she would tell me stories about my early childhood Things you know stories about my daddy because my daddy died um before I was three So I didn t hardly You don t remember anything do you And she would tell me a lot of stories about him and you know The kind of person that he was Right Just real stories you know things that Like the first TV set you know when we used to have well water and the water had to be you know got out every afternoon Just you know Yeah The hard stuff that type of thing What was your daddy like Well That she told you From stories that from her and from uh other family members I mean everybody they would always say that that he would always be the first person to help you My mother always said that that he would help a stranger you know get a car out of a ditch or whatever Uh huh And and it would take her three years to get him to do something for her around the house You know and like she say OK Mac you know You need to we ve got a hole in the roof and she would use that as an example And I ll get to it I ll get it fixed And then you know get up at three o clock in the morning because somebody s called because somebody s in a ditch or something You know That type of thing Uh huh Uh huh And then basically everybody s always told me that he was a really big practical joker Uh huh But uh actually kind of a mean practical joker You got some of that then Yeah Absolutely And you help people Yeah And I would never do anything to hurt anybody or destroy property you know But um I mean I wouldn t take a practical joke that far but there s nothing funnier than a real good practical joke Yeah Do you have any That you can share Like my daddy he had five sisters and one of them was his favorite I mean they all say you know that she was his favorite and she was telling about when it was so hard for her to get to go on a date because everybody was a friend of my daddy Forget his daddy They were afraid of my daddy And one of them said that one day he walked out to the car and they got where they wouldn t come to the house and she had to walk down this long driveway to pick her up And she said my daddy come over there and she said He was so nice to my date And her date stayed in the car And said she said my daddy was leaning in over the passenger side like where she was sitting Uh huh And she said He just kept talking to us and just telling us what a good movie was playing and all this type thing And he was so nice She said they didn t realize it until later on that evening that even while he stood there talking to him he had painted all up and down the side of this guy s car Oh my goodness That type thing you know That s That s what I said I don t destroy property you know And then the sister she just built a house and you know back then I mean uh she had uh she was probably one of the first ones in the family that own a brick home you know Uh huh And her and her husband had built a new house and my daddy did a lot of the carpentry work And the house once it was built and they got moved in she told everybody that as soon as they got in the house to take their shoes off well from what I gather it really made my daddy mad because he had helped build it and you know So he went and got one of uncle s goats and took the goat back down there with him into the house You know just things like that I mean I m not malicious so My daddy well he didn t want Sherry and Billy riding in his car and he made them duck down in front of Billing s Store and when they got there he d push them out of the car They both laugh Because he was so embarrassed But one time he ran over they went to down in Hickory I don t know if you know where that is but sort of near Longview actually But they went to this snack bar one time that s the kind of place where everybody pulled in and they had the speakers Right And uh he ordered something and then he got out and he was cruising around acting cool and everything But he almost killed this guy He turned around the curve and this guy was holding the thing like this He was holding the drink he was holding was going shzzzz Sitting there holding See I love stuff like that I love stuff like that I mean that s absolutely Of course he won t tell us anything because he won t tell us much of anything about his past because he had a Mohawk and he just Yeah He s real quiet about the things he had done Right I think we don t want to know what he did That s like you tell your stories to your children and it s like Who did you date when you were growing up I dated really nice guys You know very clean cut Oh my God If they d seen some of the guys I used to date Oh really They were all scholars That s true Oh Absolutely I went with him but I mean you know But you and Tony aren t very opposite I mean not really No not I mean oh I don t know There s a lot of things we are opposites in but it all evens out Compliments Yeah all compliments each other Like he hates to read you know Mark does too And I love to read Everybody has their own Absolutely And I m afraid that all of them are going to be like him in the area I mean at least it s not nobody likes to read like I do Right You know Right Does Sarah like to read like you do Who Sarah and Andy Do they they re are they kind of like Don They ve slowed down They re were doing really good but Doing OK in school Absolutely I think a lot of it is that AR Yeah I m all for AR but at the same time like right now I had this little thing that kind of upsets me Like right now Sarah has to have two points a week On the AR It s hard for her to read at one it s hard for her to read two one point books Uh huh Every day it s Exactly because it has to be done before Friday Uh huh And if she reads a one point book and takes a test on it she misses a question she gets point nine The reading another one point book she s going to get say she gets a 100 on it she s still only got one point nine and she had to have two points So every week it seems like I have to go to the library and get these little point five books as I call them fillers just to fill in Uh huh And and and I think to me I m afraid that I m taking away the joy of reading Exactly If I said You ve got to read this now You know Exactly Uh huh Now Amanda she gets to read self selected books and Sarah starting to read self selected books But um I think it s important because not all kids are athletes not all kids like athletic books Uh huh I probably never read a sports book in my life I don t think I ever have As much as I like to read sports just isn t one of the things that held any interest for me whatsoever I always liked books about true stories whether it was it could be murders you know those always grabbed my attention I guess because I knew it really happened Right That s just like historical places I ve been to the Alamo I ve been to Alcatraz like four times It s like one of my favorite places in the world I d give anything if I could stay over there Sean Connery on The Rock Actually I was there before Sean Connery Really Yeah It s crying shame The whole thing you know I could not get enough information about Alcatraz We got to meet one of the former inmates over there and one of the former guards Yeah I ve got a bunch of pictures with him with a man Actually I bought one of his books but um I mean it s just fascinating to me you know To be on the rock and just And the guard was the inmate was talking about he said you know he said They think that it s not we re not being punished enough Like when we got to go outside to the exercise yard He said But if you don t think that it s not punishment He said I promise you that I could stand outside in this yard and look across the harbor where you can see the whole bay area and he said If it was quiet enough you could swear you could hear champagne glasses clinking together Your I guess your imagination you know what all going on there you know Uh huh But I oh I just absolutely loved it I mean I wouldn t want to be incarcerated or anything I would love I would love to be able to stand right over there you know Just just to see oh This is wonderful Uh huh I would have liked to have been there when men were over there you know Machinegun Kelly and Oh I would have loved it Love it When did they close that place Nineteen I forget Nineteen sixty something Yeah um I mean a whole is it an island Absolutely And the whole thing s a prison Yeah Absolutely Well they had warden s houses all the officers all the guards they all lived there Oh really Yeah But there s no fresh water I mean every day they had to ferry a boat back and forth and bring fresh water You know there s because it s just right there in the middle you know There s no fresh water and no way of getting fresh water over there other than by boat Uh huh And so um of course everything that s over there you know how salt water damages you know Uh huh So everything that s over there is such just such a hard place to upkeep And it was so cold and each prisoner was assigned a little light almost like a cardigan type sweater Yeah and a blanket And that s what they had year round Of course it s not supposed to be like you know Holiday Inn or anything Yeah I know There are a lot of bad things about it its location That s wild How far is it off the It s like right Here s the Golden you can stand right there and like pier you get under the Fisherman s Wharf and the pier s right there in San Francisco you can see Golden Gate Bridge Alcatraz there s Oakland Bridge Uh huh and it s just all right there together Cool If I had the it s probably a 15 minute ferry ride But I mean that s just a little ferry If I was on a motorboat it would probably not take me five minutes to get over there Uh huh You know I mean it s you can see it it s just right there It s beautiful and that s why it s called The Rock it literally looks like a big rock just popped out of the ocean and just you know water all the way around it I mean I d like to go sometime but it s not on my Great To Do list or anything It s wonderful Absolutely wonderful I mean I d like to go to CA and see the redwoods That s really what I want to see Yeah Have you been to see the redwoods Uh huh We went to Big Bear Lake and we stayed at a friend s house in um Alberta It s a little town Albert It was a little bitty town but it s ski country and um they d just finished filming a movie And we were right beside the city called Columbia Where um Back to the Future II had been filmed Uh huh We went panning for gold and went horseback riding down there and um um but when we went to see the trees the trees there was one tree I have pictures of this too You just have to see it to believe it I put the kids on it just so you could get an idea of about how large it was But this tree it s been years probably about six years or five years so I don t remember the exact width or anything but this tree was so large and it was the first one that they had spotted so they cut it down and there was OK this is how big it was this tree that when the trunk part they holed it all out and made a bowling alley out if I think like a four lane bowling alley Ooh A four lane bowling alley out of this tree God And right behind it the stump or whatever was leveled off and they made a bar room with a dance floor out of this tree I mean it was so huge It was unreal Things like that I mean that stuff fascinates me They had the trees where you could literally drive through the tree The tree was kind of like sculpted out and big enough for you to drive through How neat I I have pictures like started taking a picture and I make Tony and the girls stand like this with their arms you know and still have tree on both sides of them on either side of them Just amazing These huge trees And that doesn t begin to tell you how tall they were I just couldn t get over it It s just huge I mean it s just huge That s cool Was that your favorite vacation spot CA My favorite vacation spot That would be San Francisco Oh really It s just I mean I wouldn t want to live there Oh God Just the bustle and the well everyday Tony would be working normally when we were there I ve taken the girls once The rest of the time it would be like everywhere I just couldn t wait for him to get up and go to work wherever he had to go that day I was hitting the Wharf you know I mean just everything from the sights the sounds the smells the everything I just loved it all The cable cars everything I would stop on the Wharf and get some um prawns for lunch or something you know That s kind of cool It was just wonderful I wouldn t want to live there But it was just absolutely wonderful Every time he goes back he has to go to San Francisco I always try to go If we have enough points to go I ll go I ll have to go Is the temperature really hot or cool It s pretty well cool But most of the time when I ve been there it s been around January and it s not it doesn t seem like it s as cold as it is here but it s always foggy and January s pretty rainy too But it s never so bad that it keeps me from doing anything you know I mean I can still walk all over the city and I never remember having to walk with an umbrella So but pretty often the day is kind of cloudy and just And you can shop a lot Yeah Yeah and there s you know in CA it s unlike it is here they ve got bread stores You know you go buy a loaf of bread it s like a loaf of bread stuck in one of the old paper popcorn holders you know Yeah I mean it s not cellophane with a twist tie There you go You know It s like a loaf of bread that you can chew on while you re walking down the street Yeah So and and the things that that are everywhere over there You can literally just walk down the street you can get you a bowl of clam chowder in the scooped out bread you know Oh yeah And I mean just just things that you don t get here you know We have a hot dog shop where they actually do that put soup in the bread but it s expensive Oh yeah Absolutely I think that uh where were we Oh Disney World They have it there too I was trying to think the only other place I ve seen it was Carowinds but no it was Disney World But yeah I mean just everything about it was so complex And then you had the people all over the street not just begging for money It s not like they re just standing there asking for handouts like they do here Uh huh Uh huh These people are doing something for the money And they take turns Where the I think it s Market and Powel Streets Market Hyde or Powel Those three streets all intersect somewhere where the cable cars are running And where they all come down and turn around it s like these people all have scheduled show times you know Like at one o clock you have this Black guy down there they re playing a fiddle and he ll play for 15 minutes it s time for the next cable car to come in and turn around and everybody s just gathered around there He passes his little hat around or his fiddle case or whatever and everybody throws money in it Well then next time it s a juggler and the next time it s a mime and the next time it s three guys who play guitars Um hum But it s always something going on And you know it s just the culture and I m always thinking you know it s not at least they re not expecting they are providing you some type of entertainment they re doing something you know Uh huh And uh that s the type thing that you really That s neat Yeah just it s just really nice to see all those things going on I can remember this guy standing there and he had this little dog I don t know what kind of dog it was but it couldn t have been more than a foot tall standing on his little hind legs and he also had a little hat and sunglasses and you could have your picture made with him for a dollar Just things like that Things that you do not see every day It s almost like going to Carowinds or someplace and seeing all these little special little things you know But they re all over the place All you have to do is open your eyes and you re there You have vendors that you know are selling homemade jewelry and there s still a lot of the old hippies and you d see a lot of the old hippies too There s a lot of the areas like that in CA That s my favorite CA would have to be my favorite vacation spot Sounds like the place to go You got to go I want to go to CO for the Grand Canyon and all that Yeah See all that Yeah I d like to do that too I haven t done that yet There s a lot in fact telling about San Francisco is my favorite spot that s my problem see I get to travel so infrequently that when I do get to go I m always thinking Well maybe I d love to go do this and this and this And I think Well what if I go and I don t have as much fun as I would if I had gone to you know Uh huh So I know if I go here I ll have fun if I go here So I ll go back there you know That s what I tell Mark I want to go back to Chicago I wouldn t live there Right But it is so awesome That s another place I d like to go I mean it is so busy but if you want to be alone you can be alone In one of the busiest cities in the world Absolutely And nobody cares And then you could walk down Navy Pier and it must be a little bit like San Francisco only they don t have well they do have people down there making money but they re mostly drawing people and stuff like that It is beyond cool And nobody but you know people say they re indifferent or whatever but not really it s just that it s a whole different lifestyle Exactly Absolutely They don t I don t their driving is my driving I don t know but I was getting screamed at and everything else but it s just a different place Now I like Schaumburg it s a suburb and there s not you know it would be like being here you know Or like Gastonia with Franklin Blvd stuff like that You had everything you needed You didn t have to go into the city Right You could go into the city for something special you know that was just there but everyday living you could just stay in Schaumburg and never to leave That s one thing I liked about San Francisco When we stayed right there right in the heart of it I could walk anywhere I wanted to go And we weren t I could literally walk out of my hotel and then two blocks to Fisherman s Wharf and all the piers Pier 39 is my favorite it had hundreds of shops on it and you know and and these seals and nobody knows why And I mean hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of seals just started coming to this pier And they ve got all the little boat slips well they re just covered with seals all the time And nobody knows why they just started coming up there you know But it s just wonderful There s there s so many things that you never get the chance to see anywhere else but you can see it all just walking around And then of course you have Lombard St the crookedest street in the world I ve walked down that street and it s amazing you know Just like those movie spots Absolutely the crookedest street in the world yeah And all those are right there within walking distance Then you take a cable car and go to Chinatown Uh huh And still that s not that far but after walking up and down those hills You are ready for bed when you go to bed that night But it is absolutely wonderful There s shops there s um all kinds of like comedy clubs and stuff Um it s just a whole different world I mean everything that you can imagine seeing all at once it s just And you can smell you have to love seafood you can smell seafood all over the city and hot breads and go get you a bowl of chapino and a big old thing of bread and just What s chapino It s like a fisherman s stew Uh huh We make it here In fact I bought I got the recipe from the little where we went to eat at Fisherman s Wharf At the Grotto Uh huh Got the recipe for chapino It s got like a tomato based soup and then it s got uh oysters it s got um crab claws it s got shrimp but nothing s peeled So you have to have these big bibs on It s not something you d want to eat on a date you know Because it makes such a mess But when we make it here at home but of course we peel everything Thank God When we make it at home we put like the whitefish in it and like uh uh tilapia Um oysters and shrimp you know I don t know if I put any crab in it But it s just wonderful Wonderful I think my favorite um food story from here is Tony putting pork rinds on the chicken Oh God Absolutely Atkins Diet Yeah Just crush up those pork rinds and roll your chicken in it It s much more creative really Yep That s when you get real desperate Tony again somebody was asking me from church the other day he recently went to the men s breakfast the one they have once a month on Saturday mornings And um Tony came back and said that he said I had to fix gravy for them And I m like Uh oh He said What I said I didn t know you knew how to cook But they ve been asking me for a long time And basically that s right they have But I told them I said Tony is one of those people who could improvise So I have learned after 19 years of marriage I have learned If you don t want to know don t ask Don t ask Because he won t lie to you He will not lie to you If he tells you something it s the truth I promise you he will not lie to you Like for instance one day there was a little gravy story He had made gravy As I sat down to eat it I thought We don t have any milk And Tony likes powdered milk he grew up on that welfare type milk Uh huh Yuck But anyway with a clothespin on my nose I was sitting there thinking and it was white gravy it was not water gravy And I said Tony How did you make gravy No answer So then I got to thinking We don t have any powdered milk Yes we do I said Tony look me straight in my eyes and tell me you did not put baby formula in this gravy And he looked at me and said How s it taste I knew I was eating baby formula gravy Eeeww So you know hey If I hadn t have known I would have been fine but knowing it s like Ooh I was glad I had quit nursing or he would have had breast milk in there There s some things you don t want to know Absolutely I mean it s just like like I ve learned if you don t want to know don t ask him Because he can he can come up with stuff you wouldn t ever think about you know Was it OK Yeah I mean it tasted fine but it was just knowing that it was in there Eating Enfamil gravy you know That s hilarious That s nasty too Absolute ly Uh huh Whew Well Mark s told me about some of his creative stuff but Mark s pretty creative too Yeah Like the time he cooked he left the Red vinegar Oh please Well Mark says stuff about it too and I m like and I m No we can t Forget it But no he um one time put he said I m going to marinate these salmon steaks Neither one of us had had it in our whole married life Uh huh that would be nice He s going to marinate it and cook it later you know And it ended up and oh God It had the worst It was pretty I said What did you put in this Red vinegar Red vinegar and it ruined it It had oh God It was awful I m not going to do that again On salmon steak I know It was nasty man I don t think you put vinegar on fish I don t really know I don t think no HC Vinegar s too strong for fish It ll go right through it With oil and stuff maybe a little vinegar We ll have to make a big pot of chapino and bring it out there Oh golly I d love to The only time we did it was when Bubba lived here because it s really expensive and we ll all go in together and make the ingredients But uh it s and we even made our own little one day we all we always made you know I got the bread machine and we always make a big loaf of bread Use it to dip in there Well bread s fine I said You know I said I would love to have some pasta So from that time on every time we d fix it me and Bubba would fix a big pot of angel hair pasta Um hum It s real thin Pour that chapino over it Man it was delicious I mean it s you use olive oil It s got garlic and um I m trying to remember what kind of peppers are in it but it is so good And you have to uh braise the little onions and stuff you know It s it s to die for It s awesome Awesome Cool Yeah I ve never had oysters but Even my kids will eat it Isn t that something too I mean once you get to dipping out you you don t have to get an oyster you know Yeah I don t want no oyster in it Amanda grew up eating oysters One time she was sitting in the highchair she d say That s no chicken And then an oyster I bought her at the Fish Camp and she d she d bit into it and the centers are normally gray you know Yeah She d bite it and OK just keep it You know Didn t faze her in the least Nate s eating um real food now He had um well actually we tried those Gerber ones that have the whole peas and stuff like that a little piece of chicken in the bottom And um he he actually ate like he ll eat baby food fruit or sometimes baby food cereal not you know not all the time He eats fruit at the daycare You better watch it I told Tony I said you know Let me think about it Once you ve tried table food can you imagine sucking on one of them bottles you know I know It won t bother me because he drinks too many bottles right now Well Jasmine s down to about three bottles a day Really Yeah um when we kept her I gave her she had one about about well it s always nap time like 10 30 in the morning around 10 00 one around 2 00 or 3 00 and then one at nighttime Well of course Nate has to have about six or seven or eight And it s getting old by about I bet we spend 180 00 if not more dollars a month on formula God Because he he you know I am and he s a bottle freak And I don t know but I can t afford that much longer and I figure well he seems Yeah well he s 10 months old It s almost time to to Well I from the day I mean from the day that mine turned a year old I started buying whole milk Uh huh Absolutely Because even and Tony said she s complaining the other day she s saying you know between Jasmine and Darnell she said I buy they drink at least one gallon of milk a day It s like normally they ll drink a whole gallon and start on the second every day so you re looking at at least eight or nine gallons a week So but even at that at three dollars a gallon you know Uh huh What is that 27 00 a week Something like that If it was nine gallons I must spend about 50 00 a week usually So you re still saving some but Well I m ready for it but now he s decided he d eat the real food And then last night my brother had this surgery and we went over there and Mark said Well I guess we ll take chicken because that s the fastest thing So he went in KFC and got one of those buckets with the slaw and everything And um I shredded up little pieces of chicken and mashed potatoes and goes through these phases where he never eats and you know he never eats Yeah But he ate that up and Mark said today He acts like he s a little constipated And I said Well when you get in there try and get me some fruit because when Colleen started eating real slow when she got hooked in cheese that was it
