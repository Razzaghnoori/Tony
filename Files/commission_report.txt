Director of Program Performance EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Legal Services Corporation is a private nonmembership nonprofit corporation in the District of Columbia The Board of Directors of the Corporation is composed of 11 voting members who are appointed by the President of the United States with the advice and consent of the Senate By law the Board is bipartisan no more than six members can be of the same political party Erlenborn Commission The Erlenborn Commission was authorized by a resolution of the Corporation s Board of Directors on November 16 1998 to study the presence requirement in the Corporation s statutory restriction on the representation of eligible aliens Since 1983 the Corporation s appropriations act and its regulation on the representation of aliens have required that an alien be present in the United States to be eligible for legal assistance from an LSC grantee Neither the appropriations act nor the Corporation s regulations define the term present in the United States The Commission solicited written comments from the public and held two public hearings duly noticed in the Federal Register The Report of the Commission is based on a thorough analysis of the applicable statutory provisions the extensive record compiled from the comments and testimony regarding the circumstances under which representation of eligible aliens occurs and the practices of legal services grantees relating to eligible aliens Scope of alien representation Corporation grantees are permitted to represent several classes of aliens including lawful permanent aliens refugees persons granted asylum and temporary agricultural workers admitted under the H 2A program With the sole exception of H 2A workers LSC grantees may provide representation to aliens on the same subjects as is provided to citizens The report refers to these classes as unrestricted categories The representation of H 2A workers however is limited to matters which arise under the provisions of the worker s specific employment contract in the areas of wages housing transportation and other employment rights under the contract The present in the United States requirement applies to both the unrestricted categories and H 2A workers Of particular interest to the Commission was the situation of seasonal agricultural workers a category that includes both aliens from the unrestricted categories such as permanent resident aliens and H 2A workers Seasonal agricultural workers frequently leave and re enter the United States thus the presence requirement would have a substantial and direct impact on their ability to receive legal representation from LSC grantees The record reveals that it has been a long standing practice for LSC grantees to provide legal assistance to eligible aliens who have left the United States at some point during representation This practice has been followed without objection from the Corporation when conducting audits of LSC grantees or from agricultural employers and growers associations involved in legal disputes In addition there has been no formal regulation or opinion of the General Counsel s office regarding the specific scope of the presence requirement A recent complaint to the Corporation about the activities of a sub grantee relating to alien representation raised the issue presented to the Commission Statutory Analysis Applying the principles of law governing statutory analysis the Commission considered the presence requirement in light of its plain and ordinary meaning its context in a statutory scheme and the purpose and design of the statute as a whole See Part III A The Corporation s appropriations act requires that an alien must be present in the United States in order to be eligible for legal assistance Construing the term present according to its ordinary meaning it is clear that the statute requires the alien to be physically present in the United States at some point This conclusion does not end the inquiry however because the relevant question is not whether an alien must be physically present in the United States but when the alien must be present in order to be entitled to LSC representation Here the language provides no express statement on when an alien must be present in the United States Indeed no single interpretation is clearly compelled by the statutory language For example nothing in the LSC authorization language keys representation to when the cause of action arises or specifically requires that the alien be present when the representation commences In particular the statute does not expressly require that an alien be continuously physically present in the United States throughout the period of representation in order to be eligible for legal assistance The factual record and the statutory scheme in which the language arises on the other hand provide an important context for consideration of the legal question of when an alien must be present in the United States Consideration of the immediate context in which the language appears raises further questions regarding the meaning of the presence requirement The statute s application of the presence requirement to legal permanent residents for example is in some tension with the fact that those aliens are legally entitled to leave the United States temporarily without affecting their immigration status See Part II C 1 Furthermore H 2A workers by definition are physically present in the United States only temporarily Reading presence in the statute to require uninterrupted continuous physical presence would mean that Congress without using such language intended to deny LSC representation to aliens who engaged in federally authorized travel that did not affect their immigration status In the case of H 2A workers the reading would require the conclusion that Congress intended to provide H 2A workers with legal services representation on claims arising from their employment contracts only for the very brief periods that the workers are in the United States potentially rendering the promise of legal representation largely meaningless In short an examination of the language of the presence requirement and the statutory context in which it arises raises a number of interpretive problems and fails to resolve the question of when an alien must be present in the United States in order to be entitled to legal services representation The Commission concludes that the statutory language is ambiguous on this point These difficulties support further inquiry into relevant legislative history to help determine the meaning of the presence requirement Legislative History The legislative history of the presence requirement in the Corporation s appropriations and the applicable H 2A provisions in the Immigration Reform and Control Act confirm that Congress intended to provide meaningful representation to eligible aliens including H 2A workers on claims arising from their employment contract and that Congress did not understand the presence requirement to severely alter or restrict this representation See Part III B The Legal Services Act was adopted to provide effective legal representation to low income persons The presence language appeared in the LSC appropriations act as part of an effort to expand LSC representation to aliens other than lawful residents and does not appear to have been intended to limit LSC representation to aliens who were continuously physically present in the United States Similarly the express purpose of Section 305 of IRCA was to secure the rights of H 2 agricultural workers under the specific contract under which they were admitted to this country Such representation was intended to prevent the exploitation of foreign H2A workers and to ensure that the wages and working conditions of U S workers would not be undermined Findings of Fact and Application of Law The record compiled by the Commission supports inter alia the following findings of fact See Part II Aliens in the unrestricted categories often legally leave the country during the course of their representation See Part II C 1 Most H 2A workers are in the United States for brief periods of time and do not seek legal representation until they have completed their contract often because of fear of retaliation by the growers See Part II C 2 and D 1 Most claims made by aliens take years to resolve See Part II E Requiring legal services attorneys to monitor their clients movements and formally withdraw whenever the client leaves the country would create extraordinary burdens for the LSC grantees the clients opposing parties and the courts See Part II G Finally the private bar and other nonprofit legal services providers are neither available willing nor able to take over the representation of these populations See Part II F This factual record provided an important context for consideration of the legal question of the meaning of the presence requirement Three possible interpretations of the presence language were listed in the Corporation s Federal Register notice 1 an alien must be physically present in the United States when the cause of action for which the recipient provides legal assistance arises 2 an alien must be physically present only when legal representation is commenced and 3 an alien must be physically present in the United States any time the alien is provided legal assistance from an LSC grantee Upon careful consideration of the findings of fact the language and purposes of the statute and the legislative history the Commission has determined that none of these formulations fully responds to the purposes of the statute or the intent of Congress Furthermore the record demonstrates that the interpretations initially offered by the Corporation in the Federal Register notice would contradict Congress clear purpose of providing meaningful legal representation to indigent lawful aliens and lead to absurd results See Part III C For example as applied to the unrestricted aliens such interpretations would preclude representation for permanent resident aliens who are evicted from their apartments or against whom divorce proceedings were commenced while the alien is legally out of the country for brief periods to attend a family emergency or funeral These interpretations would also invite exploitation by allowing litigants to simply wait until an alien temporarily departed the United States before cutting off workers compensation benefits or initiating eviction repossession or divorce or custody proceedings In regard to H 2A workers the record demonstrates that Congress purpose of providing meaningful representation to these workers cannot be accomplished under the three interpretations in the Federal Register Many of the contract rights of such workers such as reimbursement for return transportation workers compensation the 3 4 guarantee and claims that a grower failed to mail the worker s final paycheck often do not arise until after the worker has returned home In addition if the worker is required to be in the United States throughout the course of the representation the right to legal assistance would be lost altogether By law H 2A workers must leave the country at the end of their contract period and most such workers are in the United States for only two to five months The factual record before the Commission demonstrates that the vast majority of the claims of H 2A workers cannot be completed while the alien is in the United States The Commission recognizes that representation of agricultural workers was a central element in the legislative crafting of the H 2A program The Commission concludes that this reading of the statute would essentially bar LSC representation of this class of aliens and leave H 2A workers without meaningful representation on their employment contract claims directly contrary to Congress express purpose We decline to sanction such a result Conclusion Together the language purpose and legislative history of the applicable statutes and the factual record before the Commission suggest an interpretation of the statute that would authorize the following representation For an alien in one of the unrestricted categories representation would be authorized so long as the eligible alien is present sufficient to maintain residence or lawful immigration status Under this interpretation LSC grantees who have begun representation of a permanent resident alien may continue that representation should the alien be temporarily outside the United States Grantees may also initiate representation of aliens in the unrestricted categories who are temporarily outside the United States provided that they have been present sufficient to maintain and have not abandoned their residence or INA status LSC grantees may not represent aliens in this category who have never entered or been present in the United States For H 2A workers representation is authorized if the workers have been admitted to and have been present in the United States pursuant to an H 2A contract and the representation arises under their H 2A contract LSC grantees are authorized to litigate this narrow range of claims to completion despite the fact that the alien may be required to depart the United States prior to or during the course of the representation LSC grantees may not represent aliens in this category who have never entered or been present in the United States I INTRODUCTION The Erlenborn Commission was established to evaluate the scope of permissible representation for eligible aliens by LSC grantees Since 1983 the Corporation s appropriations act and its regulation on the representation of aliens have required that an alien be present in the United States to be eligible for legal assistance from an LSC grantee Neither the appropriations act nor the Corporation s regulations defines the term present in the United States The Legal Services Corporation Board of Directors adopted Resolution 98 011 on November 16 1998 providing authority to establish the Commission with the express purpose of studying the presence requirement for the representation of eligible aliens LSC grantees are permitted to represent several classes of aliens including lawful permanent aliens refugees persons granted asylum and temporary agricultural workers admitted under the H 2A program 1 With the sole exception of H 2A workers LSC grantees may provide general representation to aliens on all the same subjects as is provided to citizens These classes will be referred to as unrestricted categories The representation of H 2A workers however is limited to matters which arise under the worker s specific employment contract in the areas of wages housing transportation and other employment rights The present in the United States requirement applies to both the unrestricted categories and to H 2A workers The Commission has gathered an extensive factual record The Commission solicited comments from the public through a notice duly published in the Federal Register 64 Fed Reg 8140 1999 The Commission sought public comments on the facts and circumstances surrounding the representation of all eligible aliens who are affected by the presence requirement It placed particular emphasis on seasonal 2 agricultural workers which includes temporary H 2A workers as well as aliens from the unrestricted 3 categories such as permanent resident aliens and special agricultural workers SAWS The Federal Register notice asked that comments be directed to the following questions 1 How long are seasonal agricultural workers typically in the United States 1 The program s name is derived from the subparagraph of the Immigration and Nationality Act INA that defines the status 8 U S C 1101 a 15 H ii a 1994 an alien having residence in a foreign country which he has no intention of abandoning who is coming temporarily to the United States to perform agricultural labor or services of a temporary or seasonal nature 2 See 8 U S C 1160 h 1994 Seasonal agricultural work is defined in the INA as the performance of field work related to planting cultural practices cultivating growing and harvesting of fruits and vegetables of every kind and other perishable commodities as defined in regulations by the Secretary of Agriculture Id 3 See 8 U S C 1160 a 1 B 1994 An alien is eligible for classification as a special agricultural worker if he or she has resided in the United States and performed seasonal agricultural work in the United States for at least 90 man days during the twelve month period ending May 1 1986 1 2 When does the seasonal agricultural worker normally seek legal representation 3 What are the common claims of seasonal agricultural workers seeking legal representation 4 When do the claims of seasonal agricultural workers generally ripen 5 How long does it typically take to resolve seasonal agricultural workers legal claims 6 What is the established practice of LSC recipients in representing seasonal agricultural workers 7 What is the likelihood that private counsel is available to represent aliens who are in the United States under temporary visas or who may temporarily leave the United States 8 Under what circumstances do seasonal agricultural workers commonly leave the United States 9 What are the implications of the presence requirement on recipient attorneys professional obligations to their clients 4 The Federal Register notice identified a number of possible interpretations of the presence requirement 1 an alien must be physically present in the United States when the cause of action for which the recipient provides legal assistance arises 2 an alien must be physically present when legal representation is commenced and 3 an alien must be physically present in the United States any time the alien is provided legal assistance from an LSC grantee 5 This Report of the Commission identifies the current interpretation used by LSC grantees and the impact of alternative interpretations on all categories of eligible aliens The Commission held hearings at 1 Duke University Law School Durham North Carolina on March 27 1999 and 2 Stanford University Stanford California on April 10 1999 All requests to provide live testimony at one of the two public hearings were granted 4 64 Fed Reg 8140 8141 1999 5 Id II FACTUAL FINDINGS The Commission has compiled factual findings that address the questions identified in the Federal Register notice described above A Categories of Aliens Eligible for LSC funded Legal Services 1 Current Law LSC representation of aliens is limited to certain classes of aliens who broadly may be described as lawful permanent residents prospective lawful permanent residents and one specific group of temporary nonimmigrants 6 Lawful permanent resident is a term of art under the Immigration and Nationality Act 6 Under current law LSC recipients may provide legal assistance to an alien if the alien is present in the United States and falls within one of several designated categories A an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence as defined in section 101 a 20 of the Immigration and Nationality Act 8 U S C 1101 a 20 B an alien who i is married to a United States citizen or is a parent or an unmarried child under the age of 21 of such a citizen and ii has filed an application to adjust the status of the alien to the status of a lawful permanent resident under the Immigration and Nationality Act 8 U S C 1101 et seq which application has not been rejected C an alien who is lawfully present in the United States pursuant to an admission under section 207 of the Immigration and Nationality Act 8 U S C 1157 relating to refugee admission or who has been granted asylum by the Attorney General under such Act D an alien who is lawfully present in the United States as a result of withholding of deportation by the Attorney General pursuant to section 243 h of the Immigration and Nationality Act 8 U S C 1253 h Section 1253 h was redesignated as section 1231 b 3 Restriction on Removal and amended by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 IIRAIRA E an alien to whom section 305 of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 8 U S C 1101 note applies but only to the extent that the legal assistance provided is the legal assistance described in such section or INA 8 U S C 1101 1504 1994 Supp II 1996 and is defined in the statute as the status of having been lawfully accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the United States as an immigrant in accordance with the immigration laws 8 U S C 1101 a 20 1994 The group of prospective lawful permanent residents includes both applicants for permanent resident status and likely prospective applicants based on their current status in the United States as individuals fleeing persecution refugees asylees conditional entrants and aliens granted relief from removal by an Immigration Judge 7 There is one category of eligible aliens agricultural workers under the H 2A Program who are aliens only temporarily in the United States As noted above representation of H 2A workers is limited to specific subject matters arising under the H 2A employment contract Because of the special representational issues regarding this category of eligible aliens we will examine it in detail 2 Temporary Agricultural Workers under the H 2A Program H 2A aliens as the only category of eligible aliens who reside in the United States temporarily are particularly affected by the issue before the Commission because of their necessarily short periods of time in the United States H 2A aliens are non immigrants who reside in a foreign country but come to the United States temporarily to perform agricultural labor or services for a specified employer or employers 8 U S C 1101 a 15 H ii a 1994 Their term of stay in the United States is dependent upon the agricultural needs of the employer but by law cannot exceed one year 8 C F R 214 2 h 5 iv 1999 The H 2A Program for temporary agricultural workers is a complex regulatory scheme devised by Congress to meet competing concerns the need of agricultural employers for workers and the need F an alien who is lawfully present in the United States as the result of being granted conditional entry to the United States before April 1 1980 pursuant to section 203 a 7 of the Immigration and Nationality Act 8 U S C 1153 a 7 as in effect on March 31 1980 because of persecution or fear of persecution on account of race religion or political calamity Omnibus Consolidated Recissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 tit V 101 Pub L No

representation of any alien who herself or whose child has beensubject to domestic violence However the representation is limited to preventing or obtaining relief from the violence The representation may occur only with non LSC funds Eligibility for legal assistance for this category of aliens is not dependent upon the alien being present in the United States See Departments of Commerce Justice

Stat 1515 1998 implemented by 45 C F R pt 1626 2 1626 4 1999 to protect agricultural laborers both foreign and domestic The United States has facilitated the importation of foreign agricultural workers in response to alleged shortages of workers in the United States for many years under various programs 8 Agricultural employers have consistently asserted that many U S workers did not want to work in seasonal agriculture or live in rural areas and that crops would rot in the fields without foreign workers Organized labor and advocates for farm workers historically have disputed these assertions based on the general high employment rate among domestic farm workers and the alleged desire of agricultural employers to preserve a cheap labor force with limited legal rights Charles Gordon et al Immigration Law and Procedure 20 09 1 1999 The H 2A Program was established by the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 IRCA Pub L No 99 603 100 Stat 3359 In adopting the H 2A program Congress sought a balanced program that would ensure an adequate source of labor but would not exploit employees or provide an added incentive to hire foreign rather than resident workers See H R REP NO 99 682 I at 106 1986 reprinted in 1986 U S C C A N 5649 5710 Accordingly the legislation requires that agricultural employers recruit U S workers first and that the terms of work offered foreign workers when U S workers are unavailable must notadversely affect the wages and working conditions of U S workers 8 U S C 1188 a 1994 Congress designated a specific set of rights and guarantees for H 2A workers including workers compensation housing and other benefits to ensure that these statutory goals were met 8 U S C 1188 b d 1994 The U S Department of Labor USDOL has also promulgated regulations mandating the minimum benefits that must be provided to H 2A workers 20 C F R 655 102 a 1999 In general the wages benefits and working conditions the employer intends to offer to H 2A workers must also be offered to recruited U S workers which includes lawful permanent resident aliens Immigration Law and Procedure supra at 20 09 1 Growers must replace H 2A workers with any U S worker who applies for the job before half of the season is over 20 C F R 655 103 3 1999 The process for the admission of H 2A workers requires that the grower submit an application for certification to USDOL setting forth all the material terms and conditions of work that the employer intends to offer its workers If USDOL determines that a labor shortage exists and that the job offer satisfies the federal requirements USDOL approves the employer s application for certification See 8 U S C 1188 a 1994 The U S Department of Justice through the Immigration and Naturalization Service INS then approves the employer s H 2A visa petition to bring in workers and the U S Department of State issues nonimmigrant visas See id The approved H 2A visa petition and the corresponding H 2A 8 The controversial Bracero Program operated between 1942 and 1964 and permitted Mexicans to work temporarily in United States agriculture From 1964 to 1986 entry of foreign agricultural workers was permitted under the H 2 Program which many agricultural employers found inadequate Immigration Law and Procedure supra at 20 09 1 see also Erlenborn Commission Comments on Presence Requirement Supplement Apr 10 1999 at 56 comment of Howard Berman Member of Congress hereinafter April Comments describing prior programs as quite controversial for many years visa permit the worker to stay for the duration of the certified period of employment but in no event may the visa exceed one year 8 C F R 214 2 h 5 iv 1999 April Comments at 9 comment of D Michael Hancock USDOL Further the visa is terminated at any time the H 2A worker s employment relationship ends whether through voluntary departure or involuntary termination Id The H 2A worker must depart the country and is subject to deportation for failing to do so Id Thus the H 2A worker is only admitted to the United States to perform work for a designated employer or employers and must leave the United States when that employment terminates for any reason In crafting the H 2A program Congress was acutely aware of the vulnerability of temporary agricultural workers and of problems that had arisen under other such programs particularly the Bracero Program See discussion infra Part III B 2 Congress further recognized that the H 2A provisions 9 required enforcement mechanisms lest they become mere paper guarantees Thus in section 305 of IRCA Congress specifically authorized LSC funded representation for H 2A workers on matters pertaining to their employment contract 8 U S C 1101 note 1994 LSC funded representation was a core element in the legislative design of the H 2A program See 132 CONG REC H9866 68 1986 Erlenborn Commission Comments on The Presence Requirement Mar 27 1999 at 29 43 comment of Bill Beardall Texas Rural Legal Aid hereinafter March Comments April Comments at 53 58 comment of Howard Berman Member of Congress see also discussion infra Part III B 2 The statutory protections set forth in the H 2A program and the provision of legal representation to H 2A workers to enforce these rights thus were intended to accomplish two purposes to protect foreign workers from exploitation and to ensure that the employment of such workers would not depress the wages and working conditions of U S workers These considerations explain why H 2A workers are the only category of nonimmigrants eligible for LSC funded representation They also point to the differences between the representation authorized for the unrestricted categories and H 2A workers for the former grantees may represent eligible aliens on all matters for the latter representation is restricted to matters arising under the employment contract H 2A workers constitute a small but growing portion of the United States agricultural workforce During FY 1998 the most recent year for which statistics are available the USDOL certified 34 898 job openings and approximately 4 000 employers The FY 1998 H 2A Report U S Department of Labor Division of Foreign Labor Certifications Revised June 1999 hereinafter FY 1998 H 2A Report This is a dramatic increase from FY 1997 where 23 352 job openings were certified and

state or federal minimum wage requirement 10 64 Fed Reg 6690 1999 In most instances a non H 2A employer in an area with H 2A workers who are receiving the adverse effect wage rate would not be able to attract workers at a wage lower than the H 2A wage rate These workers would be able to secure jobs from the H 2A employer during the first half of the season because H 2A employers must provide a hiring preference for U S workers who apply for a job during the first half of the season 20 C F R 655 103 3 1999 However unenforcement of the H 2A wage rate and hiring preference implicitly allows the payment of a lower wage which has the effect of driving all wages for the area downward March Testimony at 24 testimony of Garry Geffert West Virginia Legal Services Plan Moreover absent

Defense and Education Fund The migratory and isolated nature of alien farmworker populations makes them extremely difficult for private attorneys to represent See April Testimony at 23 testimony of Cynthia Rice California Rural Legal Assistance April Testimony at 78 testimony of Victor Lara Attorney at Law Private attorneys are unfamiliar with the location of rural labor camps and lack the resources and knowledge of farmworker migratory behavior necessary to maintain contact with their clients Farmworker cases are very labor intensive clients generally cannot be accessed by phone or fax clients may not be able to communicate in writing and interviewing a client or obtaining or preparing documents may require multiple visits in person to the worker s location See April Testimony at 78

comment of Shelley Latin Virginia Farmworkers Legal Assistance Project March Comments at 208 comment of Jose Padilla and Cynthia L Rice California Rural Legal Assistance March Comments at 223 comment of Melissa A Pershing Legal Services of North Carolina The barriers involved in representing alien farmworkers are compounded by the low compensation available in such cases The low level of farmworker wages results in damages awards that are extremely low See April Testimony at 49 testimony of Jack Londen Attorney at Law Fees on wage and hour cases farm labor safety cases and many workers compensation cases are too low relative to the time needed to resolve the case for most private attorneys to litigate See March Comments at 50 comment of Francisco J Bricio Attorney at Law March Comments at 74 comment of Keith S Ernst Attorney at Law In California even large labor rights cases are difficult to refer to the private bar because of the unavailability of contingency fees the inadequacy of statutory fees and the difficulty involved in representing farmworker clients See March Comments at 208 comment of Jose Padilla and Cynthia L Rice California Rural Legal Assistance Private attorneys are not available to represent aliens in California administrative proceedings for which legal fees are not provided See id April Testimony at 18 testimony of Cynthia Rice California Rural Legal Assistance It is extremely difficult to obtain alternative representation for housing eviction benefits education and health access cases whether the client is an alien or a citizen See March Comments at 208 comment of Jose Padilla and Cynthia L Rice California Rural Legal Assistance Alien farmworker representation is further compromised by the lack of private attorneys in rural areas Georgia for example has several rural agricultural counties with fewer than five practicing lawyers and at least one such county with no attorney at all See March Comments at 187 comment of Michael L Monahan State Bar of Georgia Private attorneys who engage in the most pro bono work are located in large firms in major cities far removed from farmworker locales See April Testimony at 41 42 testimony of Jack Londen Attorney at Law The few attorneys who do reside in locations where farmworkers are likely to live and work generally represent agricultural employers and are conflicted out of representing farmworkers See March Comments at 174 comment of Daniel G Ford Columbia Legal Services April Testimony at 42 testimony of Jack Londen Attorney at Law April Testimony at 87 testimony of Victor Lara Attorney at Law Even in major cities located near farmworker areas it is extremely difficult to find pro bono lawyers able to represent farmworkers because agricultural employers are predominant clients in those areas See April Testimony at 42 testimony of Jack Londen Attorney at Law The Florida sugar industry for example retained many of the major firms in Florida to defend H 2A litigation See March Testimony at 144 testimony of Rob Williams Florida Legal Services Attorneys with expertise in employment matters a common claim of alien farmworkers also generally practice in urban areas far from the farmworker clients See March Comments at 81 comment of Marilyn J Endriss Attorney at Law The National Employment Lawyers Association whose members represent plaintiffs in employment law matters reports that while its members have expertise on employment law matters very few attorneys other than legal services lawyers are willing to take on these cases because of the complexity of farmworker legal claims the time and financial resources needed to litigate these cases and the practical problems of representing farmworkers See March Comments at 189 comment of Janet E Hill National Employment Lawyers Association see also March Comments at 81 comment of Marilyn J Endriss Attorney at Law The American Bar Association reports that pro bono programs operated through its Center for Pro Bono typically do not represent aliens for many of the reasons noted above See April Comments at 48 comment of Doreen Dodson ABA SCLAID The ABA further notes that while the immigration bar is generous with its time and equipped to overcome some of the practical barriers in representing aliens its members often do not have expertise to deal with general civil matters See id The ABA further reports on efforts it has made to expand pro bono services to the immigrant community See id at 49 These efforts have yet to result in significant new pro bono resources and it is not expected that private pro bono lawyers will be able to meet a significant portion of the demand for service See id The President of the North Carolina Bar Association reports that there just are not enough civil legal resources available from the private bar paid or pro bono to ensure that migrant workers achieve even minimum access to their basic human and contract rights See April Comments at 50 comment of Larry B Sitton North Carolina Bar Association The limited lawyers available and the barriers to farmworker representation make farmworker cases more difficult to place with pro bono attorneys than any other type of case including death penalty convictions See April Testimony at 44 testimony of Jack Londen Attorney at Law Moreover it would be impossible to find private counsel to handle emergency situations that arise for eligible alien clients See April Testimony at 97 testimony of Bruce Iwasaki Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles To the extent that private attorneys are

to specialized legal expertise language capability familiarity with aliens communities and the skills and resources necessary to keep in touch with migrating witnesses and clients If the assistance of the LSCfunded program were not available in these co counseled cases it is very unlikely that the private attorney would agree to become involved in the case See April Testimony at 45 testimony of

attorneys to accept H 2A cases on a contingency basis See March Comments at 21 comment of Robert J Willis Attorney at Law The H2A statute does not provide for attorneys fees and statutory fees are not always available See id at 20 March Testimony at 32 testimony of Garry G Geffert West Virginia Legal Services Plan In North Carolina statutory attorneys fees are awarded only on contract claims involving wages or wage like benefits See March Comments at 235 comment of Melissa A Pershing Legal Services of North Carolina Statutory fees are not available for wrongful discharge housing and health and safety contract claims See id In North Carolina the statutory twenty five percent contingent fee available in workers compensation cases includes all out of pocket costs the attorney has incurred on the case See March Comments at 21 comment of Robert J Willis Attorney at Law These costs can be substantial See id Consequently workers compensation recoveries except in catastrophic injury cases are too small to make it financially feasible for the private attorney to undertake these cases See id March Comments at 235 comment of Melissa A Pershing Legal Services of North Carolina

typically do not have the language skills special resources and knowledge necessary to maintain contact with a client who resides thousands of miles from their office and does not have a telephone or regular mail delivery and who may not even know the name of his employer See March Comments at 20 comment of Robert J Willis Attorney at Law see also March Comments at 235 comment of Melissa A Pershing Legal Services of North Carolina Often it is difficult if not impossible to conduct a client interview and fact investigation before the H 2A alien leaves the United States see discussion infra Part III D 2 and difficulties of communicating are compounded by the fact that many H 2A workers reside in small Mexican villages where the mail system is unreliable and telephone access extremely limited See March Comments at 235 comment of Melissa A Pershing Legal Services of North Carolina As in other alien cases in H 2A cases private counsel have depended upon the assistance and

comment of Shelley Latin Virginia Farmworkers Legal Assistance Project 2 Mediation and Alternative Dispute Resolution Mediation mechanisms alone to the extent that these are available to settle legal claims will not necessarily resolve aliens claims Commentators recognize that people will often refuse to participate in mediation if the other parties to the dispute lack the resources to litigate and they question the fairness of mediation if only one side is represented by counsel or if a disputant has difficulty negotiating effectively in English Stephen Goldberg et al Dispute Resolution Negotiations Mediation and Other Processes rd 3 ed 1999 The barriers to private bar representation experienced by alien clients are also applicable to ADR See March Comments at 209 comment of Jose Padilla and Cynthia L Rice California Rural Legal Assistance Further mediation mechanisms may not be available to many eligible aliens Alien clients may not have the financial means to use these procedures See March Comments at 77 comment of Mark Talamantes Attorney at Law March Comments at 209 comment of Jose Padilla and Cynthia L Rice California Rural Legal Assistance Pre litigation mediation is almost always subject to sharing of costs See March Comments at 209 comment of Jose Padilla and Cynthia L Rice California Rural Legal Assistance Court referred mediation is available after litigation is filed and often has a cost sharing component See id Even if a party agrees to pay the costs of the mediator for example in California there are other costs which the alien must bear such as paying for interpreters and translation of documents See id In some cases the possibility of a mediated settlement does not forgo the need to file litigation conduct discovery or obtain pre trial orders See March Comments at 173 comment of Daniel G Ford Columbia Legal Services March Comments at 233 comment of Melissa A Pershing Legal Services of North Carolina Oregon has an effective mediation program but pre trial mediation still requires representation by counsel and the availability of counsel to pursue litigation should mediation fail See March Comments at 142 comment of D Michael Dale Oregon Law Center and Janice Morgan Legal Aid Services of Oregon Mediation conducted in bad faith by a party can delay resolution of the case See March Comments at 49 comment of Francisco J Bricio Attorney at Law Finally as a practical matter in farmworker litigation agricultural employers may choose not to use mediation programs See March Testimony at 28 31 testimony of Garry G Geffert West Virginia Legal Services Plan In New York the legal services program the New York Farm Bureau the state Department of Labor and Cornell University established a mediation program operating out of Cornell University See March Comments at 65 66 comment of James F Schmidt Farmworker Legal Services of New York In its three years of operation not one agricultural employer agreed to use the

April Testimony at 57 testimony of Jack Londen Attorney at Law The USDOL reports that despite high violation rates in agriculture farmworkers generally do not file complaints with USDOL due to their isolation lack of knowledge regarding labor protections and fear of government agencies See April Comments at 10 comment of D Michael Hancock USDOL Wage and Hour Division investigations of H 2A cases during FY 1996 1997 and 1998 found an employer violation rate of fifty seven percent though only nineteen percent of the cases investigated were the result of a complaint from an H 2A worker See id Moreover government agencies have competing priorities and limited resources See id By law the USDOL has only seven days to review an application for H 2A certification to determine its compliance with the statutory requirements See March Testimony at 109 testimony of Javier Riojas Texas Rural Legal Aid The USDOL relies on private enforcement to play a major role in the overall enforcement scheme See March Comments at 160 comment of Michael Wyatt Texas Rural Legal Aid et al The USDOL reports that t here is no certainty that the Wage and Hour Division will be able to represent all aggrieved H 2A workers if they are no longer able to bring private actions on their own behalf April Comments at 10 11 comment of D Michael Hancock USDOL This is not surprising The USDOL lacks adequate resources to enforce its regulations April Testimony at 57 testimony of Jack Londen Attorney at Law and has a long history of weak enforcement of the H 2A program See March Comments at 160 comment of Michael Wyatt Texas Rural Legal Aid et al In 1991 a congressional committee found that USDOL failed to enforce the rights of both H 2A and United States workers The USDOL had documented repeated and long standing violations of the H 2A statute and regulations but failed to take action either to correct the violations or to ensure that full restitution was made to the workers See 1991 HOUSE REPORT cited in April Comments at 104 comment of Garry G Geffert West Virginia Legal Services Plan The GAO reports that USDOL continues to face inherent obstacles in enforcing the H 2A protections GAO REPORT at 58 see also March Comments at 160 comment of Michael Wyatt Texas Rural Legal Aid et al Enforcement by state agencies may be less effective Over a nine year period the California Industrial Relations Department issued only 120 citations for minimum wage violations to the state s 80 000 agricultural employers and their farm labor contractors By contrast in a targeted enforcement of the Fresno County raisin harvest in September 1998 USDOL found a fifty percent violation rate among farm labor contractors and a twenty percent violation rate among growers See April Testimony at 147 49 testimony of Mark Schacht California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation The Oregon state agency responsible for housing enforcement inspects labor camps once every seventeen years See March Comments 143 comment of D Michael Dale Oregon Law Center and Janice Morgan Legal Aid Services of Oregon Government agencies may also lack the legal authority to seek private remedies for individual workers For example USDOL cannot seek private remedies for violations of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act See id at 143 44 Even when the government agency has the legal authority to seek private remedies for individuals as in the case of unpaid wages the agency may choose not to pursue those remedies and only seek civil money penalties against the employer See March Comments at 111 comment of Robert Salzman Legal Aid Society of Mid New York Charlotte Sibley and Patricia C Kakalec Farmworker Law Project G Burdens of Requiring LSC Funded Attorneys to Withdraw from Cases When the Client Leaves the United States 1 Administrative Burdens Several witnesses testified about terminating representation once the alien left the country An interpretation that legal services recipients can represent aliens only during the times that they are physically present in the United States would present LSC providers with two options Either they would be required to terminate representation each time the client leaves the country April Testimony at 12 testimony of Cynthia Rice California Rural Legal Assistance or clients at the outset of representation would be

L Rice California Rural Legal Assistance In federal court a formal motion to withdraw would have to be filed See id Similar motions would have to be filed in state court actions See id In all cases significant steps would have to be taken to avoid prejudicing the client s claims See id Case files would have to be copied and provided to the client See id Case files may need to be translated for those clients who read a language other than English See id For clients who are illiterate in any language materials would have to be carefully explained to them See id A motion to withdraw may be denied by the court and the attorney required to personally support the costs of the litigation See April Testimony at 83 testimony of Victor Lara Attorney at Law Courts may be unlikely to allow withdrawal where no substitute counsel is available See March Comments at 22 comment of Robert J Willis Attorney at Law Some state courts could reject a motion to withdraw sua sponte if they believed withdrawal would compromise the court s ability to maintain the litigation See April Testimony at 21 testimony of Cynthia Rice California Rural Legal Assistance Even if withdrawal were allowed this may not protect the attorney from ethical obligations to vigorously represent the client or from claims of malpractice See April Testimony at 82 testimony of Victor Lara Attorney at Law Temporarily suspending legal representation during a client s absence by seeking a continuance is not a viable alternative to formally withdrawing from the case The court may not grant a continuance and other plaintiffs and defendants in the litigation may object to suspending the proceedings See April Testimony at 82 testimony of Victor Lara Attorney at Law Absent a formal motion to withdraw an attorney of record in federal court remains responsible both ethically and under the rules of court for responding to any matter that should arise See April Testimony at 30 testimony of Cynthia Rice California Rural Legal Assistance April Testimony at 82 testimony of Victor Lara Attorney at Law If opposing counsel filed a motion for summary judgment while a client was out of the country and the court refused to grant a continuance the attorney would be placed in the impossible position of either taking the steps necessary to respond to the motion or violating her ethical and professional responsibility See April Testimony at 30 testimony of Cynthia Rice California Rural Legal Assistance As one witness put it it s hard to know what we could do if we found out that a client was outside the country Would we not answer a phone call not respond to a question cancel a deposition or not go to the library and research a case None of those things would advance any interest at all April Testimony at 90 testimony of Bruce Iwasaki Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles Requiring attorneys to monitor the movements of eligible aliens at all times of the year would impose monumental burdens on LSC grantees See April Testimony at 24 25 testimony of Cynthia Rice California Rural Legal Assistance April Testimony at 90 testimony of Bruce Iwasaki Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles Alien farmworkers move frequently within the United States It would be extremely difficult for a legal services attorney in California to know whether a client who has been working in the migrant stream in Arizona has temporarily crossed the border into Mexico See April Testimony at 24 25 testimony of Cynthia Rice California Rural Legal Assistance Requiring the client to contact the attorney periodically is not technically feasible for many of farmworker clients See id at 25 In border communities where aliens travel back and forth across the border on a daily basis legal services offices would have to require their clients who may be illiterate to keep a daily log to account for their movements See April Testimony at 109 testimony of Lynn Coyle Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law The confusion created by a such a requirement would be significant When the client returned to the United States the administrative burdens to resume representation would once again have to be undertaken This start and stop representation would be confusing to the client and would significantly undermine the effectiveness of representation See March Comments at 209 comment of Jose Padilla

Jose Padilla and Cynthia L Rice California Rural Legal Assistance April Testimony at 19 20 testimony of Cynthia Rice California Rural Legal Assistance The rule would also invite abuse Opposing counsel

representation that may be provided by LSC recipients to aliens provides that None of the funds appropriated in this Act to the Legal Services Corporation may be used to provide financial assistance to a recipient 11 that provides legal assistance for or on behalf of any alien unless the alien is present in the United States and is A an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence as defined in section 101 a 20 of the Immigration and Nationality Act 8 U S C 1101 a 20 B an alien who i is married to a United States citizen or is a parent or an unmarried child under the age of 21 years of such a citizen and ii has filed an application to adjust the status of the alien to the status of a lawful permanent resident under the Immigration and Nationality Act 8 U S C 1101 et seq which application has not been rejected C an alien who is lawfully present in the United States pursuant to an admission under section 207 of the Immigration and Nationality Act 8 U S C 1157 relating to refugee admission or who has been granted asylum by the Attorney General under such Act D an alien who is lawfully present in the United States as a result of withholding of deportation by the Attorney General pursuant to section 243 h of the Immigration and Nationality Act 8 U S C 1253 h E an alien to whom section 305 of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 8 U S C 1101 note applies but only to the extent that the legal assistance provided is the legal assistance described in such section or F an alien who is lawfully present in the United States as a result of being granted conditional entry to the United States before April 1 1980 pursuant to section 203 a 7 of the Immigration and Nationality Act 8 U S C 1153 a 7 as in effect on March 31 1980 because of

54 emphasis added A statutory term is to be interpreted based on its plain and ordinary meaning in light of its context and the purpose and design of the statute as a whole I t is a fundamental principle of statutory construction that the meaning of a word cannot be determined in isolation but must be drawn from the context in which it is used Textron Lycoming Reciprocating Engine Div Avco Corp v United Automobile Aerospace Agricultural Implement Workers of America Int l Union 523 U S 653 118 S Ct 1626 1629 1998 citation omitted The plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined by reference to the language itself the specific context in which that language is used and the broader context of the statute as a whole Robinson v Shell Oil Co 519 U S 337 341 1997 see also Bailey v United States 516 U S 137 145 1995 We consider not only the bare meaning of the word but also its placement and purpose in the statutory scheme Moreover it is a well established rule that Congress is presumed not to have intended absurd results See United States v X Citement Video Inc 513 U S 64 69 1994 citing Public Citizen v United States Department of Justice 491 U S 440 453 55 1989 cf Green v Bock Laundry Mach Co 490 U S 504 527 30 1989 Scalia J concurring We are confronted here with a statute which if interpreted literally produces an absurd and perhaps unconstitutional result Our task is to give some alternative meaning to the language that avoids this consequence Analyzed in light of these canons of interpretation the Corporation s appropriations act requires that an alien must be present in the United States in order to be eligible for legal assistance 12 Construing the term present according to its ordinary meaning it is clear that the statute requires the alien to be 13 physically present in the United States at some point This conclusion does not end the inquiry however because the question before the Commission is not whether an alien must be physically present in the United States but when the alien must be present in order to be entitled to LSC representation Here the language provides no express statement on when an alien must be present in the United States and other familiar terms of immigration law such as continuous physical presence are not used The factual record and the statutory scheme in which the language arises on the other hand provide an important context for consideration of the legal question of when an alien must be present in 12 The statutory provision is implemented in the corporation s alien eligibility rule 45 C F R pt 1626 1999 13 The term United States is defined in the INA and Part 1626 as the continental United States Alaska Hawaii Puerto Rico Guam and the Virgin Islands of the United States See id 1626 2 h 8 U S C 1101 a 38 the United States As the Corporation has noted the statutory language may be read alternately to require that 1 an alien must be physically present in the United States when the cause of action for which the recipient provides legal assistance arises 2 an alien must be physically present only when legal representation is commenced or 3 an alien must be physically present in the United States any time the alien is provided legal assistance from an LSC grantee 14 No single interpretation however is clearly compelled by the statutory language For example nothing in the LSC authorization language keys representation to when the cause of action arises or specifically requires that the alien be present when the representation commences In particular the statute does not expressly require that an alien be continuously physically present in the United States throughout the period of representation in order to be eligible for legal assistance Consideration of the immediate context in which the language appears raises further questions regarding the meaning of the presence requirement The statute s application of the presence requirement to legal permanent residents for example is in some tension with the fact that those aliens are legally entitled to leave the United States temporarily without affecting their immigration status See discussion supra Part II C 1 Furthermore H 2A workers by definition are physically present in the United States only temporarily Reading presence in the statute to require uninterrupted continuous physical presence would mean that Congress without using such language intended to deny LSC representation to aliens who engaged in federally authorized travel that did not affect their immigration status In the case of H 2A workers the reading would require the conclusion that Congress intended to provide H 2A workers with legal services representation on claims arising from their employment contracts only for the very brief periods that the workers are in the United States potentially rendering the promise of legal representation largely meaningless These difficulties support further inquiry into the meaning of the presence requirement In short an examination of the language of the presence requirement and the statutory context in which it arises raises a number of interpretive problems and fails to resolve the question of when an alien must be present in the United States in order to be entitled to legal services representation The Commission concludes that the statutory language is ambiguous on this point B Legislative History 1 Origins of the Presence Requirement The legislative history provides assistance in analyzing the presence requirement The LSC Act of 1974 as amended was adopted to provide equal access to the system of justice in our Nation for individuals who seek redress of grievances to provide high quality legal assistance to those who would otherwise be unable to afford adequate legal counsel and to provid e legal assistance to those who face an economic barrier to adequate legal counsel 42 U S C 2996 1994 The LSC Act itself 14 64 Fed Reg 8140 8141 1999 includes no restrictions on the provision of legal assistance by LSC recipients to aliens However in the early 1980s Congress began restricting legal assistance to aliens by LSC recipients pursuant to provisos in the Corporation s appropriations acts Originally these provisos permitted the use of LSC funds for legal assistance to an alien if the alien was a resident of the United States and fell within one of the permissible alien categories all of which required that an alien was in lawful status 15 See e g Fiscal Year Appropriations 1982 Pub L No 97 51 95 Stat 958 1981 Fiscal Year Appropriations 1983 Pub L No 97 377 96 Stat 1830 1982 and a long series of continuing resolutions which included the residency requirement Residence is a term of art within the meaning of immigration law and is not synonymous with physical presence In re Olan 257 F Supp 884 S D Cal 1966 16 Resident aliens are allowed to enter and leave the United States temporarily without relinquishing their status See discussion infra Part II C 1 Thus prior to FY 1984 LSC recipients were authorized to represent aliens who were legal residents of the United States regardless of whether the alien was absent from the United States during some part of the representation In drafting the Corporation s Fiscal Year FY 1984 appropriations act Congress for the first time replaced the language resident of the United States with present in the United States Departments of Commerce Justice and State the Judiciary and Related Appropriations Act 1984 Pub L 98 166 97 Stat 1071 1983 The legislative history reveals no explanation for this change The phrase present in the United States appears to have originated in proposed legislation that would have expanded the categories of aliens eligible for LSC funded representation 17 The shift in language may have been based 15 From before the 1983 amendment until 1986 the categories of eligible aliens included 1 an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence 2 an alien who was either married to a United States citizen or was a parent or an unmarried child under the age of twenty one years of such a citizen and who had filed an application for adjustment of status under the INA 3 an alien who was lawfully present in the United States as a refugee or who had been granted asylum by the Attorney General 4 an alien who was lawfully present in the United States as a result of the Attorney General s withholding of deportation and 5 an alien lawfully present in the United States as a result of being granted conditional entry See e g Public Laws 98 107 1983 98 166 1983 98 411 1984 99 103 1985 16The term residence is defined in the INA as the place of general abode the place ofgeneral abode of a person means his principal actual dwelling place in fact without regard to intent 8 U S C 1101 a 33 1994 17 The expanded list of eligible aliens included 1 spouses parents and unmarried citizens sic children of permanent residents 2 Cuban and Haitian entrants as defined in paragraph 1 or 2 of 501 e of Public Law 96 422 as in effect on April 1 1983 3 persons paroled into theUnited States and 4 aliens eligible for derivative U S citizenship under 212 d 5 of the Immigration and Nationality Act H R REP NO 98 206 at 49 1983 Spouses and parents of permanent residents could only be in the United States if at all in temporary nonimmigrant classification and therefore would not be residents of the United States 46on the recognition that aliens in some of the proposed categories would not possess residence in the United States under the meaning of the INA for example parolees and Cuban Haitian entrants As noted above the requirement of presence is frequently used in immigration laws to describe categories of aliens within the United States who may not have established residence The proposed legislation was defeated but the phrase present in the United States replaced the residence language found in earlier statutes The new language received virtually no discussion nothing in the legislative history suggests that Congress intended to adopt new or more stringent restrictions on alien representation Statements in the Senate suggest that Congress may not have been aware that the presence language survived the defeat of the amendment 18 In short the FY 1984 change appears to have been the result of the proposal to expand LSC representation to aliens who were merely present as opposed to lawful residents There is no evidence that Congress intended to deprive permanent resident aliens of continuous representation upon their leaving the country Following the statutory change LSC issued no new regulations interpreting the language Congress called for no new interpretation and LSC grantee practice did not change 2 H 2A Representation In 1986 Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 which expressly authorized LSC recipients to provide legal assistance to H 2A workers and Special

appropriations bills by specifically creating in IRCA the legal fiction that H 2A workers would be deemed lawful permanent resident aliens for the purposes of legal services representation under the existing categories of eligible aliens IRCA 305 8 U S C 1101 note April Comments at 55 comment of Howard L Berman Member of Congress April Testimony at 131 testimony of Romano L Mazzoli Louis D Brandeis School of Law University of Louisville April Testimony at 128 testimony of Mark Schacht California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation Because SAWS and H 2A workers were deemed to be permanent resident aliens they became subject to the presence requirement in the Corporation s appropriations act See March Comments at 33 comment of Bill Beardall Texas Rural Legal Aid Legal assistance to H 2A workers was expressly limited to matters relating to wages housing transportation and other employment rights as provided in the worker s specific contract IRCA 305 8 U S C 1101 note 1994 The legislative history establishes that legal representation for H 2A workers was a crucial part of the legislative compromise that established the H 2A program The creation of the H 2A program was controversial given the history of prior temporary agricultural programs such as the Bracero program Congress was aware of the problems that had arisen under such programs and of the special vulnerability of temporary foreign workers 19 During floor debate considerable concern was expressed about the 18 See 129 CONG REC S28937 Oct 21 1983 Statement of Sen Grassley 129 CONG REC S29836 Oct 21 1983 Statement of Sen Rudman 19The Conference Report on IRCA noted in discussing the SAW program that the Committeewas ever mindful of the reports of abuses that occurred during the old Bracero program See H R vulnerability and exploitation of such workers and the need for legal representation to give meaning to their legal rights Congressman Berman explained on the House floor Part and parcel of that agreement was an understanding that the H 2 workers would be entitled if they otherwise qualified and only if they otherwise qualified to legal services representation because without that the protections contained for those workers the housing protections the domestic the transportation protections the piecework rate and adverse impact wage rates protections become utterly meaningless The fact is the history of the abuses in that H 2 program which has been documented time and time again cannot be corrected without effective representation as you could easily contemplate guest workers coming here for a short period of time hoping to come back again anxious to pick up a wage considerably higher than the wage they might be making in their own country have no individual ability and no effective collective ability to enforce the protections that the U S law is supposed to guarantee them 132 CONG REC H9866 68 Oct 10 1986 statement of Rep Berman see also March Comments

Report quoted the following testimony from the Western Growers Association The Bracero program has been likened by some to indentured slavery where employer exploitation was rampant and inhumane Some of the abuses that took place underthe Bracero program can be directly attributed to the way the program was administered The most glaring problem was the contractual relationship that existed requiring an employee to work for one employer This some argue gave employers the ability to require more from Bracero workers based on a threat or promise they would be sent back to Mexico Id at 83

the laws that are supposed to protect these folk because if you do not have legal services the laws are unenforceable and useless 132 CONG REC H9867 Oct 10 1986 statement of Rep Schumer Representative Morrison also stressed the importance of giving H 2A aliens a realistic way to enforce their rights 132 CONG REC H9868 Oct 10 1986 statement of Rep Morrison The legislative history of IRCA makes clear that Congress intended for LSC recipients to provide meaningful legal representation to H 2A workers on matters arising under the employment contract The conference report to IRCA explained the provision of legal services to H 2A aliens as follows Legal services are to be made available to H 2 aliens with regard to housing wages transportation and other conditions of employment under their H 2 contract It is the intent of the Conferees that contractsentered into shall not violate any provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act authorizing the H 2 program or any regulations issued pursuant to that Act Further the Conferees intend that the Conference substitute will secure the rights of H 2 agricultural workers under the specific contract under which they were admitted to this country See H CONF REP NO 91 1000 at 3 1986 see also March Comments at 34 comment of Bill Beardall Texas Rural Legal Aid The legislative history contains no evidence that Congress believed it was limiting legal representation of H 2A workers to the period when such workers were physically present in the United States Neither the proponents nor the opponents of legal services representation argued that such a time limit applied All the comments made regarding limitations on LSC representation for H 2A workers focused on the restriction of the subject matter of such representation to claims arising from the worker s employment contract 20 In adopting the H 2A provision in IRCA Congress was aware that H 2A workers were allowed 20Representative Simpson for example stressed that t he legal services that will be availableto H 2 workers and they are foreign nationals are limited only to housing and transportation and wages and anything within the terms of the contract nothing more The legal services are strictlylimited to that 132 CONG REC S16900 Oct 17 1986 statement of Rep Simpson see also 132 Cong Rec H10588 daily ed Oct 15 1986 statement of Rep McCollum 132 CONG REC H10587

Bill Beardall Texas Rural Legal Aid April Comments at 55 comment of Howard L Berman Member of Congress 49to remain in the United States only temporarily Congress must also be presumed to have authorized the representation with knowledge of the presence requirement in the Corporation s appropriations act South Dakota v Yankton Sioux Tribe 522 U S 329 118 S Ct 789 801 1998 United States v Hanousek 176 F 3d 1116 1121 9th Cir 1999 It is unlikely that Congress would have added H 2A workers to the categories of eligible aliens without reviewing the restrictions on representation including the presence requirement that had been included annually in the Corporation s appropriations act Indeed Congress crafted the provision in IRCA permitting H 2A representation to be consistent with the language in the LSC appropriations act Thus IRCA deemed H 2As to be permanent resident aliens a category eligible for LSC legal assistance for the purposes of receiving legal assistance from the Corporation 21 According to the comment from Representative Berman provided to the Commission Congress was aware of the presence requirement and intended that the requirement be consistent with the provision of meaningful representation to the H 2A workers under IRCA Those of us who actively participated in drafting section 305 granting LSC the ability to represent H 2A workers and H 2A eligibility for such services were very much aware of the alien representation restrictions in the annual LSC appropriations bills Congress did not view the present in the United States language in the appropriations bill as limiting the representation of H 2A workers to the time period during which they remained in the United States The H 2A workers presence in the United States under the temporary worker visa entitled them to LSC eligibility April Comments at 55 56 comment of Howard L Berman Member of Congress H 2A workers were to be treated as permanent legal residents for the limited purpose of legal services representation for claims on their contracts This legislative history suggests that Congress with full knowledge that H 2A workers were only in the United States on a temporary basis intended that their rights under their H 2A contracts be protected by being given access to meaningful legal services Nothing in the congressional debate discussing the 21 Section 305 of IRCA provided that A nonimmigrant worker admitted to or permitted to remain in the United States under section 101 a 15 H 2 a of the Immigration and Nationality Act for agricultural labor or service shall be considered to be an alien described in section 101 a 2 of such Act a permanent resident alien for purposes of establishing eligibility for legal assistance under the Legal Services Corporation Act 42 U S C 2996 et seq But only with respect to legal matters relating to wages housing transportation and other employment rights as provided in the worker s specific contract under which the nonimmigrant was admitted limitation of legal services to rights under the H 2A contract ever suggested that representation could last only as long as the H 2A worker remained in the United States Therefore we should choose the interpretation of presence that effectuates the Congressional purpose to provide meaningful representation to H 2A workers under their contracts 3 1996 Continuing Resolution In the 1996 Omnibus Continuing Resolution Congress revised the restrictions on alien assistance by applying the restrictions to all funds received by LSC entities Pub L No 104 134 110 Stat 1321 Congress also for the first time explicitly added H 2A workers to the categories of aliens eligible for legal assistance under the LSC appropriations act although that assistance remained limited to claims under the workers employment contract The other categories of aliens and the presence requirement were retained Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act 1999 Pub L No 105 277 112 Stat 2681 incorporating by reference Omnibus Consolidated Recissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 504 a 11 Pub L No 104 134 110 Stat 1321 Nothing about the application of the is present language to the alien categories was altered The legislative history of the 1996 revision contains no discussion of the present in the United States requirement and no indication that Congress sought to alter existing practice regarding the representation of aliens See March Comments at 251 comment of Alan Houseman Center for Law Social Policy The McCollum Stenholm bill on which the 1996 appropriations were based did not address the presence requirement and the statement accompanying the introduction of that bill noted only that the bill incorporated the provisions from IRCA into the existing appropriation s provisions on representation of certain aliens See id Thus the 1996 revision simply brought together in one place the pre existing provisions regarding representation of aliens and applied these restrictions to all funds of an LSC recipient Neither the language nor the legislative history of the statute suggest that Congress intended to alter the application of the presence requirement In sum the legislative history of the presence requirement confirms that Congress intended to provide meaningful representation to eligible aliens including H 2A workers on claims arising from their employment contract and that Congress did not understand the presence requirement to severely alter or restrict this representation The Legal Services Act was adopted to provide effective legal representation to low income persons See April Testimony at 9 testimony of Cynthia Rice California Rural Legal Assistance Program The presence language appeared in the LSC appropriations act as part of an effort to expand LSC representation to aliens other than lawful residents and does not appear to have been intended to limit LSC representation to aliens who were continuously physically present in the United States Similarly the express purpose of section 305 of IRCA was to secure the rights of H 2 agricultural workers under the specific contract under which they were admitted to this country See H CONF REP NO 91 1000 1986 Such representation was intended to prevent the exploitation of foreign H 2A workers and to ensure that the wages and working conditions of U S workers would not be undermined Finally nothing in the 1996 legislation altered the effect of the presence requirement on H 2A s or any other alien category C Implications of the Presence Requirement The factual record provides an important context for consideration of the legal question of the meaning of the presence requirement for representation by LSC grantees As noted above three possible interpretations of the presence language were listed in the Corporation s Federal Register notice 1 an alien must be physically present in the United States when the cause of action for which the recipient provides legal assistance arises 2 an alien must be physically present only when legal representation is commenced and 3 an alien must be physically present in the United States any time the alien is provided legal assistance from an LSC grantee 22 Upon careful consideration of the language and purposes of the statute and the legislative history the Commission has determined that none of these formulations fully responds to the purposes of the statute or the intent of Congress Furthermore the record demonstrates that the interpretations initially offered by the Corporation in the Federal Register notice would contradict Congress clear purpose of providing meaningful legal representation to indigent lawful aliens and lead to absurd results 1 Unrestricted Categories In giving content to the presence requirement it is important to distinguish between the unrestricted categories of aliens and H 2A workers The record before the Commission establishes that permanent residents and other aliens frequently leave the United States to visit spouses and children to address family problems and to survive during long periods of unemployment in the United States The category of permanent residents includes commuter aliens who work in the United States but whose actual residence is across the border in Mexico All of these aliens are legally authorized to leave and re enter the United States As applied to the situation of unrestricted aliens the three interpretations of the presence requirement suggested in the Federal Register notice would lead to unintended and absurd results Under an interpretation that the alien must be physically present when the cause of action commenced or legal representation began an alien who was evicted from her apartment or against whom divorce proceedings were commenced while she was temporarily out of the United States to attend a funeral or attend to a family emergency would be barred from LSC representation LSC attorneys representing commuter aliens who migrate daily would be placed in the predicament of representing such aliens only in claims that happened to arise during the portion of the day when the alien was in the United States Under an interpretation that the alien must be physically present when the representation commenced an alien who was temporarily outside the United States would be barred from obtaining legal services representation on 22 64 Fed Reg 8140 8141 1999 any matter during her absence These interpretations would also invite exploitation by allowing litigants to simply wait until an alien temporarily departed the United States before cutting off workers compensation benefits initiating eviction repossession divorce or child custody proceedings or otherwise triggering the cause of action or a need for representation U S agricultural recruiters in Mexico could willfully misrepresent working conditions to permanent legal residents across the border knowing the alien would be barred from legal assistance on her federally protected MSWPA claim Requiring a permanent legal resident alien to be physically present in the United States throughout the course of LSC legal representation would also be unworkable and lead to absurd results The record is undisputed that many of the kinds of lawsuits involving permanent resident aliens and other unrestricted aliens take months if not years to reach a conclusion and that permanent residents and other eligible aliens regularly travel outside the United States An interpretation that required the alien to be continuously present throughout the course of the litigation would confront indigent aliens with the Hobson s choice of either accepting representation or visiting their families abroad Moreover requiring legal services attorneys to monitor their clients movements and formally withdraw whenever the client left the country would creating extraordinary burdens for the LSC grantees the clients opposing parties and the courts An attorney whose client had to travel to Mexico to attend her father s funeral for example would have to withdraw from the case during the client s absence See April Testimony at 139 140 testimony of Sylvia Argueta Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund LSC attorneys representing alien clients living in border communities would face the prospect that they could work on a client s case in the morning when the client was in El Paso but not in the afternoon when the client was shopping in Juarez See April Testimony at 109 testimony of Lynn Coyle Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law Application of this interpretation to the U S Mexico border would disrupt access of permanent legal residents to the legal system in the poorest region of the United States See March Comments at 155 comment of Michael Wyatt Texas Rural Legal Aid et al It also would provide perverse incentives to opposing litigants to drag out legal proceedings with the expectation that an alien might have to temporarily depart from the country or engage in other forms of procedural abuse See March Comments at 74 comment of Keith S Ernst Attorney at Law March Comments at 201 comment of Jose Padilla and Cynthia L Rice California Rural Legal Assistance April Testimony at 21 testimony of Cynthia Rice California Rural Legal Assistance The private bar and other nonprofit legal services providers are neither available willing or able to take over the representation of these populations As one witness with extensive experience organizing private pro bono activities put it the likelihood that private lawyers will take on clients who would be excluded from LSC representation by the stringent interpretation of the presence requirement is zero April Testimony at 41 testimony of Jack Londen Attorney at Law The legislative history contains no evidence that Congress intended LSC representation of legal permanent residents and other aliens to turn on the accident of where an alien happened to be at the moment the cause of action arose or the litigation commenced or to require the alien to be continuously physically present throughout the course of representation The Commission does not believe that Congress intended to force resident aliens to choose between temporary trips outside the United States and continued representation in pending litigation The Commission has not been able to discern any congressional purpose that would be served by tying the right to representation on movements that have no effect on either the alien s lawful immigration status or her legal right to pursue her claim in U S courts The Commission is unwilling to recommend an interpretation of the statute that produces such consequences absent an express congressional intent that such burdens be imposed 2 H 2A Aliens The factual record before the Commission demonstrates that Congress purpose of providing meaningful representation to H 2A workers for claims arising under their employment contracts cannot be accomplished under the original interpretations offered in the Federal Register notice Many of the contract rights that were mandated by Congress in IRCA such as reimbursement for return transportation workers compensation the 3 4 guarantee and claims that a grower failed to mail the worker s final paycheck often do not arise until after the worker has returned home A requirement that the H 2A worker be physically present in the United States when the cause of action arises or the representation commences thus would deprive H 2A workers of representation on many of the most basic employment contract protections afforded by Congress directly contrary to Congress purpose As a practical matter this interpretation would also bar most other legal representation for H 2A workers since the record clearly demonstrates that due to their fear of losing their jobs their isolation lack of resources and language skills and vulnerability H 2A workers often are both unwilling and unable to contact a legal services office until after they have left their employment H 2A aliens are required by law to leave the country within ten days of the termination of their employment and generally remain in the control of the employer during this period The interpretations could also create incentives for abuse An interpretation that the representation must commence while the alien is still in the United States would encourage employers to create even greater obstacles to access to legal services while the workers are physically in the United States Employers who successfully excluded legal services representatives from their labor camps or intimidated workers into not contacting legal services during the course of employment could ensure a workforce without access to legal representation Under an interpretation that the claim must arise while the worker was in the United States unscrupulous employers would be able to exploit the system by for example failing to mail a final paycheck or 3 4 guarantee payment after the H 2A worker left the country with knowledge that the worker would not be entitled to legal representation on the claim Alternatively an interpretation of the presence requirement that required H 2A workers to be present in the United States throughout the course of the representation would eviscerate their right to legal representation altogether H 2A workers by definition are required to leave the United States within a year and the record establishes that most H 2A workers are physically present in the United States for only two to five months The record establishes that with the exception of the most minor and undisputed claims none of the employment claims for which Congress authorized representation can be completed during the brief period that the H 2A worker is in the country even if the claim arose early during the worker s stay and the worker was immediately able to contact legal services Many of the claims of H 2A workers are legally complex and all take months if not years to litigate to completion The contradiction between this interpretation and Congress purpose of providing meaningful representation for H 2A workers is patent The interpretation assumes that Congress took from H 2A workers with one hand what it gave with the other The law will not impute such a purpose to Congress The factual record moreover demonstrates the absurdity of this approach As the record shows it is not uncommon for H 2A workers to contact legal services for the first time as they board the bus on the way home and an interpretation that LSC representation is available only while the alien is physically present creates the prospect that Congress authorized legal services attorneys to represent such H 2A workers only during the bus ride to the border The rule again would invite exploitation Employers could veto a worker s decision to seek legal representation by terminating the worker and immediately deporting her See March Comments at 128 comment of Shelley Latin Virginia Farmworkers Legal Assistance Project March Comments at 231 comment of Melissa A Pershing Legal Services of North Carolina March Comments at 272 comment of Lisa Butler Florida Rural Legal Services Employers wishing to avoid paying workers compensation could deny coverage until the worker was no longer in the country or discontinue payments after the worker had returned home Opposing litigants and H 2A employers could prolong the legal process simply by refusing to return legal service attorneys phone calls or delaying provision of records to which the worker was entitled to ensure that the H 2A worker left the United States before a dispute could be resolved See March Comments at 231 comment of Melissa A Pershing Legal Services of North Carolina March Testimony at 34 testimony of Garry G Geffert West Virginia Legal Services Plan In all of these cases legal services would be barred from assisting the worker in these valid employment contract claims In short the record is clear that H 2A workers are unlikely to raise legal claims before the end of their employment contract that they are required to leave the United States at the end of their contracts that many of their claims arise after their departure and that legal proceedings cannot be completed before they depart Furthermore the availability of legal services for H 2A workers from non LSC funded nonprofit organizations and private attorneys is extremely limited and government agencies either lack the resources or the legal authority to enforce the statutory rights of these workers The Commission recognizes that representation of agricultural workers was a central element in the legislative crafting of the H 2A program We conclude that a reading of the statute that would bar representation of an H 2A worker based on the fact that he or she has left the United States would leave H 2A workers without meaningful representation on their employment contract claims directly contrary to Congress express purpose and we decline to sanction such a result IV CONCLUSION THE MEANING OF THE PRESENCE REQUIREMENT Together the language purpose and legislative history of the applicable statutes and the factual record before the Commission suggest an interpretation of the statute that would authorize the following representation For an alien in one of the unrestricted categories representation would be authorized so long as the eligible alien is present sufficient to maintain residence or lawful immigration status Under this interpretation LSC grantees who have begun representation of a permanent resident alien may continue that representation should the alien be temporarily outside the United States Grantees may also initiate representation of aliens in the unrestricted categories who are temporarily outside the United States provided that they have been present sufficient to maintain and have not abandoned their residence or INA status LSC grantees may not represent aliens in this category who have never entered or been present in the United States For H 2A workers representation is authorized if the workers have been admitted to and have been present in the United States pursuant to an H 2A contract and the representation arises under their H 2A contract LSC grantees are authorized to litigate this narrow range of claims to completion despite the fact that the alien may be required to depart the United States prior to or during the course of the representation LSC grantees may not represent aliens in this category who have never entered or been present in the United States As discussed above this interpretation comports with the language of the presence requirement in light of Congress object and purpose The language and legislative history of the LSC appropriations acts and the H 2A statute make clear that Congress intended to provide meaningful legal representation to aliens in the designated categories and there is no evidence that Congress considered the presence requirement to severely restrict this interpretation To the contrary the presence requirement was inserted into the statute for the apparent purpose of expanding LSC representation of legal aliens Moreover as interpreted by the Commission the presence requirement sustains Congress clear goal since the early 1980s of restricting LSC representation to aliens with lawful status The Commission s interpretation also comports with the consistent practice of LSC grantees and the understanding of growers and of Congress As noted above LSC grantees have regularly provided legal assistance to eligible aliens who have left the United States at some point during the representation LSC has never taken action against a recipient which continued to represent alien clients after the client had left the United States Until recently critics of legal services recipients who had knowledge of the alien representation practices of legal services recipients never questioned the legality of a recipient s representation of an alien after the alien had left the United States It is well settled that a history of practice under a statute can aid in its interpretation particularly when Congress has amended the statute without disapproving of the administrative practice N L R B v Hendricks County Rural Elec Membership Corp 454 U S 170 177 1981 In this case the practices of LSC recipients of growers and of Congress all support the Commission s interpretation Finally the Commission s interpretation of the presence requirement is fully consistent with the overarching purpose of the relevant congressional statutes The Legal Services Act was adopted to provide full and effective legal representation to low income persons In enacting the LSC Act Congress declared the need to provide equal access to the nation s system of justice for individuals who seek redress of grievances and said attorneys providing legal assistance must have full freedom to protect the best interests of their clients in keeping with the Code of Professional Responsibility the Canon of Ethics and the high standards of the legal profession The protections of the H 2A statute were adopted inter alia to ensure that the employment of foreign workers would not undermine the wages and working conditions of U S workers and Congress provided legal services representation to secure the rights of H 2 agricultural workers under their employment contracts The record before the Commission is undisputed that LSC entities cannot provide full and meaningful representation to H 2A workers and to many other eligible aliens under the alternative constructions of the presence requirement See March Comments at 132 comment of Shelley Latin Virginia Farmworkers Legal Assistance Project March Comments at 143 comment of D Michael Dale Oregon Law Center and Janice Morgan Legal

Services Instead such interpretations would simply promote the exploitation of vulnerable low income aliens The Commission s interpretation is the only interpretation which comports with the language and legislative history of the presence requirement and which permits full and meaningful representation to aliens eligible for legal assistance consistent with Congress purpose APPENDIX ERLENBORN
