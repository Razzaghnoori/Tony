 Drawing upon her rich experience of life Prudence Prudie to her friends responds to questions about manners personal relations politics and other subjects Please send your questions for publication to Prudence slate com Queries should not exceed 200 words in length Please indicate how you wish your letter to be signed preferably including your location Dear Prudie Just what does a gentleman do when suspected of having been unfaithful to his wife Is the answer to lie lie lie in order to keep peace in the family shelter the self esteem of his wife and protect the reputation of the lady in question Or is it as the Bible and some of our laws say Do not bear false witness I think I know how Prudence would reply I m interested in learning how the next generation looks at a question like this Dick Taylor Dear Dick You do not say suspected by whom If the transgressor is called on the carpet by his wife the Bible s admonition is the one to follow While Prudie admires concern for the spouse s self esteem peace in the family and the reputation of the illicit partner she must point out that all are jeopardized by the gentleman s actions Your use of the phrase having been unfaithful suggests the affair may be over If this is the case the gentleman might take his wife for a drive and ask Will you forgive me or should I drive right to a jewelry store Prudie generationally Dear Prudence It would be fair to say that like Alyssa the central character in Chasing Amy I have until now led an experimental life I am 25 and have one criminal conviction for hacking a bad credit history and some failed personal and professional relationships Recently however I have settled down and become decidedly less experimental My problem is this I am extremely bright and possess an advanced degree in philosophy Now I wish to go to medical school law school or apply for a government job What do I say at the interview about my previous experimental life In Chasing Amy Alyssa says when confronted with her past sexual behavior We are not born with maps inside us but somehow I think an interviewer will want a more comprehensive answer Can you suggest a metaphor for rationalizing my past I need to be my own spin doctor N F in New Zealand Dear N Whatever you do don t use dialogue from Chasing Amy at any interviews As for your sexual experimentation Prudie feels certain that the subject will not come up You might however have a problem with the conviction and the credit history I wish I could come through for you in the metaphor department but I am feeling metaphorically challenged today Just try to act reformed Prudie spinningly Dear Prudence I live in Pennsylvania and during the warmer months I have a habit of not wearing shoes I feel more lively and energetic when I m barefoot The good points outweigh the bad such as dirty soles and that s why I do it Checking on the Internet I have found there to be no health laws in any state that force people to wear shoes in public My question is this Why do some people look at me as if I m doing something indecent by simply not wearing shoes Also why do most major fast food chains post a sign saying No shirt no shoes no service by order of health department Do you find a person who is shoeless in public to be dressed indecently Jamie T in Philadelphia Dear J T For the word indecent I would substitute unappetizing The idea of entering a place of food service without shoes or a shirt seems vaguely Appalachian to Prudie Hot dog stands and ice cream shacks at beaches excepted Since people come in all manner of shapes and degrees of cleanliness a decorous person would support even a fraudulent health code advisory Prudie properly Dear Prudence Not long ago I learned from Trish not her real name a co worker that the pregnancy of another co worker Tina also not her real name had ended in a miscarriage After delivering this bit of news Trish assured me it was OK with Tina that we all be told the bad news I found this odd since none of us had even known Trish was expecting Is gossip now the preferred method of office communication If so has gossip replaced the memo Will my supervisor whisper my work assignments to my co workers who will then whisper them to me Or is gossip only sanctioned when the topic is of a private personal nature I guess my question is How do I distinguish sanctioned gossip from regular old slander Hanging on the Grapevine in Dickenson N D Dear Hang Slander is a false report meant to do harm and is legally actionable I think Sally had a face lift is not such an example And no Prudie does not think gossip has replaced the memo but it is somehow delivered faster Prudie idly Dear Prudence I need your advice on the following I received gifts from my parents delivered by my mom There were three gifts in the bag but none for my wife Friends have told me this was a slight to my wife My problem is what to do about the gifts I could return one or all of them and use the credit to buy a gift for my wife or I could return the gifts to my mother explaining that I take the presents being just for me as an act of hostility Confused in Baltimore Dear Con Prudie is not sure your problem is what to do about the gifts but perhaps what to do about your mother Subtle she is not The solution for you may be to do both the things you mentioned with a slight modification I would tell Mumsy that you take umbrage at her acting out and I would return the gifts for credit buying a treat for both you and your wife Prudie subtextually
