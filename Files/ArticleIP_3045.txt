 Hail Australia It s a fine time to be writing a Victorian novel The last year has been one of Jane Austen s brightest PBS and cable TV have given fresh life to Hardy Scott and all three Bront s even Dickens got a Hollywood makeover this winter his Great Expectations transported from Kent and London to New York and Florida We have renewed our fascination with the close spaces of 19 th century England and it is with those close spaces the dim hallways and yellow glooms that the Australian novelist Peter Carey s Jack Maggs reacquaints us Already a best seller in England and Australia Maggs marks Carey s second foray into Victorian England His first the Booker Prize winning Oscar and Lucinda 1988 is now a major motion picture Carey specializes in the picaresque in one man novels about larger than life social misfits who must cope with rotten childhoods loveless families hideous disfigurements and secret shames Orphans with tics and dwarfs without lips or teeth Jack Maggs and The Unusual Life of Tristan Smith 10 year old parricides and sexually abused teen agers Illywhacker and The Tax Inspector Carey documents their stories in exhaustive loving detail There is plenty of humor in his books some of it sharp and much of it just plain funny and bizarre bits of magic that though not always comprehensible compound a real sense of menace Jack Maggs offers many of these Carey staples It opens with the return to England of its eponymous hero and uses a combination of linear narrative and flashback to tell a story that spans several decades In broad outline it echoes Great Expectations Dickens story of Pip the waif who is befriended by Magwitch the convict though Carey s book is also partly a reflection on how Dickens novel came to be written There are quite a few correspondences between the two novels of which the play on names is only one Like Dickens Abel Magwitch Jack Maggs has been exiled to the Australian backwaters Both men have prot g s Maggs is Henry Phipps a much younger man who we think may be his son Maggs returns from New South Wales where he is now a citizen of good repute and considerable wealth to England where he is still a wanted man to find Phipps whose foppish lifestyle he has long subsidized It is with Maggs search for Phipps that the story begins Soon after his return Maggs encounters Tobias Oates a novelist and self styled cartographer of the Criminal Mind of which Maggs is soon forced to become the hapless embodiment Oates cuts a deal with Maggs He will help the convict find Phipps if Maggs will agree to undergo a series of experiments in Mesmerism Their terrible sessions click for a sample anchor the tale and provide a framework for its telling Through them plus a cache of invisible ink letters Maggs writes to Phipps in order to acquaint the prot g with his protector we look into Maggs tortured soul and witness an Oates in all but tumescent pursuit of Maggs life story which he will exploit for his next best seller Though there is much that Carey takes from Dickens he manages to separate his story from its archetype quite easily Carey s is a metanovel Great Expectations the Australian version that takes on the master and his work by first tenderly tucking them into its pages then slowly exposing their vulnerabilities What we end up with is a sharp postcolonial critique not just of one writer but of novel writing as a whole Carey lays his trap by hewing close to Dickens in style and mood Maggs London is Dickens London only darker a city whose humanity has long since run dry and whose juveniles the Twists and Dorrits and Chuzzlewits and Maggses are forced into lives of crime The year is 1837 that of Victoria s accession but we get a sense not of empire or of politely crumpeting tearooms but of decay and disease of the more Dickensian than Dickens underside of rapid industrialization and urban growth Carey does an impressive job as time traveler and tour guide Maggs is delightfully atmospheric and full of peel away details shit rimmed cobblestones and stinking The quaintly elaborate names Percival Clarence Buckle Mercy Larkin Sophina Smith are a lively match for Dickens Uriah Heeps and Augustus Snodgrasses And the quaintly elaborate capitalization Buckle found his way into the sleepy arms of his Good Companion takes you further back to Richardson and Pamela as does this priceless request Turn over my pretty one and raise your sweet white bottom in the air But it is through the portrait of Oates author hypnotist and all round selfish bastard that Carey brings his novel into its own For Oates pretensions his impassioned defense of abused children his overassiduous note taking his obsessions with criminality mesmerism and his wife s sister parrot Dickens own well documented preoccupations Jack Maggs is arching its brow at Dickens vaunted causes making them potentially smelly And where a literal minded parodist might have bound the narrative to Dickens and his doings Carey gives the novel and its themes a full life outside them If you ve read the Victorian author you get your insider s chuckle If not you still get a good yarn Carey s careful separation of 19 th century England from modern day anywhere may be the key to our appreciation of the Victorian world but it is his portrait of Maggs that allows you to collapse that distance and to really settle into his novel Carey gives us the flawed utterly romantic anti hero of high Victorian fiction absurdly tall absurdly shy absurdly proud absurdly trusting Maggs is a sighted Edward Rochester a kinder Heathcliff His scarred back and missing fingers his tragic isolation from those around him however also make him identifiably Careyesque Of course Carey isn t the first author to use castaways to dramatize a world gone wrong If anything he makes a remarkably unsubtle play for your sympathies Carey s cheerful ham fistedness turns out to be just what is called for to correct Dickens lugubriousness Suffice it to say that when Carey rewrites Dickens ending Maggs unlike the late lamented Magwitch does not die a miserable death it is a perfectly delightful solution Maggs is given an out In fact all the sympathetic characters in the novel are given outs They are allowed to transcend their particular poverties of class gender or nationality in a way Dickens granted precious few Micawbers Carey even reclaims that slighted continent Australia It isn t just a convenient dumping ground for convicts he tells us with the ticklish pride so typical of the expatriate Carey lives in New York Jack Maggs burgeoning dignity and the choices he makes at novel s end give 19 th century Australia the bourgeois stature it lacked in Dickens novel allowing the country to become a place of hope rather than of exile By the same token Jack Maggs triumphal march burnishes the literary moment to which its author lays proud claim restoring the 19 th century English novel that much maligned instrument of colonial oppression to a well deserved place in the sun
