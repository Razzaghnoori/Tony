                all right   well credit cards   i have some do you   well yeah i i ive used them a bit too much sometimes   yes me too   yeah uh do you have uh like the Visa and MasterCard and and those that are those the ones that you use the the most or   well i have uh weve got an American Express which we got that on purpose so we could pay that off every month that way we we know our limit   uhhuh right yeah   but then i also have department stores and um   yeah   you know we keep a couple hundred dollars um if that much charged on those which isnt too bad its just your normal   yeah yeah just a pretty pretty pretty much uh what you can pay monthly anyway   you know getting clothes and stuff every once in awhile exactly   yeah well we have uh have department store cards for nearly all the department stores i guess uh   uhhuh   uh but but we dont you know dont use them a lot uh   right   but we do have uh Visa cards uh   yeah   my wife has uh has an American Express through her through the company   right   and uh i dont even have an American Express to use for business so or i use a Visa all the time   just your Visa yeah   right and uh i i find that they you know they work all right i havent found anybody that will will turn one down   yeah i you know uh people always complain about American Express saying not enough people take it but ive ive rarely found a place that wouldnt that wouldnt take it so that doesnt bother me luckily   uhhuh yeah the uh yeah its its uh it is convenient to have that you know and it and if you can do a the a lot more with the American Express when we do when we go traveling     uhhuh   uh the American Express works a lot better for some things because you can charge you know airline tickets   oh does it sure   and and get some benefits from that i think too   thats true thats true thats thats real nice to   you know but its i tell you its its really uh its tough to uh to deal with when you let your your balances build up you know so that it its   thats true   youve we did it uh intentionally i did it intentionally i was running some business expenses   uhhuh   through the Visa card so i knew that i was running a balance up but it sure is hard to get it   paid back i know   paid back down it uh   when we first got married we you know went and got all the credit cards and   uhhuh   of course charged those puppies up and its oh boy when those bills start coming in they want a lot of money when you start getting them up there   yeah but uh you know you find its uh that the uh the interest rates vary so much on those that uh   uhhuh uhhuh   that weve been paying real close attention to that so were using the ones that uh have the lower rate as a matter of fact the uh the uh credit union   thats good uhhuh   credit card i think has the lowest about the lowest interest rate of any of the ones that we use   thats good ive noticed on the like the department stores they sure do hate it when you pay double payments   uhhuh yeah   you know its like whoa   yeah   wait a minute dont pay us too much you know and they drop it your balance uh they drop your monthly payment down low because they want that interest to build up   uhhuh right   so thats what i normally try to do if its pretty low i try to make a couple payments at a time       and get it down quicker   yeah   but theyre easy to use   so you havent been tempted uh to to call any of these nine hundred numbers trying to get a credit card then   no have you   i have been tempted i just i saw one of those ads on TV last night that you know somebody call in right now you know and you can get your gold Visa card or gold MasterCard but uh   uhhuh i dont understand how they do that   and uh of course its a nine hundred number which that means theyre going to charge you you know fifteen or twenty dollars just to make the phone call   right but they say you cant be turned down and i dont understand how they can   well the thing is the that a lot of those are like theyre set up through a bank or a savings and loan type thing   uhhuh   and you have to have a deposit in that you know that deal of you know if you want a five hundred dollar credit line then you have to keep a five hundred dollar balance in there   oh i see   well then they sure they wont turn you down because theyve got your money   sure theyve got your money already       well gosh   yeah yeah but thats yeah i know thats the way some of them work anyway   well thats darn easy then   yeah   i wouldnt turn you down either ill give you one   right yeah   huh no i havent attempted that im satisfied with what we have right now and we do have a gas credit card and we use that   yes uh yeah thats one that we dont use uh ive had uh you know had different companies or you know gas company cards before   uhhuh   but i didnt use them we we usually spend cash you know pay cash for gas and then uh most of the places will take uh the Visa card anyway so   right right thats true thats true   so i i can use that and uh   well we uh my husband always usually always pays with cash but i never seem to have cash       or at least not enough you know to fill a tank up so i always almost always use my credit card on that on that and then its nice you do tend to pay more for gas but other than that its its a good deal i think   yeah uhhuh yeah but theyre of course now theyre beginning to to get the picture i think uh like Chevron has just recently dropped theirs back   yeah i saw that   so they quit charging the extra i dont whether they they drop the ir price back to the cash price or raised all their prices up to the charge price   yeah exactly but they wont they wont charge i saw that advertised too thats a good deal but its real convenient its real convenient for me i really i just like being able to go in and do that   but uh yeah   and and its like American Express you have to pay it off at the end of the month so   huh yeah      its not going to go up too high   yeah   so its good for emergencies   right yeah thats its always handy to have that that credit card for whatever it is that you might need it for   thats what we do on thats true we always use especially on trips you know we just charge all our gas that saves us spending it or shelling out the cash right then   yeah thats it when when we travel its we used to use our the gas card just for that you know   uhhuh right   and now we dont have of course we dont drive on our trips very much anymore either we used to drive like wed drive to New Orleans twice a year   yeah oh yeah   and uh we dont go we dont we dont drive anymore when we go down there we usually fly so   yeah   you know you can fly just about as cheap as you can drive so   i know and isnt that terrible   yeah so   and save all that money   yeah so anyway   hum well do you think weve   well i think theyve got enough uh enough information from us anyway   okay well thanks for talking   okay its nice talking to you okay byebye   you too byebye
