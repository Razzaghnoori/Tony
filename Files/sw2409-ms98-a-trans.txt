 all right well credit cards i have some do you well yeah i i i ve used them a bit too much sometimes yes me too yeah uh do you have uh like the Visa and MasterCard and and those that are those the ones that you use the the most or well i have uh we ve got an American Express which we got that on purpose so we could pay that off every month that way we we know our limit uh huh right yeah but then i also have department stores and um yeah you know we keep a couple hundred dollars um if that much charged on those which isn t too bad it s just your normal yeah yeah just a pretty pretty pretty much uh what you can pay monthly anyway you know getting clothes and stuff every once in awhile exactly yeah well we have uh have department store cards for nearly all the department stores i guess uh uh huh uh but but we don t you know don t use them a lot uh right but we do have uh Visa cards uh yeah my wife has uh has an American Express through her through the company right and uh i don t even have an American Express to use for business so or i use a Visa all the time just your Visa yeah right and uh i i find that they you know they work all right i haven t found anybody that will will turn one down yeah i you know uh people always complain about American Express saying not enough people take it but i ve i ve rarely found a place that wouldn t that wouldn t take it so that doesn t bother me luckily uh huh yeah the uh yeah it s it s uh it is convenient to have that you know and it and if you can do a the a lot more with the American Express when we do when we go traveling uh huh uh the American Express works a lot better for some things because you can charge you know airline tickets oh does it sure and and get some benefits from that i think too that s true that s true that s that s real nice to you know but it s i tell you it s it s really uh it s tough to uh to deal with when you let your your balances build up you know so that it it s that s true you ve we did it uh intentionally i did it intentionally i was running some business expenses uh huh through the Visa card so i knew that i was running a balance up but it sure is hard to get it paid back i know paid back down it uh when we first got married we you know went and got all the credit cards and uh huh of course charged those puppies up and it s oh boy when those bills start coming in they want a lot of money when you start getting them up there yeah but uh you know you find it s uh that the uh the interest rates vary so much on those that uh uh huh uh huh that we ve been paying real close attention to that so we re using the ones that uh have the lower rate as a matter of fact the uh the uh credit union that s good uh huh credit card i think has the lowest about the lowest interest rate of any of the ones that we use that s good i ve noticed on the like the department stores they sure do hate it when you pay double payments uh huh yeah you know it s like whoa yeah wait a minute don t pay us too much you know and they drop it your balance uh they drop your monthly payment down low because they want that interest to build up uh huh right so that s what i normally try to do if it s pretty low i try to make a couple payments at a time and get it down quicker yeah but they re easy to use so you haven t been tempted uh to to call any of these nine hundred numbers trying to get a credit card then no have you i have been tempted i just i saw one of those ads on TV last night that you know somebody call in right now you know and you can get your gold Visa card or gold MasterCard but uh uh huh i don t understand how they do that and uh of course it s a nine hundred number which that means they re going to charge you you know fifteen or twenty dollars just to make the phone call right but they say you can t be turned down and i don t understand how they can well the thing is the that a lot of those are like they re set up through a bank or a savings and loan type thing uh huh and you have to have a deposit in that you know that deal of you know if you want a five hundred dollar credit line then you have to keep a five hundred dollar balance in there oh i see well then they sure they won t turn you down because they ve got your money sure they ve got your money already well gosh yeah yeah but that s yeah i know that s the way some of them work anyway well that s darn easy then yeah i wouldn t turn you down either i ll give you one right yeah huh no i haven t attempted that i m satisfied with what we have right now and we do have a gas credit card and we use that yes uh yeah that s one that we don t use uh i ve had uh you know had different companies or you know gas company cards before uh huh but i didn t use them we we usually spend cash you know pay cash for gas and then uh most of the places will take uh the Visa card anyway so right right that s true that s true so i i can use that and uh well we uh my husband always usually always pays with cash but i never seem to have cash or at least not enough you know to fill a tank up so i always almost always use my credit card on that on that and then it s nice you do tend to pay more for gas but other than that it s it s a good deal i think yeah uh huh yeah but they re of course now they re beginning to to get the picture i think uh like Chevron has just recently dropped theirs back yeah i saw that so they quit charging the extra i don t whether they they drop the ir price back to the cash price or raised all their prices up to the charge price yeah exactly but they won t they won t charge i saw that advertised too that s a good deal but it s real convenient it s real convenient for me i really i just like being able to go in and do that but uh yeah and and it s like American Express you have to pay it off at the end of the month so huh yeah it s not going to go up too high yeah so it s good for emergencies right yeah that s it s always handy to have that that credit card for whatever it is that you might need it for that s what we do on that s true we always use especially on trips you know we just charge all our gas that saves us spending it or shelling out the cash right then yeah that s it when when we travel it s we used to use our the gas card just for that you know uh huh right and now we don t have of course we don t drive on our trips very much anymore either we used to drive like we d drive to New Orleans twice a year yeah oh yeah and uh we don t go we don t we don t drive anymore when we go down there we usually fly so yeah you know you can fly just about as cheap as you can drive so i know and isn t that terrible yeah so and save all that money yeah so anyway hum well do you think we ve well i think they ve got enough uh enough information from us anyway okay well thanks for talking okay it s nice talking to you okay bye bye you too bye bye
