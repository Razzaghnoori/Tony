 Pachuco Cross A design in the form of a small cross that is tattooed on the left hand between the thumb and forefinger with lines or dashes radiating out from it George Carpenter Barker states that it must be seven rays or lines that radiate from the cross It is a well known symbol among Chicanos and has been traced to the era of the pachucos 1940s urban youth hence its name It is also known as the cruz del barrio cross from the neighborhood and has been found throughout major cities of the Southwest Tattoos of Christian images have always been popular among Chicanos and the custom of tattooing images of Jesus Christ crucifixes La Virgen de Guadalupe and other Madonnas has a long history In the Middle Ages the Crusaders cut a cross into Chris tian converts on the hand a little above the wrist Some social scientists believe that the pachuco cross was meant to symbolize violence and membership in a gang But it is known that it was used as an initiation ritual among friends and peers to show solidarity and allegiance to a particular barrio In describing the tattooed cross Haldeen Braddy is of the opinion that each ray jetting out from the cross represented a six month stay in jail In his view pachucos liked to stay in the jaula cage jail so that they could accumulate these rays as souvenirs of their imprisonment 1971 142 There is no evidence to support this speculation References Barker 1974 Braddy 1960 Chicano Pinto Research Project 1975 Coltharp 1965 Demello 1993 Govenar 1988 Pachucos as 1940s Urban Youth A name adopted by Mexican Americans and Mexican nationals to designate those who make up a fascinating urban subculture detached from U S culture and from Mexican American urban life also The first appearance of pachucos was in the El Paso Ju rez area during the 1920s and early 1930s It is thought the word pachuco was a colloquial way of referring to El Paso A person from El Paso was referred to as del pachuco Sometimes a person considered a pachuco was called a chuco Haldeen Braddy discusses the origin of the word pachuco providing several theories One is that the pachucos of the 1930s came from the city of Pachuca in the state of Hidalgo Mexico He also pre sents the definition from the Diccionario General de Americanismos stating that pachuca is a five card poker hand in which all the cards are of different suits or in other words a poker hand with no value a losing hand Braddy believes this well describes the pachucos of El Paso 1971 The other theory is that pachuco comes from the Nahuatl word pachtli which refers to a grass like hay that grows parasitically on trees Pachucos were identifiable by their clothing hairstyles and a distinct language with its own vocabulary The men wore zoot suits that is pegged pants long coats with padded shoulders and pancake hats Their hair was worn long and slicked back with a ducktail effect Some also wore a long chain hanging from their pants well displayed and connected to a belt Pachucas were the girlfriends of the pachucos but they also had a dress style all their own They wore short very tight skirts with their hair high and long Makeup was heavy especially around the eyes Supposedly they were very streetwise and liked to hang out with their pachuco boyfriends Large numbers of young men from El Paso speaking the pachuco argot settled in Los Angeles during the early 1940s and it was there that they became recognized as an identifiable group and considered to be gang members Young men who relocated and settled in Los Angeles even for short periods of time upon returning home to the small towns of the Southwest would spread the pachuco beliefs and jargon to their communities In this way pachuquesmo a Mexican subculture became known throughout the Southwest The pachuco speech a combination of English and Spanish also called cal was a fascinating fusion drawing from many linguistic sources Cal was originally the language of the Spanish gypsies or a dialect of Spanish showing traces of many languages acquired by the gypsies throughout their world wanderings The pachuco argot utilized several linguistic sources in developing a vocabulary or jargon These sources were southwestern Spanish the older archaic Spanish from New Mexico Mexican slang standard Spanish from Mexico City and also words invented by the pachucos themselves The pachuco dialect was the product of an urban environment and it is believed the language may have originated in the underworld and drug scene of El Paso George Carpenter Barker pinpoints almost exactly where the pachuco jargon originated from the 7 X gang who first met in the neighborhood of Florence and Eighth Streets in El Paso Arthur Campa believes that pachucos originated as a linguistic group first and had no distinctive dress style That came later as they moved into a more stable economic environment and had some financial resources Expressions and vocabulary used by Chicanos today come from the pachuco argot of the 1940s For example such words as rale what s happening or O K bato guy as in bato loco califas California hay te wuacho I ll be seeing you and la pinta jail prison have been used for generations The film Zoot Suit written and directed by Luis Valdez in 1981 depicts the dress language and problems of Mexican American youth and especially pachucos in Los Angeles in the 1940s During the 1940s a caricature of the pachuco was created for the Mexican media in the person of Tin Tan whose real name was Germ n Vald z 1919 1973 He was an actor and performer who dressed as a stereotypical pachuco and zoot suiter Tin Tan made several Mexican films portraying the Mexican American pocho who code switches between English and Spanish and speaks cal The pachuco was disdained in the U S by both the Mexican American and Anglo communities and likewise in Mexico by the media and the intellectuals Octavio Paz much quoted disparagingly discusses the phenomenon of the pachuco in his book The Labyrinth of Solitude published in English in 1961 Although almost any urban Chicano who was young in the 1940s was affected by the style and language of the pachuco the stereotypic pachuco was often associated with violence and deviancy The zoot suit riots of 1943 are held up as the epitome of the pachuco experience totally disregarding previous and later experiences According to Alfredo Mirand The pachuco has been an especially visible symbol of cultural autonomy and resistance His distinctive dress demeanor mannerism and language not only express his manhood but set him off culturally from the dominant society To be a chuco is to be proud dignified and to uphold one s personal integrity as well as the honor and integrity of the group It is at once an affirmation of one s manhood and one s culture 1985 179 180 The pachuco is the precursor to the bato loco the cholo and the low rider of more contemporary times The pachuca was the counterpart of the pachuco of the 1940s but also the home girl archetype that comes together in the young Chicana growing up in an urban ghettoized environment During the 1940s pachucas were the girlfriends of or those who hung around with pachucos They developed their own style of dress wearing very tight short skirts and sweaters and doing their hair in a pompadour style Their behavior was loud and brash they smoked cigarettes in public wore lots of eye makeup and supposedly were quick to fight Pachucas knew the vernacular of the times speaking pachuco and scandalizing their families They were not necessarily gang members but they can be considered the precursors of present day cholas See also Cal Cholos Low Rider Pocho Tin Tan Zoot Suit References Barker 1974 Braddy 1960 1971 Campa 1979 Cerda and Farias 1953 Coltharp 1965

means dove so a palomilla is a flock of doves One rarely hears the expression today but it is occasionally used in literature such as the short stories of Mario Suarez A palomilla would be one s peer

celebrations as Cinco de Mayo the Fifth of May and El Diez y Seis de Septiembre the Sixteenth of September Mexican restaurants are often decorated with streams of colorful papel picado Some of the

of Chicano folklore Am rico Paredes was a professor emeritus of English and anthropology at the University of Texas Austin His classic work With His Pistol in His Hand A Border Ballad and Its Hero first published in 1958 has become a standard work in Chicano studies and American folklore A whole generation of Chicano scholars regard Paredes as their intellectual role model and mentor and his original research on Chicano folklore engendered a new wave of scholarship and academic achievements As a young man Paredes was always interested in music corridos ballads and singing His early published scholarship focused on ballads and ballad heroes of the Texas Mexican border and through this research he developed a theory about the formation of Chicano folklore The resistance to an encroaching foreign culture the loss of political and economic power feelings of social marginality and the resulting conflict of cultures all contributed to the creation of folklore in the form of legends jokes and songs by the Chicano people His research and publications encompass various disciplines from anthropology to literature to social history Am rico Paredes was born in Brownsville Texas on September 3 1915 He attended Brownsville Junior College in the early 1930s earning an A A degree in 1936 In 1944 he joined the army wrote for the military newspaper Stars and Stripes and worked in Japan for a couple of years Returning to Texas in 1950 he earned a B A degree from the University of Texas in 1951 an M A in 1953 and a Ph D in 1956 The distinguishing feature of Paredes s scholarship has been his humanistic approach to conducting research Besides knowing and studying his own culture and ethnic community he was able to bring another consciousness to the study of folklore in general and to Texas Mexican folklore in particular He taught that the examination of a cultural or folkloric phenomenon cannot be divorced from the social context in which it is performed or expressed Before the publication of Paredes s work most of the Hispanic and Chicano folklore collected was classified published and placed on a library shelf Paredes s research emphasized the importance of the informant s culture and the social setting and history of the community of the informant It was in his book With His Pistol in His Hand A Border Ballad and Its Hero that Paredes proposed his theory of the development of Chicano folklore through a process of cultural conflict generated by the invasion of Anglo culture and values into south Texas in the 1800s Many writers have dedicated their books to him and the journal Aztl n devoted a double issue volume to him in 1982 Besides publishing over sixty articles in academic journals he was editor of the Journal of American Folklore from 1968 to 1973 and published Folktales of Mexico in 1970 and A Texas Mexican Cancionero Folksongs of the Lower Border in 1976 Besides his scholarly writings Paredes was a poet and novelist His first publication was a collection of poetry titled Cantos de Adolescencia in 1937 Most recently he has published George Washington Gomez A Mexico Texan Novel in 1990 Between Two Worlds in 1991

folk play Also known as La Pastorela the complete title of this folk drama is El Coloquio de los Pastores and it is written in verse and performed on Christmas Eve It is an ancient mystery play brought to the New World by the Spanish Franciscan priests and is performed throughout the Southwest As a folk production it is performed for entertainment but it is also a religious presentation that is maintaining a long tradition The full title means the dialogue of the shepherds and it is an interpretation of the dialogue and reaction the shepherds may have had when they learned of the birth of Jesus Christ It narrates the story of the shepherds who are visited by Michael the Archangel who informs them of the birth of the infant Jesus and urges them to go to Bel n Bethlehem Before the shepherds decide what to do they are visited by Lucifer who is angry about the birth of the Christ child to the Virgin Mary Lucifer tries to challenge the shepherds but Michael the Archangel returns just in time to defeat him The shepherds then continue on their journey to Bethlehem bringing gifts for the infant Jesus The structure of the play is formulaic and so the sequence of acts can be rearranged into many different patterns with jokes songs speeches and other events added at different points The underlying story of the drama is the universal battle between good and evil It has evolved from the literature of sixteenth century Spain and the indigenous traditions of Mexico and for this reason the play has provided a political format for the poor masses throughout the last 400 years Because of its ancient history there are many variants of Los Pastores and several versions have developed a comic dialogue between Lucifer and Cuchar n Bartolo and the other characters One character is named Bato as in bato loco crazy guy a phrase of contemporary usage among Chicanos today Variants of this play have been collected in Texas New Mexico and California and it has been performed in Mexico since the sixteenth century In San Antonio the performance of Los Pastores at Our Lady of Guadalupe Church as been ongoing since 1913 Richard Flores both as an ethnographer and as a performer presents a thorough analysis of the historical conditions that continue to provide an environment for the performance of Los Pastores as both ritual and drama In 1991 El Teatro Campesino produced a video film of their production of Los Pastores titled La Pastorela The Shepherds Tale References Bandini 1958 Cole 1907 Espinosa 1985 Flores 1995 Herrera Sobek 1995a Igo 1985 Lea 1953

of the holy water font he is a rogue folk hero with hundreds of tales to his name This trickster character is known throughout the Spanish speaking world and the Southwest of the United States He is the classic Spanish picaro rogue who incorporates three ancient literary types the wanderer the fool and the have not according to Claudio Guillen He is the trickster figure who is constantly dissatisfied always wanting more yet is always outwitting everyone and acting as the social critic along the way Pedro de Urdemalas lives by his wit has no shame and at different times makes a pact with the devil God the Virgin Mary and St Peter Tales of Pedro de Urdemalas collected by Aurelio M Espinosa in Spain and in New Mexico were published in the Journal of American Folklore in 1914 Ram n Laval gives a brief literary history of de Urdemalas and publishes a small series of tales collected in Chile in the late nineteenth century Cervantes wrote a play about him in 1615 Comedia Famosa de Pedro de Urdemalas so we know Pedro de Urdemalas was already a folkloric character in the seventeenth century Wardropper states Pedro de Urdemalas is a shadowy even elusive figure in the oral tradition of Spanish folktales Because these tales were not as far as we know collected in the Renaissance and because like ballads and songs they must have been subject to endless variation and mutual interference we cannot now know the Pedro de Urdemalas who endeared himself to the folk 218 But it is clear that Pedro de Urdemalas is a Hispano precursor to Don Cacahuate el pelado Tin Tan

plucked or bald el pelado was a designation used for a clownish performer an improvised character type developed by performing theater groups in the 1920s in Mexico and in the Southwest Also known as peladito this comic hobo is the underdog a nobody who is criticized and made fun of by the whole world The pelado was a verbal artist who according to Samuel Ramos has created a dialect of his own a diction which abounds in ordinary words but he gives these words a new meaning His terminology abounds in sexual allusion 1962 59 Many carpas tent theaters featured pelado or peladito characters and the agringado anglicized and the pocho half Mexican were special targets of his comic wit and satire Beloved by working class audiences the peladito using cal Spanish slang and pochismos Americanisms particularly poked fun at the acculturation of Mexicans who couldn t speak Spanish and pointed out to them American discrimination against Mexicans Similar to Charlie Chaplin and later developed by the Mexican actor Cantinflas el pelado was a homeless type who in dialogue could state the unthinkable and mock everything and everybody Many Chicanos who may not have known the appellation pelado nonetheless became familiar with the comic vagabond through Mexican films El Teatro Campesino the Farmworkers Theater effectively used this character type in skits and actos dramas and succeeded in intensifying with humor the serious social issues presented in their performances See also Agringado Carpas Pocho El Teatro Campesino References Broyles Gonzalez 1994 Kanellos 1990 Lim n 1998 Ramos

informally as Los Penitentes This lay religious society related to the Roman Catholic Church is still found in rural northern New Mexico and southern Colorado Originally it was organized for religious observances and practices including pious prayer and bodily penance but the society eventually became very important in providing mutual aid to the local communities Los Penitentes cared for the sick arranged funerals and conducted the religious rituals associated with wakes Their social role in contemporary New Mexico is not as pronounced but some moradas still remain active Their primary religious ceremonies commemorated the passion and death of Jesus Christ during the celebrations of Semana Santa Holy Week It is speculated that the starting date of the brotherhood is somewhere between 1790 and 1810 The origins of Los Penitentes have been debated for years but it is likely they were heavily influenced by the Franciscan Third Order who were the friars in New Mexico until Mexico separated from Spain in 1821 Los Penitentes became a strong institution in rural New Mexico because there were too few Catholic priests to oversee the religious life of the people during the early nineteenth century The village chapters governed themselves without benefit of the few priests in the colony Consequently Los Penitentes had strong influences in conserving the language and culture of the Spanish Americans of New Mexico Membership consisted of between thirty and fifty adult men per chapter called moradas and were divided into two groups common members called hermanos disciplantes brothers who discipline and officers called hermanos de luz brothers of light By the early twentieth century the various chapters had become secret societies with restricted membership Journalism about Los Hermanos Penitentes has been sensationalistic with lengthy descriptions of their Semana Santa rituals especially when Anglo Americans migrated to New Mexico during the late nineteenth century Their custom of self punishment in the form of flagellation during the Holy Week ceremonies aroused much interest and was reported widely in many East Coast publications The most sensitive and nonjudgmental writing and research have been conducted by de Cordova Henderson Sprott and Weigle A worthy contemporary 1970 1986 descriptive account of the ritual ceremonies associated with Holy Week in Cordova can be found in Charles Briggs 1988 References Boyd 1974 Briggs 1988 Brown 1978 Darley 1968 De Cordova 1972 Espinosa G 1972 Henderson 1937 Horka Follick 1969 Rael 1951 Sprott

instance when buying candy the vendor may add one extra piece de pil n to surprise and make a child happy John Bourke writes about an ancient custom in Mexico still used in the late nineteenth century a merchant kept a tin cylinder for each customer and after each purchase he d drop a bean into it After the total number of beans reached sixteen or eighteen the customer was given six cents in money or goods This was the pil n a type of dividend given to the client for purchasing from the same merchant The phrase de pil n is used when referring to the occurrence of an unplanned episode or accident In narrating a personal story with an unhappy ending an individual might add Y de pil n me ca and to top it off I fell down Although it is not found in common usage among contemporary Chicanos many will remember how their parents used this expression The word has several meanings including a heap of stuff such as a heap of grapes a heap of mortar a heap of something but it also means a lump of sugar In her personal memoir A Place in El Paso Gloria Lopez Stoppard has a delightful de scription of the use of pil n during her childhood Thus de pil n may express something positive or something unexpectedly negative References Bourke 1895 De Leon 1982 Lopez Stoppard 1996 Pi atas A colorfully decorated clay pot or papier m ch figure filled with toys and candies confetti or party favors that is brought to celebrations such as birthdays Christmas festivities and other parties Often it is decorated as a star or an animal such as a burro or elephant but it can also be a fruit or a puppet The size varies from small to very large Pi atas have traditionally been a part of birthday and Christmas celebrations but are now also brought out for other holidays In Mexico a pi ata was always broken on Christmas Eve especially among the poorer classes so that children would receive small inexpensive gifts from the pi ata The real Christmas gifts were not presented until D a de los Reyes on January 6 also known as Epiphany in the Catholic calendar A game is made of breaking the pi ata and a song accompanies the game The pi ata is hung from a tree with a long rope that is manipulated by an adult who is able to move the pi ata up and down so it won t be broken too quickly A child is blindfolded twirled around three times handed a bat and led to the pi ata Everyone will usually have a turn or two and finally the manipulator allows someone to break it The candy and prizes fall to the ground and everyone jumps to grab some The custom of breaking a pi ata during the Christmas Mass celebrations was introduced by the Augustine priests in the seventeenth century Later the custom of celebrating many Christmas Masses evolved into Las Posadas Christmas pageant The pi ata was considered to be a symbol of evil with the clay pot representing Satan or his spirit and the colorful decorations serving to tempt humanity The candies and goodies inside the pi ata were the unknown pleasures that Satan held out to attract man The blindfolded child was supposed to represent innocence and faith which must be blind to combat the evil spirit The breaking of the pi ata symbolized the struggle that man must sustain to destroy evil and receive the gifts and pleasures of God the candy The word pi ata derives from the verb api ar which means to cram tie or join together In Italy pignattas were hung from the ceilings during masquerade balls It is accepted that there is an oriental influence since pi atas are always decorated with colorful crepe paper It is thought pi atas originated in China and were brought to Sicily and Spain by the Arabs and to New Spain by the Spaniards See also Las Posadas References Burciaga 1993 Gallegos 1991 Griffith 1988 Ortega 1973 Perl

prison is believed to come from the word penitenciaria or penitentiary Other common words for prison are bote meaning can and corre which is short for correctional institution referring specifically to one in Texas Joint is another word frequently used to mean prison There has been a lot of sociological literature written about the formation of gangs in prisons as a means of surviving incarceration in the United States The media including 60 Minutes has done stories about the activities of the Mexican mafia and La Familia Often ignored is the subculture of the pinto experience that is exhibited in behavior art expression and published poetry In the early 1970s several Chicano magazines devoted whole issues to literature and art by pintos always referring to it as pinto art and pinto poetry A combination of Mexican and prison cultural values dictates the behavior of pintos inside prison and out on the street Chicano prisoners have a strong sense of family and community and feel they are constantly being watched by their barrio family women and their home boys peer group Most Chicano convicts have little education speak primarily in Spanish and have a strong sense of Mexican nationalism Regardless of place of birth mexicanismo and machismo are a very important part of being a pinto Ex pintos are often identifiable by their mannerisms gestures language haircuts and dress They are usually extremely clean and well groomed have very short hair wear well pressed pants and are in excellent physical shape Within the prison world pintos have established a well defined and structured social environment which they carry to the outside world when released In discussing the film American Me Rosa Linda Fregoso states that Edward James Olmos depicts extremely well the expressive behavior of pintos both in prison and outside In her words Besides rendering a Chicano pinto presence in the rhythms of speech Santana the movie character represents it in the stylized walk and prose of a pinto a stance honed in the corridors behind prison walls or in the barrios of East L A 1993 130 The pinto experience is a subculture of the Chicano experience Because of the low socioeconomic status of a large percentage of Chicanos in the United States and the lack of equal opportunities in education and employment many Chicano families have been inadvertently introduced to this subculture A special issue of the Chicano magazine De Colores vol 3 no 1 was devoted to Los Pintos de America and the issue was published as a separate monograph in 1976 by Pajarito Publications

means an insignia of an order and in the United States it also means the license plates of a car But within cholo and youth gang culture it refers to the sign and name of a gang or club as it appears on the walls of buildings in the barrios of Chicano communities What may appear as graffiti is actually the placa of a person or of a gang Where the placa appears signifies that territory as belonging to that gang and it may also serve as a challenge to other gangs The use of public walls for asserting a fraternal identity is really an ancient tradition and within Chicano culture it can be traced back to at least the 1930s Chicano street culture uses plaqueasos as a system for conveying information about territory and youth socialization customs If one placa is written over by the placa of another gang it is accepted as a challenge to a confrontation A placa also refers to the individual name of a gang member Nicknames are very common among Chicanos but a placa is specifically a gang related name and often very well describes the person as perceived by friends or other gang members Names such as Sad Girl Diablo devil Joker and Malo bad could be names used within a gang and may signify sadness wildness or craziness Sometimes the writing of names on walls is referred to as plaqueasos or in contemporary terms barrio calligraphy In more recent times the individual who writes on walls has been called a tagger and the art of writing is tagging Many Chicano taggers use a stylized medieval writing such as Old English and German Gothic forms Sanchez Tranquilino has analyzed the displacement of graffiti by murals in Chicano communities and finds that murals can be an extension of the barrio calligraphy rather than an attempt to control gang vandalism as is sometimes assumed

term that describes the use of English expressions in Spanish or Americanisms interjected into conversations when speaking Spanish Sometimes this kind of speech is called Spanglish or Chicano Spanish or just pocho talk Examples of some pochismos are words such as parkear meaning to park the car and wachar meaning to watch hay te wacho I ll see you also spelled guachate meaning watch out Other simpler examples are dona for doughnut el dompe for the dump troque for truck and yarda for yard According to Manuel Pe a the word jait n meaning snobbish evolved from the words high tone when one was discussing music It came to be used to mean pretentious high class as in se crea muy jaitona she thinks she s real high class but at the same time it can mean that one has elegance or style Various dictionaries of Chicano Spanish and Chicano slang have been compiled that list many other pochismos Chicano novelists and poets have consciously incorporated the use of pochismos in literary works to reinforce the precarious cultural and linguistic status of Chicanos in American society See also Cal Pachucos Pocho References Campa 1977 Galvan 1985 Hern ndez Chavez Cohen and Beltramo 1975 Pe a

fully fluent in Spanish or Mexican enough culturally and linguistically The word can also mean discolored truncated or small It has been adopted by some Chicanos to describe and ridicule themselves as they survive within an antagonistic and discriminatory environment The word became more nationally known in 1959 with the publication of the novel Pocho by Jose Antonio Villarreal which depicted the coming of age of a Chicano growing up in the Santa Clara Valley of California during the 1940s Mexicans like to call Chicanos pocho ridiculing their sometimes poor Spanish and their lack of knowledge about Mexico and Mexican customs Mexicans who have spent time in the United States and have acquired the mannerisms values and the English language may be considered pochos because they ve become agringados anglicized In the 1950s and 1960s the Mexican cinema produced several films depicting the lives of pochos from both sides of the border but emphasizing the importance of maintaining mexi canidad Titles of some of these films are Soy Mexicano de Ac de Este Lado I Am a Mexican from This Side 1951 Los Desarraigados The Uprooted 1958 M xico de Mi Coraz n Mexico of My Heart 1963 and El Pocho The Half Mexican 1964 As with the word cholo individuals have attempted to find the origin of the use of the word pocho in reference to Chicanos In his autobiography Barrio Boy Ernesto Galarza writes about the pochos he found in Sacramento California in the second decade of the twentieth century They had learned to speak English of sorts and could still speak Spanish also of sorts Concerning the pochos the chicanos suspected that they considered themselves too good for the barrio but were not for some reason good enough for the Americans 1971 203 In Los Angeles the writer Lalo Lopez has created a comic industry based on pocho caricatures that includes a comic strip political cartoons Pocho Productions an Internet web page Pocho Magazine a political satire zine and a calendar He refers to a modern Aztec calendar as a Pochteca calendar which features wisdom from the wise guy ancestors of the modern day Pocha and Pocho The whole Southwest is referred to as Pocholandia A Chicano who does not speak fluent Spanish may be said to speak pocho Spanish but the reverse is never stated about a Mexican who cannot speak fluent English Many English and Spanish

peregrinos the pilgrims representing Joseph and Mary visit a different home each night reenacting the search for an inn by Joseph and Mary Los mesoneros those who portray the innkeepers keep refusing them lodging Los peregrinos form a procession and children and angels hand carry the small figures of the Holy Family When they arrive at a home they ask for shelter and sing carols Las Posadas occurs from December 16 through December 24 Nine different homes are opened to the pilgrims and food and drink are offered after the peregrinos have been denied lodging Most homes will have a nativity scene a nacimiento set up for the prayers and singers An important tradition of these festivities is the pi ata that is brought out and broken by the children There is evidence that pi atas originated from this Christmas celebration Posadas are still held today in many Mexican communities in the United States Some are organized by church groups but recently others have been organized for commercial purposes by city entities The reenactment of Las Posadas is an ancient tradition that can be traced back to the early conquest in Mexico and to the christianization of the Aztecs by the Augustine priests They originated in the small village of San Augustin Acolman located near the pyramids in Teotihuac n The Aztecs celebrated the birth of their god Huitzilopochtli for one night and celebrations were held all of the following day in every home This occurred about the same time of the year that the Catholic Church celebrated the birth of Christ The Augustine priests saw the similarity between these Aztec celebrations and the Christmas festivities and chose this opportunity to teach the new religion to the Aztecs While the Aztecs were celebrating the birth of Huitzilopochtli the priests reenacted the pilgrimage of Mary and Joseph The nine nightly journeys symbolize the nine months of pregnancy for Mary These Christmas Masses as they were called were celebrated in the convents and churches but eventually were moved to the haciendas farms and ranches and finally to the neighborhoods The celebrations ended with firecrackers and the breaking of a pi ata Today many cities in the Southwest reenact this pilgrimage for one night with a procession winding through city streets In Monterey California the whole city comes out for Las Posadas and in San Antonio Texas a posada is held during the Fiesta de las Luminarias Festival of the Bonfires that includes a procession on the Paso del Rio river pass See also Nacimiento Pi ata References Campa 1934
