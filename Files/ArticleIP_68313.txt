 Grand Finale Mike Leigh s Topsy Turvy broadly recounts the creation of Gilbert and Sullivan s comic opera The Mikado at London s Savoy Theatre in 1885 Perhaps broadly is putting too fine a point on it The first hour in which Arthur Sullivan Allan Corduner attempts to sever his ties with W S Gilbert Jim Broadbent and the owner of the Savoy Richard D Oyly Carte Ron Cook is a mess The order of scenes feels arbitrary and characters pop up and vanish with bewildering frequency You might be tempted to vanish too Friends of mine did Be patient Leigh s movies born of actors improvisations and loosely shaped always take a while to find their rhythm and frequently their point This one finds everything By the end of its two hours and 40 minutes Topsy Turvy has evolved into something extraordinary a monument to process to the minutiae of making art And to something more the fundamental sadness of people who labor to make beautiful things who soar and then come down to a not so beautiful earth It would be charitable to attribute the shapelessness of the early scenes to the characters own lack of focus but it would also be inane As Elvis Mitchell pointed out in Slate s Leigh s opening shot features an usher who moves along a row of the Savoy Theatre lifting and peering under every seat That s every seat You can almost hear Leigh cackling How s this for a fast start you bourgeois slaves to narrative Inevitably something does happen Princess Ida one of Gilbert and Sullivan s duds has its premiere and Gilbert fumes over a review that calls him the monarch of topsy turvydom of formulaic plots involving magical elixirs and coins A heat wave has hit London theater attendance is down and Sullivan is itching to go off and become the English Mendelssohn to write operas and symphonies instead of comic souffl s Leigh evidently loves the bloodless formality of the scenes between Gilbert and Sullivan men of opposite tastes and temperaments who only overlap in their work He must also love that those scenes are narrative dead ends How s this for conflict you bourgeois slaves to melodrama The wake up call comes an hour into the movie Gilbert attends a popular exposition of Japanese culture at Knightsbridge and watches Kabuki routines and women in kimonos pouring green tea spinach water When a Japanese sword he has purchased falls off his wall he hefts it mimes a fight while issuing strangled samurailike cries then has a brainstorm We hear the horns of The Mikado overture then Leigh cuts to the fully realized opening scene on stage at the Savoy We are gentlemen of Japan Just that chorus is enough to reanimate the audience to make people sit up and grin And Leigh s technique of leaping back and forth between the finished Mikado and painstaking scenes of rehearsal has magic in it You re watching straw then gold then straw then gold And you see the connection A central section of the drama is missing What exactly fired Sullivan up about doing The Mikado What was different about this collaboration No answer Topsy Turvy turns into something other than the Gilbert and Sullivan story a portrait of life in the theater A group portrait D Oyly Carte becomes a quiet third protagonist a humane businessman He softly negotiates a salary increase with the company s lead comic Martin Savage a neurasthenic junkie He gently seeks the assurance of a tipsy ing nue the tremulous Shirley Henderson that her little weakness will not re emerge In the dressing room performers gossip and complain drink and shoot themselves up with drugs Leigh s ensemble casts strive to be microcosms of society so issues of class are ever present You see it in Sullivan s banter with the working class musicians in the pit and in Gilbert s with the uppity actors the movie s posturing middle class whom he drills on pronunciation and poise The chorus is presented as some sort of collective folk conscience when it lobbies Gilbert to restore the rashly cut solo A more humane Mikado never did in Japan exist of the sad fat fellow Timothy Spall in the title role Who would have predicted that Leigh would make Gilbert and Sullivan into Mike Leigh characters Gilbert could be a stand in for Leigh himself a haughty ill humored man with an obsession for tiny details and a glowering dedication to process Gilbert haggles with his actors over small things that shouldn t resonate but which somehow add up Leigh s small things add up too The joke of The Mikado is that its Japanese lords are thinly disguised English bureaucrats the joke of Topsy Turvy is that the opera s English performers seem culturally incapable of playing Japanese They rehearse in long coats and top hats and some of the women and men express horror at appearing on stage without corsets Behind the satire however is a reverence for Gilbert and Sullivan The tempos are slower than modern audiences are used to and the staging has been stripped of high camp accretions I saw a D Oyly Carte production of The Mikado in the late 70s It was played fast and to the groundlings and made me never want to see a G S opera again Now I can t wait for the next production Only a lunatic would call Topsy Turvy with its lame first hour and host of loose ends a masterpiece but by the finale I was ready to have myself committed The finale itself must have done it Leigh s endings are often wondrous and this one is up there with the rooftop scene in High Hopes 1988 The Mikado is a triumph it would be the Savoy s biggest hit but there s no transformation in the lives of its makers Gilbert can t bring himself to reach out to his brokenhearted wife Lesley Manville and Sullivan has a melancholy inkling that he has reached his artistic peak The ing nue Leonora is drinking again toasting herself in the mirror and praising the loveliness of Nature a Nature that will of course destroy her The final image is of Art Leonora on stage singing Yum Yum s sublime The sun whose rays are all ablaze As Leigh s camera pulls back over the orchestra and the audience this movie feels like one of the saddest and loveliest tributes to the lives of artists ever made Topsy Turvy leaves you upside down and breathless Like Mike Leigh Errol Morris rarely begins a project with a clear idea of what he wants it to be Sometimes he doesn t end a project with a clear idea of what he wants it to be either His newest documentary Mr Death The Rise and Fall of Fred D Leuchter Jr kicks up all sorts of messy emotions that his coolly ironic technique can t begin to handle The director is in his weird element only in the first half hour in which he sits his subject down and gets out of his way Leuchter who looks a little like the archetypal movie dweeb Charles Martin Smith and has a heavy exurbs of Boston accent explains how he became involved in redesigning problematic electric chairs Excess current cooks the tissue he says barely suppressing a smirk at his own expertise There ve been occasions where a great amount of current has been applied and the meat actually will come off the executee s bone like the meat coming off a cooked chicken Leuchter set about making capital punishment more humane He moves on to talking about his redesigns for lethal injection systems gas chambers and even a gallows while underneath Caleb Sampson provides macabre funhouse music and wistful calliope waltzes Morris distance from his subject implies condescension Leuchter looks like something in a jar But that s OK because the man is an interesting specimen Is he a monster or a humanist committed to eliminating the deplawrable tawchaw of capital punishment It could go either way M r Death gets into deeper waters when it recounts the trial of Ernst Zundel in Canada for proclaiming that the Holocaust never happened Zundel hired Leuchter to go to Auschwitz and examine the alleged gas chambers Footage taken by Zundel s cameraman shows the little man chiseling at walls vandalizing what even he admits are international shrines Leuchter smuggled specimens of rock and concrete back to the United States where chemical analysis revealed no cyanide gas Furthermore Leuchter can t figure out how the gas would even have been administered without killing the Nazis themselves proof he argues that mass extermination at Auschwitz never took place The subsequent Leuchter Report became the backbone of Zundel s defense he lost anyway and of the burgeoning revisionist movement led by David Irving But if Leuchter became a hero to neo Nazis he also became a target of Jewish groups and a pariah even in the execution business When Morris hooks up with him for the last time he s in hiding from creditors Is Leuchter a raving anti Semite or a pathetic pawn who thrived on having for the first time in his life a bit of celebrity The film suggests the latter It certainly produces no evidence of malice Plenty of monstrous insensitivity and hubris though Morris uses the Dutch historian Robert Jan van Pelt as a counternarrator He calls Leuchter a fffool who didn t have a clue what to look for in a place that had changed enormously in 50 years If he had spent time in the archives says van Pelt he would have found evidence about ventilation systems ways to introduce Zyclon B into these buildings but of course I don t think he knows German so it wouldn t have helped very much The most devastating rebuttal is from the chemist in charge of the Auschwitz analysis who explains that the gas wouldn t have penetrated more than 10 microns into the wall a human hair is 100 microns thick so by crushing the samples standard procedure he had effectively diluted the cyanide 100 000 times Against all this Morris shows footage of Leuchter chiseling at Auschwitz and even adds some of his own along with slow motion shots of hammers bashing rocks walls floors etc It s an obscenity After my rage at Leuchter had subsided I began to get angry at Morris for aestheticizing that violation turning it into an ironic art object The director s beautiful detachment suggests a kind of cowardice His technique is based on standing back maintaining a fixed distance while his subjects hang themselves and for a while that works stunningly But at a certain point isn t it only human to want to engage this man You don t need to play Mike Wallace and demolish Leuchter on camera You could just ask him what he makes of say van Pelt s assertion that the answer to the riddle of the gas chambers was all over the archives or what he thought of the chemist s declaration that the test performed for cyanide was the wrong test Morris can be heard asking one question only Have you ever thought you might be wrong or that you made a mistake sufficiently broad that Leuchter can casually affirm his own inanity My concern here isn t so much for Leuchter or even the Holocaust revisionists who ll just think he was sandbagged The problem is that when a documentary filmmaker seems too scared or cool or arty to violate his own immaculate aesthetic he ends up weakening his case He also provides no emotional release which isn t a small matter when the subject is Holocaust denial Morris was close enough to Leuchter to have gotten something more to have gone a little deeper in search of a poison that does penetrate surfaces
