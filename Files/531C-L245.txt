the third sector is essential to our American way of      life And indeed it is      Unfortunately our view of the importance of philanthropy is not      shared by all Americans Many see philanthropy as no more than the grand      gestures of the rich      They do not understand as we do that the museums parks hospitals      and community organizations supported by philanthropy are the      cornerstones of our very quality of life They do not realize that right      now voluntary associations are helping to address some of the most      troubling social issues of our time including homelessness crime and      drug and alcohol abuse      Perhaps most important few comprehend that the perpetuation      Indianapolis Indiana of our diverse tradition of giving caring and      serving carried out every day by Americans from all walks of life is      key to the present and future vitality of our nation      Evidence strongly suggests that this lack of understanding is

  We were founded in  with a major grant from the Lilly Endowment      one of our nations largest and most prestigious private foundations Our      earliest goal was to permeate the intellectual consciousness of the      eight campuses of Indiana University and establish philanthropy as a      serious field of study      Today we have accomplished all this and much more Currently the      university lists more than  courses in philanthropic studies that touch      on a wide range of disciplines including the law sociology and the      humanities      We also have a groundbreaking Master of Arts in Philanthropic Studies      program and are developing a doctoral degree in the field Whats more      over  professors lecturers and other distinguished scholars from      around the
