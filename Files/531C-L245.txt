 July 1994 Name Address City ST Zip The National Board of Visitors cordially invites you to become a Charter Associate of The Center on Philanthropy Dear Name I need your immediate help today to save a tradition a uniquely American tradition that has flourished in this country for hundreds of years a living tradition of voluntary action for the public good known as philanthropy I look to you because you are among the few who have an outstanding commitment to philanthropy a commitment based on your personal conviction that the third sector is essential to our American way of life And indeed it is Unfortunately our view of the importance of philanthropy is not shared by all Americans Many see philanthropy as no more than the grand gestures of the rich They do not understand as we do that the museums parks hospitals and community organizations supported by philanthropy are the cornerstones of our very quality of life They do not realize that right now voluntary associations are helping to address some of the most troubling social issues of our time including homelessness crime and drug and alcohol abuse Perhaps most important few comprehend that the perpetuation Indianapolis Indiana of our diverse tradition of giving caring and serving carried out every day by Americans from all walks of life is key to the present and future vitality of our nation Evidence strongly suggests that this lack of understanding is undermining young people s commitment to philanthropy today which will devastate tomorrow s not for profit organizations institutions and causes We cannot let our rich philanthropic heritage a vast sector that now includes more than a million organizations and a hundred million volunteers be placed in jeopardy It is critical that we educate Americans about the importance of Philanthropy that we develop a new generation of informed and committed leaders To do all this we need a place where philanthropy can be explored by students scholars and practitioners as a serious academic field This is why the Indiana University Center on Philanthropy was founded and why I am writing to seek you support of our mission today We want you as a true

more about our work and our achievements THE LILLY ENDOWMENT CHALLENGE We were founded in 1987 with a major grant from the Lilly Endowment one of our nation s largest and most prestigious private foundations Our earliest goal was to permeate the intellectual consciousness of the eight campuses of Indiana University and establish philanthropy as a serious field of study Today we have accomplished all this and much more Currently the university lists more than 50 courses in philanthropic studies that touch on a wide range of disciplines including the law sociology and the humanities We also have a groundbreaking Master of Arts in Philanthropic Studies program and are developing a doctoral degree in the field What s more over 200 professors lecturers and other distinguished scholars from around the world participate in Center sponsored courses conferences symposia and research programs designed to enrich our understanding of the vitality of our philanthropic tradition More than 1 000 individuals and some 1 000 organizations participate annually in courses and workshops offered by the Center s Fund Raising School the only national university based fund raising training program with an international reputation for helping organizations become leaders in ethical fund raising REACHING OUT TO AMERICA Developing a new generation of informed and committed leaders in philanthropy is in fact one of the Center s highest priorities That is why we have just introduced an exciting new program called Leadership Works Co sponsored by the National Association for Community Leadership the program is designed to help volunteer leaders learn fund raising skills and better appreciate their work as part of our philanthropic tradition We are well aware that the ultimate importance of the study of philanthropy is found outside the walls of the academy That is why this national initiative is now being launched in six Midwestern cities It is part of the Center s effort to serve the needs of communities directly by training those who are responsible for sustaining philanthropy at the grassroots This is but one of many projects we envision as we work to develop the next generation of philanthropic leaders and take the Center s core mission out into communities across our country Because if you and I truly want to preserve philanthropy as a
