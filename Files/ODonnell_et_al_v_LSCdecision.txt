BURLING Washington D C Paul R Thomson Jr WOODS ROGERS HAZLE GROVE P L C Roanoke Virginia for Appellees Unpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit See Local Rule 36 c OPINION PER CURIAM Client Centered Legal Services of Southwest Virginia Incorporated and Hugh F O Donnell its executive director collectively CCLS appeal an order of the district court granting judgment in favor of the Legal Services Corporation and two of its officers collectively the LSC on CCLS s claims that various actions by the LSC exceeded its statutory and regulatory authority For the reasons set forth below we conclude that Congress has not authorized judicial review of these claims We therefore vacate and remand with instructions to dismiss I In 1974 Congress enacted the Legal Service Corporation Act LSCA which created the LSC for the purpose of providing legal assistance to indigent people in civil matters See 42 U S C A 2996 West 1994 The LSC does not itself provide legal services but rather grants federal funds to legal services programs across the country CCLS which provides legal services to indigent people in the coalfields region of southwestern Virginia has been an LSC grantee since 1980 O DONNELL v EIDLEMAN This litigation involves CCLS s challenge to certain actions taken by the LSC in connection with the LSC s consolidation of services areas undertaken as a cost cutting measure and implementation of a competitive bidding program for grant money Following a bench trial the district court rejected CCLS s claims on the merits II In our recent decision in Regional Management Corp v Legal Services Corp 186 F 3d 457 4th Cir 1999 we concluded that a decision by the LSC regarding certain lobbying practices by grant recipients was not subject to judicial review in an action by a lender claiming injury as a result of such lobbying See Reg l Mgmt 186 F 3d at 461 64 First we concluded that the LSC is not a federal agency for purposes of judicial review under the Administrative Procedures Act See id at 462 Second we held that the LSCA did not explicitly authorize a private right of action against the LSC See id Finally we determined that there was no basis for finding that Congress intended to create an implied private right of action against the LSC Id In determining that Congress did not implicitly establish a right of action we considered the four factors set forth in Cort v Ash 422 U S 66 78 1975 internal quotation marks omitted 1 whether the plaintiff is one of the class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted 2 whether there is any indication of legislative intent explicit or implicit either to create such a remedy or to deny one 3 whether it is consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy and 4 whether the cause of action is one traditionally relegated to state law in an area basically the concern of the States so that it would be inappropriate to infer a cause of action based solely on federal law We determined that the first Cort factor was controlling Lenders affected by the lobbying activities of LSC grantees were not part of any special class to be benefitted by the LSCA Reg l Mgmt 186 F 3d at 463 internal quotation marks omitted Rather we noted that Congress specifically intended the LSCA to benefit indigents who have legal grievances but who are unable to afford the legal means necessary to redress them Id internal quotation marks omitted O DONNELL v EIDLEMAN The reasoning of Regional Management is controlling here As we held in Regional Management the LSCA was intended by Congress for the especial benefit of indigent persons in need of legal services Although legal services programs such as CCLS are an integral part of the process of delivering those services the programs themselves are not the beneficiaries of the Act Because CCLS is not part of the class Congress sought to benefit in enacting the LSCA we must conclude that Congress did not intend to imply a private cause of action by CCLS to challenge the LSC s exercise of its statutory and regulatory duties III For the reasons set forth above we conclude that the district court was without authority to review the actions of the LSC Accordingly we vacate the order of the district court and remand with instructions to dismiss VACATED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS We note that three other circuits have concluded that rational basis judicial review is available for decisions of the LSC that affect grantees See Tex Rural Legal Aid Inc v Legal Servs Corp 940 F 2d 685 697 D C Cir 1991 San Juan Legal Servs Inc v Legal Servs Corp 655 F 2d 434 438 39 1st Cir 1981 Spokane County Legal Servs Inc v Legal Servs Corp 614 F 2d 662 668 69 9th Cir 1980 We find these cases distinguishable for the reasons stated in Regional Management See Reg l Mgmt 186 F 3d at 464
