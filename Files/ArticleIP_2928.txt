 The Order of Things Two summer shows side by side at the Museum of Modern Art introduce little known figures with close ties to the Abstract Expressionist generation Enter Door No 1 and you re inside the strange spider web and polka dot domain of Yayoi Kusama a flamboyant Japanese artist who worked in New York during the 60s Choose Door No 2 and make yourself at home in the American sculptor Tony Smith s more austere but equally odd architectural spaces These are smallish intense shows that aim as curator Robert Storr writes in the Smith catalog to whet the appetite of the general public Viewed together they reveal surprising affinities between two versatile and ambitious artists whose early childhood traumas inspired them to try to redesign the world Kusama the lesser known of the two is the more accessible and eye catching artist and the more in tune with our time Born in 1929 in Tokyo as a child Kusama suffered from hallucinations that she was being overwhelmed by proliferating dots and nets Obsessive repetitive patterns entered her work early on Determined to take New York by storm she wrote to Georgia O Keeffe a female artist who had succeeded in the male dominated New York art world for advice O Keeffe initially puzzled by the young Japanese artist s ambitions told her to show her work to anyone willing to look at it Kusama arrived in 1958 with a couple of thousand small drawings and watercolors mainly of O Keeffe like multiseeded flowers in vibrant colors Looking down from the top of the Empire State Building at the crowds below Kusama realized that she needed to do something more spectacular like a bomb she said if she wanted to attract notice She extended the net patterns of the flowers across huge canvases creating the white on white Infinity Net paintings that remain among her most beautiful creations and along with color variants were favorably compared at the time to the decentered allover paintings of Jackson Pollock 1960 By 1961 Kusama had begun covering familiar objects an armchair a stepladder a rowboat with carefully sewn phalluses 1962 These monochrome accumulations as repetitively patterned as the infinity nets have a deadpan wit quite different from Claes Oldenburg s squishily theatrical hamburgers and lipsticks with which they were sometimes shown in early Pop Art exhibitions Like the polka dots the proliferating penises were according to Kusama an attempt to contain her fears by representing them I was scared of penises she blandly remarked at the press opening Kusama s 1964 affair with Joseph Cornell documented in Utopia Parkway Deborah Solomon s recent biography of Cornell has a peculiar aptness The man terrified of women who enclosed movie goddesses and ballerinas in little fantasy boxes and nicknamed Kusama You you I meets the woman scared of men A kindred ambivalence marks Kusama s Food Obsession sculptures inspired she claimed by the image of all the food a person consumes in a lifetime passing by on a conveyor belt Kusama s pasta encrusted clothing may have a link as curator Lynn Zelevansky suggests with eating disorders which were barely discussed at the time But such objects as the bronzed 1965 have a mod glamour undiminished by the passage of time By the mid 60s Kusama was experimenting with ways to insert her own image into her work She had herself photographed nude except for high heels and polka dot stickers then superimposed the image over one of her accumulations of phalluses In such works she seemed to be toying with male expectations of the Asian femme fatale By the late 60s Kusama had turned from these ambiguous engagements with the male gaze to more attention grabbing performances In 1968 she staged well publicized nude ins at MoMA s sculpture garden and at such Vietnam War era hotspots as the Board of Elections A 1967 film called Kusama s Self Obliteration on view in a side gallery at MoMA gives a sense of what these occasions may have felt like Kusama clothed in a kimono dabs paint on her nude models who begin to dance in comic self consciousness then escalate to a loud acid rock soundtrack into orgy Kusama s performance pieces always ended the same way with the arrival of the cops They got her on the cover of the New York tabloids but they didn t pay the rent Her paintings and sculptures with their use of body parts and food anticipate the work of such current artists as Cindy Sherman and Kiki Smith Tony Smith s daughter but they failed to attract the financial and institutional backing Kusama needed She remained desperately poor during her New York sojourn another reason perhaps for her obsession with food and returned to Japan in 1973 where she lives by her own choice in a Tokyo mental hospital that has a special emphasis on art therapy Today Kusama is a cult figure in the Japanese avant garde recognized not only for her art but for her novels as well gothic fables of sexual violence set in New York with titles like The Hustler s Grotto of Christopher Street which ends with a suicidal leap from the Empire State Building and The Burning of St Mark s Church Tony Smith less well known than his drinking buddies Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko is nonetheless hardly obscure His sculptures of the last two decades of his life he died of a heart attack in 1980 at the age of 68 look perfectly at home in MoMA s sculpture garden Maillol s nude Picasso s goat and the other sculptures that Kusama s nude minions cavorted among have been put into storage Smith s 1964 a black steel monster two stories high reigns in their place Smith liked to joke that his career architect painter sculptor followed the initials of his name Anthony Peter Smith He came to sculpture late but the ambition to reshape the world was there from the start reaching back as in Kusama s case to childhood trauma Born in New Jersey in 1912 Smith was the grandson of the designer of the standard fire hydrant and grew up among engineers such as his father He contracted tuberculosis at about age 4 and for several years lived alone in a little prefabricated house in the backyard so the rest of the family would be protected from contagion The previous year during a family trip to the world s fair in San Francisco Smith had seen an installation of Pueblo Indian cliff dwellings Back home in his quarantine shack he spent long hours fashioning pueblos out of medicine boxes and covering them with papier m ch adobe Such primitivizing fantasies made him particularly well suited when he was groping for a profession to the organic architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright with whom Smith studied and worked during the late 30s Smith s 15 or so completed buildings mostly houses are obviously indebted to Wright in their light filled eaves and open geometrical forms The three interlocked buildings of the circa 1951 are daringly deployed in a pentagonal form across the rocky hillside of Connecticut coastal bluffs Architecture didn t give Smith the control he wanted changes to the Olsen compound in particular depressed him An ambitious plan for a hexagonally based church raised above the ground on stilts and with stained glass windows by Pollock came to nothing When his wife s opera career took her to Europe in 1953 Smith went along and took his sketchbooks There he hit on a pattern based on circles in a grid which he called after a geological formation near Bayreuth Germany the Louisenberg series Storr makes large claims for these paintings seeing them as the first successful attempt to systematize the allover painting invented by Pollock and Rothko The art critic Lucy Lippard discerned a different impetus in these buoyant pictures labeling the peanut shaped forms as testicular a sign Storr adds of the ballsy ethos of Smith s generation of male artists Back in the States Smith as interested in nets and grids as Kusama worked up his geometrical patterns into three dimensions thus returning in a sense to his architectural roots 1961 currently placed as a sort of triumphal entryway to the southeast corner of Central Park demonstrates the unsettling possibilities of tetrahedral shapes where the triangular faces have a dynamic lightness lacking in rectangularly based structures The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation has helpfully added a note that the work is not intended to promote cigarette smoking A polymath and an autodidact with no degree beyond high school Smith had too many ideas The sexual pulse of a lot of his objects There is something erotic in all my work Smith admitted is evident in loud titles for sculptures like She Who Must Be Obeyed and Jim s Piece He constructed almost as many phallic shapes as Kusama and filled his notebooks with erotic doodlings comparing the sex organs of humans and flowers or depicting Christ Smith was a Catholic with breasts Smith s political ideas are more elusive He adopted an upbeat American organicism derived from Henry David Thoreau and Walt Whitman There s nothing on record as far as I know to link him to his mentor Wright s notorious sympathy for Hitler and fascism But some of Smith s doodles and offhand remarks give one pause One of the drawings on view at MoMA is a diagram of the races with the Jews identified as circumscised sic cut off from Earth In another drawing from 1943 Smith develops his personal symbol the spiral cross which is really nothing but a relaxed swastika Traveling in Germany after the war he felt an uneasy admiration for Hitler s Haus der Kunst exhibition hall in Munich As you may have guessed he wrote to the painter Barnett Newman the thing as a whole was very like the church design I sent you and for Albert Speer s gigantic stadium at Nuremberg Such remarks inspire Storr s rather defensive observation that unlike fascist art and architecture Smith s sculptures and buildings were insistently built to human rather than superhuman scale It may be that grandiose schemes for redesigning society inevitably flirt with repressive politics Or perhaps the New York art world in which Kusama ran aground required such a tough guy mentality to survive Either way Smith s work unlike Kusama s seems locked into its time The inflexible architect leaves behind a whiff of Ayn Rand his twisted metal hulks suggest the ruins of uninhabitable places Walking through Smith s fantasy world of black steel I found myself drawn to some of his softer more tentative objects like the handmade plaster web called Wingbone from his daughter Kiki s collection or a pencil sketch of confused sperm tangled up in a traffic jam with the caption Will Jackson Pollock affect our cars These it occurred to me had the Kusama touch anarchic whimsical looking for a perch to call home
