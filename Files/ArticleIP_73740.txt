___________ Send your answer by noon ET Wednesday to newsquiz slate com Monday s Question No 372 Stakes Sauce Sunday s contests determined that the Tennessee Titans will face the St Louis Rams in

Jon Hotchkiss Beats me Does incest count as a product Tim Carvell Click for more answers Randy s Wrap Up To quiz participants the structure that symbolizes Nashville is of course the Grand Ole Opry and the structure that symbolizes St Louis is the 12 ounce Budweiser beer can not the Arch which was mentioned only a few times Nashville has its own failed attempt at a symbolic structure None of you referred to the life size model of the Parthenon located in Centennial Park or to the life size model of a Jew so beloved by school children in the city s Natural History Museum The diorama is wonderful The Torah and roasting Christian baby are incredibly lifelike The Opry succeeds where the Arch and Parthenon fail because it is not merely a tourist attraction but a vibrant part of the city s life with a genuine if regrettable purpose as a performance space for country music while these latter two are self conscious attempts to construct a symbol So the lesson is Empire State Building good Space Needle bad The Washington Monument the Lincoln Memorial and their ilk seem to be exceptions to this rule being evocative symbols of the capital but lacking apparent utility However the Lincoln Memorial is not a cheap bit of chamber of commerce boosterism it is a genuine attempt to honor the 16 th president just as the Washington Monument is meant to inspire penis jokes about presidents judges and former U S senators eager to pick up a quick buck and so to unite a nation Inadequately Researched Answer I found no stories about mayoral wagering of local products I mourn the lost clich s of labored regionalism and my own inability to figure out these search engine thingies However for traditional money gamblers St Louis is an 8 point favorite the over and under bet is 48 1 2 About 80 percent of the action will be on which team wins but Vegas bookmakers offer more than 200 wagering options including Player to Score First Touchdown Eddie George Titans is the 9 2 favorite the Double Result a bet on who s ahead at the half and at the end you can have Tennessee at the half and St Louis at the end at 7 2 who scores first and who wins the game you can take the Rams both ways at 5 6 What player gets arrested for a felony during the actual game Marshall Faulk Rams is a long shot at 20 1 The odds are 50 1 against this last bet actually being offered in Vegas
