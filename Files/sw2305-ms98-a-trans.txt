        okay um well the first thing uh what do you think you would offer as far as uh uh information about selecting a school   well first i think theyve got to have a pretty good idea of what they want to what they want to do uh once they have that then they can start looking in   uhhuh   all the various publications that give out all the information about schools and write to the schools themselves and start finding out about the different requirements for the programs and what kind of uh of job assistance and all that other kind of stuff they offer   yeah uh do you do you feel that the first two years that the um depending upon the field i know there are some fields which a person should go to the school that school all four years but i know there are some fields where its really not necessary   yeah a lot fields are most of your liberal arts degrees and stuff arent really concerned with your first two years anyway its its your core education your general requirements general education requirements um   uhhuh   if you know if they want to get a liberal arts degree i dont i dont know what advice id give them go to the school youd like to go to  thats what i did     yeah   i didnt care about the program or anything else i went where i wanted to go   yeah yeah what was your degree in   uh political science   political science oh okay well  i know i know im going to school right now and uh i have a friend uh UTD University of Texas Dallas   where are you at well yeah i guess everybodys in Dallas that i talk to im in north Carolina   i know well thats where Texas Instruments is   yeah right   um something that i i think that ive noticed that i i have a friend i think if youre going into like uh law or medicine a very particular very specific field even even engineering you can get you can meet a lot of the requirements at a public um institution   sure   and uh its a lot cheaper my parents my parents made a mistake in uh in sending my sister to a private institution for the first two years   oh yeah um   and she found out after that she said you know my parents they just they really wasted a lot of money this is about twenty years ago but uh   uhhuh   well right now i just i mean as far as selecting selecting a school i i i feel that uh a lot of it depends upon the major   yeah it does Um i didnt know what i wanted to do after i got my my degree um originally i had planned   uhhuh   uh undergrad degree in political science and then a masters in public administration And i went ahead and pursued that i i got as far as the thesis and decided To hell with it i didnt want it   umhum   Um and from that point i went to law school and after a year and a half of that i decided i didnt want that either  havent figured out what i want to be when i grow up     uhhuh   okay yeah   and so but i i i really did enjoy the law i mean thats thats where i wanted to be but i didnt want to go through the uh the hassle that the law schools put you through because i never did want to be a practicing attorney i just wanted a law degree   uhhuh   and ive since discovered that i would be far better off being in the paralegal field because thats the nuts and bolts of the law and thats what i like   yeah   and you dont have to put up with all the B S that the lawyers have to so thats thats what im pursuing right now   right   and im pretty happy with it so far   um yeah yeah im im pursuing what they whats whats called an interdisciplinary field im a speech therapy major and fortunately i have a lot of i have a good medical background and   uhhuh yeah thats probably very useful   yeah its its actually turning out to be more more useful than what i thought and um i also have a good languages background linguistics   uhhuh uhhuh   and some psychology so its all working together the only field im not familiar with really is education which is required as well it requires about four or five different fields really   yeah oh good grief   so its a   yeah i thought at one time i wanted to be a teacher but i i quickly dispelled that idea when i became a substitute teacher for a while just to get my feet wet i said uh i couldnt do this everyday no way   uhhuh     maybe maybe being a tenured professor would be one thing but being a public school teacher is entirely another thing   um oh so you are a disgruntled graduate student   i am a disgruntled i am i am just a disgruntled person all around  im the uh im the uh original uh mister Scrooge i guess   oh   yeah bah humbug   yeah bah humbug Yeah i just   i i i think yeah there is i i i think uh law would be a fine field a fine profession fine field to go into um i know one time i was in a political science class and you know talking about fields people going into different fields i made an off off the cuff remark about lawyers about their integrity being questionable and i mean oh that was like a can of worms  no   probably you probably got everybody on you because they were probably all going to law school   no there was a woman she said  my my best friends are lawyers and you know all this and it was just   well that remark in itself is a slam My best friends are lawyers you know like like uh my best friends are blacks   yeah i know it was or or Jewish it used to be Jewish you know   jewish now blacks and i guess i i guess Iraqi now is the   yeah i know it but   law law was a lot of fun until you get to law school and it doesnt become fun anymore   yeah yeah i have a  i have a friend shes studying shes going into law another friend going into law and that shes i i im really im really concerned about you know shes just going to be       you know whats going to happen when she gets there you know all of her dreams will be dispelled   yeah you going oh yeah Yeah if if if youve ever seen the program paper chase its very much like that except worse   yeah yeah its i i think its probably more embarrassing and very painful i i see i see that happening   it is yeah very much so yeah its its a lot of that Um it it was enjoyable for a while   yeah   um but its such a grind and you begin to wonder you know if if im not i mean you really have to be dead set on being a lawyer   yeah   to do it if you have any doubts whatsoever you better not get into it i mean i wasted a year and a half of awfully hard and i aged ten years   uhhuh umhum uhhuh   but i i i wouldnt trade the experience for anything in the world It never hurts to have some kind of a grounding in law     yeah i i went to a language school and and that was a it was a an i guess uh  United States Institution it was i was military at the time and i i think probably the biggest huh   what branch were you in what branch were you in i was too   i was in the Air Force yeah yeah for myself i mean i think that military experience was fine it was just i just wish that there was something else that that that i could have done you know with   yeah yeah well i got i got tired of the service after a while i mean it i had a terrific job really enjoyed it uh command post   yeah yeah uh i was i was a linguist   i was just wondering were you in SAC by any chance were you in SAC   hum in TAC   SAC   uh no i wasnt   oh okay i i thought maybe you might have had some experience with the uh R C one thirty fives   no no i didnt i didnt go flight crew matter of fact i didnt make it completely through that through that field i was i was in intelligence school and about three weeks short   oh   i didnt make it i sort of washed out   well thats   yeah after about eighteen months of talking about the year and a half training you know its its something you know i think thats why you know children really need to   uhhuh   think about the field theyre going to going into and i mean spend a lot of serious reading before they i mean not just thinking about they actually should do some reading and they should study it   yeah yeah thats right and it and if its possible even get some experience at it or at least watch some people do it   yeah i i i i think i think theres a lot to be said for kids working after school i mean they they find out whether just how much of a people person they are   uhhuh sure thats true i found that out when i was in high school i worked at McDonalds   yeah oh and i tell you what i worked at McDonalds as well and i i can tell you one thing there are just some people that i you know you just came to the point where i mean and oh i eventually worked in a lab in a lab as a lab technician and i worked front desk and i mean somebody could walk in the door and i knew exactly what they were going to do and say   yeah yeah i was the same way too im not a people person i i i hate um having to play such a nice guy you know especially when its all phony especially when you got some uh jerk coming in   yeah umhum   i its just not for me im uh i deal much better in research and books and stuff like that   uhhuh   which is why im going to enjoy the paralegal field a lot   umhum yeah thats good i was just wondering um getting back to the school thing so i mean i i i almost wish that there was some
