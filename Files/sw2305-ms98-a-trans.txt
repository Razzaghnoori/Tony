 okay um well the first thing uh what do you think you would offer as far as uh uh information about selecting a school well first i think they ve got to have a pretty good idea of what they want to what they want to do uh once they have that then they can start looking in uh huh all the various publications that give out all the information about schools and write to the schools themselves and start finding out about the different requirements for the programs and what kind of uh of job assistance and all that other kind of stuff they offer yeah uh do you do you feel that the first two years that the um depending upon the field i know there are some fields which a person should go to the school that school all four years but i know there are some fields where it s really not necessary yeah a lot fields are most of your liberal arts degrees and stuff aren t really concerned with your first two years anyway it s it s your core education your general requirements general education requirements um uh huh if you know if they want to get a liberal arts degree i don t i don t know what advice i d give them go to the school you d like to go to that s what i did yeah i didn t care about the program or anything else i went where i wanted to go yeah yeah what was your degree in uh political science political science oh okay well i know i know i m going to school right now and uh i have a friend uh UTD University of Texas Dallas where are you at well yeah i guess everybody s in Dallas that i talk to i m in north Carolina i know well that s where Texas Instruments is yeah right um something that i i think that i ve noticed that i i have a friend i think if you re going into like uh law or medicine a very particular very specific field even even engineering you can get you can meet a lot of the requirements at a public um institution sure and uh it s a lot cheaper my parents my parents made a mistake in uh in sending my sister to a private institution for the first two years oh yeah um and she found out after that she said you know my parents they just they really wasted a lot of money this is about twenty years ago but uh uh huh well right now i just i mean as far as selecting selecting a school i i i feel that uh a lot of it depends upon the major yeah it does Um i didn t know what i wanted to do after i got my my degree um originally i had planned uh huh uh undergrad degree in political science and then a master s in public administration And i went ahead and pursued that i i got as far as the thesis and decided To hell with it i didn t want it um hum Um and from that point i went to law school and after a year and a half of that i decided i didn t want that either haven t figured out what i want to be when i grow up uh huh okay yeah and so but i i i really did enjoy the law i mean that s that s where i wanted to be but i didn t want to go through the uh the hassle that the law schools put you through because i never did want to be a practicing attorney i just wanted a law degree uh huh and i ve since discovered that i would be far better off being in the paralegal field because that s the nuts and bolts of the law and that s what i like yeah and you don t have to put up with all the B S that the lawyers have to so that s that s what i m pursuing right now right and i m pretty happy with it so far um yeah yeah i m i m pursuing what they what s what s called an interdisciplinary field i m a speech therapy major and fortunately i have a lot of i have a good medical background and uh huh yeah that s probably very useful yeah it s it s actually turning out to be more more useful than what i thought and um i also have a good languages background linguistics uh huh uh huh and some psychology so it s all working together the only field i m not familiar with really is education which is required as well it requires about four or five different fields really yeah oh good grief so it s a yeah i thought at one time i wanted to be a teacher but i i quickly dispelled that idea when i became a substitute teacher for a while just to get my feet wet i said uh i couldn t do this everyday no way uh huh maybe maybe being a tenured professor would be one thing but being a public school teacher is entirely another thing um oh so you are a disgruntled graduate student i am a disgruntled i am i am just a disgruntled person all around i m the uh i m the uh original uh mister Scrooge i guess oh yeah bah humbug yeah bah humbug Yeah i just i i i think yeah there is i i i think uh law would be a fine field a fine profession fine field to go into um i know one time i was in a political science class and you know talking about fields people going into different fields i made an off off the cuff remark about lawyers about their integrity being questionable and i mean oh that was like a can of worms no probably you probably got everybody on you because they were probably all going to law school no there was a woman she said my my best friends are lawyers and you know all this and it was just well that remark in itself is a slam My best friends are lawyers you know like like uh my best friends are blacks yeah i know it was or or Jewish it used to be Jewish you know jewish now blacks and i guess i i guess Iraqi now is the yeah i know it but law law was a lot of fun until you get to law school and it doesn t become fun anymore yeah yeah i have a i have a friend she s studying she s going into law another friend going into law and that she s i i i m really i m really concerned about you know she s just going to be you know what s going to happen when she gets there you know all of her dreams will be dispelled yeah you going oh yeah Yeah if if if you ve ever seen the program paper chase it s very much like that except worse yeah yeah it s i i think it s probably more embarrassing and very painful i i see i see that happening it is yeah very much so yeah it s it s a lot of that Um it it was enjoyable for a while yeah um but it s such a grind and you begin to wonder you know if if i m not i mean you really have to be dead set on being a lawyer yeah to do it if you have any doubts whatsoever you better not get into it i mean i wasted a year and a half of awfully hard and i aged ten years uh huh um hum uh huh but i i i wouldn t trade the experience for anything in the world It never hurts to have some kind of a grounding in law yeah i i went to a language school and and that was a it was a an i guess uh United States Institution it was i was military at the time and i i think probably the biggest huh what branch were you in what branch were you in i was too i was in the Air Force yeah yeah for myself i mean i think that military experience was fine it was just i just wish that there was something else that that that i could have done you know with yeah yeah well i got i got tired of the service after a while i mean it i had a terrific job really enjoyed it uh command post yeah yeah uh i was i was a linguist i was just wondering were you in SAC by any chance were you in SAC hum in TAC SAC uh no i wasn t oh okay i i thought maybe you might have had some experience with the uh R C one thirty fives no no i didn t i didn t go flight crew matter of fact i didn t make it completely through that through that field i was i was in intelligence school and about three weeks short oh i didn t make it i sort of washed out well that s yeah after about eighteen months of talking about the year and a half training you know it s it s something you know i think that s why you know children really need to uh huh think about the field they re going to going into and i mean spend a lot of serious reading before they i mean not just thinking about they actually should do some reading and they should study it yeah yeah that s right and it and if it s possible even get some experience at it or at least watch some people do it yeah i i i i think i think there s a lot to be said for kids working after school i mean they they find out whether just how much of a people person they are uh huh sure that s true i found that out when i was in high school i worked at McDonald s yeah oh and i tell you what i worked at McDonald s as well and i i can tell you one thing there are just some people that i you know you just came to the point where i mean and oh i eventually worked in a lab in a lab as a lab technician and i worked front desk and i mean somebody could walk in the door and i knew exactly what they were going to do and say yeah yeah i was the same way too i m not a people person i i i hate um having to play such a nice guy you know especially when it s all phony especially when you got some uh jerk coming in yeah um hum i it s just not for me i m uh i deal much better in research and books and stuff like that uh huh which is why i m going to enjoy the paralegal field a lot um hum yeah that s good i was just wondering um getting back to the school thing so i mean i i i almost wish that there was some
