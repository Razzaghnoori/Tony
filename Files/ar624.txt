 Introduction Autoreactive T cells are primarily eliminated in the thymus by negative selection central tolerance Some of the autoreactive T cells however may escape from negative selection and are released into the periphery These self reactive T cells are exquisitely regulated and their activation can result in autoimmune diseases There is accumulating evidence that in addition to activation induced cell death or anergy T cell mediated dominant control of self reactive T cells represents one mechanism for maintaining immunological tolerance 1 2 3 Studies conducted in a number of experimental models have demonstrated the existence of regulatory T cell subsets that prevent activation of autoreactive T cells Recently a subset of CD4 T cells was identified that is present on 5 10 of CD4 T cells in normal na ve mice and expresses CD25 the chain of IL 2 receptor 4 5 Functional analysis of murine CD4 CD25 T cells showed that those cells which constitutively express cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen CTLA 4 6 7 8 fail to proliferate or secret cytokines in response to polyclonal or antigen specific stimulation but inhibit the activation of conventional responsive T cells 1 2 3 8 9 The suppressive activity of the CD4 CD25 T cells depends on signaling via the negative regulator of T cell activation CTLA 4 7 and requires a cell cell interaction that possibly involves cell surface bound transforming growth factor TGF 1 1 10 It has been shown that B7 CD28 costimulation is essential for the development and homeostasis of the CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells 6 which play critical roles not only in preventing autoimmunity but also in controlling tumor immunity and transplantation tolerance 2 11 Proteoglycan induced arthritis PGIA is a novel autoimmune murine model that is induced by systemic immunization of BALB c mice with cartilage proteoglycans 12 13 The development of PGIA is based on the cross reactive immune response between immunizing human and mouse self cartilage proteoglycans in genetically susceptible BALB c mice 12 13 Several lines of evidence indicate T cell involvement in the pathogenesis of PGIA First CD4 T cells selectively proliferate in response to proteoglycan antigens 14 Second prevention of arthritis can be achieved by in vivo treatment with anti CD4 monoclonal antibodies 15 Third arthritis can be transferred to na ve BALB c or severe combined immunodeficient SCID mice using T and B cells from arthritic animals 16 17 18 Fourth a proteoglycan specific T cell hybridoma T helper 1 type can induce arthritis in BALB c mice 19 Finally CD4 T cells from arthritic animals are resistant to activation induced cell death 20 These data suggest a breakdown of peripheral tolerance and accumulation of autoreactive T cells in the periphery In order to determine whether CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells play a role in the development of PGIA we monitored the CD4 CD25 expressing regulatory T cells in mice with PGIA during an entire immunization period We also transferred purified CD4 CD25 T cells from na ve BALB c mice together with spleen cells from arthritic animals or alternatively transferred CD4 CD25 depleted spleen cells from arthritic animals into SCID mice and then monitored disease development in SCID mice In addition we examined disease incidence in CD28 deficient mice which have deficiency in CD4 CD25 T cells Our data suggest that the CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells might not be essential for controlling the development of PGIA Materials and methods Antigen mice and immunization High density cartilage proteoglycan aggrecan was purified from human cartilage by CsCl gradient centrifugation and depleted of glycosaminoglycan side chains as described previously 21 Female BALB c mice National Cancer Institute Friedrich MD USA or The Jackson Laboratory Bar Harbor ME USA and CD28 deficient mice The Jackson Laboratory were immunized intraperitoneally with cartilage proteoglycan 100 g protein in complete Freund s adjuvant on day 0 and boosted with proteoglycan in incomplete Freund s adjuvant on days 21 and 42 Female SCID mice on a BALB c background NCI NCrC B 17 scid scid aged 8 12 weeks or young retired breeders were purchased from the National Cancer Institute and maintained under germ free conditions Assessment of arthritis A standard scoring system based on swelling and redness of each paw was used for the assessment of the severity of disease The first clinical symptom of swelling was recorded as the time of onset of arthritis Joint swelling was scored ranging from 0 to 4 in each paw and expressed as acute cumulative arthritis score resulting in a possible maximum severity score of 16 Typically in the primary form of PGIA BALB c mice developed swelling and redness in one or more limbs 7 14 days after the third injection with proteoglycan and adjuvant In the transfer system recipient SCID mice developed a more uniform disease from day 10 after transfer with involvement of nearly all peripheral joints Flow cytometry analysis The CD4 CD25 expressing T cells were identified by staining spleen cells with fluorescein isothiocyanate FITC labeled anti CD4 and biotin labeled anti CD25 followed by CyChrome labeled streptavidin BD PharMingen San Diego CA USA and analyzed on a flow cytometer Beckton Dickinson San Jose CA USA For analysis of intracellular CTLA 4 spleen cells were first stained with the above fluorescence labeled antibodies fixed and rendered permeable and stained with R phycoerythrin PE labeled anti CTLA 4 using a Cytofix Cytoperm kit BD PharMingen Purification of CD4 CD25 and CD4 CD25 T cells and cell transfer in SCID mice The CD4 CD25 T cells were purified using a protocol described previously 6 Briefly CD4 T cells were isolated from spleens of 10 to 12 week old na ve BALB c mice by negative selection using CD4 enrichment columns R D System Minneapolis MN USA Purified CD4 T cells were incubated with PE labeled anti CD25 and the stained cells were incubated with anti PE microbeads Miltenyi Biotech Inc Auburn CA USA The CD25 cells were selected on an LS column Miltenyi Biotech Inc The purity of the CD4 CD25 T cells was approximately 90 The CD4 CD25 T cells which did not bind to magnetic beads were collected from the flow through the washing steps purity 98 A total of 5 10 5CD4 CD25 or CD4 CD25 T cells were injected intraperitoneally along with 1 10 7spleen cells from arthritic animals that were depleted of CD25 cells and 100 g proteoglycan into SCID mice Depletion of CD4 CD25 T cells and cell transfer Spleen cells from arthritic animals were depleted of CD25 cells using negative selection as described above 0 5 g PE labeled anti CD25 per 1 10 6cells The depletion of CD4 CD25 cells was detected by flow cytometry Typically less than 0 3 of the depleted cells expressed CD25 a total of 1 10 7CD25 and CD25 spleen cells together with 100 g proteoglycan were injected intraperitoneally into SCID mice In vitro suppression assay CD4 CD25 T cells 1 10 4 isolated from na ve BALB c mice were mixed with CD4 CD25 T cells 5 10 4 from arthritic mice in the presence of irradiated syngenic splenocytes as antigen presenting cells 7 5 10 4 with 1 g ml soluble anti CD3 for 3 days or 50 g ml proteoglycan for 5 days and T cell proliferation was determined by 3H thymidine incorporation Measurements of antigen specific T cell responses antibodies and cytokine production Antigen specific T cell responses were measured in quadriplicate samples of spleen cells 3 10 5cells well cultured in the presence of 50 g proteoglycan protein ml T cell proliferation was assessed on day 5 by 3H thymidine incorporation 14 22 Antigen proteoglycan specific interferon IL 10 and IL 4 production by T cells was determined in media collected on day 4 using capture enzyme linked immunosorbent assays ELISAs from BioSource International Inc Camarillo CA USA For induction of TGF 1 spleen cells were cultured in serum free medium X Vivo 20 BioWhittaker Inc Walkersville MD USA in the presence of proteoglycan Total TGF 1 was measured after acidification to activate latent TGF followed by neutralization using an ELISA kit from Promega Madison WI USA Maxisorp immunoplates Nunc Rochester NY USA were coated with human or mouse cartilage proteoglycans 0 1 g protein 100 l per well for ELISA and free binding capacity of the wells was blocked by 1 fat free milk in phosphate buffered saline 23 24 25 Sera were applied at increasing dilutions and isotypes of proteoglycan specific antibodies were determined using peroxidase conjugated rat antimouse IgG 1 or IgG 2a secondary antibodies Zymed South San Francisco CA USA as previously described 24 26 Serum antibody levels were calculated according to mouse IgG 1 and IgG 2a standards Mouse IgG 1 and IgG 2a standards were purified by sepharose coupled protein G from irrelevant non proteoglycan specific monoclonal antibody containing ascites fluids and coated directly onto the microplate s surface Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v7 5 SPSS Chicago IL USA The Mann Whitney and Wilcoxon tests were used for intergroup comparisons P 0 05 was considered statistically significant Results Lack of correlation between development of arthritis and expression of CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells in PGIA To elucidate the role of these regulatory T cells in autoimmune arthritis we first followed up the CD4 CD25 expressing regulatory T cells in mice with PGIA during the entire course of immunization To exclude the possibility that different CD4 CD25 expressing T cells may be a strain and or antigen dependent phenomenon we immunized BALB c mice PGIA susceptible strain and C57BL 6 arthritis resistant strain with human cartilage proteoglycan or ovalbumin As shown in Fig 1 BALB c mice immunized with human cartilage proteoglycan started to develop arthritis after the third injection and the incidence of arthritis reached 100 at day 72 following the third immunization whereas BALB c mice immunized with ovalbumin or C57BL 6 mice immunized with proteoglycan were completely resistant to PGIA The CD4 CD25 expressing T cells detected 14 days after each immunization from each experimental group were similar during the entire course of immunization Fig 2a This observation suggests that the CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells might not be involved in the development of PGIA Although it has been shown that the CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells can suppress the development of autoimmunity a recent report 27 demonstrated that depletion of the CD4 CD25 T cells is necessary but not sufficient for induction of autoimmune gastritis It has been shown that the CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells express CTLA 4 6 7 8 which is a negative regulator of T cell activation The suppressive activity of the CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells may in part be ascribed to signaling through CTLA 4 CTLA 4 may transduce an activating signal to CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells 2 Although we did not detect any significant decrease in numbers of the CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells between proteoglycan immunized BALB c and C57BL 6 mice this might be due to reduced expression of CTLA 4 in the CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells from proteoglycan immunized BALB c mice To test this possibility we then detected CTLA 4 expression on the CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells using intracellular staining There was no significant difference between levels of CTLA 4 expression in the CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells from each group Fig 2b This finding excludes the possibility that reduced expression of CTLA 4 in the CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells from BALB c mice with PGIA may mediate the induction of the disease CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells may not control autoimmune arthritis To further investigate whether the CD4 CD25 T cells play a role in PGIA we performed adoptive transfer experiments using SCID mice as recipients Purified CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells 3 20 10 5 from na ve BALB c mice together with 10 7spleen cells from arthritic mice that were depleted of CD25 T cells and 100 g proteoglycan were injected intraperitoneally into SCID mice 18 and the incidence and severity of disease were monitored Note that we used different ratios of the CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells to the effector cells and we did not observe any suppression of arthritis development As a control the same number of CD4 CD25 T cells together with arthritogenic spleen cells that were depleted of CD25 cells and proteoglycan were also adoptively transferred into SCID mice The transfers of CD4 CD25 T cells did not have any impact on incidence and severity of the disease in SCID mice as compared with transfer of CD4 CD25 T cells Fig 3a suggesting that the CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells did not protect SCID mice from arthritis To further verify these results a depletion experiment was conducted Spleen cells from arthritic animals either depleted of CD25 cells or without depletion were injected into SCID mice together with proteoglycan The incidence and severity of arthritis in SCID mice receiving spleen cells containing CD25 cells or spleen cells depleted of CD25 cells were identical Fig 3b Proteoglycan specific T cell proliferation and production of IL 4 interferon IL 10 TGF 1 and antiproteoglycan autoantibodies were comparable in both transfer groups Fig 3c The inability of the CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells to suppress PGIA was not due to loss of their suppression activity because in vitro the CD4 CD25 T cells could effectively inhibit the proliferation of the CD4 CD25 T cells Fig 3d left panel Interestingly proteoglycan induced proliferation of CD4 CD25 T cells could not be inhibited by the CD4 CD25 T cells Fig 3d right panel which is consistent with a recent report that the effective function of the CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells is T cell receptor TCR specific 28 Collectively our data suggest that the CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells may not be involved in the development of PGIA CD28 deficient mice have severely reduced CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells but are resistant to PGIA It has been shown that CD28 B7 interaction is essential for the homeostasis of the CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells that control autoimmune diabetes 6 Consistent with that report the expression of CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells was found to be significantly reduced as compared with that in wild type BALB c mice Fig 4a To investigate whether a deficiency in the CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells may lead to an increase in the development of PGIA we immunized wild type and CD28 deficient BALB c mice with proteoglycan and disease incidence was monitored In contrast to the report in autoimmune diabetes 6 CD28 deficient BALB c mice were highly resistant to induction of arthritis albeit at a low percentage of the CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells observed in these mice Fig 4b Note that T cells from proteoglycan immunized CD28 deficient mice proliferate in response to proteoglycan stimulation albeit at a rate lower than that in wild type T cells Fig 4c suggesting that CD28 deficient T cells can be effectively primed Discussion A controlled balance between initiation and downregulation of immune responses peripheral tolerance is important for maintaining immune homeostasis whereas dysfunctional immune regulation may lead to chronic inflammation or autoimmunity 29 The CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells have been shown to suppress autoimmunity in several animal models 2 To evaluate the role of the CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells in PGIA three approaches were used First the numbers of the CD4 CD25 cells in spleens of susceptible versus resistant or ovalbumin immunized mice were assessed by flow cytometry at day 14 following immunization No significant change in the numbers of the CD4 CD25 cells was observed among experimental groups tested Fig 2a Moreover the levels of expression of CTLA 4 in the CD4 CD25 cells was similar between groups These data suggest that the CD4 CD25 cells may not be involved in the development of PGIA Although the immune system had been perturbed by immunization CD4 T cells isolated 14 days after immunization of each group did not show significant increase in CD25 expression as compared with that in na ve mice suggesting that T cells activated by immunization had become resting memory T cells To further evaluate the role of the CD4 CD25 cells in PGIA an adoptive transfer system was employed Different ratios of activated effector cells CD25 depleted spleen cells to CD4 CD25 cells were tested in our cotransfer experiments No suppression of development of PGIA in SCID mice was observed Although one could argue that the ratio of effector cells to regulatory cells is not sufficiently great to inhibit disease we tested a wide range of ratios of effector cells to regulatory cells 5 30 1 in our transfer system and similar results were observed We did not observe any inhibition at the ratios used in the present study However we cannot completely exclude the possibility that 1 4 1 ratios may be required for suppression of PGIA In view of the published literature this is unlikely because most studies of this type used ratios greater than 20 1 6 This finding is further supported by the evidence that adoptive transfer of CD25 depleted splenocytes from arthritic mice does not exacerbate disease in SCID mice The CD4 CD25 T cells are functionally normal because the CD4 CD25 cells can significantly inhibit the proliferation of the CD4 CD25 cells induced by TCR stimulation Fig 3d left panel No alteration in IL 10 and TGF production could be detected in two transfer groups Fig 3c Taken together our data suggest that the CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells may not regulate the development of PGIA We found that CD28 deficient mice which have a low frequency of CD4 CD25 T cells are resistant to PGIA Although one may argue that in the absence of CD28 T cell priming by proteoglycan immunization may be defective However CD28 deficient T cells from proteoglycan immunized animals can proliferate in response to proteoglycan stimulation in vitro albeit at a rate lower than that in wild type T cells which is consistent with the report by Oliveira dos Santos et al 30 It has been demonstrated that in the absence of CD28 engagement T cells require very high TCR occupancy and prolonged stimulation whereas CD28 costimulation allows T cells to respond to lower degrees of TCR occupancy 30 31 In support of this observation CD28 mice can still mount immune responses which vary in magnitude and efficiency depending on the antigen or infectious agent 30 32 Our results and those reported by others 30 suggest that CD28 may regulate the threshold for T cell activation In support of this notion immunization of CD28 deficient mice with high concentrations of myelin basic protein induces experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis at similar prevalence and severity as in wild type mice 30 Our data suggest that the CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells might be important for controlling spontaneous models of autoimmunity but not for induced models of autoimmunity In induced models of autoimmunity the CD28 B7 interaction has been shown to regulate disease susceptibility by rendering autoreactive T cells anergic or alternatively by upregulating the threshold for autoreactive T cell activation 30 Furthermore we previously showed that impaired Fas mediated activation induced cell death AICD of autoreactive T helper 1 cells may be responsible for the development of PGIA 20 Therefore AICD and or T cell anergy but not the CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells may be responsible for deletion or inactivation of autoreactive T cells in autoimmune arthritis Conclusion Our results showed that the percentage of the CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells does not change during the development of PGIA The CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells do not protect SCID mice from arthritis when they are cotransferred with spleen cells from arthritic mice and proteoglycan into SCID mice Transfer of spleen cells from arthritic mice depleted of the CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells into SCID mice does not accelerate the disease Furthermore CD28 deficient mice which are deficient for CD4 CD25 T cells are resistant to PGIA Our data suggest that the CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells may not be essential for controlling experimentally induced
