 Easy Answers It is often said that there are no easy answers but in fact there are In a former life I used to interrogate politicians on television and in six years there was never a subject on which they were unable to come up with an easy answer Not necessarily a correct answer or honest or heartfelt or logically coherent but easy What is an easy answer An easy answer for a politician is one that assures you will never be proved wrong Or at least that if you seem to have been wrong another easy answer will be available to explain why you weren t There are no easy answers is itself an easy answer if you can get away with it Often you not only can get away with it but you can also enhance your reputation for being thoughtful high praise that in the culture of politics means indecisive in a classy way rather than kindly or considerate of others or anything like that Sometimes though you have to do better and this is when easy answers become hard work War and peace issues are the worst A famous joke among academics is that scholarly disputes are especially passionate because the stakes are so low By contrast when the stakes are as high as they can get there is a special need for elected officials to avoid having a forthright opinion Easy answers to the rescue The current issue of American military involvement in Kosovo for example seems to be a yes or no question to which either conventional answer call them yes and no is decidedly uneasy Yes means risking American lives in a faraway land that has no apparent connection to the only thing that really matters which is the Dow Jones industrial average No means doing nothing as the world s only superpower while a thug government commits daily televised atrocities against white people in Europe not just some unmediated Africans Unless you re extraordinarily lucky the outcome of making either choice will leave you morally implicated in some dead bodies with larger raw numbers making up for lack of American citizenship in the case of a no Fortunately even for Kosovo there are answers available besides yes and no They will be familiar from intervention disputes dating back at least to Vietnam but they are especially useful for the summer squall style military actions of today in which we all agree to be frenzied about the occupation of Kuwait or a drug smuggling dictator in Panama or warlords in Somalia or genocide in Bosnia on the strict understanding that we will be allowed to forget all about these matters and places in six months max Here are half a dozen consumer tested easy answers on issues like Kosovo 1 Well Cokie my concern is that if we go into INSERT LOCATION we should do so with the resources necessary to get the job done Airstrikes alone or only 200 000 troops or a mere half a dozen hydrogen bombs or whatever is on the menu just aren t enough It is immoral to put American soldiers at risk without a guarantee of overwhelming superiority for a certain and speedy victory This is perhaps the most prestigious dodge the Powell Doctrine named for Gen Colin Powell who is responsible for the doctrine but not its use as a dodge The Powell Doctrine holds that the lesson of Vietnam is do it right or not at all Go in full force from the beginning rather than escalate yourself into a quagmire Or don t go in at all Finish quickly before the public loses patience or ideally as in the case of Grenada before the public has even heard of the place Or of course don t start at all As to which of these alternatives all or nothing at all is the right one in any situation the Powell Doctrine does not say So this is a great way to sound tough and sophisticated without actually committing yourself Since any actual military engagement is not going to involve every last wing nut in the Pentagon s miscellaneous screws jar you are well positioned to say I told you so if things go badly Yet you never actually opposed the action so you re OK if things go well And no one can accuse you of wimping out if the military action doesn t take place Hey you wanted to go in with more force 2 Where is our exit strategy Ted That is what I d like to know Exit strategy became a fashionable term during the Gulf War It really sounds like you know what you re talking about And what does it mean As I understand it an exit strategy is a sort of poor man s Powell Doctrine It does not demand certain and prompt victory It merely demands a certain and prompt conclusion to the exercise that is acceptable to the United States When invoking this concern it is not necessary to specify and indeed it is hard to imagine what conclusion short of victory a guy like you who flings around terms like exit strategy would find minimally satisfactory And no military action except for actual movies can be fully scripted in advance So you re golden If things go wrong Ted I pleaded with the president to make sure we had an exit strategy And if the action goes well or disaster occurs because we didn t intervene Ted I was behind this all the way I ve always said that victory is the best exit strategy 3 Tim I support the president American credibility is at stake The commander in chief has made a commitment on behalf of the United States and the United States must honor that commitment This is the sneakiest dodge and probably the most popular especially among Republicans You get to be patriotic and hawkish And if things go well you were behind the commander in chief all the way But if things go badly it is the president s fault for making the commitment Tragically you had no choice but to support him once the commitment was made but of course making it was irresponsible folly Please note that like a reheated stew this dodge works even better after a military action has begun Tim we never should have got into this quagmire but now we have no choice but to 4 I m not persuaded this is so important so vital to the nation s interests that we ought to intervene That s an almost exact quote from a real senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and illustrates a nifty linguistic evasion You don t say you re against it you say you re not persuaded to be for it Not only do you evade the tough choice you also evade responsibility for your decision It s the president s fault even if he s right because he didn t persuade you You can also say like Sen Max Baucus of Montana that there are unanswered questions Being undecided and wanting ever more information is another great way to be designated as thoughtful And with a bit of skill and a bit of luck you can keep taking your own temperature until it doesn t matter any more Meanwhile you re OK no matter what happens Not persuaded can be spun as a yes or a no A nice variant is to say The American people must be persuaded this is the right thing and the president hasn t made the case Not only is whatever happens not your fault unless it s good it s not even the public s fault It s the president s fault either because we did what he wanted or if we didn t because he didn t convince us to do so 5 I don t think we should begin bombing unless and until the Serbs really begin a very significant massacre against the people in Kosovo That is Don Nickles of Oklahoma in Tuesday s Wall Street Journal where most of these quotes come from In a way this is not a dodge It is a sort of madcap Solomonic approach Sen Nickles is saying Why must we guess whether Milosevic is going to kill a lot more people Let s wait and see if he does it And why must we choose between saving a lot of Kosovars and saving none Let s split the difference and save half of them As a bonus Nickles retains a valuable fudge factor in the question of what qualifies as a very significant massacre Depending on what happens Nickles is in a position to accuse the president of failing to defend American interests and values or of recklessly endangering American lives on the basis of a massacre that was merely significant but not very significant 6 What s happening in WHEREVER is a tragedy and an outrage Wolf Intervention to stop the bloodshed is absolutely essential But it s a job for INSERT NAME OF CLOSER COUNTRY AND OR REGIONAL GROUP not for the United States This final dodge is slightly different You re claiming credit for sharing whatever humanitarian or geostrategic concern dictates military action while opposing the use of the only military power you yourself bear responsibility for I once interviewed an especially moronic senator since defeated who declared that some worthy military action was a job for the United Nations I asked him why other countries should risk their soldiers lives if the United States wouldn t and he replied I didn t say other nations I said the United Nations When it was pointed out to him that U N troops don t come from Mars he was stymied That point had never occurred to him But exposing the logical flaw here does not depend on any huffing and puffing about America s leadership role An American pol going on American television to say that the Europeans should tidy up the former Yugoslavia without our help is like the Economist running as has been known to happen a stuffy editorial saying that a corrupt dictator in some Third World country should resign Of course he should And the sun should shine in London every day But even the Economist s opinion cannot affect these matters When an answer moves beyond difficult to completely impossible it becomes easy once again Watch for these easy answers on the TV talk shows and in the newspaper Practice on your own Soon you too can be ducking responsibility like a real life member of Congress For more Kosovo coverage click
