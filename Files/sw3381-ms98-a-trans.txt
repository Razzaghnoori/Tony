                uh i guess its uh watching the radio the TV today there had a lot of stuff on on uh crime in our state right now uh recently theyve had a lot of uh uh the rapists uh murder type uh killers going around and   oh gracious   and well i i theyve caught them and they theyre in there   uhhuh wasnt it your state that had the um guy that committed all those murders there was that um   uh well yeah Wisconsin uh and Milwaukee area yeah   yeah yeah that was really on the national news a lot we heard a lot about that in Texas   yeah no thats       well i i live right on the border Minnesota and Wisconsin so i kind of get both both news and i know in Minnesota uh they had uh the one that just uh got out and went after a uh college student and raped and killed her and   oh   theyre not too happy about that now   well i can imagine it seems like the       violent crimes are increasing a lot to me i i dont know i dont know if statistically they are but it seems like you sure hear a maybe you just hear a lot more about them on the news i dont know   yeah uh thats hard to say for sure i uh sometimes i wonder if these people arent dont it just for the publicity and   you wonder about that sometimes   they they get their names in the in the paper and they become big celebrities   umhum thats kind of scary id im  wish there was some way that we could change the news media so they didnt feature these way out stories maybe it wouldnt give other people ideas   well uh i know one thing i i think Texas has the death penalty right   yes we do do you have it up there   yeah no   i see   see i i not   do you think thats a deterrent   yeah well uh its its its not gonna prevent any people from doing it but the person thats caught hell never do it again if he gets the death penalty and thats and there are a lot of repeaters uh   yeah umhum i guess thats another thing that to me is a a real problem and i know weve got so many people in our prison system now at least here in Texas   yeah   i mean theyre really in a crisis theres been times theyve had to just close off the prisons and leave them in county jails or whatever because there just wasnt enough room for all of them and   yeah   a lot of them they put out on parole and then some of the ones that they put out early you know do repeat offenses and the crime rates the worst than ever before   hum yeah well some im just wondering a lot of times theyll put uh people lesser crimes in uh with uh people that did more severe crimes and they maybe they just tend to learn from these people and they and when they get back out they just go into worse crimes and   i think that could be true too   maybe they should try and separate them a little bit more um   i think the whole parole thing you know if somebodys convicted of second degree murder or something gets fifteen years well theyre out in six or seven you know outbound on the streets again   yeah   and to me thats really scary some some of these crimes that they commit you know seems like the punishments not really equal to the crime   well uh i dont know uh with with my limited uh psychology background i do have uh i dont i dont even feel that prisons and stuff are are the answer if you wanna stop the crime i think you got to get uh the people when theyre kids   oh yeah   a lot of this probably just starts with from the from the homes also from the the the media the TV you see uh   umhum   all these uh gory movies on there becomes uh just natural fact of life   umhum i think its okay thing to do   yep   yeah i think thats a very good point you know i theres a lot more working mothers a lot more kids in day care centers all that kind of thing morality is being taught more by the schools a lot of times than in the home anymore   uhhuh well a lot of the European countries uh they tend to censor well they probably wont censor so much the sexual stuff as much as the violent   and umhum   and they have a lot less crime   hum   some of some of those European countries are are you can leave your your uh doors open and and and be safe uh even uh i think New Zealand is one of one of the places uh thats not
