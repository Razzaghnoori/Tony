                    Background        Defining which factors affect flowering is important for        a better understanding of plant growth and development and        offers an opportunity to study the interactions of        environmental cues chemical signals and gene expression        This is also relevant from an agronomic perspective A        plant needs to flower in order to set seed and in the case        of many crop plants including legumes and cereals the        seed serves as a main source of food in large parts of the        world Flowering time  defined as the time that elapses        between planting and the emergence of functional        reproductive structures  affects the yield Early        flowering can be beneficial to prevent loss due to frost or        other adverse weather conditions towards the end of the        season Significant reduction of flowering time could even        enable the production of an additional crop per year        Recent advances in genetics have made it possible to        study the genetic control of flowering In the model plant         Arabidopsis thaliana many genes        affecting flowering time or the transition from the        vegetative to the reproductive phase have been identified        and a number of them have been cloned for recent reviews        see      This has resulted in a model in which        meristem identity genes activate a developmental program        that enables the shoot apical meristem to produce        reproductive structures The meristem identity genes can be        activated via three different pathways One pathway        involves a set of autonomous genes which are turned on at        a specific developmental stage a second pathway involves        genes that are responsive to the photoperiod and a third        pathway includes genes that respond to the phytohormone        gibberellin        Orthologs of Arabidopsis flowering genes have been        identified in several other species including pea and        snapdragon     rice     maize     pine           and ryegrass     In addition transformation of one        plant species with constructs resulting in the        overexpression of flowering genes from another plant        species resulted in effects on flowering dynamics              This indicates that the function of several flowering        genes is conserved between plant species On the other        hand there is evidence that the transition to flowering is        not governed by a universal set of signals Many plant        species including maize and other grasses are much less        dependent on the photoperiod and gibberellin than        Arabidopsis suggesting that different signals may be        required for flower development This is conceptualized in        the multifactorial control hypothesis    in which a        combination of chemicals including phytohormones        assimilates and minerals interact with genetic components        in the process of floral initiation The recent cloning of        the         Indeterminate Id gene from maize        also illustrated incomplete understanding of the floral        transition process The         Id gene is expressed in developing        leaves prior to their transition from sink to source        tissue Its sequence shows similarity to a transcriptional        regulator and the gene product may play a role in the        movement of a flowering signal in developing leaves             The         Id gene is different from any of the        flowering genes isolated from Arabidopsis so far        We recently reported changes in flowering dynamics in        some of the         brown midrib mutants of maize          Zea mays L     Compared to        wildtype maize nearisogenic lines carrying the         brown midrib and         brown midrib mutations flowered at a        different time from their wildtype counterparts        The maize         brown midrib mutants have a reduction        in lignin content and an altered lignin subunit composition            Lignin is a complex hydrophobic polymer made of        substituted         p hydroxycinnamyl alcohol units        that differ in their extent of hydroxylation and        methoxylation for recent reviews see      Lignin        is important for the transport of water and plant rigidity        and it serves as a defense mechanism against pests and        pathogens In maize the relationship between cell wall        composition and flowering time appeared independent of        lignin content but instead seemed to depend on lignin        subunit composition            Life history theory and experiments have repeatedly        demonstrated tradeoffs between current survival and future        reproduction in both animals and plants             According to this theory there is an overall energy budget        for an organism with a finite amount available to divide        between these two evolutionarily important processes Such        a tradeoff may well be at the basis of the genetic        correlation between flowering time and cell wall        biosynthesis observed in maize If this is indeed the case        a similar relationship might exist in other species        Sorghum          Sorghum bicolor L Moench is a        good species for explorations of this nature Maize and        sorghum diverged approximately  million years ago and        are considered closely related     This is reflected        by the degree of synteny between maize and sorghum           and the high degree of DNA sequence homology of coding        regions between the two species     In addition         brown midrib mutants exist in sorghum            making a study on the relationship between cell        wall composition of sorghum and flowering directly        comparable to the maize study Despite these similarities        the morphology of the sorghum floral structure is very        different Unlike maize which is monoecious separate male        and female flowers the panicle of sorghum is        hermaphroditic The sorghum florets contain two spikelets        one of which contains both the anthers and the ovary        whereas the other is often sterile        The sorghum         brown midrib bmr mutants generated        via chemical mutagenesis with diethyl sulfate DES are        similar to the         bm mutants of maize in that they have        brown vascular tissue in the leaves and stem The content        and composition of the cell wall polymer lignin is also        altered in the sorghum         bmr mutants     The         bmr mutation was shown to result in        an accumulation of coniferaldehyde    and sinapaldehyde           and seems to be most similar to the maize         bm mutant     The         bmr and         bmr mutants are allelic            These mutants have lignin with lower amounts of syringyl        residues Instead the lignin contains more        hydroxyguaiacyl residues and therefore resembles the        lignin composition of the         bm mutant of maize             Little is known about the lignin composition of the other         bmr mutants        In this study the sorghum         bmr mutants are compared to their        wildtype counterparts in terms of their flowering        dynamics                    Results                  Variation in flowering time          Table lists the mean and median flowering times of          the different lines at the two locations There was          considerable variation in the flowering time when the           bmr lines were compared to their          normal counterparts and when the           bmr lines were compared to each          other In general the           bmr mutants flower later then their          wildtype counterparts except in the case of           bmr which flowers earlier than          the N line          Linear regression was performed on the data from          location A using the model Y                       ijk                                      X                      i               X                      j                          ijk             where X            is the replicate            i    X            is the genotype            j            bmr normal and Y                       ijk            is the time to halfbloom for individual           k in replicate           i for genotype           j  Based on the linear regression          the flowering times of the mutants           bmr and           bmr do not differ significantly          from those of their wildtype counterparts In all other          cases the difference in flowering time was statistically          significant            P   Differences between          genotypes were consistent in direction across replicates          although the estimate of the distance between genotypes          varied to some extent In the cases of           bmrN bmrN and           bmrN residuals showed          departures from the normality assumptions Linear          regression was then conducted on the data from location A          using the model log Y                       ijk                                      X                      i               X                      j                          ijk             This logtransformation did not change the          conclusions or improve residual behavior          The data were also analyzed using a survival analysis          Compared to linear regression survival analysis does not          require the data to be normally distributed and early          data on plants that do not survive until the end of the          experiment due to diseases or other damage can be          included in the analysis     Furthermore survival          analysis allows the comparison of modeled flowering          dynamics as opposed to a comparison of just the mean          flowering times          Figure and Figure show the flowering dynamics of the          plants in the two replicates in location A obtained          using survival analysis A parametric loglogistic model             gave the best fit across genotypes Based on these          figures it is apparent that most           bmr mutants flower later than their          wildtype counterparts with the exception of           bmr which flowers earlier than          N and           bmr which flowers at the same          time as N There is very good agreement between the two          replicates Differences between           bmr and N           bmr and N           bmr and N           bmr and N           bmr and N           bmr and N were statistically          significant            P   As with the linear          regression there was no statistically significant          difference between           bmr and N and between           bmr and N          The slopes of the lines represent the rate at which          flowering progresses A steep slope such as in           bmr N is indicative of a more          rapid progress in flowering than in cases where the slope          is more gradual such as in           bmr N Note that for each          combination of mutant and wild type the lines are          parallel which suggests that the           bmr mutations affect the time to          flowering but not the rate of flowering          In both the twodwarf            bmr     and the threedwarf          lines            bmr   the difference in          flowering time is apparent which indicates that the          effect is not limited to a specific genetic background          It is also interesting to note that the allelic mutants           bmr and           bmr behave differently even          though they are both in the threedwarf background This          could be the result of variation in the penetrance of the          mutation                          Plant height and development          Given the significant differences in the flowering          time between most           bmr lines and their wildtype          counterparts the question arises what the origin of          these differences is One possibility is that the           bmr lines develop at a slower or          faster growth rate and reach the point at which they          transition from the vegetative to the reproductive state          at a different time Differences in growth rate may be          apparent all the time or only during select stages such          as germination or the formation of floral structures and          they may or may not result in a difference in height at          maturity Alternatively the           bmr lines may develop at a normal          rate but delay the time at which they flower at the          level of the flower itself In that case the flower may          be present but may start blooming earlier or later than          the wildtype flowers It is possible that different          mutations result in different developmental effects          In a first attempt to examine these different          possibilities the height at halfbloom was measured for          each individual plant in location B Table displays the          height at halfbloom of the lines           bmr bmr and           bmr and their wildtype          counterparts A comparison of the height at halfbloom          reveals no significant variation between           bmr and N and between           bmr and N but the           bmr plants are somewhat shorter          than the N plants            P   There is a slight          height difference between the           bmr and           bmr plants and their respective          normal counterparts but it is not statistically          significant at the    level It may be worth          examining a larger number of plants to explore this          possible variation in height The height data indicate          that there may be an effect from the           bmr mutations on plant growth but          it is likely that this effect is not universal but          rather dependent on the specific mutation                            Discussion        The results from this study indicate that changes in        cell wall biosynthesis affect flowering dynamics in        sorghum Most of the         bmr mutants we investigated flowered        later than their wildtype counterparts but the         bmr mutant flowered earlier In the        case of N and         bmr and N and         bmr there is no significant        difference Differences across replications were consistent        in direction but varied somewhat in the estimate of        difference between the wild type and         bmr mutant These changes in        flowering time are similar to what was observed for the        maize         bm mutants     If the        correlation between flowering dynamics and cell wall        biosynthesis were spurious mutations affecting cell wall        composition in evolutionarily related species with        different flower morphology would not show association with        flowering dynamics Therefore the verification of this        association in sorghum when it has been demonstrated in        maize provides evidence for an evolutionarily conserved        mechanism that links cell wall biogenesis with flowering        time This opens the possibility that a similar mechanism        is present in other plant species including the model        plant Arabidopsis        Taken together the maize and sorghum data agree well        with the model of tradeoffs between current survival and        future reproduction The fact that the change in flowering        time is not in one direction suggests that the different        mutations have different effects on the energy balance        Additional experiments are necessary to obtain further        details on the relationship between cell wall composition        and flowering time In the case of         bmr we have evidence that not only        flowering time but also height is affected as a result of        the mutation It may be interesting to explore variation in        height in other mutantwildtype combinations Furthermore        determining during what developmental stage the difference        between a particular         bmr mutant and its wildtype        counterpart becomes apparent may reveal whether or not        there is a direct effect on the floral transition It will        be necessary to complete allelism tests before a        relationship between the biochemical effect of the        various         bmr mutations and the flowering time        can be defined with confidence        One hypothesis that can be tested is the involvement of        phenylpropanoid intermediates as signaling molecules in        plant development Mutations in lignin biosynthesis may        affect the effective concentration of such molecules which        could include dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol glucosides DCGs        DCGs are lignanglucosides with cytokininlike activity             An alternative hypothesis is that as a result of        the         bmr mutations the physicochemical        characteristics of the vasculature have been altered in        such a way that it affects the transport of signaling        compounds Colasanti and Sundaresan    proposed a role        for the vasculature in the control of transport of        signaling molecules between leaves and the shootapical        meristem Indeed a recent study on the nitrogen content of        phloem and xylem exudates during the transition to        flowering in Arabidopsis and         Sinapis alba showed changes in the        transport of amino acids through the vasculature                   The present study also confirms the role that the maize         brown midrib genes play in flowering        dynamics The maize         bm mutants were isolated more than        fifty years ago and the wildtype progenitors of the        original mutants are no longer available Therefore        studies with the maize         bm mutants need to be done with        nearisogenic lines While comparisons between a wild type        and a mutant that has been subjected to six or seven        backcrosses are generally considered acceptable there is        still a small risk of linkage drag creating the        possibility that genes linked to the         brown midrib genes are affecting the        development In the case of sorghum however the         bmr mutants can be compared to a line        derived from a wildtype sibling which minimizes the        source of genetic variation Given that the sorghum         bmr mutants show different flowering        dynamics we can attribute the variation in flowering        dynamics in maize more confidently to the         bm mutations        Now that it has been shown that the         bmr mutations of sorghum also affect        the flowering time the experimental population that can be        used to determine the underlying effect has become        significantly larger Furthermore the incorporation        specific         bmr mutations in sorghum breeding        programs may be of use for the manipulation of flowering        time                    Materials and Methods        Approximately  seeds were planted in a randomized        complete block design at the Agronomy Research Center in        West Lafayette IN location A in the Spring of  in        the following manner two replicates of approximately         plants each for the following entries N         bmr N         bmr N         bmr N         bmr N         bmr N         bmr N         bmr N and         bmr The         bmr mutations were introduced via        chemical mutagenesis with diethyl sulfateethylsulfonate        DES     Briefly an M          population obtained from selfing M          and M          plants M          refers to plants grown from the        mutagenized seeds was screened for         bmr mutants The         bmr mutants were identified among        segregating head rows The corresponding wildtype Nlines        were derived from wildtype siblings in the same head row        Both the N and         bmr plants were advanced to the M          generation via selfing to result in        nearisogenic lines The genetic similarity between these        lines is far greater than can be achieved through recurrent        backcrosssing because there is essentially no linkage        drag        The mutants         bmr bmr bmr bmr and         bmr were derived from the        threedwarf parent line  The mutants         bmr bmr and         bmr were derived from the twodwarf        parent line  and tend to be taller than the mutants        derived from line  Note that the different numbers        of the         bmr mutants do not necessarily        designate separate loci Preliminary allelism tests        indicated there are at least three different         bmr loci     The         bmr mutants that were part of this        study did not show any major abnormalities in their growth        and development        In addition two    Latin squares with  plants per        entry were planted at the Throckmorton Agricultural Center        near West Lafayette IN location B in the Spring of         The first Latin square contained the entries N         bmr N and         bmr the second Latin square        contained N         bmr N and         bmr         Flowering time was defined as the time to halfbloom        extrusion of mature anthers having progressed halfway down        the head and was recorded as days after planting DAP for        each individual plant by daily survey in both locations        The height at halfbloom in cm of each plant in location        B was measured        All data analyses were performed using the statistical        software package SAS SAS Institute Cary NC Height        comparisons between genotypes were made based on linear        regression Basic statistics on the flowering time        including the mean median and standard deviation for each        genotype were calculated In some cases data were skewed        as is common in timetoevent data Differences in        flowering time between genotypes were assessed with two        different statistical modeling techniques linear        regression and survival analysis A logtransformation was        performed before the linear regression when the data were        not normally distributed        Survival analysis covers a broad class of models that        deal with the analysis of timedependent data In brief        analysis of survival data involves two interrelated        functions the hazard function h         t  which given survival until time         t gives the instantaneous potential        of an individual to undergo the event of interest and the        survival function S         t  which gives the probability of        survival longer than time         t     The hazard and survival        functions vary depending on the specific model Models can        be parametric or nonparametric Nonparametric survival        models assume no baseline hazard This can result in a loss        of precision and in some cases a loss of power In        contrast the parametric models specify a baseline survival        function which can have serious consequences if        misspecified For a more detailed description of survival        analysis see      Survival models can also be        implemented in SAS     The application of survival        analysis to developmental traits was discussed by Vermerris        and McIntyre
