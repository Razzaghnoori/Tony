 Background Ciliate nuclear dimorphism Following pair wise mating conjugation each exconjugant replaces its old parental MAC with a new MAC developed from a mitotic daughter of its genotypically new zygotic nucleus review 14 The mitotic sister of the MAC precursor anlage is set aside as the new diploid germline MIC which is then heterochromatically silenced all known gene expression is from the MAC or MAC anlage 15 16 17 Once the anlage begins differentiation the old MAC is apoptotically destroyed 18 The mature exconjugant resumes feeding and establishes a vegetative clone a karyonide propagated by binary fission in which the MIC replicates as a typical diploid mitotic nucleus and the MAC replicates amitotically Macronuclear development Ciliates employ a strategy of irreversible genome alterations to generate the MAC a specialized gene expression organelle Analogous developmental strategies have evolved several times outside the ciliates scattered across phyla 15 19 thus mammalian immunity depends on irreversible somatic genome alterations 20 Initially the MAC anlage s chromosomes are endo reduplicated evidenced by visible polyteny in a variety of ciliates The ploidy can reach 64 in some Spirotrichs 21 22 Thus each sequence that survives subsequent elimination MAC destined is represented by numerous polytene chromatids in principle each could be processed differently Near the end of endo replication in Spirotrichs many transposons and transposon like sequences are eliminated by precise excision Internal Eliminated Sequences or IESs 23 Excision directly precedes massive chromatid fragmentation and de novo telomere formation chromosome healing 9 and the degradation of IESs and of spacer DNAs that lie between blocks of sequences destined for different MAC chromosomes The surviving sequences as few as 5 of the germline sequences reside on many small MAC chromosomes which are then highly amplified to the level of the mature MAC The Oxytricha MAC genome is typical of those of other Spirotrichs It consists 1000 copies of 20 000 different tiny acentric linear chromosomes They range in length from 0 5 kbp to 15 kbp number average length 2 4 kbp J Garrett K R W D Witherspoon and G H unpublished comprised almost exclusively of transcription units Many carry only one gene review 24 but some carry two or three genes each 25 N Sanders B Fausett T G D K R W and G H unpublished Not all identical polytene chromatids of the anlage are processed identically as evidenced by the generation of alternative processing families of MAC chromosomes We have studied alternative processing of the 81 MAC locus which generates a family of three overlapping chromosomes 26 27 see Fig 1 below Analogous phenomena have been described in other ciliates 28 29 30 31 Chromatid breakage and de novo telomere formation Telomeres are not encoded in situ at the ends of MAC destined blocks 32 33 but are polymerized onto new ends de novo by telomerase These processes have been best studied in Tetrahymena thermophila and in various Spirotrichs including Euplotes crassus Breakage occurs at 200 cut sites in Tetrahymena and at 40 000 sites in Spirotrichs A short 15 bp cis acting sequence cbs is necessary and sufficient to direct breakage at or near it in Tetrahymena presumably being the binding site of the breakage enzyme the cutter 34 35 36 The cbs sits in eliminated sequence a short variable distance from the positions that receive telomeres An analogous sequence E cbs has been characterized in Euplotes by sequence comparisons and analyses of DNA intermediates and products of MAC development 37 38 39 At a fixed distance from itself E cbs directs a 6 nucleotide staggered cut with a protruding 3 OH to which telomerase adds telomere repeats The E cbs can sit within the MAC destined sequence or in the adjacent spacer DNA in some cases both generated ends receive telomere repeats so that the two resultant telomere tailed ends overlap by 6 bp A cbs has been tentatively identified in Stylonychia lemnae 40 no cbs is known in Oxytrichs although we assume it exists see Discussion The in vitro properties of telomerase are consistent with its known role in creation of MAC telomeres in Tetrahymena 41 as well as presumably in all other ciliates 9 Telomerases from exconjugants of Tetrahymena and Euplotes have been extensively studied in vitro The E crassus enzyme can only act on oligomers that pair with telomerase template RNA at their 3 terminus unless assisted by a dissociable factor chromosome healing factor which contributes extra mass to the enzyme in exconjugants 42 Telomerase assisted by this factor still requires a block of dGs or telomere repeats internal to the 3 primer end 43 In contrast the Tetrahymena exconjugant enzyme can add to a primer completely devoid of telomere repeats in special reaction conditions and shows no evidence of increased mass beyond that of the vegetative enzyme 44 Although chromatid breakage requires an endonuclease activity the cutter directed by a Cbs binding activity no Cbs dependent binder cutter activity has been detected in vitro The cutter could be an activity of telomerase itself 39 43 Telomerase of both Tetrahymena and Euplotes has a single strand endonuclease activity 45 43 It can trim potential primers back so that the 3 terminus pairs with template RNA 46 Thus while it may serve a 3 editing function the existence of a nuclease activity in potential proximity to the site of chromatid breakage is provocative suggesting that telomerase provides the double strand cutting activity and thereby explaining coupled action between chromatid cutting and telomere addition see below However Niu et al 47 in a study of a similar endonuclease activity of the yeast telomerase argue that since yeast perform no developmental fragmentation this activity plays some role other than in fragmentation It is generally believed that the developmental action of telomerase is tightly coupled to cleavage The Oxytricha multi TAS regions we describe here seem to cause an uncoupling of these steps our models invoke the ability of telomerase to act independently of the binder cutter Tetrahymena telomerase and the binder cutter appear to act concertedly in vivo as if in a physical complex 48 49 However this contrasts with in vitro properties of the enzyme from exconjugants 1 it acts on non telomeric primers 44 50 and 2 it apparently is no larger than the vegetative enzyme 44 Furthermore telomerase can act in the vegetative MAC of Paramecium uncoupled from chromatid breakage 51 It remains to be seen if a complex between telomerase and binder cutter activity does exist We consider models that assume the two activities exist separately in a loose complex This assumption is supported by our results as well as those of M llenbeck and Klobutcher 52 which indicate that exonucleolytic erosion of new ends must sometimes occur before telomerase caps them It is possible that the nuclease activity of telomerase causes the erosion Telomere addition sites TASs The exact nucleotide positions where telomere repeats are added have been examined in several ciliates reviewed by 23 53 Cloned chromosome ends from 81 MAC family indicated heterogeneity of TAS placement which we attributed to exonuclease erosion of the broken ends prior to telomerase action 27 Analogous multi TAS regions have been described in Tetrahymena 49 E Hamilton and E Orias pers comm and in Paramecium A Le Mou l and E Meyer pers comm In stark contrast no heterogeneity of TAS positions has been reported for E crassus MAC chromosomes although recently M llenbeck and Klobutcher 52 report multiple TASs at the end of a MIC limited spacer segment Thus in Tetrahymena and Paramecium telomeres are added at a heterogeneous collection of clustered sites which we here refer to as multi TAS regions whereas in E crassus only one TAS is used for each MAC destined end single TAS regions Here we describe both kinds of regions in Oxytricha both involved in the generation of the 81 MAC family of MAC chromosomes Alternative processing of the 81 MAC locus A family of three nested MAC chromosomes was discovered when the MAC chromosome cloned in pMA81 was hybridized to Southern blotted MAC DNA 26 The chromosomes consist of three contiguous segments of germline sequence referred to as the common region CR and the left and right arms Figure 1 Each segment bears a protein coding gene 54 25 The smallest chromosome MAC III consists solely of the common region with telomeres Arm alone chromosomes have never been observed in vegetative MAC DNA and are proposed to be replication incompetent 27 The two large chromosomes each have a common region MAC I carries a right arm and MAC II a left arm Therefore the latter two chromosomes each carry two genes 25 a novel finding in Spirotrichs see 24 The identities of the genes have not suggested any selective advantage to such couplings but the alternative processing of this locus has been conserved within the Oxytrichs and with variation in some Stylonychids A Seegmiller and K R W unpublished We proposed that this nested set is generated by alternative breakage patterns of polytene chromatids of the 81 locus DNA 27 bottom Fig 1 While the arm distal positions must be efficiently cut on each chromatid alternative breakage at the regions bounding the CR was proposed Thus not all CR arm junctions are cut on each chromatid analogous to an incomplete DNA restriction digest leaving arm DNA appended to CR DNA in some cases MACs I and II and not others MAC III Given the apparent functioning of exonucleolytic erosion following chromatid cutting note that another way to explain the generation of arm less chromosomes is to assume that chromatids are only cut at arm distal sites and that erosion alternatively stops at the arm distal TAS position or proceeds completely through the arm to stop in the CR boundary multi TAS region By this model arm alone chromosomes never exist even transiently use of anchored PCR see below is intended to search for such species and to distinguish between this massive erosion model and the incomplete cutting model The latter model seems more parsimonious to us and we assume it in discussing the results of this report Incomplete cutting at the CR boundaries might be caused by poor binding sites or poor cut sites for the binder cutter In the work presented here we employed an anchored PCR procedure to precisely map telomere addition sites TASs We show that the two CR boundaries CR Right and CR Left are multiple TAS regions but the two arm distal regions have single TASs Models are proposed to explain why the two putatively incompletely cut CR boundary regions also are multiple TAS regions Results Karyonidal reproducibility A karyonide is a clone of cells established by an emerging exconjugant that is a clone of cells that have the same ancestral developed new MAC 58 If random erosion is responsible for the heterogeneity we see then it should be different in each different karyonide Figure 3Ashows displays of the CR R TASs from two sets of karyonides with different alleles of the 81 MAC locus The displays for the different genotypes differ at many positions but inter karyonidal variation is very slight by comparison In a separate experiment not shown similarly identical display patterns of CR R were generated from three independent a b heterozygote karyonides displays from both P1 anchor and P2 anchor PCR products were identical demonstrating that P2 anchor PCR does not generate artifacts While the allele composition of the 81 locus is identical in each pair of karyonides the karyonides are not otherwise genetically identical unlike sister karyonides in many ciliates e g see 59 but are independently derived so that the backgrounds differ between karyonides which might explain these slight variations Perhaps more interestingly these inter karyonidal variations could be attributed to the limited number of chromatids available to be partitioned into the various TAS classes represented by the display bands however the over riding reproducibility implies that the positions of these TASs are dictated genetically by cis acting sequences Allelic specificity Note that if TAS positions are dictated solely by cis acting sequences then the pattern of the a b heterozygote should be equivalent to the sum of the two homozygote patterns a a b b but this is not the case Fig 3B Indeed we ve observed analogous non additivity at CR R for each of the three heterozygotes a b a 3 and 3 b and at CR L for a b and 3 b data not shown Since independent isolates of a given genotype have essentially the same pattern this is unlikely to be caused by different genetic backgrounds Rather it is possible that this phenomenon indicates allelic interactions particularly given that the alleles are closely associated in a polytene chromosome at the time they are processed homologs are paired in the polytene anlage of Stichotrichs 60 61 For instance transvection is a phenomenon dependent on homolog pairing transvection normally is evidenced by rescued gene expression in heterozygotes of two alleles defective in different cis acting sequence features which interact in trans to essentially complement one another review 62 Whatever the explanation of this complexity it does not negate the conclusion that the patterns are genotype sensitive and that cis acting sequences must be operating in the process of TAS determination Thus even if alleles interact to determine the TAS pattern nonetheless the alleles are determining the pattern that is the patterns are determined by cis acting components of the allele sequences The results suggest that allelic sequences predominantly determine TAS positions autonomously additively but the non additivity results indicate that the allele sequences must also interact in trans These two multi TAS regions roughly lie between their neighboring genes coding regions and no TAS site interrupts the common region transcription unit Fig 4 below CR L data not shown The CR R multi TAS region of O fallax 3 5 is larger than that of O trifallax Fig 3B To display the fastest bands representing TASs most proximal to the CR gene the images of the bottom of the 3 5 lanes are shown along side the images of their respective lanes Furthermore these clone 3 5 patterns are displayed in two parallel lanes which illustrate the band confirmation technique of telomere step in PCR In this procedure PCR is performed with the P1 anchor PCR product as template using P1 in combination with an oligomer of 3 telomere repeats see Anchor and G 4 T 4 G 4 T 4 G 4 marked in Fig 2B generating a set of products shortened by removal of the anchor from beyond the telomere repeats and once again display chains are generated Bands representing bone fide telomere bearing 5 P termini shift down by a predicted size decrement thereby verifying each responsible TAS Note essentially all the bands in the 3 5 display shift down in concert including the extremely slow band a marked short chain triplet and the marked shortest chain band The significance of the extreme TAS position represented by the latter band will be considered below Figure 4shows the positions of detected TASs mapped onto the sequences of six alleles of the CR R multi TAS region Homologous nucleotides are aligned Forty six positions are used as TASs As the displays indicate Fig 3 uses of many positions are influenced by the allele sequence Illustrating that allele specific cis acting sequences must dictate TAS position use alleles differ at most TAS positions only 3 are used by all alleles 24 positions marked are used by more than one but not all alleles and 19 positions marked are used by only one allele For instance note the most CR proximal dA TAS only mapped to O fallax 3 5 vA it resides in a segment of highly conserved sequences with the exception of a vA specific dT 5 nts 5 of the TAS Might this single mutation have caused the use of this unique TAS position Given the interactions between alleles we observe in the O trifallax data Fig 3 it may be that the vA TAS might not be dictated by a vA sequence feature acting in cis but could have been induced on vA by the vB and or vC alleles also present in the anlage that established strain 3 5 macronuclei This vA segment is immediately 5 of the Common Region gene s transcription start sites Fig 4 54 and presumably is conserved by selection focused on expression of that gene 27 54 63 The position of this most proximal TAS in vA is surprising indicating that some vA MAC I or II chromosomes have as few as 3 5 base pairs between the telomere DNA and the transcription start site of the Common Region gene Fig 4 54 The two kinds of possibilities are that these chromosomes cannot express their Common Region gene for lack of promoter elements or that they do noting that the use of this verified TAS is genetically dictated and hence is tested for fitness by natural selection Thus if the CR genes are silenced on these close trimmed chromosomes the implication is that generation of these chromosomes with inoperative genes is somehow useful to Oxytricha perhaps adjusting the stoichiometry of expressed 81 locus genes Alternatively these chromosomes may be able express their Common Region gene despite the extreme lack of 5 sequences Assuming that some promoter element is required and is not provided by the 3 5 bp 5 of the transcription start perhaps the telomere repeats serve this purpose see 64 It is also possible that a promoter element resides internal to this region we have identified a highly conserved sequence block in the gene s first intron and suggested that it might serve as a promoter element 65 Perhaps the most trivial interpretation of the existence of these short chromosomes is that the responsible TAS is positioned due to a recent mutation that arose in the vA allele subsequent to its relatively recent divergence from vC 65 thus the mutation is relatively new and despite its potential impairment of the CR gene on these short chromosomes the mutation may not yet have been expunged by selection Single TAS regions distal to the left and right arms of the 81 MAC locus In contrast to the multi TAS regions bounding the Common Region telomeres are added to single positions at the extreme arm distal boundaries of the 81 MAC locus Figure 5presents LM PCR displays in which both the left arm and right arm distal TAS regions show single bands step in verified An exception is the triple band for left arm distal region of O fallax 3 5 A more complete study of single TAS regions will be presented elsewhere K R W T G D D J Witherspoon G A H manuscript in preparation Clones of these three bands have been sequenced K R W unpubl results showing that the three bands represent the three versions alleles of this locus each of which has a different TAS Sequence differences that might be responsible for the different TAS locations are not obvious Discussion We show that two distinct processes are determined by cis acting sequences First cis acting sequences must determine that the arm distal TAS regions only generate single TASs while the common region boundaries each generate multiple TASs Below we propose that the responsible sequences are the sites for binding or cutting by the chromatid binder cutter Second we show that the heterogeneity of TAS positions within the CR bounding multi TAS regions are genetically determined the pattern is not random but reproducible from karyonide to karyonide and it is allele specific indicating that each TAS in these regions is dictated by its own cis acting sequence which we model below as a pause site for an exonuclease that resects the new MAC end before telomerase can act By trying to explain why alternatively or incompletely cut TAS regions are also multi TAS regions while completely cut positions have a single TAS we have attempted to infer properties of the trans acting machinery that works at these sites Toward that we now present three models involving a set of cis acting sequences and trans acting components A series of assumptions has been made some of which will be examined after the models are presented as we consider alternative explanations First we assume the previous model for alternative processing that the CR boundaries are not efficiently broken on each chromatid sometimes leaving the common region linked to a left or right arm 27 We assume three trans acting components and three kinds of cis acting sites The trans actors assumed are a loose non covalent complex between the binder cutter enzyme and telomerase and a resecting exonuclease that pauses The assumed cis acting sites are the binding cutting and exonuclease pause sites Finally we assume that enzyme can act either coupled to the binder cutter action or on its own at ends exposed by the exonuclease The first model is what we take to be the accepted model in the field for chromatid breakage and telomere formation at a single TAS and what we propose also to be the mechanism operating at the arm distal single TAS regions In this case all the components function with full efficiency first a complex of telomerase and binder cutter bind to the binding site then cutting of the cut site ensues with immediate coupled telomerase capping of the MAC destined end with no interposed erosion Two further alternative mechanisms are offered to generate the spectrum of TASs at the CR boundaries These models share several features Each is a kinetic chain of events scenario Each invokes a sub maximal or weak cis acting sequence compared to that at a single TAS region as the cause of the ensuing events and in each enzyme is portrayed anthropomorphically for heuristic and didactic reasons In the hesitant cutter model the complex binds but the endonuclease is slow to cut because the cut site is weak recalcitrant to cutting Meanwhile the impatient telomerase dissociates from the complex and while it is away from the site the cutter finally cuts and the raw end is not capped and is exposed to the exonuclease which progresses in fits and starts stalling at each TAS When telomerase eventually acts it usually encounters the eroder paused at a pause site and adds telomeric repeats to those resected chromatid ends thus generating the reproducible spectrum of TASs observed In the frustrated telomerase model the cut site is normal but instead the binding site is weak so that the complex binds but with a high off rate In this chain of events the complex binds transiently and cuts and dissociates from the binding site removing telomerase before it can cap the new end As in the previous scenario exonuclease erodes the end and pauses telomerase returns and caps the ends it finds and the observed spectrum of TASs is generated In principle the binding and cut sites might be coincident or overlap as for Type II restriction enzymes 66 in that case cutting would destroy the binding site and this frustrated telomerase situation would apply This predicts that multiple TASs should result even at a TAS region with an optimal binding and cut site but this is contrary to the behavior of the arm distal TAS regions Further Euplotes binding and cut sites do not overlap 38 A central and potentially contentious assumption in these two weak sites models is that telomerase is capable of acting independently of the binder cutter that is outside the widely inferred complex However the ciliate literature is unclear about whether Tetrahymena telomerase might be able to act uncoupled from the action of the binder cutter see Introduction Furthermore the in vitro exconjugant enzyme of Euplotes crassus can cap non telomeric DNA aided by Chromosome Healing Factor 42 That Euplotes is more closely related to Oxytricha than to Tetrahymena tentatively supports our assumption that telomerase can heal ends well after the binder cutter has acted In support of this we note that the level of telomerase activity must be much higher in the Oxytricha anlage than in the Tetrahymena anlage in that the density of broken ends would be all else being equal 100 higher 0 5 ends kbp in Oxytricha MIC DNA vs 0 005 ends kbp in Tetrahymena Might telomerase nuclease activity be the cutter 39 43 If so obviously the cutter and telomerase cannot physically dissociate The weak sites models invoke dissociation specifically to explain the correlation between the two properties of the boundaries of the CR their partial cutting and their broad distribution of TASs Thus we argue that the cutter and binder activities must reside in some entity other than telomerase Also arguing against both activities being in one inseparable entity is the apparent erosion interposed between cutting and telomerase action Specifically erosion requires that nuclease activities have access to the ends of the break Might the telomerase endonuclease activity erode the 3 ends This nuclease clips 3 tails that protrude beyond internal segments that pair with the RNA template AAAACCCCAAAA segment 9 While many 76 of the TASs in the CR R multi TAS region have 3 dT s which could pair with template As several cannot specifically the 25 dAs and 5 dCs Fig 4 In any case telomerase in vitro requires that the 3 primer end protrudes on a single strand tail review 9 Thus another activity is required to resect the 5 underhanging strand see 67 and this enzyme too would need access to the break A variety of 5 3 exoncleases are known in eukaryotes review 68 so it is reasonable to assume such an activity operates during macronuclear development Conclusions We have shown that the two CR boundaries share the property of being multi TAS regions in contrast to the two arm distal regions These properties correlate with the previously inferred incompleteness of chromatid cutting that occurs in each of these regions Cis acting sequences must dictate these two contrasting behaviors of the chromatid breakage and telomerase activities Reproducibility and sensitivity to allele sequence show that the positions within multi TAS regions also are dictated by cis acting sequences The proposed weak sites models make several predictions We predict that a loose complex will be found in ciliates between telomerase and a cbs directed binder cutter activity In Oxytricha other alternatively processed loci like the 81 locus should have multi TAS regions that define the boundaries of segments that are shared between different sized chromosomes we are searching for such loci in a growing data set of MAC chromosome end sequences being generated in collaboration with R Weiss and D Dunn of the Utah Genome Center We have begun to examine this data set for TAS adjacent sequence motifs that potentially define the binding sites and or cut sites of single TAS MAC ends as Klobutcher et al 38 have done for E crassus We can then test the prediction that multi TAS regions bear either weak binding or cut sites Finally we are expanding our data set of allelic and orthologous variants of the 81 MAC multi TAS regions to be able to infer the identity of their cis acting pause site sequences As the details of multi TAS region processing unravel we should be able to illuminate the processes of chromatid breakage and healing by telomerase Methods DNAs Oxytricha was cultured and whole cell
