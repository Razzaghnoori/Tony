and was raped and murdered when her secret got out Critics can t say enough good things about the film It is audacious accomplished Emanuel Levy Variety a delicately conceived fearless film that is like a long tragic poem David Denby The New Yorker one of the year s best Roger Ebert the Chicago Sun Times The New York Times Maslin calls it a stunning debut feature for director Kimberly Peirce and Entertainment Weekly s Owen Gleiberman calls Hilary Swank a Beverly Hills 90210 veteran who plays Brandon extraordinary Watch the trailer on the official site and an article in Slate on how well the film reflects the facts of the actual story Superstar Paramount Pictures If Superstar were meatloaf and that would be an improvement the recipe would be 4 pounds bread crumbs to 3 ounces sirloin Make that chuck opines John Anderson in the Los Angeles Times Most reviewers agree with this assessment saying the Saturday Night Live sketch featuring Molly Shannon as nerdy horny tortured Catholic schoolgirl Mary Katherine Gallagher with a signature pratfall that exposes her large white underpants does not translate well to the big screen The biggest problem The character is so sad and helpless so hard to like so impossible to empathize with that watching it feels like an act of unkindness Ebert the Chicago Sun Times A few concede that the film is amusing if uneven Dennis Harvey Daily

Interscope Excellent reviews and a debut at No 1 on Billboard s pop chart it then dove down to No 16 for Trent Reznor s first offering in five years The double album is a musical treasure trove Hard rock simply doesn t get any smarter harder or more ambitious than this Jim DeRogatis the Chicago Sun Times What sets Reznor who records under the name Nine Inch Nails apart from the techno goth rock pack His knack for pop hooks and appealing beats in the midst of all the aural chaos W hen you listen up close you get engrossed in the buried sonic twists and turns when you turn it up loud Reznor bangs your head with great rockers Rob Sheffield Rolling Stone Watch the video from the album on the official Nine Inch Nails Web site Garth Brooks in the Life of Chris Gaines by Garth Brooks EMD Capitol Garth Brooks shocks the world by putting out a pop album under the fictional persona of Chris Gaines giving himself a radical makeover complete with soul patch eye makeup and most startling of all no cowboy hat H e looks a bit like Trent Reznor crossed with a guy who eats a lot of cheese steaks Christopher John Farley Time The music though is anything but shocking It s drab anonymous pop Robert Hilburn the Los Angeles Times with a few Babyface style R B numbers thrown in for good measure The consensus It s neither a great pop album nor a great Brooks album Brian Mansfield USA Today
