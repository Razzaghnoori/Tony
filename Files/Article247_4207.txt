 Cineastes vs Multiplexers Dear Sarah When I read a sentence about Tom Hanks like Wherever he goes a treacly white guy triumphalism seems to follow I wonder what impulse causes you to add the words white guy to the sentence That s the one part he can t help Would you write this sentence substituting Jewish or black or Native American Tom Hanks embodies all he embodies You don t like it find another actor To some degree every actor simply is what he is Does Denzel Washington ever put you in mind of treacly black guy triumphalism In The Bone Collector for example Or are both Hanks and Washington in scripts you don t like because as scripts they embody treacly triumphalism But of course America loves Tom Hanks Quite often I do too I think it is important that as film critics we stay in touch with ordinary audiences not to reflect their values because we must have our own but to understand them Most of the ideological criticisms of The Green Mile are by and for sophisticated and subtle observers writing for one another The average moviegoer with 8 and a seat in an Abilene multiplex is likely to find himself or herself subtly more complex humane and liberal after seeing that film than before It is reductive and stereotyped to a media cineaste but perhaps the best and most evolved movie that many of its viewers will see all year I agree with you by the way in feeling fed up to here with movies about men being on the ropes The most offensive example of that trend of course was Fight Club which I notice is very absent from most of the year end best film lists Having recently returned from Calcutta where the extent of the poverty was almost inconceivable to me I now have even less sympathy for pathetic preppies who have to beat up each other to feel authentic I am thinking now of an e mail from a twentysomething whiner who said that his generation needed Fight Club because they have been denied a war like Vietnam to test themselves in Best Roger
