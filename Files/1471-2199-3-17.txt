 Background Group II introns are catalytic RNAs that are also mobile genetic elements Although their primary sequences vary considerably the intron RNAs fold into well conserved structures Figure 1 The generalized group II intron secondary structure consists of six helical domains emerging from a central wheel 1 2 Some group II introns are capable of self splicing however for efficient splicing in vivo the intron encoded ORF or host encoded splicing factors are required 3 Mobile group II introns encode a reverse transcriptase maturase with the coding region generally located in domain IV Group II introns were first identified in fungal mitochondria and grouped on the basis of their secondary structures 2 4 5 They have been found in organelle genomes of fungi and plants and also in a number of bacteria 6 None have been found in animals although it has been suggested that group II introns may be progenitors of nuclear spliceosomal introns based on similarities between nuclear pre mRNA splicing in eukaryotes and the splicing mechanism used by group II introns 7 8 In the first step of splicing there is a nucleophilic attack by the branch point residue on the nucleotide at position 1 of the intron resulting in a lariat structure with the intron remaining attached to the 3 exon The second transesterification results in exon ligation with the release of lariat RNA complexed with the intron encoded protein This ribonucleoprotein RNP complex is an endonuclease which can initiate reverse splicing into an intron less target site in a process known as retrohoming 3 After the intron RNA reverse splices into one strand of the double stranded DNA the intron encoded protein cleaves the other strand at position 9 or 10 downstream of the intron insertion site and the generated 3 end of the second strand is used as a primer for reverse transcription of the inserted intron RNA Integration of the resultant cDNA occurs via the host s recombination or repair mechanisms At this point however it is not clear what the exact structural requirements for retrohoming are or which tertiary interactions are dispensable for the reaction This mutational study is an effort to understand what structural features of the intron RNA are important for mobility and to utilize that information to construct a minimal intron capable of retrohoming The development of a core functional intron would be interesting not only from an evolutionary perspective but would also facilitate manipulation in the laboratory Results and Discussion Domain I Domain I possesses numerous intra and inter domain interactions by which it serves as a scaffold for intron folding It associates with domain V to form the catalytic core It is also important for recognition of the 5 exon in cis splicing reactions and for targeting DNA or RNA in reverse splicing 9 Not surprisingly deletions in sub domain structures particularly Ic greatly diminish mobility In this report the ratio of amp R tet R to amp R colonies of each mutant normalized to the wild type ratio was used as a measure of mobility frequency It is important to note that for mutants with a very low mobility 0 001 this ratio may not reflect mobility frequency due to background tet R colonies and it was necessary to verify intron insertion by PCR analysis Only two deletions in domain I retained some mobility domain Ib 0 06 and the helix nts 190 204 0 37 The Ib deletion mutant had a mobility frequency of 0 06 which may indicate that the tertiary element is not absolutely essential for mobility This result is interesting in that only the deletion mutant is mobile while both the deletion and the double deletion are not This is in contrast to the results of splicing assays with the group IIB introns aI5 and Pl LSU 2 where it has been shown that the interaction is essential for splicing 10 11 12 This discrepancy could reflect the fact that the mobility assay is more sensitive and can detect greatly diminished levels of splicing and mobility It is also possible that other structural features of Ll LtrB or its interaction with LtrA protein help it properly orient important regions flanking the element Based on an earlier secondary structure of the Id i iii region the helix included positions 190 204 Figure 2a A deletion of this sub domain resulted in a frequency of 0 37 However when the structure was redrawn based on comparative analysis Figure 2b 13 and the new helix containing the interacting element was deleted nts 185 201 the frequency dropped over 1000 fold These results imply that the interaction itself may not be essential for the activity of the intron but the overall structure of this region is critical This is further indicated by the deletion of the helix just above it nts 205 210 339 346 for which no mobility was detected The finding that is not essential is similar to a finding by Costa et al 2000 for the Pl LSU 2 intron in which a deletion of the entire ID ii a stem loop containing the element was still capable of splicing 12 Additionally this element is absent from the introns S p cox2 I1 P a cox1 I4 A m cox1 I3 and P a cox1 I1 along with Id ii 1 13 The loss of the interaction might also be compensated for by the intron encoded protein This is supported by a strong protein enhanced crosslink between U191 near in domain I and C2421 near in domain V Noah and Lambowitz unpublished data None of the other 11 sub domain deletions in domain I were mobile Even the double deletion mutants and which presumably affect local folding and hence could be less deleterious overall did not restore mobility The observed homing frequencies in the range of 10 3 10 4 are close to the background level of appearance of tet R colonies 10 3 Surprisingly neither the single nor the double deletions involved in the interaction are mobile This interaction is not well conserved and is missing from some introns classified into the following structural categories bacterial classes B B2 like intron structure C novel hybrid and D unusual B like 13 However this region may be involved in protein interactions based on strong protein protections observed in this region 14 Strong protein protections are also observed in the Id4 terminal purine rich loop In fact it is these two sites in DI which exhibit the strongest LtrA protections 14 Domain II From the mobility analysis it is clear that deletions in sub domains IIa and IIb are mobile to some extent while a complete deletion of domain II is not functional 100 of the colonies picked from both deletions were true homing events 10 10 This is consistent with previous reports where Bachl and Schmelzer 1990 15 showed that a partial truncation of DII leaving a short hairpin in the intron bI1 had no pronounced effect on splicing efficiency whereas a complete deletion eliminated the reaction This was also demonstrated in aI5 16 The II ii a b deletion of nucleotides 404 459 was mobile to a small extent frequency 0 23 This region includes the interacting element indicating that it may not be essential for mobility The interaction has been primarily observed to mediate a conformational change between the two steps of splicing 17 It is also missing from some mitochondrial class A1 and bacterial classes B C and D intron structural groups which may indicate that it is not absolutely essential for splicing Domain III Many reports indicate that domain III is absolutely required for splicing in vivo and in vitro Although its exact function is unknown it has been speculated to be involved in the formation of the catalytic core 9 Besides this it was shown for the group IIB intron aI5 that the phylogenetically conserved basal stem loop contains one of the most internalized regions of the molecule 11 Here it was found that neither deletion in domain III could be tolerated Frequencies were at the background level in both cases 10 3to 10 4 and no bona fide homing events were found Domain IV Domain IV is the most variable domain and has not been shown to have a large effect on either splicing or mobility In fact the mobility frequency of the DIVb 1 2 deletion is almost 70 of the wild type intron which is the highest mobility observed for any deletion in this report In this case 10 10 colonies tested were true homing events Surprisingly the deletion of DIVa which is the primary binding site for LtrA exhibited a low level of mobility 6 10 4 although the number of true homing events was only 60 80 This is likely due to residual binding whereby LtrA recognizes other features of the intron to promote splicing and mobility 14 18 Cui and Lambowitz in preparation Domain V It had previously been reported that the invariant G at position 2 of the catalytic AGC triad in domain V was critical for self splicing in vitro and in vivo Here point mutants of this residue were made Although the mobility frequency 3 10 3 0 25 was greatly diminished G3A was the least affected presumably reflecting a requirement for a purine and or base pair at that position whereas G3C and G3U had frequencies almost 100 fold lower Interestingly it was observed upon sequencing the isolated homing products that G3C and G3U were revertants back to G the wild type nucleotide By contrast the G3A colonies were verified to involve integraton of the G3A intron For the G3C and G3U revertants the donor plasmids from these tet R colonies were also isolated and sequenced to verify that they had the original mutations In a mutational analysis of the same triad in the aI5 intron it was found that mutations at G3 were some of the more deleterious ones in DV 19 Revertants that restored base pairing were also identified Further the G3U mutant could not be rescued but the G3A mutant could suggesting that a purine is required at this position as seen in Ll LtrB Domain VI A deletion mutant of the branch point A A54 along with the other three substitution mutants A54G A54C and A54U were tested Interestingly the A54 mutant gave a frequency of 0 003 but upon sequencing the homing products no true A54 mutation was found Instead a variety of sequence changes surrounding the branch point A were observed in the homing products although the original deletion mutation remained the same in the donor plasmids Figure 3 It appears that this mutation can be rescued by many kinds of secondary mutations as indicated It was reported that group II introns could go through a hydrolytic splicing pathway to generate a linear intron even without a bulged nucleotide 20 Our findings suggest that if a linear intron is generated by hydrolytic splicing of A54 it is unable to carry out mobility Hence the branch point nucleotide is absolutely required for mobility Recently the crystal structure of a 70 nucleotide RNA containing domains V and VI of the aI5 intron was determined 21 Surprisingly it revealed 2 bulged nucleotide residues in DVI instead of one In aI5 it is the branch point A and the following 3 nucleotide which is a U that are both bulged out This appears inconsistent with the revertant sequences here which show selection for a Watson Crick base pair at the position 3 but not 5 to the branch point nucleotide Support for the observations in this report comes from work by Chu et al 2001 22 on the aI5 intron in which they propose that a 4 bp stem 3 of the branch point is one of the determinants for branch point activation Additionally they state that a G U wobble pair above the branch point is also a determinant which fits in with the observation that a non canonical pair A A or A C is found at this position in some of the revertants More recent support for this upstream weak or non pairing with simultaneous downstream pairing was observed in all lariat forming group II introns in barley chloroplasts 23 Here 13 16 introns lacked Watson Crick pairing above the branch point A and G C was the downstream base pair whenever there was an upstream A C A G or G G Additionally no barley intron was found in which the upstream Watson Crick pair coincided with a downstream G U or other weak pair All three branch point substitution mutants tested were mobile to differing extents with relatively high frequencies 0 67 2 02 indicating that any base at the branch point position can function in mobility 100 of these products were true homing events Although it is specifically the N6 amino group of the branch point A that is recognized many lines of evidence suggest that the actual base at the branch site is not required to be an A Naturally occurring introns have U 11 times followed by G 5 occurrences and C 1 occurrence Comparative RNA Web Site database http www rna icmb utexas edu In aI5 G and U at the branch point were found to allow for some branching to occur 22 Also it was observed that even if the branch point residue was paired it did not have a large effect on splicing efficiency and no effect on the choice of the branch site 20 C was also found in the branch point position in 8 25 A54 homing products From previous reports it was noted that if the branch point nucleotide was changed to a C branching was reduced 20 22 In this case it is likely that the sensitivity of our assay permits the detection of homing products Surprisingly A54G which demonstrated the highest mobility among these three substitution mutants was not found in the A54 homing products It remains elusive how the sequences were changed at positions surrounding the branch point and why only C along with wild type A were selected at the branch point despite the fact that A54G was slightly better than A54C in mobility Table 1 Two additional combinations of mutants were made One containing deletions DIVb 1 2 DII ii a b and the helix 190 204 that resulted in an intron that was 710 nts in size and a second one containing an additional deletion of domain Ib which resulted in a reduction to 694 nts However both constructs exhibited no mobility Conclusions The largest deletions that preserved Ll LtrB intron mobility were the 158 nt deletion in domain DIVb 1 2 and the 18 nt deletion in domain IIb The smallest derivative of the Ll LtrB intron that retained mobility was 725 nts resulting from the DIVb 1 2 and DII ii a b deletions 0 23 The tertiary elements whose deletion does not completely abolish mobility are alpha kappa and eta Only the G3A substitution mutant in the catalytic triad of DV was mobile while the other two mutants were revertants back to G In DVI a branch point nucleotide was found to be essential for mobility It was also observed that any nucleotide at this position supported mobility to some extent Methods Bacterial strains E coli HMS174 DE3 Novagen Madison WI was used for the genetic mobility assay The cloning strain was E coli DH5 Construction of mutants Intron deletions were made by overlapping PCR and cloned into the donor plasmid pACD2 see 24 for details This plasmid carries a ORF ORF version of the intron that contains the T7 promoter in DIV from which the tetracycline resistance tet R gene is expressed after homing takes place LtrA is also expressed from the donor plasmid but at a downstream location outside the intron In this study the donor plasmid has been further modified to contain a 158 nucleotide deletion in DIVb 1 2 It must be noted here that part of the DIVb helix substructure is maintained by the insertion of the T7 promoter Domain I deletions that were upstream of the Bsr GI site intron position 308 were cloned using the Hin dIII and Bsr GI sites on the donor plasmid Deletions downstream of the Bsr GI site and the point mutants were cloned using the Bsr GI and Pst I sites All mutants were verified by sequencing Mobility assay The genetic mobility assay was performed essentially as described in Guo et al 2000 Figure 4 25 In brief the donor plasmids carrying the mutant or wild type introns were each co transformed with a recipient plasmid pBRR3 carrying a promoterless tet R gene downstream of the target site which are the ligated exons positions 30 15 After IPTG induction 100 M 1 hour 37 C and plating on ampicillin 100 g ml tetracycline 25 g ml plates mobility events were identified as amp R tet R colonies It is important to note that both the intron RNA and LtrA protein are overproduced in this assay which might mask more subtle effects of these mutations At least 10 colonies were picked from each of the selection plates and tested by PCR to confirm true homing events The PCR primers used were Rsense recipient plasmid primer 5 ACAAATAGGGGTTCCGCGCACA 3 and LtrBAs2 intron primer 5 TTCTCCTACAGATTGTACAAATGTGG 3 In the case of deletions Id3 i 1 and Id4 the intron primer used was LtrBAs3 5 GATTCTCGGCATCGCTTTCG 3 All positive homing products were isolated and sequenced to verify the deletion In the case of DV and DVI revertants donor plasmids from the PCR positive homing events were also isolated and sequenced to verify the mutation True homing events were identified based on all of these three tests selection on plates containing ampicillin and tetracycline followed by PCR verification and sequencing Note This
