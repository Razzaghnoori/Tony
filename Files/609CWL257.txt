 January 1996 Dear Friend For 18 years I have had the tremendous opportunity to be an actor at the Indiana Repertory Theatre One of the joys of being an actor is having an opportunity to talk with members of the audience following a performance One such event occurred last season Following a show a young couple came up to the stage to say hello They said they both felt they knew me like an old friend because they d been coming to see IRT shows since their high school days In fact even though they had gone to separate schools each one s first experience with live theatre was an IRT production I was delighted at their vivid recollections of some of my favorite shows at the IRT Midsummer Night s Dream and You Can t Take It With You They said that because of those high school trips to the IRT they have made professional theatre an integral part of their cultural lives So many people have told me that seeing a play as a student literally opened their eves and minds to a whole new world a world of imagination more powerful than any futuristic movie or television sit com As adults they crave that potent mix of actor playwright and audience which is the magic of live theatre It s that magic I am asking you to keep alive and well for all children in the state of Indiana Fully professional fully produced theatre has made a difference to children like Becky Stephanie Marcus Emily and their classmates from across the state of Indiana I ve enclosed letters they and some of their teachers have written us Please read them They touched my heart and I know they ll touch yours The one thing I am most proud of is that the IRT is a leader across the country in providing theatre experiences for students The work the IRT does with teachers and students has a profound impact on their lives Most important is the fact that attending a performance at the IRT is not just a field trip The IRT has staff educators artists and a statewide Student Teacher Advisory Committee that carefully plan all the education programs The plays which are performed are selected because they have a specific link to what is being studied in the classroom Whether its a literature topic a humanities issue or an important person in history every play has a direct tie in to classroom curriculum The education programs at the IRT are more comprehensive than any other performing arts organization in the state of Indiana and possibly the nation A full array of educational services are incorporated to enhance the learning experience for the students including Printed study guides and detailed audio visual materials Docent or artist pre performance classroom visits Behind the scenes tours of the theatre s workshops and rehearsal areas An extensive slide show library on a variety of theatre topics Pre performance teacher workshops and Direct contact with artists and actors through post performance question and answer sessions I am writing to ask for your direct assistance in educating a child With a donation of 50 100 250 or whatever you can give to the IRT you can play a role in the development of a young person through the educational outreach programs at the Indiana Repertory Theatre Each year between 45 000 and 50 000 students from over 800 schools in 60 Indiana counties culminate their lessons on a variety of topics by coming to the IRT to see a play Because we re committed to provide these education services donations must be sought to off set ticket discounts we give to students Ticket income doesn t begin to cover the cost of these programs We need your assistance as your generosity allows us to keep these programs affordable to schools and students You can help directly A gift of 50 allows 10 students to receive discounted tickets to an IRT performance A gift of 100 provides an entire classroom with study guides and other curriculum materials Take a moment right now to consider a gift of 50 100 250 or whatever you can give to the IRT It means everything to me to ask for your support It means everything to Becky Stephanie Marcus and Emily and students like them You can make the difference TODAY I look forward to hearing from you Best Wishes Priscilla Lindsay Actor and Educator Indiana Repertory Theatre P S From the bottom of my heart thank you You can make the difference today with your check Theatre allows students to experience worlds outside their own and to see their classroom studies come to life To continue to impact the lives of Indiana s students with first class theatre productions that support and enhance their academic and personal growth your support is needed TODAY
