 Poverty Lawyers Poorer Than Ever Disparity in Salaries Far Greater Now By Thomas Adcock New York Law Journal March 8 2002 It was hardly the most enlightened of times not with the conflict in Indochina rapidly becoming America s costliest and most divisive war Yet simultaneously there was the social activism of the Warren Court and a national administration moved to declare a more worthy campaign in 1964 the War on Poverty It was a time when progressive young lawyers began a long struggle not yet won for the right of all poor people to free and effective legal counsel They are today s grayheads of the poverty law bench as the new generation of public service lawyers affectionately call them a generation whose idealism comes at a far steeper price at least on the surface Daniel L Greenberg remembers a negligible difference in the average annual starting pay for poverty lawyers and their counterparts at big Manhattan firms 6 500 and 7 500 respectively The year was 1969 said Mr Greenberg president and attorney in chief of the Legal Aid Society of New York That year one firm doubled the starting salary and then the others quickly followed suit said Mr Greenberg In part the firms were saying that they were losing the best and the brightest to use the phrase of the time to the emerging new legal services Nowadays a poverty lawyer working for one of New York s many agencies representing the indigent including Legal Aid the South Brooklyn Legal Services the Lawyers Alliance for New York InMotion the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights Volunteers of Legal Service the Bronx Defenders and New York Lawyers for the Public Interest might begin his or her career at 32 000 per annum compared with the 125 000 average first year associate salary at the city s larger firms Which is not to say that youthful idealism collapsed with the incredible inflation of private law firm salaries There are reasons why people do this work it s about larger things you believe in said Lynn Vogelstein a documentary filmmaker who is now a staff attorney practicing family law at South Brooklyn Legal Services As a filmmaker she said I was somewhat frustrated because the social impact is very indirect My cases present me with incredibly interesting legal and intellectual issues about the role of government in people s lives the responsibility the state has in our lives the intrusion of the state into people s lives I m confronted by such issues every day said Ms Vogelstein 36 a 1997 graduate of New York University School of Law Sometimes people think you re a do gooder and making this big sacrifice but the thing is I get to practice at so many different levels which is something a lot of young lawyers in private practice don t realize Katherine R Locker 29 knew her calling from childhood growing up with a sister who suffered developmental disabilities Ms Locker became a teacher then later went to Harvard Law School Today she runs her own pilot project within the Juvenile Rights Division of Legal Aid Families like mine need lawyers even if they don t have the means said Ms Locker supervising attorney for the Kathryn A McDonald Education Advocacy Project named for the late administrator of the New York City Family Courts With the help of a paralegal and two staff attorneys her project has a broader vision of legal advocacy We spend a lot of time going to schools and negotiating with the hope of resolving problems before litigation With the appropriate services people can surpass what s expected of them At age 48 Sean Delany executive director of Lawyers Alliance for New York which provides business services to non profit organizations holds a perspective midway between the grayheads and the new breed of poverty lawyer When he was at the University of Virginia School of Law in the late 1970s Mr Delany said Tuition was modest 1 500 per semester Today not only do law school graduates forego the opportunities of a large salary but they have these enormous tuition debt burdens A graduate of a top tier law school may carry a debt burden of as much as 100 000 Some schools certainly not all credit a portion of tuition debt in return for public law service And last August the American Bar Association created a Commission on Loan Repayment and Forgiveness to formulate ways to expand such credits beyond the relative handful of schools offering such help usually the more well endowed campuses such as NYU Law Harvard Law Columbia Law School and Yale Law School But no national standard of debt forgiveness is even near at hand and the help that now exists does not mean that young poverty lawyers do not worry about what they owe I m in a huge overwhelming sea of debt said Jennifer Arons 28 a criminal defense staff attorney at Manhattan Legal Aid So the money thing s tough She chose NYU Law over Columbia specifically because NYU would cover more of her tuition And she chose public interest law because otherwise I would have been ostracized My parents were Marxists and so were my grandparents Ms Arons and her office mate Stephanie Schwartz make something of a political odd couple at Legal Aid While Ms Arons was a so called red diaper baby Ms Schwartz s mother is Carol Schwartz a law and order Republican on the Council of the District of Columbia They try to see her as less of a Republican said Ms Schwartz of her mother My father was a corporate lawyer and he hated it They re both proud of my underdog work Our criminal justice system is scary Most who have to go through it are poor people of color I worked in a prosecutor s office one summer I decided I could never be a prosecutor Like Ms Locker Michael A Rothenberg of New York Lawyers for the Public Interest became hooked on trying to make a difference as he put it while growing up with a learning disabled sibling I watched my parents struggle to get my brother the services he needed said Mr Rothenberg 37 who is now executive director for New York Lawyers Even with my father being a lawyer it was tough Early in his public law career as a staff counsel for South Brooklyn Legal Services Mr Rothenberg worked as co counsel with his father Stanley Rothenberg a partner at Moses Singer LLP Father and son made a successful appeal before a Social Security administrative board on behalf a learning disabled client My family was able to help me with school said Mr Rothenberg a graduate of NYU Law So unlike the truly new generation I wasn t faced with the debt burden But public service wasn t something I thought about he said I knew what I wanted to do and money wasn t the issue Issue of Money For better or for worse money can be an issue for young public interest lawyers whether or not they have debts Can you really live on 32 500 in New York City Mr Rothenberg asked It s do able but it s hard and there are sacrifices I m looking at ways to raise salaries John Chip Gray Jr the project director at South Brooklyn Legal Services and at 59 a veteran of poverty law said he likes to find lawyers in private practice willing to scale back To cut your income by two thirds or more now that takes character said Mr Gray We get them that way sometimes I wasn t much interested in being a corporate lawyer My mother was a Legal Aid attorney in Boston when I was growing up in the 50s said Mr Gray Your mother s a big influence on you So it was an easy decision for me But there are a lot of people who have to fight their parents to do something like this condemning themselves to limited income It takes real commitment to the importance of the work said Mr Gray Which I find fascinating on a substantive legal basis All public law services depend on pro bono work by the private firms and nearly every New York firm contributes especially in the wake of Sept 11 We try to involve our lawyers in pro bono right from the start of their careers said Christopher K Tahbaz 37 a partner at Debevoise Plimpton It s an important part of what a lawyer in private practice should be doing Lately Mr Gray and his fellow grayheads have been discussing the question With the increasing disparity in salaries between public and private law is it more difficult to recruit and hire the kind of idealistic young lawyers who seemed to be everywhere in the 60s For his part Mr Gray answered No I haven t noticed that
