 The Bill Gates Kool Aid Test Dear Kara Sorry to get such a late start today I find when I m starting out on a new story as has been the case the last couple of days I have a hard time even reading the newspapers much less absorbing the information contained within I m too preoccupied too panicked I always feel as though I m starting way too late and I ll never be able to pull it off and that this will be the story that finally exposes me for the fraud that I really am My wife thinks this is an utterly absurd way to go through life for which I can offer no defense but a helpless shrug I used to think that I would get over this feeling now I know better Anyway I did want to pick up on two threads from your message this morning First on the question of Bill Gates it strikes me as completely unarguable that his living icon status has been a tremendous asset to Microsoft or at least it did until the antitrust trial began First he s a founder who is much more a businessman than a technologist he doesn t like to hear that but it s true so he gets to command the respect that founders command within companies while also having the set of skills rarely seen in founders that are required to manage very big companies It helps a lot that his employees will follow him over a cliff The classic example was when he woke up one day and decided that Microsoft needed to devote all its energies to the Internet The entire company had to shift on a dime and promising projects which people had devoted years to were scrapped because they didn t relate to the Internet At a typical big company there would have been enormous resistance But at Microsoft there wasn t so much as a whisper of complaint Everybody simply got with the program because by God that s what Bill wanted Competitors like to say that Microsoft employees take the Kool Aid but they probably all wish they had at least a little of that Kool Aid themselves During the antitrust trial though you could see the problem with that lack of independent thinking Gates deposition was a true abomination he was churlish and evasive and precisely because he is so clearly the embodiment of his company he hurt Microsoft s cause a great deal But no one at Microsoft could admit that obvious truth Instead they blamed it on the Feds for asking bad questions and the press for writing stories that simply said out loud what we were seeing with our own eyes And most of the subsequent Microsoft witnesses brought to the trial the same set of characteristics that were so vividly on display during the Gates deposition defensiveness arrogance an unwillingness to say anything straightforwardly Fairly or not they all looked as though they had something to hide just as Bill had It s such an insular culture ultimately that Microsoft people have trouble even grasping questions that are posed from a non Microsoft point of view The great virtue of Ken Auletta s New Yorker piece on the trial is that it really illustrated that point wonderfully Ken would constantly ask Gates simple sensible questions and would get an uncomprehending rant from Gates in return Sigh Speaking of abominations the Waco disclosure certainly ranks as one on so many levels Not long after the event an old Texas friend of mine Dick J Reavis went to work on a book about it He was convinced that the government had behaved badly an attitude I foolish wrote off as part of his generally anti government bias Boy was I ever wrong and was he ever right Over the years it has become increasingly clear that Waco was a disaster that should never have happened It gives solace to the off the grid crowd It s scary that the FBI will tell lies for six years six years before someone with firsthand knowledge is willing to tell the truth I can t stand people who play to those who view the government as one giant secret conspiracy Oliver Stone for instance But at moments like this one it is hard to argue with them Oh and one other thing Isn t this just another reminder that Janet Reno ranks among the worst attorneys general of all time Sure seems that way to me
