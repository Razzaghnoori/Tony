 Introduction BALB c mice immunized with human cartilage proteoglycan PG aggrecan develop arthritis 1 2 3 4 Autoantibody production precedes the first clinical symptoms of arthritis 5 While these anti PG autoantibodies alone do not transfer arthritis autoantibodies significantly hasten the onset of disease and cause PG to be released from the cartilage 6 7 B cells proliferate and differentiate into immunoglobulin secreting plasma cells under the influence of a combination of cytokines derived from T cells 8 IL 4 a T helper Th 2 cytokine regulates the switch from IgM D to IgG1 and IgE in activated B cells 9 10 However the in vivo dependency on IL 4 for the IgG1 response is controversial 11 12 13 The Th1 cytokine IFN is important in vitro and in vivo for enhancement of IgG2a secretion 14 15 Th1 and Th2 cytokines also function to cross regulate Ig isotypes For example IFN antagonizes IL 4 induced IgG1 responses at the level of IgG1 transcription 16 17 whereas IL 4 has the ability to suppress IFN driven IgG2a responses 16 We have previously shown that PG specific antibodies increase the severity of arthritis and that PG induced arthritis is a Th1 type disease dominated by IFN 4 We therefore were interested in finding out how IFN and IL 4 regulate isotype expression of the PG specific antibodies and if an autoantibody isotype contributes to the severity of disease Materials and methods Animals BALB c and IFN deficient mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory Bar Harbor ME USA BALB c heterozygous and homozygous nude mice were obtained from the National Cancer Institute Frederick MD USA Breeding pairs of BALB c IL 4 deficient mice were obtained from Klinische Forschergruppe f r Rheumatologie Freiburg Germany CD40 deficient BALB c mice were purchased from Taconic Germantown NY USA Preparation of cartilage PG monomer aggrecan and immunization Human cartilage was obtained during joint replacement surgery and high density PG was prepared as described elsewhere 1 5 Female BALB c mice wild type or gene deficient were injected intraperitoneally on days 0 21 and 42 with 100 g of human cartilage PG measured as protein in adjuvant as described elsewhere 1 2 5 Measurement of immunoglobulin isotypes Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA was used to measure isotype specific antibodies in serial dilutions 1 1000 to 1 62 500 of sera ELISA plates were coated with either 0 5 g human PG or 1 g mouse PG as described elsewhere 5 18 PG specific IgG isotypes were detected with peroxidase labeled rabbit anti mouse IgG1 or IgG2a Zymed Laboratories San Francisco CA USA IgG1 and IgG2a myeloma proteins were used for a standard curve Assessment of cytokine production by spleen cells in vitro Spleens were obtained 1 week after the third injection with PG as described elsewhere 4 Cells were stimulated in the presence or absence of PG 20 g ml and a capture ELISA was used to measure the released cytokines IFN IL 4 and IL 10 4 Assessment of arthritis The severity of arthritis in each paw was graded according to an established scoring system 3 5 as follows 0 normal 1 mild erythema and or swelling usually in one or two toes 2 moderate erythema and or swelling of the paw 3 more diffuse erythema 4 severe erythema and swelling affecting the entire paw maximum score for the four paws 16 Inflammation and joint swelling were recorded twice a week by the same individual in a blinded manner Statistical analysis The Mann Whitney U test was used to compare nonparametric data for statistical significance P values less than 0 05 were considered significant Results PG specific IgG1 isotype dominates despite a higher ratio of IFN to IL 4 BALB c mice immunized with human PG generated a PG specific IgG1 isotype response which was significantly higher than the PG specific IgG2a isotype Fig 1a However when the production of Th1 and Th2 cytokines was measured from splenocytes of animals immunized with PG IFN was produced at a significantly higher concentration than either IL 4 or IL 10 Fig 1a These results reveal a dichotomy between the isotype of the PG specific antibody response IgG1 and the secretion of IFN The discrepancy could be reconciled if the PG specific IgG1 response is independent of T cells We therefore assessed the PG specific response in heterozygous and homozygous nude mice and in CD40 deficient mice Whereas heterozygous nude mice generated essentially the same antibody response to PG as wild type mice Fig 1b no or very little anti PG antibody was detected in homozygous nude or CD40 deficient mice Fig 1b These results show that the human and murine PG specific antibody responses are dependent on the interaction between T cells and B cells IL 4 and IFN regulation of the PG specific IgG1 IgG2a isotype response To find out if the PG specific IgG1 response is dependent on IL 4 we immunized IL 4 deficient mice with PG and measured the PG specific IgG1 and IgG2a isotypes Whereas the IgG1 response to human PG was unaffected Fig 2a the loss of IL 4 significantly reduced the IgG1 response to mouse PG in IL 4 deficient mice Fig 2b The most striking observation however was the dramatic increase in PG specific IgG2a response in IL 4 deficient mice There was a sixfold increase in the IgG2a response in the absence of IL 4 Fig 2a b These results show that the PG specific IgG1 response was marginally dependent on IL 4 whereas endogenous IL 4 dramatically suppressed the PG specific IgG2a response To find out if IFN induced a PG specific IgG2a response in vivo the PG specific IgG2a response was examined in IFN deficient mice The IgG2a antibody responses to both human and mouse PGs were lower in these mice than in wild type mice Fig 2a b These results show that the PG specific IgG2a response was dependent on IFN If IFN concentrations regulated IgG1 reduction in IFN should be permissive for IgG1 in IFN deficient mice however there was no increase in IgG1 response to either human or mouse PG Fig 2a b Arthritis is associated with an increase in IgG2a We studied the induction of arthritis in mice deficient in IL 4 and IFN to find out if there is a correlation between the isotype of the antibody and disease In wild type and IL 4 deficient mice paw swelling began 11 6 6 6 days after the last injection with PG whereas in the IFN deficient mice swelling began much later at 36 8 6 2 days Table 1 The incidences of arthritis in wild type and IL 4 deficient mice were much higher than in the PG immunized IFN deficient mice and the arthritis score was significantly higher in the IL 4 deficient than in the wild type animals Table 1 In IFN deficient mice not only was the proportion of animals with arthritis lower than in the other groups but also their reduced susceptibility was further mirrored in the significantly less severe paw swelling Table 1 These data show that endogenous cytokine concentrations dramatically affect both the onset and the severity of inflammation Discussion Because PG induced arthritis is dominated by IFN it is considered to be a Th1 type disease 4 18 Paradoxically we observed higher concentrations of the IgG1 isotype than of the IgG2a isotype To resolve this apparent paradox we examined the anti PG responses in cytokine deficient animals We found that in the absence of IL 4 the PG specific IgG1 isotype was only minimally affected These in vivo experiments are very different from those describing a dramatic in vitro effect of IL 4 on IgG1 induction 9 10 but are similar to other studies that showed partial elimination of IgG1 in vivo either using neutralizing antibodies to IL 4 or blocking the IL 4 receptor with antibodies 11 12 13 19 One possibility was that the large carbohydrate content of PG might have a promoting interaction with B cells in a mitogen like manner thus permitting production of IgG1 However nude mice and CD40 deficient mice did not generate a PG specific IgG1 response and such a response was also independent of IFN Taken together these results are in contrast to the IL 4 dictated IgG1 switch response Rather they suggest that the PG specific IgG1 response at least in BALB c mice may be regulated in vivo by other as yet unidentified cytokine s 8 20 21 22 In contrast to IgG1 the expression of IgG2a isotype showed a strong inverse correlation with the concentration of endogenous IL 4 In the absence of IL 4 the IgG2a response was six times greater than in wild type mice This finding demonstrates that IL 4 plays a critical role in regulating the PG specific IgG2a response The role of this cytokine in the suppression of IgG2a in vivo has not been well studied The IgG2a response was only minimally enhanced after in vivo treatment with anti IL 4 antibody 8 but it was increased in immunized IL 4 deficient mice 23 Since there is no evidence that IL 4 directly inhibits IgG2a transcription in B cells this cytokine very likely suppresses the IFN response either directly or indirectly Indeed the significant reduction of the PG specific IgG2a response in the absence of IFN suggests that the response is controlled by this interferon We have found that the development of PG specific antibodies correlates with the development of arthritis and that PG specific autoantibodies increase the severity of disease We show here that mice deficient in IL 4 develop arthritis that is significantly more severe than in wild type animals The pathogenic role of IgG2a antibody was also described in a model of autoimmune hemolytic anemia 24 however these IgG2a autoantibodies were not pathogenic in mice that are deficient in Fc receptor III 24 These two observations taken together suggest the possibility that the IgG2a PG specific autoantibodies elicit a pathogenic effect through an Fc receptor mediated mechanism PG induced arthritis is considered a Th1 type disease characterized by a higher ratio of IFN to IL 4 4 Our finding that treatment with IL 4 inhibits IFN suggests that IL 4 could mediate a shift from a Th1 to a Th2 response in vivo 4 In addition to the effects of IL 4 on antibody production this cytokine inhibits Th1 responses including IFN and macrophage production of proinflammatory cytokines 25 26 An increase in inflammatory cytokine production in IL 4 deficient mice may also contribute to exacerbation of PG induced arthritis In adjuvant arthritis which may not be dependent on antibodies disease is increased in the absence of IL 4 27 This finding suggests that IL 4 inhibits adjuvant arthritis by its anti inflammatory properties and not by an alteration in isotype expression Paradoxically in collagen induced arthritis CIA disease is suppressed in IL 4 deficient mice 28 CIA is also different from PG induced arthritis in regard to IFN In CIA and some other organ specific autoimmune diseases IFN functions in a protective role so that in IFN deficient mice disease is exacerbated 29 30 Whether the difference between PG induced arthritis and CIA is due to the autoantigen or to genetic differences in mouse strains is not clear at present Conclusion Th1 and Th2 cytokines regulate PG specific autoantibody IgG isotypes and susceptibility to arthritis In the absence of IL 4 the production of PG specific IgG2a isotype was dramatically enhanced and disease was significantly more severe IL 4 may exert its effect through IFN since in IFN deficient mice both the PG specific IgG2a response and arthritis were suppressed The correlation between PG specific autoantibody isotype and development of arthritis suggests a pathological role for IgG2a isotype in disease
