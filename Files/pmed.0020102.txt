                            One of the most fundamental human rights is the assumption that each person matters and        everyone deserves to be treated with dignitythis is the tenet from which all other human        rights flow Another is that those who are most vulnerable deserve special protection        However in many developing countries vast numbers of children are born but never counted        and their health and welfare throughout their lives remains unknown And because        singlemean measures of population health mask inequalities among the bestoff and        worstoff the health of vulnerable populations is not effectively documented and        acknowledged Health information systems can play an important role in supporting these        rights by documenting and tracking health and health inequities and by creating a platform        for action and accountability        A human rights approach to health information systems also supports effective health        development To effectively improve population health governments and communities need        access to socioeconomically disaggregated population health data Because the relationship        between such information and human rights has received little attention the two areas of        health information systems and human rights have done little to support each other                    The Health Metrics Network        The Health Metrics Network HMN is a global collaboration focused on strengthening        country health information systems to generate sound data for decisionmaking at country        and global levels see httpwwwwhointhealthmetricsen Its interim secretariat is        based at the World Health Organisation The development group of HMN recently considered        strategies for strengthening health information systems within countries The Equity        Working Group of HMN made recommendations that outlined the content of equitysensitive        information systems identified opportunities for minimizing collection burdens and        suggested strategies to foster an equityoriented decisionmaking culture Although the        recommendations were implicitly focused on human rights and on improving opportunity for        the worstoff populations making that framework explicit helps us to acknowledge and        clarify the values on which decisions for developing information systems are made The        framework is based on several principles rooted in human rights and their implied actions        see Sidebar                    Every Individual Matters        Despite the acknowledged importance of counting everyone only  of the  WHO member        states almost all of which are developed countries have vital registration systems that        report on births and deaths for at least  of the population Consequently a primary        recommendation from the Equity Working Group is that health information systems should        support the most basic acknowledgment of human rightsones existenceby counting births        and deaths in every country through a vital registration system Figure                     Opportunities and the Means to Health        A persons human rights are recognized to include a standard of living adequate for the        health and wellbeing of himself and of his family including food clothing housing and        medical care and necessary social services and the right to security in the event oflack        of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control  In other words the means necessary        to achieve health are part and parcel of a right to health However many country studies        have repeatedly shown that there are large gaps between the opportunities of advantaged and        disadvantaged subpopulations For example in South Africa average household expenditure        for whites was five times the rate for blacks in  and female children in Bangladesh        were less likely to be brought to clinic than their male counterparts  Examples        demonstrating inequalities between various economic ethnic genderbased and other social        groups are replicated time and time again in all countries         Of  countries  have a health information system sufficient to support basic        analysis of socioeconomic inequalities and health Such a health information system would        include the vital registration system coupled with a major household survey Ninety        countries have only a census an old household survey or no data at all whereas the        remaining countries fall into a middling category a census and a recent household        survey or two household surveys L Bambas P Braveman N Dachs I Delgado E        Gakidou et al unpublished data        The two issues of health inequalities and human rights overlap in a number of ways that        enrich a perspective on health as a human right A human rights framework can inform a        minimally acceptable level of data collection in health information systemsthat is a core        set of equity indicatorsas well as the conditions surrounding the release and use of that        data In contrast to individual measures of health inequalities populations as units of        analysis are especially useful for examining achievement of human rights as well as        identifying health inequities since they indicate patterns of differential opportunity in        society among various social strata A human rightsoriented indicator of health        inequalities then would be composed of two measures  A health measure including        health status health care and other determinants of health or the social economic        consequences of ill health and  A measure of social positionadvantage also called an        equity stratifier or social stratifier that defines strata in a hierarchy eg income or        economic assets education sex or ethnic group        Health differences across social strata in comparison with the most advantaged group or        an absolute standard suggest inequities in health  This interpretation of health        inequities directly coincides with a human rights framework since it focuses on a broad        concept of health as well as on means to and opportunities for health Critical issues of        methodology for using these indicators also need attention including identification of        appropriate measures of social position and how to meaningfully compare indicators across        countries        Consequently the Equity Working Group recommended that health information systems        should include the information necessary to create equity indicators and that research        into methodologies should be given due attention On a practical level equity strata and        health indicators can be integrated into a number of existing data sources including        censuses vital registries household surveys small areas data and administrative data        sources Such empirical information not only clarifies distributions of health and        achievement of rights but can also identify barriers to health and provide insights on        multisectoral approaches in planning and interventions to support the most vulnerable        populations                    Accountability and Autonomy        When equitysensitive information is collected access to information is often        restricted to the government and is rarely disaggregated to show differences between        socioeconomic groups But a human rights approach to health information implies not only        particular content but also mechanisms to promote the effective use of information        including the public release of data in a useful form        Confidentiality and privacy issues arise in relation to information disaggregated by        equity stratifiers especially in the context of the public release of such data There are        strong arguments for the public release of health equity information including the fact        that such information is a determinant of health and that civil society can play a vital        role in improving health opportunities both directly and by influencing governmental        priorities The publics general lack of knowledge regarding patterns of health        inequalities and their causes within societies further supports the need for the public        release of such information        If information is disaggregated for very small populations such as within a village        particular individuals or households may be identifiable and feel their privacy rights were        impinged upon Therefore the public release of equityoriented information on health        should be explicitly planned for in the development of health information systems        Principles to guide release of disaggregated data should be followed and communities        should have a voice in the decision to release highly disaggregated information when        privacy rights might be compromised The HMN Equity Working Group suggests development of        international standards for collection and sharing of disaggregated data and its use Given        the potential conflict between the two interests we should continue to investigate        possible technologic andor policy solutions                    Mutual Responsibility        Another mechanism for promoting the effective use of information is to support cultures        of equityoriented decisionmaking In addition to the public release of information        strategies should include supporting research on pathways of health inequities and        interventions building capacity for analyzing information and developing interventions        encouraging demand for equitysensitive data in government and the public and supporting        broad participation in the promotion of health equity        Standards for improvements and target dates for achieving a minimally acceptable        information system should take into account differences in the resources and needs of those        implementing changes The Equity Working Group recommended that target dates be developed        with countries to define and integrate core equity indicators into routine information        sources All countries should be able to achieve within the next  years at least the        middlelevel information system which could be considered a minimum standard However the        rationale for this standard is predicated on the assumption of significant financial and        technical support being given to the effort and on the least welloff countries receiving        the most support L Bambas P Braveman N Dachs I Delgado E Gakidou et al        unpublished data                    Conclusion        These recommendations provide a strategy for strengthening decision and policymaking        by providing a stronger empirical base for human rights considerations This        equityoriented empirical base could strengthen health rights not only through health        sector decisionmaking but also through decisionmaking in sectors related to        determinants        The initial development stage of the HMN has now ended and hopefully the refinement and        implementation stages of the effort will begin within the next year Regardless of the        existence of a centralized effort countries would greatly promote health rights by        integrating equity issues into health information systems releasing that information        publicly and supporting participation and decisionmaking attentive to the concerns of        health equity and human rights
