 The Bandwagon Defect Hello Fred Well after our moment of concord let s give the crowd what it came for Are you ready to rummmmmmmmbbbbbllle Actually let s talk about concord a little more Maybe the most surprising thing about Michael Lind s book is what has not occurred When I heard that it was coming out and what its title was I thought Oh no here we go again I was remembering the rancor that followed two previous revisionist works on Vietnam by Norman Podhoretz and Richard Nixon to say nothing of Robert McNamara s 25 years after the fact revelation that he d made a little mistake back in the 60s Each of these books seemed to zoom us straight back in time to all the anger of that era Disclosure I was really in a lather about McNamara s book and did a very bitter denunciation of it on NPR I said essentially if you didn t speak up when it could have made a difference Mr Secretary you should have the decency to remain silent now Chances are I attacked the other books too Bonus disclosure As is no secret I was in the antiwar protest movement in the 60s and avoided being drafted in 1970 by deliberately failing a physical In fact Lind s book has received mainly positive reviews and not all from publications in the stab in the back camp It s conceivable that the calmer reception has to do strictly with the book and its author These other writers were public figures during the war Lind was a schoolboy They wrote as if they had scores to settle reviewers often settled scores right back But factors like these can t be the whole explanation One of the things I don t like in the book is a long chapter debunking myths of Vietnam e g that the Khmer Rouge were OK until U S bombing of Cambodia drove them berserk Many of Lind s specific points are reasonable but it s the one place where he has a categorically dismissive rather than explanatory tone The journalists were all dupes so were the lefties this is a picture of the antiwar movement similar to the protestors mental picture of Johnson McNamara and Rostow That this hasn t yet created a flap may mean that people haven t noticed Or it may mean that the emotional steam has gone out of the whole subject If so I think the rise of John McCain has a lot to do with it Or it could just be actuarial forces The median age in the United States is just over 30 so most Americans have no personal memory whatsoever of this episode On to the disagreement There is so much in this book that I d like to go into 20 different themes that it raises But one is most important and it s the main one where I disagree both with you and with Lind To recap The two great axioms of the book are 1 Great powers constantly test each other for dominance and if one side shrinks from a fight even a symbolic one as in Vietnam its perceived weakness will cascade into real weakness as other countries classify it as a loser But also 2 the United States will stomach wars other than total wars against Hitler only as long as the casualty rate is low On No 1 for reasons we just don t have space for here I think that Lind presents the bandwagon effect of weakness in too sweeping and mechanistic a way But that s because I belong to the camp he s specifically arguing against the minimal realists who think the country doesn t have to accept every symbolic challenge Lind presents No 2 not as a failing of America as he hardly could having written before about the evils of an overclass that avoids military service and public obligations but as a realistic factor to bear in mind when the country makes commitments As an important corollary to No 2 Lind argues unlike many conservatives that the United States couldn t have fought Vietnam in a really really casualty sparing way with all out attacks on the North because China and the Soviet Union would have backed North Vietnam up When you put these together you end up with the contention that it was better to have gone in casualties and all than to have avoided the fight early The clinching evidence is supposed to be that Southeast Asia is in better shape than if we hadn t fought Now I love Southeast Asia I lived for two years in Malaysia which beat its own Communist uprising a decade before Vietnam But even accepting for purposes of argument that America s war spared Malaysia and its neighbors from invasion it wasn t worth it We are marveling at an end to rancor after 25 years which shows how terrible the damage was within the United States The clinching argument on my side comes you will be pleased to hear from Ronald Reagan Lind presents the Reagan years as the time of a revived Cold War which he endorses as a way to offset the bandwagon of weakness that followed the collapse of Saigon But Reagan was unbelievably conscious of the need to avoid U S casualties This was the president who pulled out of Lebanon after Marines were bombed there So he clearly found a way to project a bandwagon of strength without putting U S troops on the line Sounds like effective minimal realism to me
