 WHAT TO DO SHOPPING The demise of Communism in 1989 and the move to a free market economy have had a dramatic impact on Poland as a shopping destination Drab state owned stores are a thing of the past The dollar and mark and other currencies don t go as far today as they once did but foreign visitors and their Polish counterparts can only be pleased with the opening of trade and vastly improved selection of goods on the market In major cities like Warsaw and Krak w Poland doesn t lag far behind Western Europe and North America for commercial opportunities Even with the end of Communism and inflation Poland remains considerably cheaper than Western European destinations Where to Shop Poland s development of a market economy has produced a proliferation of stores and boutiques including many imported from Western Europe and North America You can now buy most Western goods in large and modern department stores specialty shops and market stalls For folk art and other handicrafts start at branches of Cepelia stores a chain of folk art and souvenir shops in large cities Occasionally they go by different names even though locals invariably call them Cepelia For antiques the dominant player is the Desa chain though there are many smaller independent dealers as well In Krak w and Warsaw there are numerous branches all with different stock so it pays to visit a few if you re looking for a particular item There are essentially three places in the country for Polish poster art in Krak w Galeria Plakatu Krak w ul Stolarska 8 10 and in Warsaw Galeria Plakatu ul Hoza 40 and the Poster Museum Muzeum Plakatu at Wilan w Palace Specialty shopping markets and unique venues exist in several cities These include the famous long standing Cloth Hall stalls loaded with crafts and amber jewelry in Krak w Warsaw s swank boutique lined ul Nowy wiat and ul Mariacka in Gdansk s Main town for amber jewelry Open air markets and bazaars include in Warsaw Dziesieciolecia stadium in Praga across the river actually held in a stadium and Kolo Bazaar in Wola in Krak w the traders market between the train station and the Barbican and in Gdansk Kupcy Dominikanscy on Pl Dominikanski 1 Good sources for local shops and markets in Warsaw Krak w and Gdansk are the local editions of the In Your Pocket guide which features individual store listings Bargaining is generally only acceptable at the large open air markets though if you ask for a discount at an antiques store or art gallery you may very well be granted one What to Buy Amber Amber is not a semi precious stone but a fossilized tree resin Still it is very attractive and available in many shades from yellow to brown and grades of clarity The cities near the Baltic Sea Gdansk and Gdynia have an abundance of amber and excellent rosters of shops often dealing in one of a kind jewelry pieces Amber is a very popular stone in Poland as well as a popular export Be careful not to buy amber on the street as it is likely to be fake look for a sign of the Amber Association of Poland Societas Svccinorvm in Polonia in shop windows as a guarantee of quality and authenticity Art Antiques You ll find excellent antique furnishings and religious art throughout Poland though the best pieces tend to wind up in the wide spectrum of shops and galleries in Warsaw and Krak w and to a lesser extent cities like Gdansk and Poznan Religious icons from the Orthodox Church in Russia can be found although a large black market in stolen icons exists throughout Central and Eastern Europe and officials are understandably touchy about their export even when the item in question is not originally from Poland Ceramics Pottery Distinctive Kashubian pottery and that known as Ceramika Artystyczna Boleslawiec are sold the world over but are considerably cheaper in Poland They re not as ubiquitous though as one might expect Folk Art Rustic Poland excels at folk art and handicrafts including hand carved wooden usually religious figures leather goods from the Tatra mountains embroidery and lace hand painted eggs especially at Christmas and colorful na ve art and glass paintings especially that of Zakopane Music Compact discs from Polish composers are available in record shops in major cities The most recognizable to Western listeners are composers such as Fr d ric Chopin the father of Polish music as well as Krzysztof Penderecki and Henryk G recki who unexpectedly scored an international best seller with his Symphony No 3 in the early 1990s A contemporary film composer Zbigniew Preisner who wrote the scores for the Polish director Krzysztof Kie lowski s films including The Double Life of Veronika Dekalogue and the Three Colors trilogy Red White and Blue is worth seeking out Of special note is a recording of the best of Preisner recorded live in the Wieliczka Salt Mine outside of Krak w You can also find recordings of Polish folk music such as traditional g rale tunes from the Tatra highlands Poster Art The art of poster making for film theater and opera is a still thriving and valued art form in Poland and some of the finest poster artists in the world are Polish as they have been since the 1950s You ll find vintage and contemporary posters for familiar Western films and the greatest hits of theater and opera as well as more obscure titles Among the stars of contemporary poster art are G rowsky Stasys and Sadowski Vodka If you d like to take back an authentic bottle of Polish vodka or w dka pronounced voot ka look for Wyborowa Zytnia or any of the

obvious place to take children perhaps and in fact few foreigners who haven t been posted overseas in Poland seem to do it Traveling with children in Poland is a matter of being flexible creative and putting together disparate activities to keep the kids interested when palaces castles and rebuilt old towns impress them less than they do their parents Many of the activities listed below are in the capital Warsaw where there is simply a greater abundance of facilities To begin with the most obvious option the Warsaw Zoo ul Ratuszowa 1 3 Tel 619 40 41 www warszawa um gov pl zoo has been going

are many facilities ideal for children including a manmade ski slope and a exhilerating toboggan run For older kids that enjoy hiking and skiing the area around Zakopane in the Tatra mountains is the best in Poland Among traditional sights two stand out as especially appealing or educational for children The 700 year old Wieliczka Salt Mine near Krak w where you first descend 378 steps then traipse through long corridors and see chapels and figures including the Seven Dwarves entirely carved out of salt and finally zoom up to ground level via a fast and slightly shaky bare bones elevator

Auschwitz concentration camp may not exactly be fun but it certainly is a tremendous and moving learning experience for older children The administrators of Auschwitz in fact recommend that children under the age of 13 not visit the camp because the horrors of what happened there to adults and children are all too graphic and disturbing HELPFUL EXPRESSIONS
