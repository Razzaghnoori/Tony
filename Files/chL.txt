Legends See LeyendasLa Leyenda Negra The Black LegendLa Leyenda Negra is the term used for a myth that describes a very negative attitude many believe pervades the historical perspective regarding Hispanics and Mexicans The Black Legend embodies a belief that Spaniards are basically a cruel evil lazy greedy treacherous and fanatical people It originated in the era of Inquisitorial Spain and has misrepresented the history of Spain since the s The printed history of the conquest of the New World depicts a violent and corrupt invasion but there is a belief that the Black Legend has influenced the way this history has been writtenThe Black Legend originated in the sixteenth century during the Protestant Reformation with the beginnings of a rejection of Catholicism and abhorrence of the political and military power of Spain When Spain and Portugal remained loyal to Catholicism and expanded their empires by settling in South America Central America the Caribbean Islands and parts of North America the rest of Europe looked on very disapprovingly This viewpoint has continued to color everything about Spain since then including the grim legacy left by Spain in the New World It has justified the dictatorial treatment of Latin America and Mexico by the United States since the early nineteenth century Biased attitudes toward Catholic Spain were inherited by Anglo Americans and brought to the New World colonies by Protestant English settlersThe term Leyenda Negra was assigned to this belief by Julian Juderias a Spanish intellectual in  He stated that antiSpanish propaganda and misconceptions had continued to develop since the sixteenth century and historical distortions in both Europe and America constituted a Leyenda Negra It is thought that the Black Legend is actually the basis for the discriminatory treatment of Mexicans by Anglo Americans during the conquest of the frontier in the s and even for the current treatment of Chicanos in the United States in the twentieth century The cause for derogatory stereotyping of Mexicans and other Latin Americans is difficult to understand and the negative stereotype seems to have no historical basis until one understands the history of the Black Legend Publications by early American travelers to the Southwest and Mexico depict the Spanish Mexicans in not only horrendous terms but with extreme passion Thomas Jefferson Farnham a New England attorney wrote in the s In a word the Californians are an imbecile pusillanimous race of men and unfit to control the destinies of that beautiful country Weber  Stephen Austin in  after a trip to Mexico City wrote To be candid the majority of the people of the whole nation as far as I have seen them want nothing but tails to be more brutes than the apes Weber During the USMexican war of  the uncivil treatment of Mexicans and Californios and the public conviction in the righteousness of the war are cited as examples of how Mexico was disrespected by Americans Historically powerful stereotypes of inferior Mexicans and Mexican Americans perpetuated by arrogant Americans such as Austin led to the acceptance of Manifest Destiny as Americas right The result of such efforts to discredit Mexico and justify war was a widespread belief that the Godforsaken Mexicans were unworthy to keep the valuable resources and land they had inherited from Spain Sanchez  The popular image of a Mexican with a large sombrero sleeping under a cactus very likely originated from these early writings of traveling Americans with the result that the icon has become imprinted forever upon the collective character of Chicanos and Mexicans The common reference to finally the sleeping giant awakens when conferring on Mexican American socialpolitical issues is made often by educated and acculturated Chicanos manifesting an internalization of an image imposed from outside the Mexican culture Although no one actually mentions the Black Legend belief its legacy permeates a lot of Chicano oral folkloreReferences Powell  Sanchez  Weber Leyendas LegendsA leyenda a legend is an oral narrative different from a folktale in that it is narrated as if the event described occurred in the recent past and the story is believed by the narrator to be true There is often a supernatural element to the narrative such as a persons disappearance into thin air yet it will be recited as having occurred in a specified locale Often the narrator states where the story originated and explains that the events were observed by a grandmother cousin father or friend The names of persons and places in the narrative will be familiar to the audience In Chicano oral tradition stories about La Llorona the Blue Lady or Joaqun Murrieta can properly be called legends and almost always tell a story the audience wants to believe The Chicano communitys cultural belief system is inherent in the narrative otherwise the legend would not be recited and retold again and again There are hundreds of variants of the La Llorona legend all narrated about known encounters with her during the past  years Her tragic story is believable and one can say she is probably the quintessential legendary figure of the Chicano folk belief systemThe urban belief tale sometimes just called an urban legend is a subtype of the legend and is called such because it circulates among all classes and ages and reflects modern stresses and anxieties It is not only found in urban centers but in rural regions as well In addition to the legend of La Llorona Weeping Woman another widespread legend in Chicano folklore is the Vanishing Hitchhiker although not always known by this name A California folklore journal first carried an article about it in  and a Chicano version appears in Millers narrative collection from Los Angeles with a date of  The story usually involves a driver who picks up a hitchhiker often late at night and often a young girl and he drops her off at or near her home She leaves something in his car or he lends her a jacket or sweater and the next day he returns to retrieve it and learns that she was a ghost and has been dead for several years Sometimes she is met at a dance and asks a boy to drive her home or she might be a nun but the ghost is rarely a male Brunvand calls it a classic automobile legend and its prevalence has increased since cars became affordable to all social classes Interestingly the Vanishing Hitchhiker legend is one of the few narratives shared by both Anglo American and Chicano folklore Mark Glazer discusses a collection of  variants from the Rio Grande Folklore Archive at Pan American University in Texas and states that the legend is part of a culture which believes in miracles mystery and romance  See

meaning a sweeping as in housecleaning Limpiar means to clean and a limpia is similar to a barrida Both words mean a cleansing in a medical and in a spiritual sense Some people use the word limpieza instead of limpia but the significance is the same An individual may seek a limpia from a healer if the person is not feeling well with no specific cause or feels that bad luck or misfortune is prevalent in his or her life A limpieza can expel the hostile forces and also provide spiritual strength so that the person can effectively fight off negative energy Spiritual healers who are not curanderos perform limpias although mostly it is curanderos who perform this ritual The patient may be standing sitting in a chair or lying down while the ritual is performed The healer will sweep the patient with a little broom made of herbs such as sage rosemary and rue believed to be effective in eliminating evil influences Herbal water holy water or alcohol is sprinkled over the person in the form of a cross and the healers hands are used to sweep along the whole body pushing away the evil spirits While this is being done prayers are recited The prayers may be the Lords Prayer or Las Doce Verdades del Mundo The Twelve Truths of the World Instead of herbs some curanderos use an object for the sweeping such as an egg or a lemon believing that it will absorb the harm or illness affecting the patient These objects are burned after the ritual ensuring the recovery of the person The person is swept on all sides front and back and if there is pain in a particular spot special attention will be given to that area Trotter states that the presence of the curandero the soothing effect of the sweepings touching and the lowkey monotone chant of the prayers produces in the patient a light trance state that is comforting and reassuring Trotter and Chavira  See also Curanderismo Las Doce VerdadesReferences Roeder  Trotter and Chavira La Llorona The Weeping WomanThis is the name of probably the most famous legendary woman found in Greater Mexico The ancient legend of La Llorona has been traced to preColumbian times in Mexico and there is continuing discussion whether it may also have medieval European origins Most Chicanos heard of her as children read about her in literature or learned of her from friends La Llorona meaning the weeping woman or the howling woman may be represented as an Indian woman an ugly old witch or a beautiful woman in white with long flowing hair She always appears late at night and her crying and weeping can be vividly heard as she shrieks Ayyy mis hijos Oh my childrenAccording to the tragic legend there once was a woman who was abandoned by her husband or lover and left with two or three children Angry and seeking revenge she kills her children by throwing them into a river or sometimes by other means When she realizes what shes done she goes insane She is condemned to spend eternity searching for her lost and dead children Consequently she is often heard in the night calling her children She frequents rivers and other bodies of water and is sometimes seen floating above the water looking searching for her children Her legend has been recited for over  years and in contemporary times she is still believed to be wandering the streets in large cities as well as in the small towns of the Southwest where numerous people report encounters with her At times she is seen as a beautiful woman wearing a white dress roaming back streets and country roads crying and weeping Sometimes she becomes visible to the wayward husband who is out late drinking and when he approaches her she turns into an ugly horsefaced hag scaring him into swearing abstinence forever Parents use her name to scare little children into obedience Hay viene La Llorona  portat bien The Llorona is coming behave yourself Even adults whove heard the story many times and do not want to admit belief still fear a latenight encounter with La LloronaThere are ancient texts of indigenous mythology narrated by the Aztecs and recorded by the Spaniards that very closely resemble the La Llorona legend In some tales she is believed to be Cihuacoatl the patron goddess of women who die in childbirth It is said that Cihuacoatl carried a little baby cradle on her back or a dead baby in her arms as she roamed the country crying through the nights Those who saw her considered it an ill omen Sahagn mentions in The Conquest of Mexico that a woman was often heard as she went weeping and crying out Loudly did she call out at night She walked about saying O my beloved sons now we are about to go Horcasitas and Butterworth  Horcasitas and Butterworth reprint several texts of these early chronicles Diego Muoz Camargo ca  also reported that before the Spaniards arrived many times and many nights was heard the voice of a woman who cried out in a loud voice drowning herself with her tears and with great sobs and sighs wailing Horcasitas and Butterworth Contemporary texts of La Llorona collected in Mexico assert that the original Llorona was La Malinche the mistress of Corts Corts abandoned her to return to Spain and according to the legend Malinche killed their son with a knife This could be the source of another characteristic of the La Llorona legend In many variants the reason for her abandonment by her lover is their class differences He leaves her for someone of his own class or she is an Indian woman or a mestiza mixedrace woman and he is of pure blood In other variants she is a woman of the streets who doesnt want her illegitimate children so she throws them into the river She is always described as having long hair down below her waist and is seen wearing a white gown Sometimes men see her as a temptress and a siren she entices them to follow her and then she frightens them with her horrible looks They are usually found dead the next day What appears to be an unjust punishment is that La Llorona is condemned to wander for eternity crying and repenting searching for her lost children All mothers who have lost children identify with her and feel her painThe prodigious amount of published literature about La Llorona by folklorists literary critics anthropologists and feminist writers attests to the complexity of the legend Childrens books short stories novels and films have been created based on this basic story of infanticide and repentance We find narratives in rural and urban areas of the Southwest on college campuses in juvenile halls in large cities of the Midwest such as Chicago and among the native populations of MexicoMany Chicanos see themselves as orphans of La Llorona as the lost children of the marriage between the Aztecs and the Spanish Conquerors She is a beloved female archetype among contemporary Chicanas who write poems short stories and academic research articles about her As one writer put it It is finally time to let go of a single narrow understanding of the tale and to see La Llorona instead as an always evolving emblem of gender sexuality and powerand too as another female victim of historys tender mercies Candelaria See also

Monsalvo Low RiderThe expression low rider is used to describe the car the subculture and the person who drives a vehicle that has been lowered rides very low and has been customized A car truck bicycle van or motorcycle that has been loweredand this can be achieved by various methodsmeans that it sits very close to the ground and has a sleek streamlined appearance The driver andor owner is called a low rider and the act of low riding refers to all the activities associated with driving the car cruising caravanning and hopping Low riders have commonly been associated with cholos s urban youth and gangs but traditionally Chicanos seriously involved in low riding and customizing lowrider cars are not involved in gangs and lowrider clubs actually present an alternative to gang involvement Lowrider car clubs communicate a message of cultural pride and unity Although different the cholo subculture can be closely linked to the lowrider subcultureIt is not clear when low riding started but it was already a custom by the s in Los Angeles and Sacramento although the name low rider did not come into usage until the s After World War II because of the growth in the economy many Chicanos could afford to buy cars old and new and the practice of customizing cars and cruising became very popular throughout the Southwest and California during the s The most popular cars to lower are long ones such as Fords Buicks and Chevrolets Hydraulic lifts are used to lower and raise both the front and rear ends of a car Before it was discovered that a hydraulic lift could be used with the batteries stored in the trunk of the car different methods were used to lower the chassis of the car Early crude methods were to place heavy bricks and cement bags in the trunk or to cut the springs coils or lower the cars blocks To give the car that lowered look the top might be cut back to lower the roof In recent times once a car is lifted or all juiced up the driver controls the lift with a hand controlThe painting and decorating of the exterior and interior of the car are very important for appearances personal identity and also for belonging to a car club and participating in car shows The interior may be upholstered in crushed velvet red or black have walltowall carpeting a bar a chandelier a TV and a stereo tape deck The exterior may be painted in two tones a lacquer mixed with iridescent flakes or have a pearl finish Sometimes the undercarriage is chromed and goldplated Painting lowrider cars is a specialty only available at certain paint and body shops so low riders must be aware of such businesses Besides the painting of the car other decorative designs or motifs may also be applied such as pinstriping fancy lace a fire design and murals Murals of an Aztec or Mayan scene or La Virgen de Guadalupe are popular icons painted on the trunk hood or roof of the car Even though there is similarity in the styles each car is very different in the final production There are many techniques employed to arrive at a unique personal style For instance accessories from differentyear models are interchanged such as side panels from a  model may be cut and welded to a  car or  Cadillac tail lamps on a  Chevy Impala Bright Low riders are usually young urban Chicanos between the ages of eighteen and thirty and there can be two and three generations of low riders in one family The cost of fixing and maintaining a lowrider car is fairly high so the owner typically is a working person Since finding older cars say from the s is becoming difficult some low riders now customize small trucks motorcycles and bicycles as well The movie Mi Vida Loca My Crazy Life depicts the work that goes into customizing a pickup truckCruising involves driving very slowly up and down city streets such as Mission Street in San Francisco Whittier Boulevard in Los Angeles and King and Story Roads in San Jose California The objective of cruising is to socialize to see and be seen to give others the opportunity to admire ones car and to admire the other cars consequently the driving must be very slow muy despacito Driving a great customized car beautifully painted is a unique experience for the low rider Cruising slowly and smoothly sitting low in the drivers seat glancing out at the street nodding the head slightly when being recognized all these make up an experience only a Chicano low rider who has invested lots of time and money in his car can appreciate Cruising is often compared to the custom of promenading around a plaza referred to as el paseo in many Latin American and Mexican cities In this sense the lowrider car becomes a cultural vehicle as represented by the artist Gilbert Lujan in his series titled Cultural VehiclesA lowrider  Ford LTD called Daves Dream is on display at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington DC the first and only lowrider car in the museum From Chimayo New Mexico Dennis Martinez Richard Martinez and David Jaramillo worked on customizing the car starting in  It has two hydraulic pumps with the batteries stored in the truck that lift and lower the car and can make it rock from side to side and give it an appearance of dancing Actually car dancing is an event held at lowrider car showsWithin the lowrider subculture there exist several divisions of traditions For instance car clubs are an important aspect of the culture and a way to showcase cars in competitions One of the oldest ongoing car clubs in Los Angeles is named the Dukes Members of car clubs are referred to as clubbers and they compete for trophies ride in car caravans and often participate in fundraising events Cholos are considered another group less financially stable with more modern cars less ornate and likely more Mexicano in orientation A third group the cha chas are Mexican immigrants who drive the Toyotas and Volkswagens and are a smaller groupLow Rider Magazine was founded during the s to provide a forum for low riders and the culture that surrounds low riding Low Rider has been very instrumental in the widespread growth of lowrider car clubs and Low Rider Happenings throughout the Southwest Low riding is looked upon as a very Chicano cultural phenomenon yet it has spread to other ethnic communities There are many nonChicano car clubs and the Japanese have also adopted it Low Rider has been publishing a Japanese edition for the past four years and has organized lowrider car shows in Tokyo and Osaka As a form of artistic expression and folk art the customizing of lowrider cars by Chicanos is an expression of tradition and cultural prideReferences Bright   Chabran and Chabran  Gradante  Griffith  Marks  Parsons  Plascencia  Stone  Thomas  Vigil Luminarias BonfiresNot to be confused with farolitos luminarias are small bonfires and the custom of lighting them dates back to the Roman history of Spain These small fires are built in New Mexico to celebrate La Noche Buena Christmas Eve and to light the way for the announcement of the birth of the Christ child One family may light three luminarias in front of their home one each for Jesus Mary and Joseph while another may light twelve one for each of the twelve apostles It is believed luminarias originate from the huge bonfires built in preChristian times to celebrate rituals to the gods and goddesses Also in ancient times shepherds built fires to keep themselves warm and to scare off the wolves This tradition continued in New Mexico with the shepherds fires to illuminate the way for the coming of Jesus Christ They are not as well known as farolitos in contemporary American popular culture and one often finds farolitos mistakenly called luminarias and magazine articles describe how to make them especially during the Christmas holidaysReferences Anaya a Brown  Ortega
