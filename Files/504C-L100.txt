 Dear Friends of Herron This is a special year for Herron Our 90th Birthday celebration began in July and will continue through February There s still time for you to take part by attending the remaining events and by making a gift to Herron in honor of its tremendous continuous influence on the Indianapolis art scene Maintaining that same level of influence is harder and harder due to the rising operating cost of a professional art school And we try to augment this on going effort with special opportunities for the students like the Visiting Artists Series the latest computer graphic equipment the best faculty and the most meaningful art exhibitions Your donations go toward it all Help us continue to offer the finest professional art training to our students the junior and senior high school students enrolled in Saturday School and to all those adults in continuing education courses Your support is greatly needed and greatly appreciated Sincerely yours William J Voos Dean Herron School of Art P S Enclosed is a listing of the 90th exhibitions going on throughout the city Don t miss the opening of the last one at the National Art Museum of Sport on Thursday November 5 from 5 30 8 00 p m Also notice Herron s window display at the city Center through October
