 all right um so let me guess it s the Dallas Cowboys no no no not originally from Texas oh okay uh either San Francisco or Miami okay now San Francisco i think s almost everybody s favorite and uh uh i don t know not many people know about Miami i used to be a big Miami fan when they back in the seventies when they were real good Larry Csonka and all them yeah yeah they were my favorite team for a while well i didn t get uh into football until about Danny Dan Marino s first year okay are you you used to live in Miami no oh originally from Louisville Kentucky okay no just uh i liked them yeah my biggest team ever my favorite was uh the Los Angeles Rams they re pretty good i like their yeah i never lived anywhere near Los Angeles um i liked Eric Dickerson Dickerson yeah uh yeah i don t know but i think they re on the down slide i don t know i think the team coming up is the Raiders the Raiders huh um yeah he s getting some teams together some people together there yeah i think the the team i like rooting for the best which i don t i don t know if they really are the a good team but they re an underdog that s why i like them is the Philadelphia Eagles sometimes i don t like Randall Cunningham you don t like him no i like him uh i like him because he s reckless i think that s why i don t like him okay now my underdog team is the Broncos the Broncos oh yuck i hate them yeah well people put me in labor back when they was in the Super Bowl yeah i used to live in Colorado and i i kind of rooted against them and everyone else couldn t understand why because the people out there are really serious about them oh yeah i know my sister lived in Colorado for a little while and uh so i i don t know she said they go crazy yeah i had fun rooting against them it was yeah you d have the whole town on you didn t you i know it was kind of funny because i wasn t from Colorado yeah well i i don t know but um i ve never been to any a game or anything like that uh huh i just uh i ve gone to a few games i not in a while went to uh actually went to a play off game once that would ve been great when we lived i lived in Maryland and we saw the Raiders play the Colts in the play off when was this it was like uh at least ten years ago okay it went into double overtime i bet that was a good one yeah it was a great game i like those close games so who do you think s going to win this year right down this year that s a toss up between uh the Giants with them trying to repeat um hum and oh i hate to hazard a guess uh i m trying to go through and see who s got who uh i d say the Raiders but i doubt it i think they re going to be next year hum uh San Francisco might try to make a run back but i doubt it yeah they ve lost too many people yeah i think Buffalo s got a pretty good shot yeah yeah i uh if they hold together forget who their quarterback is i can see his face yeah i can t remember his name either what is his uh let s see they have the defense to do it yeah well uh if i could think of some of their names i Bruce Smith Bruce Smith uh he s a guard isn t he no he s a defensive end yeah he s a big mean guy i shoot i can t even think who s quarterback uh the uh darn uh coach name for the Bills um isn t it Marv Levy yeah i think so yeah that s it i had fun watching the Super Bowl last year because the the Giants coach looks like my sister s boyfriend Jim i m like what is he doing what s Matt doing out there called her up and said hey what s your boyfriend doing out in TV the what now who who was this uh the the Giants coach um what s his name i can t think of his name oh Bill Parcells Bill Parcells yeah my sister s boyfriend looks like him oh okay so i had fun laughing at it all right i i didn t catch that for a minute yeah looks like him a lot younger but oh there s one team that i out and out hate and that s the Bears you hate the Bears i don t really like the Bears either uh Mike Ditka i don t like the way he treats people um i didn t like him from uh oh one year when uh McMahon was real big f or the Bears yeah and uh he had put Doug Flutie in uh huh and Doug Flutie had called a time out huh you know he was in trouble the time was running out on the clock and he goes walking up to Mike Ditka to talk to him and Mike Ditka just turns his back on him and walks away huh and i didn t think that s you don t do that no i mean that s not what a team s about uh but he you know i mean if a guy screws up you got to say okay you screwed up what do we do now and move on it s you know i played softball and i screwed up coming around third base one time and the uh yeah the coach actually called time out and came and tapped my tail with her foot and said you know pointed that finger and went ah yeah yeah yeah yeah you know and i thought okay so that s better than ignoring you i think you know yeah well it didn t hurt and she was more you know we was in a uh it was a play off of a sort i guess yeah we was down in there in North Carolina huh huh uh for the uh nationals wow i m trying to think where we were i don t remember where we were huh well Raleigh just got a uh one of the new football teams the new World whatever it is World Football League or World League yeah yeah but Raleigh Sky Raleigh Durham Skyhawks have you watched any of those games i watched a little bit this weekend a few minutes of the one game oh i ve watched the New Jersey and New York teams you know i they re combined yeah that s that s who was playing i ve watched them twice and they look like bumbling idiots out there at times uh they don t look like they know what they re doing huh and i know they do they ve got to know yeah but i watched them when they was playing that team over there in New England i think is where it was and uh last week i watched them play huh and they just they looked terrible but they got the the NFL backing them so they might make it huh yeah that would be interesting to see i m uh every attempt so far i think has failed at a second football league uh yeah well well uh that s how i got to liking Doug Flutie he was playing for the Generals yeah on uh the uh USFL uh huh and down in Memphis they had a uh team called the Showboats yeah i remember that and uh you know i didn t care for the Showboats much but i did like a couple of their players huh uh and a couple of them even went to the uh NFL i just don t remember their names huh uh Doug Flutie s the only one that sticks out in my head for some reason huh uh i think that s because of what Ditka done to him that just put it in my head and kept it there but uh i don t know yeah but uh i don t know well it will be interesting seeing these games across the you know from London or wherever yeah well i that the London Knights i think is who it is Spain uh huh uh they were a fairly decent looking team huh they take the football serious yeah uh shoot i don t remember remember what the score well they have a whole nation behind them you got to remember that instead of just you know one section of the country like we have yeah that s true i never thought of it like that they don t they don t have another football team to root for no competition yeah so no competition they re going to have a lot more support over there yeah i know they take their softball serious or their soccer serious i mean yeah definitely and so i guess they would take it serious i i never thought of it like that i guess the next time somebody starts harping down i ll just bring that up yeah that s a good come back thank you all right all right sounds good what about your kickers huh kickers on softball football teams kickers huh i don t know i hadn t thought too much about that i always liked Matt Bahr because he went to Penn State oh i like Penn State my dad both my mom and dad went to Penn State so i i ve i ve barely made it out of high school uh huh uh but i like uh Reggie Roby Reggie Roby who does he play for he Miami okay uh uh at times i like Kevin Butler on the Bears you know there are some teams uh some guys i like on the Bears huh uh huh he s he s all right but they got uh uh what s his name i was going to mention Majkowski but he s a quarterback oh well i can t think of his name huh can t even think of what team he plays for either huh that s real bright huh all right well listen i ve got to go yeah well it was good talking to you all right bye bye all right bye bye
