                um the question was kind of interesting to me because i was just trying to put together a uh long term financial plan and a monthly budget the only thing i do now is uh put the data into Quicken i dont know if youre familiar with that   yeah ive uh have some friends of mine who use Quicken and uh i considered using it once myself but i decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date so i i kind of gave up on the idea of using Quicken at least for now   umhum hm i ive found that its the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced actually because what will happen is my wife or ill write a few checks and then well uh uh not bother to total it   umhum   and then it it comes comes in just to do all the arithmetic so it  helps with that   yeah well i have similar problems but uh we just have the one check book and we try to keep it up to date as much as possible and occasionally well get behind like you say but uh it doesnt really seem to be too too tight if we remember just remember to keep everything up up to date and balanced   um   well how do you handle the the long range or medium range planning on finances   uh actually we havent had to yet yet uh uh until just recently i guess weve got a a daughter whos eighteen months and another one on the way so   umhum   we need to start doing more of that just for uh you know saving for college and things like that we tried a way try to put away between two and four thousand a year just for that for   yeah well thats pretty good if you can do that i know   um   i have a daughter whos ten and we havent really put much away for her college up to this point but um were to the point now where our financial income is enough that we can consider putting some away for college so   umhum   were gonna be starting a regular payroll deduction in the fall and then the money that ill be making this summer well be   hm   putting away for her college fund   hm sounds good yeah i guess were were just at the point my uh my wife worked until we had a family and then you know now were just going on the one income so its a lot more interesting trying to   umhum   find some extra i think payroll deductions probably the only way well be able to um do it just you know kind of enforce the savings   umhum   but uh itll be interesting to see     well our situation is just a little bit kind of the opposite of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently uh took on a full time job well almost full time   hm   so its only recently that weve had the money where we could start putting away large sums of it for uh long range goals like college and   um   significant travel and that kind of thing   that sounds good but uh uh i was just curious what uh part of the country oh   ah Wisconsin   okay   how about you   um Cincinnati actually i was kind of wondering if theyd be collecting people with uh the western accents or something like that i dont know how many people are uh going to be involved in this but   umhum   uh well thats interesting im uh   uh um actually uh i was kind of interested if you found out about the study by uh reading Telecom Digest or was there another   uh a colleague of mine at uh at work got some information over um the computer network called internet   oh okay yeah thats how i got it as well but uh   and he just forwarded that on to me and um it sounded like itd be an interesting project to participate in so i   umhum   sent   yeah itll be interesting to see what they   sent back some Email   itd be interesting to see how the data base  well i guess were talking about the experiment and   umhum   probably try to get back on the topic but uh its hard to talk about finances without without getting to uh dollar figures i guess   umhum   you know we could talk about some of the long range goals   what other long range goals do you have besides college   yeah um well i think either my wife or i would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point   umhum   uh i guess well have to factor that in if were if were not working for employers that happen to fund that it seems like every year my employer scales back you know a little bit of their tuition reimbursement   umhum   i mean they use to reimburse it a hundred percent and now its uh now its reimbursement depending on the grade you get in class and uh its its a real shift from what we had before uh because were
