        so do you have kids in the public school system     uh no i dont im a college student actually no kids yet   oh yeah  well ive got preschoolers so we have one that is going to be starting kindergarten next year and uh   uhhuh   i dont know if im real comfortable with the public schools at this point but um   right   home schooling right now is not an option for us so   uhhuh   and private private schools um i dont know yeah so you have to deal with it what you have but um   pretty expensive right   um i dont know im what do you think about the school systems   uh i think that theres a lot that could be done to improve them i uh being that im in college and stuff you get to college and you see you know it just seems it seems like that we ought to be doing a lot of the things that are that are done in college i guess should be taught a lot earlier in school like in math and science and stuff like that   yeah   i mean im a math major and when i was in high school you know i i think i could of handled a lot of the work that ive been doing here in college at a much younger age and i believe that thats the way that it used to be in this country a long time ago and that it probably is in a lot of other countries too because your       your math professors or whatever whatever will always go yeah i was doing this stuff back in high school and youre like well  you know then why the heck is it you know my third year in college and im just now getting to it     yeah   it just seems like that theyve the curriculum in the public schools is just too soft or something   yeah theyre i feel like theyre trying to teach a lot of um theyre taking the role of the parent and trying to teach a lot of uh of values and doing a lot of baby sitting and and not getting down to what they need to be teaching   right   and um yeah theres a lot of things that i i wanna teach my kids and i dont want them to mess around with   right   um you know i dont feel like thats their thats their place um one of the things that uh my husband works for uh for a company that well  well he works for FritoLay but they had a a guy come in um talking about some of the new IBM um systems that they have coming out and talking about how school systems are just are not transitioning as as rapidly as um as a lot well industry industry right now is is just gonna have to uh you know well in a transition period  with the computers and stuff and um that was real encouraging as i we we went and looked at the   uhhuh   the kindergarten class that my little boy will go into and they have reading to write which is uh they can write stories and and learn to write on computers so at least uh the school district that were in has you know computers that they begin on and i really feel like   uhhuh right   um theyre going to have to use those a lot and and that way a child that my son already know already knows how to read and he will be able to excel at his own pace where the kids that you know   right   that dont have you know that havent had the he has a real desire to learn and hopefully he will be challenged throughout you know his school life if hes of you know that things are available to him like the computer   right   go off and and teach himself yeah because i know theres a lot of a lot of junk that i learned in school and its been its been a number of years since ive been in high school and college and um   work at his own pace     they uh you know some of the stuff i learned it was such a such a waste of time   right   and um i come back and i got a degree in uh i got a business degree in college and thats the most useless degree in the world its like why did they do this to people  and um you have to you know you have to   uhhuh right   uh you really have to work with um whats out there in the environment and use it to your advantage in the schools right now its just theyre just beginning i think to to take advantage of the computers and and of course not all schools are able to do that because of the expense of them but um   right well i agree very highly with your point about the the uh public schools have gotten away from the real sort of hard core curriculum and into areas that are more should be dealt with at home or in the Church or somewhere else   yeah   dealing with value judgements and dealing with how you how you interact with the rest of society because i feel that those are really things that that have no place in the school i mean i i see that theyre theyre trying to uh i dont know what they are trying to do but i really think that the emphasis should be more on on book learning and not on okay you know heres our civics class this is were going to talk about how people deal with each other in their community and how its suppose to be and as opposed to just having straight up math reading writing   umhum
