 August 1 1991 Name Address City ST Zip Dear Name This fall alumni and students at the Indiana University School of Law Indianapolis will initiate several programs to encourage alumni support for the school As outlined during recent meetings of the Board of Visitors and Alumni Association Directors these will include an Indianapolis law student alumni telephone campaign and increased emphasis on giving at the Maennerchor Society level Prior to launching these programs we are requesting each of our alumni leaders and friends on the two boards to review their support of the school for 1991 and if no pledge or contribution has been made to consider joining their colleagues in the Maennerchor Society As an alumnus and Chairman of that activity my function is to beat the drums for financial contributions of 1 000 or more per year from alumni and friends of the school Accordingly a brief recital of unmet needs is given below with a request for contributions Also I want to express my gratitude to those of you who have already pledged or contributed in 1991 These comments for better or worse are not accompanied by heartrending pictures of faculty members standing in bread lines nor with snap shots of undernourished law students The school s staff appears quite professional and the students reasonably fed However the school does have specific needs some quite visible and others somewhat subtle which are not being adequately met by legislative appropriations student tuition and fees Any of these include The Student Lounge This area is usually the first seen by prospective faculty and students Over twenty years of wear have left furniture and other decor in a shabby state inconsistent with an impressive law school Rehabilitation costs are estimated to be 85 000 No state dollars are available for this project Scholarships For 1990 1991 our school of law received 57 000 in state funds and 78 000 from private endowment and gifts for a total of 135 000 for scholarship assistance This is only about 6 of the total cost that law students paid for their legal education at the school last year It is far less scholarship aid than is available at most law schools Last year for example the IU School of Law Bloomington spent 279 000 for scholarships from private and public sources although their student body is somewhat smaller than ours Faculty Salaries and Research Support Our law school ranks last in median base salaries for full professors when compared with salaries paid to full professors at the eight other Big Ten law schools The school also lacks sufficient funds to award adequate summer stipends to support faculty scholarship and to cover the costs of student research assistants Library expenditures Again our law school ranks last in this category when compared with the eight other Big Ten law schools Annual Expenditures Highest Michigan 2 686 398 Average 1 700 395 Law Indianapolis 1 219 785 Your patience will not be tested by commentary on the General Assembly s problems in providing more support for higher education Rather these humble efforts will be directed to increasing private sector contributions One of the selling points in this fall s development campaign is the level of support given by the school s alumni leaders and friends on the Alumni Association Board and the Board of Visitors Obviously if all members of the two Boards were to pledge 1 000 per year we would be most grateful and we would have a great story to tell However we recognize that contributions at the Maennerchor Society level are not possible for all Some Board members may have had their mother in law move in another mouth to feed and a loss in domestic tranquility Junior may have wrecked the car and daughter may have attained the age for orthodontia If circumstances do not permit your participation in the Maennerchor Society please do contribute at one of the levels recognized annually by the school Maennerchor Society 1 000 or more Dean s Council 500 999 Barrister s Club 250 499 Law School Associates 100 249 Contributions may be made when the pledge is submitted or anytime prior to the end of 1991 A pledge card and return envelope are enclosed For the reasons noted below please return your card before August 30 1991 If you have pledged or contributed for 1991 you have my thanks and the appreciation of the administration and faculty of the law school Also you have the satisfaction of knowing that your colleagues are being urged to emulate your good judgment In early September it will be my privilege to personally contact any members of the Board of Visitors or Alumni Board who through misadventure oversight procrastination or the pendency of personal bankruptcy proceedings have not made some pledge or contribution however large or small to our school As I consider the talented loyal and resourceful leaders on these Boards I assume few if any calls will be necessary One last matter we will be contacting alumni for membership in the Maennerchor Society in October and November If you are willing to make a few six or less telephone calls to assist the law school please so indicate on your pledge card Those participating will be provided prospects names addresses and telephone numbers as well as background information on the school s needs Thanks for your courtesy in reviewing this epistle and for your response Sincerely John M Holt 56 Chairman Maennerchor Society Committee Indiana University School of Law Indianapolis
