 Emission Accomplished In horse country everyone will always remember precisely where they were and what they were doing when they first heard the news that Cigar was shooting blanks Tragedy is part of horse racing but this cut to the heart of the business the ancient and profitable enterprise of breeding Every thoroughbred in America is the descendant of one of three stallions the Darley Arabian the Godolphin Barb and the Byerly Turk brought to England from the Middle East three centuries ago Cigar had brought honor to the bloodline He had won 16 consecutive races and been named Horse of the Year twice in a row He was the most celebrated thoroughbred since Secretariat Surely he would make a monster stud At the Breeder s Cup last fall says Claire Khuen a Pennsylvania thoroughbred owner People were talking about wanting to have little Cigarettes Cigar retired after the Breeder s and went to Ashford Stud in Kentucky for what should have been the most important and satisfying work of his career His stud fee fetched the farm 75 000 a pop Cigar had mares lining up around the paddock Everyone wanted a piece of that code A few weeks passed The mares did not come into foal Some horses that come off the racetrack are slow to start said the farm s manager hopefully But then the veterinarians looked at Cigar s sperm under the microscope and discovered the horse s appalling little secret His sperm were slackers They had no motility whatsoever Many were shaped abnormally This incredibly fast and strong and durable thoroughbred heroic of stature and stout of heart was a genetic dead end The news broke simultaneously with the story that Scottish scientists had cloned an adult sheep An enterprising reporter for the New York Post called Cigar s owner Allen Paulson and managed to get a quote to the effect that perhaps Cigar could be cloned The thoroughbred community quickly protested It turns out that cloning would violate Rule 1 D of the American Stud Book which reads To be eligible for registration a foal must be the result of a stallion s natural service with a broodmare which is the physical mounting of a broodmare by a stallion and a natural gestation must take place in and delivery must be from the body of the same broodmare in which the foal was conceived It s a shocking provision Everything else in today s society has been converted to mass production One would think that there is a more modern way to breed a horse something involving hydraulic machinery vacuum tubes pumps stainless steel vats perhaps even cross country pipelines Cigar was foaled at Country Life Farm just north of Baltimore and I drove up to check out some horse breeding up close Country Life Farm is as pastoral as it sounds smelling of grass and hay and horses Adolphe Pons bought it in 1933 and passed it on to his son Joe who is an amiable old gentleman now padding around in a Cigar Ran Here First cap and looking like you could not pay him a million dollars to get worked up over anything He passed the reins to his kids notably Josh Pons who is 42 and seems to run the place although there are Ponses everywhere The place is dense with humans and horses as though fecundity is contagious Josh Pons is a serious businessman I remarked that the rules for breeding seem rather low tech for this day and age He looked as though he wasn t sure if he liked the sound of that term It s difficult work he said It s also risky It takes four or five men to handle the horses as they breed His top stallion is worth 1 5 million and could be disabled by a swift kick from a mare If she were to hit the stallion in the penis we d be out of business Pons said As it happened a jumpy mare named Canada Miss had come onto the farm to breed this very morning She was 9 years old and a maiden She d never had a horse on her back Her owner Barbara Gardi stood by nervously It s like my baby My big baby Gardi said A farm employee warned her to be prepared for what was coming up It is a little the employee paused violent Everyone at the farm was wary of Canada Miss She d come there the day before for schooling and she had been balky A veterinarian had reached inside and confirmed she was in heat but after nine years of racing she might not grasp the concept of being covered as they say by a 1 300 pound stallion First the horsemen brought out a teaser horse A teaser horse is the warm up act an important but ultimately expendable creature This one s name was Popeye and he was a gelding Popeye nuzzled and licked the maiden on her left flank She urinated a sign that she was ready A horseman held a twitch that covered her mouth while another man held her left front leg with a strap Two more men stood at her flanks Popeye reared up and plopped on her back and there was a sudden grunting and whinnying and with both hind legs Canada Miss bucked and threw Popeye off her back Poor little girl This is all new for her said her owner Josh Pons did not like this He wasn t going to let his prize stallion get near this creature until she got tranked The tranquilizer took a few minutes to take effect Canada Miss started to look a little sloppy Another teaser came out of the stud barn this one named Dew Dew was no gelding he had all the equipment Dew tried to mount her but she bucked away He s a little scared right now The mare doesn t look like she s ready and he s not standing there with a giant hard on ready to knock her down said Pons One notices that Pons doesn t mince words No one around here is guilty of being pretentious Obviously the traditional breeding method is a lot harder than just letting a couple of horses loose in a pasture and waiting for nature to take its course And it s a far sight harder than artificial insemination Pons said that if AI were allowed as it is with standard bred horses breeding would be a one pony trick Instead of a teasing chute we d have some sort of a riding bronco bull a leather mare The stallion would mount it and a veterinarian would collect the ejaculant in an artificial vagina he said The prohibition is more than just tradition It s good business Artificial insemination would create a rush on sperm from a select few champion stallions Midlevel stallions would see their stud fees plummet Dew the teaser finally mounted Canada Miss The process is not gentle Two horses mating is a lot of meat in motion Four men had to control the horses and one of these men Eduardo had the most critical job of all which is to reach with his right hand and grab Dew s erect penis which is thick as a baseball bat and almost as long and pull it to one side to prevent penetration When it comes to consummating the act Dew don t Pons noted that poor Popeye the gelding has been tugged to the side like this so many times that he s developed a pronounced curvature He s got a bent dick Pons said Finally it was time to bring out the breeding stallion Allen s Prospect His stud fee is 10 000 and he averages 1 7 covers before the mare is in foal an excellent batting average in the horse business He emerged from the barn whinnying and stamping his feet Eduardo was now wearing a helmet a defense against biting The horsemen washed the stallion s genitals in soap and water and led him to the mare By now the old man Joe had wandered up and he was the only one who looked at peace He s a good breeding horse He won t mess around The four horsemen held the mare Allen s Prospect mounted her and the horsemen on either side guided his penis into the mare and held onto it while the horses brayed and whinnied and huffed more than a ton of towering bucking horseflesh and after about 30 seconds the stallion ejaculated and instantly slipped out of her and headed back to the barn It s very draining physically and emotionally said Josh Pons as he drove around the farm in a golf cart a few minutes later He said studs get hurt top broodmares get sick and die foals are born dead Nothing is easy It s the nature of thoroughbreds They re not bred for their reproductive ability they re bred for speed Critics say even this isn t really working that racing times have reached a plateau and the thoroughbreds may have even regressed in quality watered down by excessive breeding in the boom years of the 1980s and the use of medication that masks physical frailties While the horses run in place genetically the racetracks themselves are falling behind the rest of the gaming world Racetracks are getting clocked by casinos lotteries riverboat gambling and slot machines Pons is not sure if Country Life Farm will pass to yet another generation of Ponses If it s a dinosaur game and everyone s betting at the casinos instead of the racetrack we re out of business From the farm I drove to the racetrack Laurel Park I ve been to Gulfstream and Hialeah and Santa Anita and Hollywood Park and they all maintain some resonance of their grand past At Gulfstream you enter in a broad boulevard between rows of royal palms At Hialeah there are old fountains and broad porches and perfectly landscaped gardens Laurel Park has none of that magic The entrance road is bumpy and crude The facility has been rebuilt various times over the last 81 years but now just looks cobbled together in addition to being old On this particular Saturday only a few thousand people were scattered in the stands Many were watching TV monitors showing simulcasts of races at some other track They weren t completely here mentally A woman smoking a cigarette outside the office turned out to be Lois Ryan the track s director of public relations She said Laurel s big problem is that the governor won t allow slots Tracks in Delaware have slot machines now and they re pulling in billions of dollars in revenue jacking up the purses for the races and siphoning away both the fans and top racehorses Philadelphia Park is getting video lottery terminals as will tracks in West Virginia Plus the racetrack as broadly imagined by the public suffers a reputation of seediness It s not true she said It s clean and lively she insisted Soon they will bring in costumed characters so kids will have something to do Up in the press box the handicapper Clem Florio 67 looked down from his lofty perch as the horses meandered toward the starting gate for the sixth race It doesn t have the glamour that it did Florio said It had glamour You d see people go from nothin to the big time He grew up in Queens right next door to Aqueduct Routinely there d be 30 000 or 40 000 people at the track on a Saturday We had a tradition along the Eastern Seaboard of horse players Every corner had a bookie Florio said It was the only game in town Tradition alone can t compete in the churning marketplace of American gaming Maybe racing could use a few cloned Cigars Something Anything For the seventh race at Laurel there were only seven horses in the field The next race would have nine horses and the one after that only six Six horses is not much of a field You know a racetrack is on hard times when it can t even get horses to show up
