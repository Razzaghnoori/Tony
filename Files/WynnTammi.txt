                     Test test I grew up in a very small town called Dacusville and thats in SC and heres the history behind Dacusville         Its a very small town that didnt or doesnt have a post office doesnt have a grocery store really only has a school and two gas stations         But we actually lived in the city of Easley and went to Pickens High School but had also a different phone number         But anyway theres some background of the type of small town that I grew up in         Um my house was a house that sat on  acres of land and I had um my mom and my dad and a three year old older sister         Well at some point my dad decided that uh we needed to have goats so we fenced in our front part of our yard which was probably about six acres and we got goats and on we also had other animals         Like we had a pony and we even actually had a ram at some point but thats another story         So we had these goats and they were in a fence an electric fence and we would have to cut the hay and bail the hay         Well I know I could not have been any older like six or seven years old when we had this pickup truck that was a straight drive and or thats what we called in straight drive and that was a manual shift car or truck         And um I was really small and thats why I must have only been like six or seven because I couldnt do anything else         Um I couldnt um help like bail the hay pick up the hay do anything because I was so small so my mom and my dad and my older sister could um help collect the hay so my job became driving the truck and I could reach the pedals         I was tall enough to reach the pedals but my dad taught me how and I would get in that truck and drive around from point to point while they picked up the hay and put it in the truck and Id drive the truck around and wherever it needed to go and theyd store the hay         So yeah I learned how to drive at a very early age and needless to say my first car was a straight drive and no one um in that town really waited until they were  or  to drive         We all were driving pretty early because whos going to know about that far out that we didnt have a license so heres related um to driving         Another thing uh that I learned to how to do very early on was drive a tractor         Of course because we had to have a tractor to cut the hay and do all the things that you know involved I guess in a semi quasi farm we were pretending to have         So my dad taught me how to drive this tractor and I thought I was big stuff because you sat up high on the tractor and you could see everything and you know I could just drive it and drive it and drive it         Well one Sunday afternoon it was early no it was after church um before dinner was ready         I was out there and my dad said I could drive the tractor while we were waiting on dinner         So I was driving the tractor around around and around and then I got called in for dinner so I parked the tractor         Oh our house also sat on a hill and I think it sat on the top of a hill and then the field and the fencing went down and then across the street was my uncles land and no one lived there         Over there it was another field that was fenced in and I dont think there were any animals over there but it was a fenced in filed as well         So I parked this tractor at the top of our driveway and I go in to eat dinner         So we eat and I dont know it probably takes about an hour and I go back out         I want to ride the tractor         We go back outside for some reason and it wasnt there         And I dont have a clue as to what happened to it and I yell for my dad and we go out there and we start looking and we see trail marks all the way down the driveway through our field and then there is the tractor on the other side of the road in the fence         So guess what happened I being the smart little what six year old that I was decided that I forgot or didnt remember correctly that I had put the tractor in park and or in gear and not in neutral         I thought for sure for sure I remembered that my dad said to put it in neutral         Yeah well I remembered wrong so uh went over and got the tractor out and my dad drove it back and I dont know what he did to the fence Im sure that he fixed it I dont remember how badly it was damaged but I was so upset I really thought I was big stuff         I mean I knew how to drive this tractor and I couldnt believe that I remembered wrong and I made that mistake and I first was scared because I thought I was in trouble but then when I realized I wasnt in trouble I was really you know I had lost a lot of confidence because I really thought I was big stuff         So I was like No more tractor         I dont want to have anything more to do with the tractor         Well my dad said Get back on it your going driving         So he made me get back on it because he wanted to teach me that we make mistakes and that you just have to get back on kind a like if you fall off a horse so thats my stories that I remember about driving         OK going back to the whole goat thing Ill tell you another story about the goats         Uh the fence um we had this goat that we bottle fed actually we bought our dad bought the goat         Most of our goats were just regular farm goats but this particular goat was registered         He was you know high class for a goat         He had papers and everything and we named him Remington         We named all are animals after TV characters         Like all are dogs all the goats were named after TV characters so Remington was after uh I guess that show Remington I forget now but some character         Well he was our pet goat and we raised him         As a baby we bottle fed him and we had to burn off his horns because if they grow up with horns then they can be dangerous so you burn them off when theyre little         We did that and we played with him basically like he was a dog because he was our little baby         He grew up um to be a very um close animal to us but because we played with him so much he really thought that he was part of the family and he belonged really wherever we were         Wed let him in the house and you know take him in the car take him in the truck or just do whatever         So one day we were uh where we were somewhere in the house and like I said we had this electric fence and the electric fence works only so long until the goats figure out how to get out a of it or decide that they want out so theyll you know endure the few seconds of shock         So yeah Remington got out he didnt think he belonged in the fence anyway with the other goats so hed gotten out and uh we look outside our house and we had a carport and um the storm door was open and the screen and we look out and yeah hes on to a the car him standing on top of the car         That was when I think we decided we needed to set some more boundaries         So Remington um quickly had to learn some lessons         OK Ill tell ya another story about my dad because my dad grew up in basically the same area we did um real country and he was the youngest of  kids         Yeah um Im sure he was an accident um and you can tell by his name         He kind of got the last of the pick Homer Stobo         Yeah well um well was like I said the youngest so his parents by the time they had him were quite older and I dont think they paid him too much attention or maybe as his older siblings had to um have most of the part in his raising or upbringing that I think he was kind a left to do his own thing for quite a while         So he was quite rambunctious so he used to always tell us stories about things he did as a kid         First of all even though he was capable of uh going to school and doing his schoolwork he chose not to and he would always um what you call play hooky and on those days when we wouldnt go to school he would always come up with some kind of tricks and one of the things I remember him saying that he did and actually since the time this time I had other people confirm that uh this is true that he would take a pocketbook one of his moms pocketbooks and empty it out and tie it a string to the handle and hed put it in the middle of the road and he and his buddy would let the string be long enough to where they could hide in the bushes and still have the string attached and then theyd wait for a car to drive by and there would always be a car to come by because of course this was in the country         And a car comes by and sees see a pocketbook they think you know were going to pick this up and do one of two things         Their going to either take it which whats more likely is that theyre going to look because everybody knows everybody so they pick it up or they get out of their car and they go to pick it up         Of course as soon as they pick it up my dad and his friend just would jerk that pocketbook         Well you would think theyll just jerk it away and laugh         Well they decided that that wasnt fun enough so they would jerk it a little bit and make it seem like it was the wind or just do it a little bit where they werent maybe the person wasnt quite sure if it really moved or not or that maybe they accidentally kicked it and theyd do that a couple a times and then they would have basically be teasing the person along until the person just had thought they were going crazy         And then uh they finally realized what was going on and my dad and his friend would run and they would just run and run and run         And he would do all kinds of little tricks when he was out a school but um as it turns out he um he was quite into trouble his grades didnt quite make it         He made a D in PE a D in um gym         Yeah he he wasnt quite fond of school and he dropped out in May of his senior year so although he later in life became successful and owned his own company he just didnt and I guess and neither did his parents think school was that important so his his stories they always told us didnt involve growing up and going to school and doing well and behaving they were always mischievous
