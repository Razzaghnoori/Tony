        there you go first question do you own your house   yeah uh right well we try  i mean its a big mortgage in the sky and someday maybe we might even own it but um for all practical purposes i guess we hold the mortgage     our name is on the bill so that implies ownership     yeah right no one else has offered to pay for it   thats right and i wouldnt object if anybody did   yeah really they could move right into the spare room   yeah well weve we had this one for five years now before that we lived in Garland uh probably about you know four blocks away liked the area chose to stay inside of Spring Park its a uh   uhhuh   i dont know if you have been up here but it is a residential homeowners association so theres a lot of you know activities a lot of pluses and common land   right yeah   but uh we thought we were buying at the bottom of the market you know it could not possibly have gone any lower and so we were wrong   oh five years ago yeah   yeah i think what it bottom out about a year year later   yeah it well i mean just recently i would say i would give it two years back when it was i think bottomed out   oddly enough two years you know i i think that   but maybe not in your area see it was just different areas   not in in in this area because this is about like the   thats a really nice area besides its you know its not its not Richardson is it its still considered Garland   yeah no its its Richardson its uh Richardson and hold on a second  Paul i can hear you perfectly perfectly well i dont want to hear you you are being rude whatever you ask or scream when im on the phone the answer is no do you understand   oh okay yeah   how does that sound   there you go write that one down it sounded good to me   yeah there i go yeah yeah well i hate to say how long that will last too no this area up here is uh  all custom homes and its   right   i i dont think that many by the builder that we that built this house and we were not the first people the first owners i think we are the third owners it was built by the architect for himself   uh okay   who never moved into it who sold it to a couple who had no idea that homes ever needed upkeep   oh no   oh yeah caulking windows was a great mystery to them you know you know they just watched the water pour in on the carpet but its a Sharif Myneer Homes if that means anything it did not really mean anything to me except i liked it   oh gee i i i kept thinking of Omar Sharif every time i saw that name somewhere so   he builds eight hundred thousand dollar houses now i think he got out of the lower end market and decided but the houses here in in this class of housing never dropped to below two hundred   uh oh wow   yeah well  but still i know that this one was built for two ninety nine which is nowhere near what we paid for it and i think or somebody told me its also on a creek side lot heavily wooded off the golf course   right oh great   yeah and the guy around the corner is being transferred so he said uh well he did comparable that its about eighty dollars i think it was i dont remember if he said it was sixty dollars a square foot off the creek and eighty on the creek or if it was eighty and a hundred i think it was sixty eighty   well yeah probably eighty sixty eighty   i think   well because i know our our little house over here stuck in the middle of you know the subdivision is i think fifty five so i think the high end is definitely you know somewhere around there   well try and think if it was a hundred dollars a square foot no it could not be because this house is around thirty four hundred square feet and it would never sell for three hundred forty thousand dollars just never   yeah well   now maybe you know thats thats pretty close to what it would have sold for uh brand new or and thats pretty much what it was built for its got an awful lot of nice things in it but you know i dont think i think its going to be a long time if ever when nice things and really quality construction and all the other additional amenities are really uh desirable its seems like people go for square footage only now and uh because have you been back to the Perry Homes back here   yeah   um the ones that look like brick houses   the one that looks like Monopoly apartments   right yeah i think those are awful  im sorry i just dont see the designers i i just see him as trying to squish as much space you know as much house into the space as possible   they are huge when you are inside them theyre very spacious theyre you know i was i was in one today it was forty two hundred square feet   yeah ooh   yeah uhhuh   well see thats the house that we got is small enough so my husband and i because theres just the two of us and the two cats um can yell at each other from one end to the other and be heard and we thought that was important instead of getting swallowed up in something that you know   see when you have kids you like to be able to send them some place where they can yell and you wont hear them but i have been watching these houses go up and i i   yeah thats true   dont well somebody was telling me i know somebody who lives back there ive always questioned the quality of construction and i i dont think they exceed more than twelve nails per house   oh   when you watch them go up you are just amazed that they do not fall over and it takes them something like thirty days to complete a house   yeah oh thats amazing right now in fact even as we speak we are having a deck put on in back and these guys are phenomenal they just they they are doing such a terrific job back there i mean you know you you pay for it too but its its like really worth it they are putting in a deck a redwood deck and its just   umhum   they are doing such a fine fine job and im really excited about it   weve got three different levels of decking because this lot slopes way back down and and the house is built around the trees   uhhuh great   and with these decking decking that a corporation and a large area for the trees to come up so its real real shady but thats one of the few things that really uh immediately pays back on return but what i was going to tell you these Perry Homes back there   yeah   when the people from MCI come down and they are you know theyre used to the the Virginia area metropolitan DC my God they come down here and and those houses that that look like to them the colonial look what the   oh looks like the George Town Brownstone yeah   right and the idea of ever owning anything that has four thousand square feet in it for less than two hundred twenty thousand dollars which is probably about what their equity is that they got out of selling their house those things are selling like hot cakes   must be a dream come true yeah   but one of the people that was living back there was telling me that there is his air conditioning bill per month last summer was in excess of five hundred dollars a month and i thought     i cant   and he was talking he was talking about how you keep up with the utilities here and i was thinking well you know i know why your God damn bill is so high its because theres not a theres no insulation insulation in those things   he has no insulation probably oh my gosh what a trap   yeah any yet you know  they they show very well uh they show very well unless you have you know lived in a lot of houses around here or   and you ask the right questions and can research yeah   or looked at a lot of houses around here   yeah   and i think that makes a big difference but i like i like this area and everything that ive been saying says that its   oh i do too   if i think if we had to sell now we could come close to breaking even   but still um its worth it for the area and for the school and things like that   youre in youre in the
