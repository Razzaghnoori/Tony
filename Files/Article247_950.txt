 Headline Hi Katha Yes my morning ablutions are complete and I know it s noon I ve just caffeinated taken three viracepts one combivir four rescriptors one zantac one immodium one zoloft and one propecia Who needs oatmeal But the good news is I m alive and my hair is growing back In fact I was so zippy I missed Charlie Moskos letter Whenever I ve dealt with him he has seemed an extremely reasonable fellow he wrote a good piece for me at TNR on race in the ranks but like many military types he just seems to lose it when it comes to the obvious fact that homosexuals have been happily murdering and killing in uniform for generations At least he didn t push the off the record spin that these nellies just can t hack it which is what Pentagon flunkies were whispering to gullible journalists He also misses a very basic point The 563 violations were by commanders not soldiers It s rather like holding turkeys responsible for Thanksgiving As to the notion that gay soldiers disproportionately leave early this only applies to new discharges How does Moskos explain the enormous increase Could it possibly be that bigoted commanders who hate the idea that they might have to tolerate discreet homosexuals in the ranks now try to flush them out early and fast by massive amounts of intimidation In Italy a Marine first sergeant is reported by the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network to greet new unit members with the declaration There are three things I hate liars thieves and faggots Nice to meet you too A final thought It s interesting that Moskos is aware as someone in his position would never have been a generation ago that young people do come out at an earlier and earlier age Society has changed enormously So all the policy is doing it seems if he is correct is successfully flushing out a whole swath of young men and women who have the self respect not to be ashamed of being gay Should the military be happy it s getting rid of all these people and becoming less rather than more like the society it s supposed to defend And is the presence of these people who are often disproportionately committed to their jobs such a threat to the effectiveness of the military as a whole Or are we better off with a bunch of conflicted repressed neurotics As to welfare mothers I share your abhorrence of the guy who demeaned motherhood although I am probably uniquely unqualified to talk about its onerous responsibilities My sister has two small children though and she works harder than I ever have in my life Or ever will But the apposite question it seems to me is not simply whether day care is adequate it almost certainly isn t but whether as a whole it is better that whatever the current problems the old system has been shaken up and reformed in the direction of work Of course welfare bureaucracies being what they are a lack of support in health care and day care is hardly surprising But the answer to that is to fix the health care and day care with some of the large amounts of money being sent back to the states rather than to return to what happened before Or am I wrong Is your position that welfare mothers were better off in dependency and close to their kids rather than in work and distant for some of the time from their kids I d be crazy to believe the new system is perfect or without its injustices But isn t it an improvement on what went on before And isn t it at least a more constructive place from which to improve policy than old style entitlement My nomination for the most boring story of the day bank mergers And anything to do with Mike Ovitz Who really gives a damn about Hollywood moguls And doesn t The New Yorker fellate them enough for the Times to stop covering them I loved the story on Kathy Bates though What a babe I thought the Primary Colors movie was unconvincingly crude can anyone believe for a moment that George Stephanopoulos was ever deeply morally conflicted about anything but Bates was great Along with George Michael she s my newly discovered icon Cheers Andrew
