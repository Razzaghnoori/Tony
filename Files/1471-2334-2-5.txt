 Background Respiratory syncytial virus RSV belongs to the Pneumovirinae subfamily of the Paramyxovirodae family of enveloped single stranded negative sense RNA viruses RSV infection of the lower respiratory tract cells results in cell death and sloughing into the lumen of the respiratory tree Worldwide RSV is the leading cause of infant mortality from respiratory infections and is so highly contagious that by age two nearly all children have been infected RSV infection in infancy cause severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia and may predispose children to the subsequent development of asthma the most common chronic illness of childhood 1 Many studies have indicated that chemokines can play an important role in the onset and severity of asthma and it has been shown that RSV infection of lung epithelial cells increases chemokine production although the mechanisms involved are largely unknown 2 3 4 5 The chemotactic cytokines or chemokines compose a large superfamily of small structurally related polypeptides that play important roles in host defense by recruiting specific subsets of leukocytes to sites of inflammation and injury 6 Chemokines have been associated with a number of inflammatory diseases and conditions including asthma sepsis inflammatory bowel disease and adult respiratory distress syndrome 7 8 9 The chemokine superfamily can be divided into two major groups based on the position of the first two of four conserved cysteine residues at the amino terminus which are either adjacent CC subfamily or separated by one amino acid CXC subfamily The CXC chemokines such as IL 8 were originally identified as potent activators and chemoattractants for neutrophils whereas the CC chemokines such as MCP 1 and RANTES mostly attract monocytes and eosinophils respectively 10 Chemokines are secreted in a stimulus and cell type specific manner 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 and are regulated primarily at the level of gene transcription 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 The transcriptional promoters of IL 8 RANTES and MCP 1 contain binding sites for the redox responsive transcription factor NF B which has been shown to be important for their regulation by viral infections and cytokines 18 20 23 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 We previously demonstrated that the chemokines IL 8 MCP 1 and RANTES are differentially regulated in A549 airway epithelial cells 35 36 37 38 To further elucidate the mechanisms of chemokine expression in A549 we have compared the induction of IL 8 MCP 1 and RANTES by RSV infection with that of TNF Our findings suggest that RSV induction of chemokine gene expression involves a redox sensitive NF B signaling mechanism that differs from that mediated by TNF and involving predominantly the Rel A subunit of NF B Materials and

Rel A or p50 binding as per the manufacturer s instructions Optical density was determined on a spectophotometer at 450 nm Results RSV induction of chemokine expression differs from that induced by TNFalpha As shown in Fig 1 RSV infection of A549 epithelial cells induces the production and secretion of the chemokines IL 8 MCP 1 and RANTES In A549 epithelial cells substantial MCP 1 was constitutively expressed whereas little or no spontaneous IL 8 or RANTES was detected However upon RSV infection MOI 3 a significant increase in chemokine production and secretion was observed 24 hr post infection for each of the chemokines To determine whether the chemokine induction was mediated by increased chemokine gene expression we assessed the kinetics of mRNA synthesis by chemokine specific RNase protection A549 cells were infected with RSV MOI 1 or stimulated with TNF 100 ng ml and total RNA isolated at various times post treatment over a 24 hr time course As shown in Fig 2 RSV rapidly induced IL 8 and MCP 1 with steady state mRNA readily detected as early as 1 hr and continued to increase over the 24 hr time course In contrast RANTES mRNA was not detected until 4 hrs post infection after which its expression rapidly increased also reaching a maximum at 24 hrs The RSV induction kinetics differed dramatically from the induction kinetics for TNF in the same experiment Whereas RSV induction of the chemokines did not reach a maximum until 24 hrs TNF induction was maximal between 4 and 8 hrs and was either unchanged or lower at 24 hrs post infection The magnitude of induction also differed between TNF and RSV infection In general TNF was a stronger inducer of chemokine expression This difference was also reflected in the amount of chemokine secreted from the cells data not shown Together these data indicate that RSV infection of A549 epithelial cells induces chemokine expression with distinct kinetics suggesting the mechanism of RSV induction differs from that of proinflammatory cytokines NF kappaB inhibitors differentially effect RSV and TNFalpha induction of chemokine expression IL 8 MCP 1 and RANTES gene expression are regulated by the redox responsive transcription factor NF B 18 20 23 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 41 42 43 44 The NF B signaling pathways have been shown to be differentially affected by antioxidants and glucocorticoid steroids 45 To determine whether RSV and TNF induction of chemokine expression might be mediated by different NF B signaling pathways we pretreated A549 cells with the glutathione precursor N acetyl L cysteine NAC or the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone DEX Twenty four hours post infection total RNA was isolated and steady state mRNA expression analyzed by chemokine specific RNase protection As shown in Fig 3 the two inhibitors had very different effects on chemokine gene expression Most strikingly RSV induced chemokine expression was more sensitive to NAC whereas TNF induced chemokine expression was conversely more sensitive to DEX Thus NAC preferentially inhibited chemokine expression induced by RSV while DEX predominantly inhibited chemokine expression induced by TNF Differential inhibition of TNFalpha and RSV induced NF kappaB NF B binds to the chemokine promoter as either homo or heterodimers composed of Rel A p65 and NF B1 p50 Initially we detected TNF and RSV induction of NF B by EMSA KA Roebuck and LR Carpenter unpublished data but because multiple gel shift complexes were induced it was not possible to distinguish the individual contributions of Rel A and p50 to the formation of these complexes Therefore to assess the induction of the Rel A and p50 subunits individually in A549 nuclear cell extracts we used a subunit specific NF B binding ELISA system that utilizes anti Rel A and anti p50 antibodies As shown in Fig 4 Rel A and p50 subunits of NF B are differentially expressed and induced in A549 epithelial cells In untreated cells no Rel A solid bars was detectable whereas in resting cells constitutive levels of p50 were observed open bars suggesting that unstimulated A549 epithelial cells contain p50 homodimers which with regard to transcriptional activity have been shown to be functionally inert or inhibitory In contrast cells stimulated by TNF Fig 4A or infected by RSV Fig 4B markedly induced Rel A the transcriptionally active subunit of NF B In addition TNF was also able to induce p50 by about 5 fold whereas RSV increased the constitutive p50 level by only about 50 The induction of Rel A and p50 were specific since competition with either wild type or mutant consensus NF B oligonucleotide respectively inhibited or not the RSV and TNF induced binding activity These data demonstrate that TNF is a potent inducer of both Rel A and p50 whereas RSV primarily induces the Rel A subunit of NF B To determine whether RSV and TNF activate NF B differently we examined the effects of NAC and DEX on Rel A and p50 binding activity As shown in Fig 4 Rel A and p50 subunits are differentially inhibited by NAC and DEX which have been shown to inhibit NF B by distinct mechanisms Both NAC and DEX were unable to inhibit TNF induction of either Rel A or p50 In contrast in RSV infected cells both DEX and NAC inhibited Rel A and p50 binding activity However the inhibitory effects were most striking for Rel A suggesting the inhibitors primarily target the RSV induction of Rel A The differential effects of NAC on TNF and RSV induced NF B binding activity correlated with its effects on chemokine gene expression Fig 3 and protein secretion data not shown suggesting that RSV induces IL 8 MCP 1 and RANTES through redox sensitive NF B binding complexes DEX also showed differential effects on NF B binding activity with DEX preferentially inhibiting RSV induction of NF B However the effects of DEX on NF B binding induced by TNF did not correlate with its effects on chemokine expression suggesting in TNF activation of chemokine gene expression DEX targets another mechanism of chemokine induction not involving NF B Discussion In this study we examined the role of NF B in the activation of chemokine gene expression in response to TNF and RSV infection The inhibitor studies correlating chemokine gene expression and NF B binding activity indicate that RSV in contrast to TNF induces IL 8 MCP 1 and RANTES expression in A549 epithelial cells through a redox sensitive NF B signaling pathway that appears to involve predominately Rel A IL 8 MCP 1 and RANTES are known redox regulated genes and our results are consistent with the findings that oxidant tone can regulate chemokine gene expression in RSV infected airway epithelial cells 46 47 48 NF B activation is controlled by its inhibitory protein I B which when phosphorylated on ser32 and ser36 marks it for degradation by the 26S proteosome complex Thus I B is a potential regulatory target for the differential induction of NF B Although we have not directly examined the role of I B Fiedler et al 49 50 have reported differential effects of RSV and TNF on I B activity in A549 epithelial cells In addition Bitko and Barik 51 have demonstrated that another I B protein I B may also contribute via a redox sensitive pathway to NF B activation by RSV In addition to NF B dependent regulation there appears to also be NF B independent activation of chemokine expression since DEX inhibited TNF induced chemokine expression but not NF B binding activity Along these lines it has been shown that RSV activation of chemokine gene promoters involves multiple inducible transcription factors including AP 1 52 53 which is also a redox sensitive transcription factor important in chemokine gene expression 28 36 54 AP 1 can also be inhibited by DEX and has been shown to cooperate with NF B to mediate RSV induction of IL 8 46 55 The differential effects of NAC and DEX on chemokine gene expression and NF B activation suggest that the mechanisms of RSV and TNF activation of NF B and chemokine expression differ possibly involving distinct NF B signaling mechanisms TNF rapidly and potently activates Rel A and p50 subunits of NF B through a kinase mediated phosphorylation cascade involving a high molecular mass signaling complex called the IKK complex 56 TNF activation of the multiprotein IKK complex results in the serine phorsphorylation of I B and the subsequent activation of NF B 57 Consistent with the idea of RSV and TNF activating distinct NF B signaling pathways we found that the NF B inhibitor NAC had differential effects on chemokine gene expression In contrast to TNF RSV induced chemokine expression was sensitive to NAC particularly the Rel A p65 subunit NAC is an antioxidant thiol that raises the intracellular pool of glutathione the major redox regulating mechanism in the A549 epithelial cell line 45 Interestingly it has been reported that NAC can have differential effects on NF B binding activity suggesting only a subset of NF B binding complexes are redox sensitive 58 Moreover it has been shown that NAC inhibits Rel A p50 heterodimers but not p50 homodimers and can inhibit NF B binding to only certain variant B elements which presumably interact with distinct redox sensitive NF B binding complexes 59 These observations are consistent with our findings that indicate NAC predominantly inhibits Rel A homodimers since that was the major NF B subunit induced by RSV infection of A549 cells Consistent with RSV and TNF inducing functionally distinct NF B binding complexes AP 1 was recently shown to be the preferential cooperative partner with NF B in RSV induced IL 8 expression 46 whereas in TNF induced expression NF B cooperates preferentially with NF IL 6 18 19 22 Apparently the stimulus specific gene regulation of chemokines is complex involving differential cooperativity of redox sensitive and redox resistant NF B complexes with other transcription factors to form unique higher order transcription complexes Conclusions Taken together our data indicate that RSV in contrast to the cytokine TNF activate NF B and chemokine gene expression through a redox sensitive NF B signaling pathway involving predominately Rel A Competing interests None declared
