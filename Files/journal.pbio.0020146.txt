                                       a complete comprehensive understanding of odor  may not seem a          profound enough problem to dominate all the life sciences but it contains piece by          piece all the mysteries  Lewis Thomas                One of the oldest beliefs about human perception is that we have a poor sense of smell        Not only is this a general belief among the public but it appears to have a scientific        basis Recent genetic studies show a decline in the number of functional olfactory receptor        genes through primate evolution to humans Human evolution was characterized by the gradual        ascendance of vision and reduction of smell evidenced in the anthropological record by the        progressive diminution of the snout as the eyes moved to the middle of the face to subserve        depth vision Jones et al  Concurrently the use of an arboreal habitat and the        adoption of an erect posture moved the nose away from the ground with its rich varieties        of odors        However some recent behavioral studies suggest that primates including humans have        relatively good senses of smell Resolution of this paradox may come from a larger        perspective on the biology of smell Here we begin by reassessing several overlooked        factors the structure of the nasal cavity retronasal smell olfactory brain areas and        language In these arenas humans may have advantages which outweigh their lower numbers of        receptors It appears that in the olfactory system olfactory receptor genes do not map        directly onto behavior rather behavior is the outcome of multiple factors If human smell        perception is better than we thought it may have played a more important role in human        evolution than is usually acknowledged                    Gene Studies        From rodents through the primate series to humans there is a progressive reduction in        the proportion of functional olfactory receptor genes Rouquier et al  Gilad et al         Mice have approximately  olfactory receptor genes of which some  are        functional Young et al  Zhang and Firestein  whereas humans have only some         functional genes of approximately  Glusman et al  Zozulya et al  The        conclusion seems obvious the low number of functional olfactory receptor genes in humans        compared with rodentsand presumably most other mammalsis directly correlated with the        evolutionary decline in the human sense of smell                    Behavioral Studies        Although these conclusions seem incontrovertible they are challenged by some recent        behavioral studies One type of study shows that much of the olfactory system can be        removed with no effect on smell perception The olfactory receptor genes map        topographically onto the first relay station a sheet of modules called glomeruli in the        olfactory bulb Up to  of the glomerular layer in the rat can be removed without        significant effect on olfactory detection and discrimination Bisulco and Slotnick         If the remaining  of the glomeruliand the olfactory receptor genes they representcan        subserve the functions of  genes it implies that  genes in the human are more than        enough to smell as well as a mouse        Another type of study has tested smell perception in primates and has shown that        despite their reduced olfactory receptor gene repertoire primates including humans have        surprisingly good senses of smell Laska et al  Comparing the data on smell        detection thresholds shows that humans not only perform as well or better than other        primates they also perform as well or better than other mammals When tested for        thresholds to the odors of a series of straightchain aliphatic aldehydes dogs do better        on the short chain compounds but humans perform as well or slightly better than dogs on        the longer chain compounds and humans perform significantly better than rats Laska et al         Similar results have been obtained with other types of odors        A third type of study demonstrating human olfactory abilities shows that in tests of        odor detection humans outperform the most sensitive measuring instruments such as the gas        chromatograph        These results indicate that humans are not poor smellers a condition technically called        microsmats but rather are relatively good perhaps even excellent smellers macrosmats        Laska et al  This may come as a surprise to many people though not to those who        make their living by their noses such as oenologists perfumers and food scientists        Anyone who has taken part in a wine tasting or observed professional testing of food        flavors or perfumes knows that the human sense of smell has extraordinary capacities for        discrimination                    The Mystery        Here then is the mystery how can one reconcile a relatively high sensitivity to smell        with a relatively low number of olfactory receptors in the nose To answer this question I        think we need to look beyond the olfactory receptor genes and consider olfaction in its        full behavioral context This requires considering several overlooked aspects of the        olfactory system the nasal cavity the oropharyngeal cavity the olfactory brain and the        role of language In this article I focus on behaviors related to conscious perception of        ordinary smells Pheromones and the rich world of unconscious effects of odors and        pheromones are beyond the present scope cf Jacob et al  though they undoubtedly        will add to the general conclusions                    The Filtering Apparatus of the Nasal Cavity        A marked difference between the noses of primates and other mammals is that in nearly        all nonprimate mammals the nasal cavities contain at the front a muchconvoluted filtering        apparatus formed by the ethmo and maxilloturbinals covered with respiratory membrane        This filtering apparatus is a biological air conditioner Negus  with three key        functions cleaning warming and humidifying the inspired air An important function of        the filtering apparatus is presumably to protect the nasal cavity from infections In many        mammals air drawn into the nose is often highly contaminated with bacteria from fecal        material decaying animal and plant material and noxious fumes from the environment all        of which attack the olfactory epithelium Rodents are susceptible to chronic rhinitis        which causes substantial loss of functioning olfactory receptor cells Hinds et al                This filtering however might have negative consequences for odor detection Warming        and humidification presumably enhance the odorstimulating capacity of the inhaled air but        cleaning would remove odor molecules by absorbing them into the lining of the epithelium        an effect which could be large depending on the size of the filtering apparatus If so        mammals with large snouts might have a large inventory of olfactory receptors at least in        part to offset the loss of odor molecules absorbed by the filtering apparatus        How do these considerations relate to humans The evolution of humans involved lifting        the nose away from the noxious ground environment as they adopted a bipedal posture Aiello        and Dean  This would have reduced the need for the filtering apparatus and with it        the losses of absorbed odor molecules The large numbers of olfactory receptors and        receptor cells would have come under reduced adaptive pressure and could accordingly be        reduced in proportion        By this hypothesis during human evolution the snout could be reduced in dimensions and        complexity without compromising the ultimate amounts of odorized air reaching the olfactory        epithelium The reduced snout allowed the eyes to come forward and lie closer together to        promote more effective stereoscopic vision Thus vision could become more dominant in        humans without sacrificing unduly the sense of smell Tests of this hypothesis are needed        including calculations of air flows and odor losses through the filtering apparatus in        mammals with extensive filtering apparatuses compared with the simpler nasal cavities of        primates                    Humans Receive Richer Retronasal Smells        Being carried in with inhaled air the orthonasal route is not the only way for odor        molecules to reach the olfactory receptor cells Odor molecules also reach the olfactory        receptor cells via the retronasal route from the back of the oral cavity through the        nasopharynx into the back of the nasal cavity Although the orthonasal route is the one        usually used to test for smell perception the retronasal route is the main source of the        smells we perceive from foods and liquids within our mouths These are the smells that        primarily determine the hedonic ie pleasurable or aversive qualities of foods and        that combined with taste and somatosensation form the complex sensation of flavor It is        likely for several reasons that this is an important route for smell in humans        First with the adoption of bipedalism humans became increasingly wide ranging with        concomitant diversification of diet and retronasal smells Second the advent of fire        perhaps as early as  million years ago Wrangham and ConklinBrittain  made the        human diet more odorous and tasty From this time also one can begin to speak of human        cuisines of prepared foods with all their diversity of smells Wrangham and        ConklinBrittain  support the view that prepared cuisines based on cooked foods are        one of the defining characteristics of humans Third added to the cooked cuisines were        fermented foods and liquids with their own strong flavors These developments occurred        among the early huntergatherer human cultures and continued through the last ice age With        the transition to agricultural and urban cultures  years ago human cuisines changed        by the advent of animal domestication plant cultivation use of spices and of complex        procedures such as those for producing cheeses and wines all of which produced foodstuffs        that especially stimulate the smell receptors in the nose through the retronasal route and        contribute to complex flavors        These considerations suggest the hypothesis that the retronasal route for smells has        delivered a richer repertoire of smells in humans than in nonhuman primates and other        mammals see Figure  Research on retronasal olfaction is being actively pursued        reviewed in Deibler and Delwiche  Studies are needed of the evolutionary pressures        on this route in addition to the pressures on the evolution of the snout                    Humans Smell with Bigger and Better Brains        Comparisons of the decreasing size of the olfactory system relative to expansion of the        visual auditory and somatosensory systems usually focus on the olfactory bulb and lateral        olfactory tract which are relatively small However what matters more are the central        olfactory brain regions that process the olfactory input as the basis for smell        perception        These regions are more extensive in humans than is usually realized The dedicated        olfactory regions include the olfactory cortex the olfactory tubercle the entorhinal        cortex parts of the amygdala parts of the hypothalamus the mediodorsal thalamus the        medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortex and parts of the insula Neville and Haberly         These regions are involved in immediate processing of odor input and probably        subserve the specific tasks of smell detection and simple smell discrimination For more        complex tasks memory becomes important in comparing smells thus involving the temporal        and frontal lobes eg Buchanan et al  and the specifically human higher        association areas It may be hypothesized that these regions enable humans to bring far        more cognitive power to bear on odor discrimination than is possible in the rodent and        other mammals        The reduced repertoire of olfactory receptor genes in the human is thus offset by the        expanded repertoire of higher brain mechanisms Rather than being restricted to a tiny part        of the brain olfactory processing of complex smells such as those produced by human        cuisines draws on the enlarged processing capacity of the human brain                    Language Is Necessary for Human Smell        In the enlarged processing capacity for perceiving and discriminating odors language        plays a critical role This seems paradoxical for we have great difficulty describing a        smell in words Insight into this difficulty comes from the finding that different smells        are represented in the olfactory bulb by different patterns of olfactory glomerular        activity These patterns function as virtual odor images Xu et al  It has been        hypothesized that these odor images provide the basis for discrimination between odors        analogous to the way that retinal images are the basis for discrimination of visual pattern        stimuli The complex patterns constituting odor images may be considered as analogous to        the complex patterns constituting visual images of faces And just as we are very good at        recognizing a human face yet have difficulty describing it in words we have a hard time        describing and verbally comparing odor images        Because of this difficulty describing a smell or a taste in words is very demanding A        professional wine tasting for example requires many steps analysing both orthonasal and        retronasal perception comparing the two in memory with each other and with all other wines        to be compared identifying the constituent properties separate from the hedonic qualities        and finding the words to describe the process as it unfolds leading to the final        formulation to characterize the quality of the wine and identify it as distinct from all        others It may be characterized as hard cognitive work that only a human among all the        animals with olfactory organs can do It may be argued that this is what humans are        adapted to do Wrangham and ConklinBrittain         This cognitive work is largely independent of the numbers of peripheral receptor cells        and their genes A good analogy is with language There are some  auditory        nerve fibers in the rat and cat and some  in the human cf Hall and Masengill         This modest increase in the input from the peripheral auditory receptors provides        little basis for the development of human speech and language which had much more to do        with the increase in the central brain mechanisms that elaborate the input It may be        hypothesized that a similar conclusion applies to human olfaction                    Implications for Systems Biology        A general result from these considerations is that there appears not to be a onetoone        relation between the number of olfactory receptor genes and the detection and        discrimination of odors This implies that we are dealing with a fundamental problem in        relating genes to systems behavior a given set of genes may not map directly onto a given        behavior In this respect the mystery being addressed here is a caution for the new era of        systems biology and against any belief that behavior can be related directly to genomes        proteomes or any other type of ome We are reminded instead that the functional ecology        of the body is dependent on many factors                    Conclusions        Much about the sense of smell seems enigmatic and conflicting This is partly because of        the inherent difficulties in presenting smell stimuli and partly because there is not yet        a recognition of all the relevant mechanisms that are involved        It may be hoped that the hypotheses and mechanisms discussed here can help to address        and resolve the mystery of the apparent noncorrelation of olfactory receptor gene numbers        with smell acuity and in doing so stimulate a major reassessment of human smell        perception Such an effort cuts across many academic disciplines Molecular biologists need        to continue their efforts to characterize the olfactory genomes of humans and nonhuman        mammals more closely to compare how different organisms sample odor space Physiologists        need to devise highthroughput systems to test these odor spaces Behavioral        neuroscientists need to develop increasingly accurate tests of olfactory function that        enable comparisons across different species Psychologists need to explore even more        vigorously the subtle ways that smells can influence human behavior Anthropologists and        paleontologists need to study the olfactory parts of the cranium and face from this new        perspective to reassess the role that both orthonasal and retronasal smell may have played        in primate and human evolution        The factors reviewed here suggest that the sense of smell is more important in humans        than is generally realized which in turn suggests that it may have played a bigger role in        the evolution of human diet habitat and social behavior than has been appreciated All of        these considerations should stimulate a greater interest in this neglected sense
