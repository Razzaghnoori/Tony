 Analyst Whores Qualcomm Soars If there s one thing to hope for after this day on which the Nasdaq leapt over 4 000 hardly a month after it crossed 3 000 it s that three months from now no one remembers Walt Piecyk s name Piecyk is the Paine Webber telecom analyst who this morning put a 12 month price target of 1 000 a share on Qualcomm which closed yesterday at 503 a share Piecyk s call sent Qualcomm s stock back off to the races It opened at 560 and ended the day at 659 which is a leap of 31 percent That s respectable by any standard but it s especially remarkable when you consider that Qualcomm before today was already the best performing stock in the S P 500 Index up about 1 800 percent for the year It s now up better than 2 300 percent I know I know These numbers are effectively gibberish especially since I could fill this column every day with stories about stocks making incredible moves upward So why does it matter or not matter whether in May the mention of Walt Piecyk s name will be greeted with anything other than Who The simplest answer is that the success of calls like Piecyk s success here meaning just that investors buy on the news of your price target leads to more calls just like it When Henry Blodget who was then at CIBC Oppenheimer said that Amazon s shares would hit 400 within the year he was right it catapulted him into national attention and in some sense probably got him his new job at Merrill Lynch And other analysts noticed When FreeMarkets a hot new business to business company went public a few weeks ago an analyst at a firm that wasn t underwriting the deal initiated coverage on the day of the IPO and set a price target of 300 a share even though the company was going public at 48 a share It s become almost de rigueur in fact for analysts to make audacious calls Otherwise they won t even be noticed You can see the same phenomenon at work in analysts estimates of things like that fabled Internet business to business market For a while now the number everyone s been tossing around is 1 3 trillion in 2003 But that means that if you re an analyst and you cite that number no one will notice you So now the numbers are getting ratcheted up to the point where a recent Goldman Sachs study said the market could be as large as 2 5 trillion And of course here I am mentioning the report The phenomenon of number creep is bad because we want analysts to reach conclusions they think are true and not conclusions that they think are going to get them on CNBC I realize this is incredibly naive but there it is And the truth is that there still isn t enough accountability for these kinds of forecasts to make the rewards and punishments for success and failure commensurate But the phenomenon is also bad because these kinds of calls have become market moving events which means that it s no longer irrational to trade as a result of them at least if you re a trader According to a traditional definition of information about a stock as in a stock s price reflects all the available information the market has about it Piecyk s report was not new Moreover when you consider that Qualcomm was already up 1 800 percent for the year the appropriate question to ask is probably Why are you just starting to cover this stock now But if we broaden the definition of information to include everything that might affect that stock s price even in the short term then the report has to be considered new information which means that it has to affect the stock price And that means that ignoring it is not necessarily rational even if there s nothing valuable about Piecyk s analysis The best thing for everyone then will be for Qualcomm to settle back in the next couple of months or even just rise slightly and for Piecyk s forecast to be forgotten In the long run even in this stock market companies stock prices will find their true level But what has become incredibly clear in 1999 is that the signal to noise ratio in the stock market is degenerating with something like Piecyk s report being noise and that means that it will take longer for those true levels to be reached
