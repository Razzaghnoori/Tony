 How Accurate Is Once and Again Remarkably as it turns out Culturebox isn t a divorced mom in the suburbs but she did conduct an informal survey of divorced suburban parents she knows on the realism of Once and Again That s the much touted new drama by writers producers directors Ed Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz who is divorced about two divorced parents in the suburbs who meet cute while dropping their kids off at school and date even cuter It airs tonight on ABC at 10 p m Here are two picayune but quite common details of the separated life that Culturebox for one has never seen on a TV series before If you have please write Culturebox and tell her where The endless shlepping Children in joint custody arrangements invariably forget stuff at one parent s house and make the other one take them there late at night or first thing in the morning At the beginning of the episode Eli Sammler 11th grade son of the male half of the new couple Rick Sammler announces he has to be taken to his mother s because he s left his history notes there The homework falling through holes syndrome It s completely understandable that parents who don t communicate well would have a hard time keeping track of schoolwork done by one child at two households during the course of a single week This comes up in Once and Again when Eli starts failing two subjects at school because Rick doesn t make the teen ager buckle down on the nights he sleeps at Rick s house Many of the other details of divorce on Once and Again are the regular fare of family sitcoms or dramas There s the slightly tired riff about deadbeat dads Lily s ex husband promises to show up at their daughter s soccer game but forgets about it until Lily angrily reminds him There are the mutual accusations of denial or neurosis with each parent accusing the other either of refusing to face their children s problems or of making too much of them There s the way the smart aleck children discuss the details of their parents sex lives with them That last in fact strikes the falsest note in Once and Again since it has been Culturebox s experience that real children will go to some lengths to avoid the disgusting details of a parent s sex life Zwick and Herskovitz grasp this in principle since at one point they have Lily s daughter asking plaintively Why can t they keep their private lives private But the needs of dramatic exposition clearly proved too much for the show s creators How else are you going to get Lily and Rick to go into their feelings for each other or at least about dating if they aren t going to share with their kids After all who else do divorced parents spend their time with Lily gossips some with her sister an annoyingly perky single creature but goes on and on about her fears of dating with her daughters Rick mostly keeps things to himself but is interrogated by curious children Despite lapses like these Once and Again strikes Culturebox as the first show to make an attempt to capture divorce as it is lived today With a 50 percent divorce rate in America and 3 out of 10 households run by a single parent three times as many as two decades ago Once and Again seems poised to become for joint custody what Thirtysomething was for yuppie angst
