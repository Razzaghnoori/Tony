W Bush touches on foreign policy health care Social Security and sex education among other issues On foreign policy he says that the Somalia and Haiti invasions would not have happened under his watch When host Tim Russert reminds him that his father initiated the Somalia intervention W simply reasserts that he will not intervene on humanitarian grounds except in rare circumstances W goes out of his way to emphasize the need for a theater anti missile defense system both for the U S and Taiwan He downplays the importance of arms control stressing instead the need for non proliferation anti missile systems and the safe storage of existing nuclear weapons He pledges to increase military salaries and military R D budgets Asked if the Clinton administration is too supportive of Russian President Boris Yeltsin Bush replies cryptically That s going to be an interesting debate in the fall campaign if I m the nominee let me just put it to you that way We ll find out about Victor Chernomyrdin and the U S Vice President and the relationship they have On health care Bush supports allowing a patient to sue her HMO if an independent review board has decided that she has a reasonable dispute This position is more lawsuit friendly than the House GOP leadership Asked about Social Security W indicates a willingness to raise the current benefit receiving age Responding to Bush on CNN s Late Edition Steve Forbes advocates transforming Social Security into personal savings accounts which would allow recipients to choose their own retirement age When Russert reads a Naomi Wolf quote advocating that sex education instructors promote fondling and mutual masturbation as an alternative to sex Bush says Wolf s advice is pathetic says condom promotion hasn t decreased teen

on important budget issues like tax cuts and across the board spending cuts Paul Gigot PBS s NewsHour With Jim Lehrer notes that spending in this year s budget has grown at twice the rate of inflation

Capital Gang says her campaign needs a James Carville figure to rev things up and Mark Shields Capital Gang says she has an uphill battle George Stephanopoulos ABC s This Week says that focus groups show that the voters wish there were different candidates running Kate O Beirne predicts Hillary will drop out of the race and wonders how she ll ever be able to run for president if she can t win New York But several shows flash the results of a New York Post poll showing Clinton only seven points behind Giuliani Bill Kristol This Week notes that seven points behind one year before the election in

president Both This Week and Late Edition review a new Bush campaign commercial in which W pledges to restore dignity to the presidency Bill Kristol notes that the message is not just anti Clinton but
