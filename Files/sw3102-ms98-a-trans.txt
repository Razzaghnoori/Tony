              so uh lets see what what was the topic i forgot oh oh we are supposed to talk   advice for people taking for parents uh help their kids through college   yeah do you have any children   no i just graduated from college yes   oh did you where did you go   i went to Clarion   Clarion   uhhuh   huh uh would you i mean if you had children would you want them to go to a certain place or   um i would want them to make that decision and i would you know uh i pretty much made my decision on my own and my brother older brother likewise   yeah uhhuh   and uh you know we we were both pretty much happy with what we did so i think i would not push them towards any one place   yeah uhhuh yeah i know i kind of feel the same way i i just finished college a couple years ago and i uh you know it was while i had my family and everything and it was a lot harder but uh you know i went to a college that was fairly local and i feel like my education you know you get out of it what you put into it i think   uhhuh   but you know i know its some people are real adamant about you know going to a certain school or whatever   uhhuh   i do not know i guess it a lot of it would depend on maybe what your major was or something i do not know but   yeah exactly i think one of the first things kids ought to look for is first of all they have to decide what they want to major in and then you know find a school thats good for that   but uhhuh yeah is that why you picked the school you did or   well i picked it for a couple of reasons it was only about an hour and ten minutes away from home so it was far enough away that i was away but yet close enough if i ever wanted to go home i could   uhhuh yeah yeah   uh   so you lived there at school then   pardon me   you lived there at school   yeah i lived up at school yeah   uhhuh   uh another reason was uh i paid for my entire education so i had to look for something that i could afford economically you know   uhhuh right   you know and uh Clarion was oh it was roughly around six thousand a year   uhhuh and that was for tuition and   yeah that was for everything and now i did not go out a lot and i did not order out a lot and i you know i did not spend money on myself   uhhuh uhhuh   but uh then again i was there for school so   yeah   uh and then another reason was i was not sure you know i always wanted to go to school for nursing and then at the last minute i changed my mind   uhhuh   and i knew that Clarion was known you know  for two things actually for their they are known as a teachers school   uhhuh   and also for their business so thats what i ended up going for is for business uhhuh   for business so uh are you working somewhere then or   no no not yet i am moving shortly so i am not looking around here   oh i see where are you going to move to   uh Maryland uhhuh   oh are you do you have friends there or   my fiancee is down there   oh i see       so does he work for a company down there   yeah he works for the government   oh i see oh the big company   yeah   so yeah i i have been working for TI for about twelve years i guess so   uhhuh     but i am not originally i am originally from Illinois but you know i have gone to college i guess a few different places but i think you know most for the most part you know the teachers have been pretty good and i have got out of it what i have what i have put into it   uhhuh   so but you know i think i think thats most of it personally but thats why i you know with my kids i think that you know i am just going to encourage them to go and i am going to try to help them financially but uh i think you know financially i am theres only so much i can do for them and i will say heres what you have got you can either you know go a couple of years locally and you know then if you want to move off to a more expensive school then we might be able to handle it but   exactly uhhuh   otherwise you can just go for four years you know somewhere and i will try to try to help you but uh i do not know you know the financial end of it like you said i put my wife through school too of course TI paid for a lot of the tuition and books and stuff but uh it still was a challenge to do and uh so i think you know financially thats thats one of the big aspects   exactly yeah   you know you   it does have a lot of bearing on it whether you are paying for yourself or whether your parents are you know   right yeah well did you uh since you were paid for school yourself do you think you had a different outlook on it like your grades and things like that   uh yeah because i was paying for it myself i kind of slacked off because i felt it was mine and i could do with it what i wanted   uhhuh   i think if my parents would have paid for it they would have been on me you know   uhhuh   uh they pretty much got to the point well well you know you are at that age and you are going to have to decide what you want to do if you goof up its your fault its not ours you know   right right   and then lets me go and i mean i did not do poorly i finished with a two five thats not that wonderful either   uhhuh yeah   but uh you know i i i mean i worked i did not you know goof around i worked it was just harder you know it was i do not know i was used to being you know on top and when i started there it was like you are mediocre so   yeah right yeah well see i think you know i have known a lot of people that would go to school and their parents paid for it and and i guess it depends on the way you are raised too but if you if you grow to expect that you know you kind of go there as sort of a vacation   uhhuh   you know i thats the way a lot of my friends did it and you know they were not they did not take it very serious i know i took it real serious because i did not start to college until you know   yeah     i was about eight or ten years and uh you know out of what i should have been in school   uhhuh   but uh you know so i think that helped me be real serious about it and i i ended up graduating with like a three point six   oh wow thats really good   yeah so i you know and that was hard cause i had two kids and you know a family and everything else so i had a lot of different hats to wear all at the same time but   uhhuh yeah see well i screwed myself up also there was a point in time that i decided that i did not want to in school and my parents never pushed me until my dad just said what are you going to do and i said well i am going to go because i have not whipping butter the rest of my life you know   yeah you are right exactly   so i went and i just took business well being as i was paying for it myself you know i just kept you do not get into your major until like your second or third year   uhhuh right   and i am going into my third year and i decided well i do not want to do accounting anymore right   uhhuh   and i thought oh my God i am paying for this myself i am not switching completely because i will put myself a year behind so i switched to finance and i liked it better   right yeah   and i pulled myself from a two oh to a two five you know in my last year my senior year   uhhuh yeah   but i would have really liked to go on uh secondary ed with math education but it was just the fact i was paying for it myself i was not going to put myself behind another year   uhhuh right right well my my wife was sort of in the same situation she was she went to school to be a teacher just because she did not really know what else to go for   uhhuh   and she did not realize until she got to be a senior and was doing her student teaching that she did not like it   uhhuh   but you know by then she had practically got her degree so so you know   exactly i think if uh i would have went with the math i think i would have done a lot better because i was more interested and thats what i i knew thats what i wanted   uhhuh   but uh i think a lot of kids that hold off a year or two oh my gosh i would like to see the results on a study done i think they would do a lot better because they are more focused   uhhuh yeah   they know exactly what they want to do   yeah i think i think you are right when you pull yourself away and then you get out and you say man i really need this   uhhuh
