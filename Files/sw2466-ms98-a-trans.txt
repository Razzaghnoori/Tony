 okay okay that made a nice ugly sound yeah your name is Lynn Linda okay so Linda uh huh so it sounds like you like to read yeah i i read quite a bit i probably don t read as much as i would like to i don t read as much as i would like to either i m i m a single mom but i i ve always loved reading what do you like to read uh huh um well um i m a i m a counselor a therapist by trade so most of my books are um i guess what you d call self improvement type of books oh well that s what i ve been reading lately a lot of um my interests switch around dramatically i used to read just mainly fiction fiction and now i like like a said i ve read a lot of self self help books uh huh what kind of things have you read oh i read all kinds of things for um helping people uh survive a divorce uh The Road Less Traveled was probably one of my favorites have you read that um hum um hum i i haven t gotten through it yet you haven t no okay well what would you recommend um as as far as dealing with divorce oh i m i m kind of getting that one past me but a good self help book good self help well um probably the best one that i i know of and i work with all the time is called Search for Significance yeah um that sounds good it s by Robert Magee and it s one that that we use in our work uh it s probably one you d find in in like a Christian book store um uh huh i don t know what the chains are down there maybe in the mall family book store something like that uh huh i m writing it down that does sound that s sound really good um what kind of counseling do you do or should we stay on the topic of books um probably should stay on the topic but that has a little bit to do with some of the things that i read i um um hum a therapist for Rossa it s a Christian treatment organization oh and because of that i see i work with adolescents specifically so i i see a lot of kids with with various problems right now some of the things i m working with are kids that are dealing with sexual abuse so a lot of the books i ve been reading uh have to do with with helping them get through uh those issues oh i would imagine helping them feel good about themselves they re at a bad stage anyway and then to have to deal with sexual abuse would be terrible as a teen um hum that s uh boy uh that must be a wonderful feeling to be in that profession and be able to make a contribution like that well sometimes it s rewarding and and sometimes it s a struggle oh i m sure i m sure um what other is is that just the only type of reading you ve been doing or do you have you read any good novels lately um i guess i i ve got so many books like that that i need to read it s it s hard for me to do a lot of uh reading yeah reading just for enjoyment just joy reading yeah i i i hear you there that s for sure in fact um i guess the last book book i ve read um my oldest daughter uh huh uh had to read Lost Horizons for her English class and i just realized i had never read it growing up so i just finished reading that for enjoyment um hum hum that s neat and it was it was good um she she s not didn t enjoy it much so i didn t get much satisfaction trying to discuss it with her but uh i thought it was real interesting yeah i ve always wanted to go back and read some of my literature texts from college um because i enjoyed some of those stories so much but i never seem to have the time to do that kind of reading um hum um hum i know yeah um i m trying to think of some of my other favorite books but uh i i keep lists i must have a list of oh two hundred three hundred books that i want to read it just like oh i want to read that and i write it down oh uh huh yeah i ve got a a stack next to my bed i i tend to get a a little bit of ways in a book and then i i get distracted and or have to start on another one and so do i it s pretty tough to keep up with i was trying to think of of of i ve got a copy of The Road Less Traveled but i was trying to think there s another Scott Pack book that i ve got that i had read so i was uh he he also wrote People of the Lie and yeah that s the one i was thinking of yeah i i bought that one and i didn t get into involved in that one as well there s another one he wrote that even sounds better and it s kind of uh the whole concept of global peace you know it s like and communities building communities and uh um hum someone just recently said something really neat about that uh i got involved in uh Beginning Experience Weekends and uh it was one of the people from there that uh that said that his latest book and i don t can t recall the name of it is just excellent and his whole idea is we can build a better world if people get involved in good community building projects and he did uh mention Beginning Experience Weekends as one of the you know one of the places so i have um hum that s interesting yeah it it really was a a a real fun books bunch of books that i read uh the beginning of last year were um the author of Jonathan Jonathan Livingston Seagull Seagull i can t think of his name right now pardon me um hum is it Swift Swift uh no uh oh it ll it ll come to me but he wrote he wrote the Illusions the Illusions Illusions and A Bridge Over Time uh uh huh A Bridge to Forever those are really really mind expanding books his concepts are so different than what i would have ever dreamed of hum i can t think of what his name is right right off the bat though but uh they they they were fun they were real just books for fun um hum have you been involved on the switchboard long um not very long i i really just started uh huh how did you get involved my wife has been working for TI oh i see i m a former uh a former TI er i just recently quit and so uh i got myself involved in a sales job and right now uh my list of books to be read have to do with uh the art of selling so oh uh huh yeah i was just i was just thinking at at Rossa they they tend to come out with a new book every couple of weeks uh huh just to help us deal with with all the things that we have to deal with so i keep getting stacks of books i need to read and i don t know when i m going to get to them all there s never there s never going to be enough hours in the day even if you took speed reading huh yeah i don t think so yeah i don t think so so well i m trying to think of what other kind have do you like to read mysteries yeah a little bit have do you like Ken Follett um trying to think he he writes uh spy novels The Eye of the Needle and uh i i ve really i ve really have found his books en joyable uh huh well i like that kind of stuff i think the last novel i read i read in i guess in conjunction with my wife over vacation last year it was a um his last name s Peretti it s called Piercing no it s called This Present Darkness um it s uh it s kind of unusual book it s a lot about uh spiritual warfare and some things like that oh that sounds interesting it sounds really good hey you should make yourself a promise that you ll you ll read one novel in the next six months just just for you you know um hum it s it s so easy to get caught up on reading just for your work or you know self improvement and you kind of forget the fun of reading yeah that s true yeah very easily so well i guess we ve covered the topic pretty thoroughly i think so too oh well thank you for calling and uh i ll have to check out that book you told me about okay thank you you take care bye bye yeah it was nice talking to you Linda okay great hope hope you like it um hum you too bye bye
