                    DESCRIPTION of CASE        An yearold Caucasian male with type  diabetes presented to the emergency department        complaining of severe left knee pain and swelling after sustaining a knee injury that        occurred during a high school football match Joint effusions were visible and palpable        above the left knee and there was significant loss of smooth motion of the knee passively        performed Plain X rays showed no signs of fractures The patient had had type  diabetes        for six years and his insulin regimen consisted of insulin glargine  units at         pm and insulin lispro  units at  am and  units at  pm The patient had        no apparent complications related to type  diabetes        On examination he was alert his pulse was  bpm regular and his blood pressure was         mm Hg Recently the patient had had frequent episodes of both hyperglycemia and        hypoglycemia However he had never developed diabetic ketoacidosis DKA His recent HbAc        was  demonstrating inadequate glycemic control        The patient was referred to an orthopedic surgeon and arthroscopy was scheduled a few        days later A complex tear of the medial meniscus extending to the articular surfaces was        diagnosed Partial meniscectomy was recommended This procedure usually takes about one        hournonetheless the preoperative preparation for general anesthesia and the postoperative        recovery may add several hours to this time                  When Would You Have This Patient Report to the Hospital The Day before Surgery or          the Morning of Surgery          This patient should be hospitalized no later than the evening before surgery given          his history of frequent episodes of hypo and hyperglycemia and his poor glycemic          control This should allow for final optimization of glucose control before surgery          Ideally frequent contact with the patient and adjustment of the insulin regimen prior to          surgery should lead to an excellent glycemic control This yearold patient on          glargine might benefit from additional doses of lispro given before lunch and dinner          rather than at  pm unless this is before dinner          A patient with poorly controlled diabetes should not undergo elective surgery until          glycemic levels are reasonably controlled For example bringing the patient into the          hospital with blood glucose levels of  mgdl will likely result in a canceled surgery          If a patient is scheduled for day of admission surgery one way to avoid having to send          the patient out without being able to do the procedure is to perform a finger stick blood          sugar on arrival so one can cancel before admission          Patients undergoing minor surgical procedures eg arthroscopy may be brought to          the hospital on the morning of surgery As the patient is usually NPO ie has been          given orders to fast before the surgery a lower dose of the intermediate or          longacting insulin is administered and the regular insulin is withheld Box  Insulin          therapy should never be withheld in a patient with type  diabetes as this can result in          DKA                          How Should His Insulin Be Managed before Surgery          The degree of metabolic control should be carefully evaluated before surgery the goal          is to improve the patients blood glucose readings on an outpatient basis before          undergoing surgery If hyperglycemia has been present for a prolonged period of time          before surgery this could result in dehydration which is commonly associated with          electrolytic abnormalities such as sodium and potassium loss and possibly intravascular          volume depletion Prolonged hyperglycemia will delay healing and increase the risk of          ischemia A number of observations have indicated that hyperglycemia impairs collagen          formation and causes a decrease in the tensile strength of surgical wounds  Simply          avoiding hyperglycemia can prevent these consequences The reduction of glucose levels to          below  mgdl has been shown to improve granulocyte adherence and granulocytosis both          key components of the innate immunity and the defense against bacterial infections          Studies in both humans and animals suggest that high glucose levels might exacerbate          ischemic brain damage           Admission to the hospital is recommended for all patients with type  diabetes and a          stabilization period of  hours is also recommended for urgent procedures if severe          hyperglycemia is present  However the widespread use of home blood glucose          monitoring makes the improvement of glycemic control possible prior to admission          Traditionally longacting eg ultralente insulin is discontinued  days before          surgery and the patient is stabilized on a regimen of intermediateacting neutral          protamine hagedorn NPH or lente and shortacting regular or humalog insulin twice a          day or regular insulin before meals and intermediateacting insulin at bedtime However          if the glycemic control is good and the patient is being treated with glargine it is          acceptable to continue the regimen until the day of surgery  Alternatively           of the usual insulin regimen is given on the day of the procedure  On the morning of          surgery patients with type  diabetes should receive the insulin regimen that is used          intraoperatively Box            Evaluation of metabolic homeostasis lipid profile and kidney and myocardial function          must be completed before surgery The presence of diabetic autonomic neuropathy should          also be assessed prior to surgery because this condition predisposes to perioperative          hypotension In such patients meticulous monitoring of blood pressure and volume status          is essential during the perioperative period           The common agreement is that  hours before surgery the patient should be kept NPO          subcutaneous SC insulin should be discontinued and an intravenous IV infusion line          should be inserted It should be emphasized that if the elective surgical procedure can          be scheduled for early morning hours and the procedure lasts at least four hours this          limits the NPO to about  hours and allows administration of usual or  usual          insulin and use of a glucose infusion to replace breakfast and supplemental insulin          either subcutaneously or intravenously If both glucose and insulin are infused it          should be pointed out that these must be two separately controlled infusions so glucose          and insulin infusion can be varied independently                          How Should His Insulin Be Managed during Surgery          Major surgery and general anesthesia can cause severe metabolic abnormalities in          patients with type  diabetes Given the limitations of SC insulin therapy such as          unpredictable absorption and variable plasma insulin levels constant infusion of insulin          is recommended  Anesthesia induces complex neuroendocrine stress responses and          activates the sympathetic nervous system The abnormal release of growth hormone          cortisol and epinephrine leads to impaired insulin secretion and causes insulin          resistance and hyperglycemia due to increased glycogenolysis gluconeogenesis and          decreased glucose disposal Many other conditions may cause severe insulin resistance in          a patient with diabetes Box           For patients scheduled for elective surgery IV insulin and glucose infusion are          usually started several hours preoperatively and glucose levels should be maintained          between  and  mgdl Slightly higher targets  mgdl have been recommended          by some diabetologists to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia The maintenance of glucose          levels below  mgdl has been shown to prevent bacterial infections and ischemic brain          damage  Suggested guidelines for management of patients with type  diabetes by use          of insulin are outlined in Box  Since IV regular insulin has a short halflife ten          minutes hypoglycemia is of little concern as the infusion can be decreased and the IV          glucose rate increased The infusion rate can be adjusted by a floor nurse before surgery          and by the anesthesiologist intraoperatively An insulin infusion algorithm is          constructed to allow easy titration of the insulin dose and IV glucose must also be          infused to obtain glucose levels within target Box  This type of algorithm is          effective in the majority of patients however it is based on the average patient and          might require individualization If the patient has a coexisting condition associated          with increased insulin requirement IV insulin doses need to be increased Glycemic          levels must be monitored at hourly intervals to keep glucose levels between  and           mgdl          Patients with type  diabetes who are treated with continuous SC insulin infusion by          an insulin pump should be easily converted to IV regular insulin infusion just before          surgery Continuous SC insulin infusion is an acceptable regimen for surgical procedures          requiring local anesthesia                          How Should Fluids and Electrolytes Be Managed in This Patient          An adult without diabetes requires a minimum of  to  grams  to  calories          of glucose per day to prevent protein catabolism and the development of ketosis Hence          this patient with types  diabetes should be treated with  grams of glucose per hour           to  mgkgmin in a kilogram subject to provide sufficient basal energy          requirement and prevent hypoglycemia during surgery The dextrose concentration of the IV          solution Box  is adjusted based on the expected length of surgery Thus in this case           of dextrose in water DW can be administered intravenously via infusion pump For          longer surgical procedures intraabdominal or intrathoracic surgery  of dextrose          should be used to avoid excessive fluid administration A  or  dextrose solution          can be infused through a central venous catheter if fluid restriction is critical If          additional fluids are required for instance to replace unexpected intraoperative blood          losses nonglucosecontaining solutions should be administered          As a general rule normal serum potassium levels do not necessarily imply that the          total body potassium content is normal as only  of total body potassium stores are          extracellular  In patients with diabetes the metabolic homeostasis can rapidly be          altered and many factors may influence serum potassium levels and total body potassium          stores These factors are a insulin which increases potassium uptake by cells b          acidemia which causes hyperkalemia as a result of the exchange of intracellular          potassium for hydrogen ions and c hyperosmolarity which causes a rearrangement of          potassium and fluid from intracellular to extracellular compartments In patients with          diabetes who have normal renal function and normal serum potassium concentration  to           mEq of potassium should be added to each liter of dextrosecontaining fluid A higher          dose is required in patients with hypokalemia If serum potassium levels are greater than           mEql potassium therapy should be withheld from the IV fluids and potassium serum          levels should be monitored closely                          How Would the Management of This Patient Be Different for Emergency Rather Than          Elective Surgery          It has been estimated that as many as  of all patients with diabetes require surgery          at some point during their lives  Many of these patients undergo emergency surgery as          a result of lower extremity infections requiring incision and drainage or even lower limb          amputations More than  of lower limb amputations in the United States occur among          people with diabetes The majority of patients with diabetes admitted for emergency          procedures have a poor glycometabolic control and some of them may have coexisting DKA          The first step in management is to assess glycemic electrolyte acidbase and volume          status An IV saline infusion should be started while waiting for laboratory tests to          correct possible volume loss Insulin infusion should be started at an appropriate rate          Box  and frequently insulin requirement might increase during emergency surgery It          is crucial that volume losses and electrolyte abnormalities are corrected prior to          surgery          If DKA is diagnosed immediate treatment is indicated and if possible surgery          should be delayed until the glycometabolic control is corrected and stabilized If          emergency surgery procedures cannot be delayed DKA can be treated concurrently with          surgery                          How Should the Postoperative GlycoMetabolic Management Be Handled in This          Patient          Both IV insulin and glucose DW  normal saline infusion should be continued          until the glycolmetabolic control is stable and until  hours after the patient is          able to resume oral feeding without difficulty If postoperative nausea and vomiting are          present IV insulin and glucose infusion should not be discontinued Furthermore in          patients with type  diabetes ketonuria could be an early sign of impending DKA which          could be triggered by starvation Capillary glucose should be monitored every  hours          at the bedside and the variable insulin and glucose infusion should be adjusted to          maintain blood glucose levels between  and  mgdl Box  Serum electrolytes          should be measured immediately after surgery Hypo and hyperkalemia are fairly common in          the postoperative period and should be corrected without delay The presence of a widened          anion gap suggests the possibility of DKA or lactic acidosis that might be caused by          systemic infections or hypoperfusion          If the patient is stable and can tolerate oral feeding the regular home dose of          insulin may be administered  minutes before the meal and the insulin infusion          stopped  minutes after the meal Of note insulin infusion should be discontinued          only after the SC insulin regimen is started to avoid any gaps in plasma insulin levels          that may lead to a loss of metabolic control          Resuming a sliding scale SC insulin treatment postoperatively has been advocated to          improve metabolic control in patients with type  diabetes However there are several          drawbacks with this approach First of all this approach is based on a retrospective          treatment for hyperglycemia which reflects the degree of insulin sensitivity and glucose          disposal rate in the preoperative period The use of a SC insulin treatment          postoperatively tends to create fluctuations in blood glucose levels that could be          difficult to control Moreover there is a risk of exposing the patient to the risk of          hypoglycemia if excessive doses of insulin are administered More importantly the use of          a sliding scale treatment might predispose to DKA in insulindeficient patients before          the development of hyperglycemic levels                          What Are the General Principles for Surgery in a Patient with Type           Diabetes          Patients with type  diabetes require good blood glucose control prior to undergoing          surgery Although these patients seldom develop DKA the same adverse effects of poor          glycemic control may develop For procedures that require general anesthesia specific          treatment other than hourly glycemic monitoring is not required for patients with type           diabetes whose diabetes is well controlled with diet ie fasting blood glucose less          than  mgdl However insulin should still be administered as described in Box  as          hyperglycemic responses may still occur intraoperatively in these patients Targeted          glycemic levels are identical to those for patients with type  diabetes For elective          procedures requiring general anesthesia insulin infusion is usually required to control          hyperglycemic levels that occur during surgery Frequent intraoperative glucose          monitoring is imperative in this setting to avoid complications resulting from a poor          glycemic control Patients with type  diabetes who require insulin and who are scheduled          for surgery should be managed similarly to patients with type  diabetes          As a general rule SC insulin should not be used in patients with type  diabetes          requiring surgery and general anesthesia since insulin absorption from the SC tissue          could be quite variable particularly in obese individuals          With regard to patients with type  diabetes who require general anesthesia and whose          diabetes is well controlled with sulfonylureas there is some degree of disagreement          Many diabetologists recommend withholding the sulfonylurea the morning of surgery for          procedures requiring general or local anesthesia and using continuous insulin          infusion          Any patient treated with metformin should discontinue this medication at least           hours before surgery The drug should be completely cleared after discontinuing metformin           hours preceding surgery This is a prophylactic measure in an effort to lower the risk          of lactic acidosis that could be secondary to complications of surgical procedures such          as hypotension myocardial infarction or septic shock          Treatment decisions for patients with type  diabetes receiving local anesthesia and          undergoing minor surgical procedures are similar to those described above for patients          with type  diabetes                            DISCUSSION        Patients with type  diabetes undergoing elective or emergency surgical procedures have        a higher degree of morbidity and mortality than those without diabetes as a result of        impaired glycometabolic homeostasis and electrolyte balance The magnitude of the        catabolic responses is not only related to the severity of surgical and postsurgical        complications but also to the effects of inadequate perioperative management on metabolic        control Healthcare providers should be very familiar with the perioperative management of        type  diabetes with individualized insulin and glucose variable infusions young patients        affected by type  diabetes can undergo surgery with a minimal risk        The goal of glycemic management in these situations is to maintain normal glucose        homeostasis and normal metabolism As insulin resistance and gluconeogenesis increase        during surgeryrelated stress and anesthesia additional insulin will be needed to prevent        excessive hepatic glucose release An important issue is maintaining a physiological fluid        and electrolyte balance        Perioperative hyperglycemia increases the risk of infections delayed wound healing and        ischemia Achieving preprandial glycemic levels between  and  mgdl before surgery in        the preoperative period and maintaining plasma glucose levels between  and  mgdl        during surgery and between  and  mgdl after surgery using simple and safe algorithms        Boxes   and  can significantly decrease the risk of these complications
