                so uh how you how do you find out whats going on   whats new         well uh quite a variety of ways i guess uh like to listen to the radio back and forth to work at least back to work and in the mornings   uhhuh do you listen you listen to the same station or do you switch back and forth   well i have one station i listen to when i get up in the house then i listen to another one in the car   uhhuh i listen to i actually i listen to the radio most of all i dont i dont buy papers and stuff i i listen a lot to national public radio   yeah   which is i know pretty much its got in the morning it has like an all news format and then uh toward it it changes like it goes onto classical then onto jazz later on but on in the way to work that thats what i do is i listen to to NPR and what it says about about whats going on   hum well we dont have uh well lets see i guess it might be available i just havent heard of it on that one i i guess i have come to think of it but uh   umhum   i havent made a practice of listening to that one   uhhuh   watching some TV in the evenings   uh what  its its funny i havent seen do you watch like CNN or do you uh or the   well i usually catch the networks and i will occasionally watch CNN too depends on what you know   uhhuh Jack do you listen i dont know do i i like it when i watch TV i dont really watch TV news all that often but what i do is i i like ABC i think i think they have the best news network   yeah uh i generally uh i dont know i go to the NBC sometimes   have   ABC sometimes   have you ever watched Nightline with with with Ted Coppell or is that i i i get to see that i get that occasionally but its like i i hes a i think hes sort of like an upscale Geraldo     yeah i watch that     you know he i digs he he digs just a digs just like a a a little a little too much i i wish i could actually stay up late enough to to see some of the to see some of those things   yeah yeah yeah yeah   you get Time Magazine or Newsweek or anything like that   uh i dont take them i read them sometime i read them in the barber shop or whatever   uhhuh   dentist office material   yeah   i actually i i kind of gave up on on news magazines they they havent they kind of pile end up piling up   yeah thats what i was just about to say about the newspaper i uh i take it then i quit it     yeah it   gets there laying around and dont get to read its does get to be quite a volume of   oh well i tried like uh i like i read the Sunday paper you know i that one i can probably i can find time for you know like on a i i really like to on a Sunday morning get up and uh listen uh get up   material after awhile yep   and read the Sunday paper like first usually i try to read it from like from cover to cover you know   yeah that same here   and that that pretty much gives you gives me an idea whats going on and in about like a two hours it takes me to run right through it i can figure out exactly what what whats happened in like the past week but thats about the only newspaper that i really listen to   our our morning paper throws you a curve they uh you know thats what i would like to do i say well id just like to take the Sunday paper well well uh well let you have the rest of the week for free       so what do you what do you do   so you end well you end up with like a big stack of papers anyway on the on the way out huh   yeah    but i say well the heck with it well go buy it from that guy on the street   well one of the things that i i cant do is i just cant find the time to read the paper all that much it just if i were to if i were to it would take like what half hour a day   oh yeah   to to to find the time to read the paper and thats why i like the radio the best especially especially in the car because i when im in the car and im on my way to work theres nothing else i can do other than like watch the road you know   yeah ive gotten into some uh you know we have a uh news service on our uh network here on the computer   oh and it its it slides in a window across the bottom   well we have that at at lunch in the cafeteria but we also have uh one that you pull up on your screen you know we have a computer network here at TI that you can go to uh   umhum so do you is it is it Dow Jones   Dallas and get the national they have a Dow Jones segment there where it covers us uh you know some most active stocks uh general average   yeah friends of mine at friends of mine at other at other uh at other locations they have they have that and its like you can actually see like the ticker run you know you can open a window on your work station   uh   and you can run and you can run the uh the ticker across the bottom and it it actually you know they they run a ticker for for news items as well as stock     yeah thats actual that DJNS i guess   and so you can see you can see the uh you can
