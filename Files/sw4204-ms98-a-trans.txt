              so youre looking for a car   well actually not but im all ways looking at them  you know you know yeah it uh   yeah i know that feeling mines about ten years old now so debating weather to run it into the ground   uhhuh   put up with those headache or get something new   hum you know am convince that um its always cheaper to repair than replace and uh you know if you replace there are other reason for doing it       like you want you know my my answer to a car is its okay if it ugly um it okay depending on the amount  there is a bunch of other things that okay that it is it got to be reliable there is no excuse for that   right thats number one well that and safety     yeah yeah   safe and reliable   umhum well safety is subjective i think um you know one person criteria of safety is maybe a little different from another person   well i think yeah thats true but reliability you know if its not reliable its not safe     well the you know not reliable company it it will never start in which case extremely safe   well may be not if youre on the Trans Alaska highway     yeah thats true there are places where you can starve or freeze to death if your car want start        um for a while i was a proponent of Saabs and um i have had two of them and one was a tremendous one disappointment from a reliability view point and um basically i decided to get rid of it before the warranty ran out   uh   and i think i was cured of the European motoring mystic at that point   well the Saab does have a lot of good features and the reliability is uh like one of the few things i worry about with Saab   um have you own one or   no i havent but uh you know look looking around it does seem like a roomy     guess im     good handling   you know if it werent for the reliability in every other respect the car was wonderful drove great ton of room very very safe but front wheel drive which with me a plus but i just keep having um string of minor malfunctions   yeah exactly yeah   and um just the process of have to pay for these thing you know also the increments is what a hundred and fifty dollars two hundred fifty every time you take it to a mechanic and touch it hundred dollars hundred dollars hundred dollars   oh yeah well thats       yeah thats the other drawback of Saab is that they are not really cheap   yeah its can of funny because um i was having it repaired at this place called Import Only and um this guys comment was and i asked him you know you you repair them all what do you think is best kind of reliability and he kind of get a Japanese car um that starting to fall out of fashion these days   oh yeah a lot of flag waving going on   uh yeah you know im convince that well you it kind of interesting is what im driving right now is a Ford Probe which is manufactured in a Mazda factory in Illinois       so im not sure weather its an import or not     well thats a serious problem if your concerned with that i dont its possible the where things are built anyone   yeah its fake its fake because see i mean even if i im sure the um you know if you take the most Americanized in American cars and you know pry open one of those computer you will find a computer chip that were assemble in Singapore and so forth uh its just difficult difficult   oh yeah you know   i mean its got funny  coming once just before and um equal the orange juice was label concentrate manufactured in the United States and Turkey who would have though of it apple say orange apple apple juice and turkey   yeah its probably own by a European country company thats employing Mexican     very probably you know its um yeah i think the ideal of um yeah its interesting because you know the location um   you you know   dont seem to uh you know you you can work over several thousands of miles not like it once was use use to be they request uh penalty for  uh doing it but i dont think its true any more   yeah it seems like a oh well transportation does still cost   and so yeah absolutely um you know but there may be other bigger factors so if you decide to replace this ten year vehicle what what is the prime contender right know   well uh i was i was actually thinking of the Saab nine thousands   yeah i own one   but theres a theres a few other hatchbacks   yeah   no well i have it a Toyota and i like the Toyotas   yeah um which kind   its a a Supra   uhhuh   so it handles really well so im reluctant to get anything that handles poorly   yeah uh you would like the Saab have you driven one   um i drove a nine hundred about five years years ago   umhum yeah   it was very nice   well i had had a nine hundred which i replaced the nine thousand nine thousands is the one that gave me a lot of problems   uh   um i happen the think the nine hundreds is a uh i like the nine hundred better it it had more of the Saab weirdness which really attracted me   yes uh i dont mine ugly   yeah um you know its um   in fact i really dont
