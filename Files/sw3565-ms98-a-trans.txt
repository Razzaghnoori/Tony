        youve done     our most recent uh in series of projects i guess was inside was uh we remodeled the bathroom recently   and how did it go   well it went pretty well um other than the fact that we encountered some uh problems that you run across in older homes with uh plumbing which one thing led to another and eventually we ended up replacing all the pipes from the sink clear back to the main drain which meant you need take the wall out and start all over   jeez its like starting over i guess oh   it wasnt one of those it started out as a Sunday project and by the by the next Sunday it was done it wasnt a onedayer   uhhuh  and it   boy that sounds like uh course uh i dont know once you get it done then you probably wont have that problem again   believe me yeah its good for another thirty years   um it youve got an older house   yes   they uh built a little bit more sturdy than   well thats the thing that surprised me because once i got into the plumbing       everything in there was copper and it was all soldered   right oh is that right   thats what drove me bananas because you know im going to the hardware store saying give me plastic pipe and and       yes   and cement   and its all been so   to fit them together and nothing wanted to go so it was like i had to go all the way back to the main drain and start all over   and just start at square one   really   huh   that was an all day job just to get it plumbed   well and then if you do it wrong   fortunately i was very fortunate uh in the fact that uh when i made the installation of the sink and everything bolted up and we turned the water on nothing leaked   everything went all right   everything worked and i just said thats marvelous i appreciate it   thats the type of thing you cross your fingers and are glad when that happen   well i expected something to leak you know left a fitting loose or didnt use Teflon tape on one or something like that   right yeah   right   but it all came together so i i felt pretty fortunate about that   all worked out all right huh   how about you   well um ah probably the last thing i did was uh paint and wallpaper kids room   umhum   and uh i learned uh i used the wrong kind of paint this wasnt must have not been a very good quality because it just hasnt stood up very well   what kind of paint   it was a latex plaint paint it was flat and i wonder if maybe i shouldve used the gloss   umhum   uh but they say you uh use your gloss mainly in your kitchens and things like that   yeah that and semigloss for trim work and usually flat for walls   yeah but i think maybe uh i dont know if it was just the   was it not washable paint   well it it is a latex paint but it just kind of is so you know so its supposed to wash youre supposed to be able to wash it   umhum   but it um just looks dingy i dont know how else to explain it just its pink   what color is it pink okay   its kind of got uh oh just kind of a worn look to it i dont even even know how to say  just didnt turn out quite as nice as i would have liked but   did you uh require more than one can of paint   we put two coats on it and its a small room but i think it only took one uh can   umhum you didnt have to mix paint then right   no   okay   we did uh oh you do mix the color as far as you start with uh white and then they add the color you know what im saying but   umhum yeah yeah but you only had one can of paint that you did the entire room with     yes right and then i wallpapered a couple of walls and uh   howd that go   well that was the first time ive ever wallpapered and uh  thats a an education in itself   kind of fun isnt it really   but uh the dye lots uh must have been a little bit different from first of all it takes quite a few rolls even a small room if youre trying to match a design and i   repeating patterns is what you have to check for when you when you buy your paper   yes thats what i needed and i didnt think about that i got a Mickey Mouse print is what i got and so a lot is wasted   yeah normally it will tell you on the roll how often a pattern repeats   so youd know how i see i didnt even think to look for that  and then the   yeah   one of them was just a  different color different color pink is what it ended up being   hm   and i   when you did your papering did you start in the middle of the wall   no i didnt is that how youre supposed to do   or did you start at the edge   i started at one edge and went over then you had to cut around the closet   umhum   and cut around a window   umhum   but uh   ive had my best luck in papering when i start in the middle of a wall and ill start with a plumb line   and start right there   and start in the middle of the wall and and go from there and go all the way around the room   it seem to get it straighter is that the advantage or whats the   well you you
