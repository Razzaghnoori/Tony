 Star Power What accounts for charisma in music for the authority or power that strangely radiates from this or that performer not just from the sound but so it seems from the performer s personality from the shake of a head or the expressive curl of a wrist I realize that of all the grand effects that music can produce charisma is one of the cheapest which is to say the easiest to fake if your standards are not too high Years ago in the days before I became a journalist I played trombone with a group called the Uptown Horns backing up blues and rock bands and I savor the memory of how our jaded little group used to mock the rock world s cult of the charismatic To hold one s fist stiffly in the air in a gesture of ridiculous defiance while the bass amplifier thundered and the guitar shrieked and our man on tenor sax honked deliriously and to see a barroom audience respond with shouts and their own idiotic fists in the beery air that was to laugh A fascist rally at the Second Avenue gin mill We musicians were all smirks behind our kick ass fa ade In the last few months I ve been running around to classical concerts in New York looking for charismatic qualities in places where in theory they might be expected and I ve noticed something else about the charismatic in music A genuine touch of the charismatic is never where you expect it to be A given soloist might be wonderfully talented and might choose to perform the kind of music that exudes noble and heroic inspirations with every phrase and even so the indefinable strength that counts as charismatic might fail to appear An example not to be cruel but just to show what I m getting at could be seen at the New York Philharmonic debut a couple of months ago of a violinist named Frank Peter Zimmermann from Germany Zimmermann s reputation in Germany is said to be excellent In New York where he played the Bruch Violin Concerto in G minor the audience leapt to its feet and gushed appreciation The New York Times pronounced itself content Yet what can I say It may have been the doughy look of earnest concentration on the young man s ample cheeks or it may have been his habit at the conclusion of every dazzling double stopped arpeggio of deftly lifting his bow off the strings with a satisfied air a happy pastry chef pleased and relieved to have given the world one more perfect Linzer torte And the result was to be honest dismal even if the concerto s many splendidly demagogic passages performed virtuosically did their customary work The clearest examples of charismatic musicianship that I ve seen lately have been in performances by Yuri Bashmet the Russian violist who was in New York not long ago conducting his own chamber orchestra at Carnegie Hall and playing with the Philharmonic under Kurt Masur Bashmet ought to be an unlikely source of spectacular and forceful effects due to the humble nature of his instrument The viola tends to be plaintively melancholic or else to squawk ugly duckling style like a bassoon or an English horn In the pantheon of instruments the viola is a mortal not a god Yet when Bashmet comes out onto the stage wiping his Prince Valiant locks off his face and holding his non god by its helpless neck like a dead rabbit you feel even before he starts to play a vibration in the air ever so slightly as if gusting from the air conditioner Before he starts I admit there is something fishy in that observation I blame his pre concert publicity Bashmet we are told by virtually every journalist who has written about him began his musical career on the electric guitar a teen age rock star in Rostov on Don back in the late 1960s He played in a Beatles style band then embraced the viola out of the despairing recognition that on the guitar he would never match the fireworks of Jimi Hendrix his idol And so the violist gazes outward from the stage and the audience mulling over the biographical background with its air of 60s mayhem and long lost Soviet dissident hipness is bound to wonder Is this a Promethean figure Hendrix like standing before us A man of extremes On the verge of mental derangement He plays with a weird supercontrol He produces a wide sumptuous when he wants to and at other times the speedy wobble of a swallowed scream But characteristically he uses very little vibrato at all and the tones that emerge are round and affectless like a man singing falsetto His emotional peaks are almost always achieved at the lowest volume He whispers You expect him to sink beneath the level of audibility But those falsetto timbres of his make a searing tone even in a middle register where tones are usually not searing and the sound is an X ray which penetrates everywhere The of his performances that I have heard do not capture the full strangeness in this sound The CDs get louder or softer but the quality of penetration fails to vary The true X ray tonality is something you can hear only in the concert hall And in the concert hall you become aware also how risky it is for him to produce that very strange sound which is to say how heroic is his playing In a recital at Carnegie Hall more than a year ago he reached for that sound and at one excruciating moment lost control of his bowing and sent out a wild overtone double the volume of his normal playing like the feedback on an electric guitar Hendrix like after all the worst howler I ve ever heard from a musician of first rank At his Philharmonic appearance during his most recent visit he performed a viola concerto by the Russian composer Alfred Schnittke who not only wrote the piece for him but was kind enough to derive a theme cabalistically from the letters in Bashmet s name The concerto you can hear it for yourself on is a fantastic affair It feels like an ancient epic with the viola as Gilgamesh wandering the earth Unspeakable horrors deploy across the background Tartar hordes and Stalinist work brigades seem to go marching past in flaming colors The violence is shocking The starry sky is gorgeous Schnittke is a witty composer and at certain moments you have the feeling that he is drunkenly singing sardonic songs of woe and contempt And all the while Yuri Bashmet goes threading his way across the foreground a lonely man with an eerie and haunting sound sometimes quietly shrieking sometimes singing lyrically a heartbreaking figure heartbreakingly courageous until by the end he seems to be quietly sobbing I m not sure that in the course of his performance with the Philharmonic Bashmet didn t once again lose control of Yet by the end I was nearly sobbing myself It was because the charismatic in music is genuinely awe inspiring and to watch the violist trek across Schnittke s barbarous Russian landscape was like watching humanity and inhumanity in ferocious battle waging every grand and noble struggle that we associate with the 19 th century violin concertos except without any of the reassuring triumphalism that among 19 th century composers was indistinguishable from a finale But what is this awesome thing the charismatic in music My supposition of the moment now that I find myself under Bashmet s sway a definite indication of charismatic force by the way is that charisma in music the real thing and not the fake is a more than musical quality Music is always telling stories more or less and I think that charismatic power is an element in one of those stories the force we feel when a strong personality comes up against a demonic power and refuses to be cowed and takes hair raising risks and succeeds in being if only for a moment the demon s equal
