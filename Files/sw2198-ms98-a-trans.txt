 so so what movies have you seen lately i really haven t seen any movies lately i the only two movies i ve seen were uh uh King Ralph which really was depressing wasn t any any good oh was bad yeah oh that s disappointing i was thinking about going to see that and well it s not worth the whatever five bucks or four four fifty whatever you pay for you know to get into the movie but yeah wait for it to come out on videotape i guess yeah yeah or i saw Chima Para Diso uh Chima Para Diso what s the other one oh say that again what s that it s a foreign film uh huh it s a an Italian film about uh this guy who uh who from when he was a little kid like ten years old uh huh oh Cinema Para De Simo oh okay because you re saying it with a you re saying it little Italian oh are you Italian oh okay that s why go ahead yeah italian accent yeah yeah it s it s about a movie about you know this guy who was running a a movie uh huh you know movie studio whatever he ran he ran a machine that was pretty good didn t you think so yeah i saw it too yeah it was i really liked it my wife and i loved it yeah i thought yeah i thought that most Americans might not like it because you know of it s it s not that good of a quality film but i mean it s the meaning behind it that i liked uh huh yep that s true yeah it had a really uh i thought the story was really nice and i thought uh the guy that played the projectionist i just thought was superb you know he was great uh and the little boy was good too uh huh i i thought they did an excellent job of actually aging the person you know from when he was a little kid to little older to little older to except the last the very last you know the last person the last actor that played the kid uh huh you know when he had gray hair he didn t look anything like him but you know up until that point they did a really good job of keeping you know an actor who yeah yeah yeah they did well i think that s the guy that uh it was like his story uh huh i think he was like a Italian director or something like that and i think that was himself he was he that was his own story right yeah on what s made him successful or whatever yeah so of course he picked probably all these really good looking young people you know yeah yeah i liked that too yeah um we um my wife and i are planning on trying to go see um yeah uh Silence of The Lambs tonight yeah i hear that s pretty good yeah it s a suspense well i guess it s ranked number one now it s supposed to be pretty good suspenseful yeah but are you good at do you like suspenseful movies like that yeah because see i i m not really one that likes real suspense i like the nice lighthearted comedies most of the time oh is it yeah i do well it depends on what mood you re in too you know yeah that s true yeah but uh like for example Tequila Sunrise i liked that yeah well that well that was that s with uh who s what s his name s in it uh uh i don t know Mel Gibson and uh what s his yeah that was a good movie too that was good i yeah is that supposed to be something like that one yeah yeah something like that except it s it s supposed to be really you know suspenseful yeah so i guess but you know we re it s been rated pretty well and every all the critics like it so and every word of mouth has been pretty good on it so yeah that s pretty good yeah we re we re going to go see that probably tonight well what have you seen that that uh actually let s see we we uh we ve rented a couple movies lately you know because you get them on videotape we rented uh just last night we watched um David Lynch s uh movie Blue Velvet uh huh which which is that it it sort of has some of the some of the music behind it did you ever watch Twin Peaks no i don t watch that show yeah well that it has some of the music we ve watched we watched Twin Peaks because uh uh a little bit so it have you know and i think she had seen part of it before uh huh friends of hers had rented it and she d seen part of it but we thought we d rent the whole thing and actually it s a pretty good movie but it s not great you know uh huh they said it s supposed to be really weird but because that David Lynch has like a weird style but i didn t think it was really weird you know not as weird as i don t know i we also uh huh maybe you expected too much out of it yeah i think yeah that s probably true yeah we also saw Wild At Heart which is also a David Lynch movie that that that had been out now that was a weird movie uh huh Wild At Heart that was yeah that was about what it was it was about uh a guy uh Nicholas Cage does Elvis Presley like a like a pseudo Elvis Presley impersonation through the whole movie he s like a real violent uh uh huh twenty year old and he uh he s in love with this girl that s about sixteen or seventeen and they leave he s involved with like a murder and then um he they go to uh they go to like Louisiana and Texas and uh he get they get more he gets more involved with this robbery and whatever but it s sort of so he just gets in trouble everywhere yeah he gets in trouble everywhere he goes it s real violent um and uh you know which is like what David Lynch s other movies were about you know the so i don t know i just i didn t think it was that good my wife liked it a little bit more than i did she looks she looks at more some of the uh more creativeness behind it you know she likes the different type of movies yeah yeah yeah but i didn t think it was that good i don t i don t like to look too deep into movies if it s good it s good if it s not it s not yeah that that s sort of the way i feel too i don t know what else we just saw something recently yeah i want to go see The Doors that s what i want to go see yeah they say that s pretty good well how old are you i m twenty one twenty one oh see you re young so you you see i m thirty one so you see this as like a mythical thing you know so you re like uh huh right well i mean i i you know i m pretty familiar with the story of Jim Morrison i mean i don t know everything about it but yeah uh huh yeah it s one of the things uh if you read in the newspapers and stuff he s the critics really like it or they really don t uh huh yeah so i think uh but i think it s supposed to be well done uh i heard i heard that it that what what is it Siskel and Ebert someone told me that Siskel and Ebert said that one of the two liked the whole movie but he doesn t like the ending so he wouldn t recommend the movie and he didn t like the ending because uh huh of the way Jim Morrison s life ended and it s like that s ridiculous i mean that s a true life story How can you not like something that really you know is if it happened it happened you re just telling a story right yeah yeah uh huh that s true yeah i guess i guess uh i well i was watching uh Arsenio Hall the other night and uh uh huh the actor that plays Jim Morrison s one of the other uh Val Kilmer uh not Val Kilmer the um Tom McLaughlin who plays one of the other characters in the band one of the other men in the band uh was on was on uh Arsenio and he was talking about it you know and uh he said that uh they tried to stick pretty much to you know uh huh the real story yeah the real story and and and for to for all of them to get an understanding of how their characters were they could they watched older videotapes you know of their them in interviews and things like that so they tried to make it pretty you know close to the line right but uh they also said that whatever the guy that directed it yeah i don t he uh he s very he really liked The Doors so it was very much his impression too you know so so if you have right yeah Oliver Stone isn t it yeah yeah and he s a very strong willed person and his his ideas whatever came through you know with however so they said if if you um yeah but he s a good director so i mean he should still be able to yeah so so if you like his view and his direction in other words then you ll really like the movie you know so probably if you liked his other two movies uh those are like Wall Street and Platoon then uh huh oh i liked Platoon it was all right but i didn t see Wall Street yeah yeah if you like Platoon yeah if you liked Platoon you ll probably really like this because it takes pretty much the same direction for the time you know uh i think yeah so that s uh because he has a pretty strong will and he directs his own way so it should be you know pretty good well i think i ll go see that this weekend or next weekend one or the other yeah because i really want to see it i wanted to see it uh about two weeks ago when i had a chance to go see it but i i went home for the weekend and they didn t have it playing home uh huh for like spring break and yeah oh you in college yeah i m still in college well why are you participating in this study uh my uh roommate took a voice over course yeah um hum and they told him to sign up for this and he asked me if i wanted to do it and i said sure you know it s like just you know to help out whatever you know the the more participants you have the bigger yeah yeah yeah the more participants the better it works out because i m a voice researcher uh you get a bigger pool of all the different regions of and and right uh huh yeah that s true i guess they wouldn t be called dialects but they re pretty close sometimes yeah that s what they re yeah that s what they re really looking for i think just how we speak also looking where we pause and where we don t things like that yeah but that s pretty that s good um what do you get many movies on campus right yeah well the the good thing about campus is that we have this uh system that uh uh it s a it s called UAB uh university something or other i don t know and they give out like movies they show movies in the theatre for a dollar uh huh right yeah and and so you know like every other day or or so they have like movies for a dollar Sometimes they re even free i think uh they showed uh Chima Para Diso free uh huh uh huh uh but i missed it so i rented it the other day yeah yeah because my wife and i saw it in the theatre we really liked it uh huh yeah i liked it but i didn t i didn t know if the Americans would like it so much they might you know look into it and say uh this is low budget film and it s not really that good but i mean i like the story yeah it was a great that s a i think that s that s one thing too um you know you can t get so much caught up in the expense right as as you do a good telling a good story and i thought that was that movie really told a good story yeah yeah and and i think if you really like the story going along with it you don t notice that it s a little bit you know it might not have as many camera angles or it may not have right you know uh because the you know the character actors the town the community people were just great they just seem so real you know they came right off the screen they were they were i mean i you know i i go to Italy every summer except i missed last summer but i mean it s like that you go into the small towns especially you know like in where he was in Sicily uh huh uh huh and the southern part of Italy everything is like that you know and no one has any money you know you just barely get by But everybody is like a big family and it s like it s just like that so that s why i liked it i guess i m a little biased but i i i i i thought right but see i really think yeah i i think those characters came right off the screen in that story you know it was really enjoyable and and my wife we thought the same thing we were so pleasantly surprised yeah
