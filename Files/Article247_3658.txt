 There s No Worm in This Apple It s not too often that the market takes it as good news when a company announces that its revenues and profits are going to fall well short of expectations And in the case of Apple Computer which made precisely that announcement after the closing bell yesterday the market in fact did not take it as good news In the midst of a broad if relatively mild sell off in technology stocks today Apple was a notable loser with its shares falling nine points or better than 12 percent In the context of the past year which has seen Apple s stock soar because of all the buzz about the iMac the iBook and the new Power Mac G4 Tuesday s tumble was unsurprising But there were two interesting things about it nonetheless The first is that the stock fell sharply despite the fact that pretty much every serious analyst who covers the company said that if the stock sold off investors should treat it as a buying opportunity So we were greeted with odd headlines on the newswires today like Apple s Stock Tumbles Street Says It s Time To Buy Considering the heavy volume in Apple it s clear that lots of people on the Street were in fact thinking it was time to sell But this is one case where it wasn t the brokerage houses that overreacted even if a couple of analysts did trim their estimates for next year The more interesting thing about Apple s announcement is that from one angle it really was good news at least if you looked at things from the perspective of the longue dur e What Apple said was that its revenues and earnings were going to be down because Motorola which is the sole manufacturer of the microprocessor for the G4 hadn t been able to deliver enough chips to satisfy a much heavier than expected demand for the G4 Apple said it had already received 150 000 orders for the G4 in the three weeks since it went on sale but that Motorola was not going to be able to produce anywhere near that many chips The obvious point here is that if you re going to have a problem it s better to have one that s the result of too much demand rather than too little Though there is something deeply ironic about Apple which initially ran into trouble because its founder and now interim CEO Steve Jobs wanted it to build everything that went into the machines is now having problems because its sole supplier is struggling But there s also something else which is that Apple said its profits in this quarter would be 20 to 30 percent less than they were a year ago On the face of it that s strange Even if the company were having trouble with the G4 which is a new product why would that make it earn less money than it did a year ago when the G4 didn t even exist But there s actually a good reason for this and it has to do with the way Apple has pared back its operations concentrated on its best products and placed a new premium on technological innovation A year ago there were still Apple products in the pipeline and on store shelves that were older models or that served markets in which the company was never going to thrive Today that s not true The best thing that Apple has done in the past year and a half actually the best thing it s done in more than a decade is return to its core competence as a company that makes sharply designed user friendly high performance products for consumers who are willing to pay a premium for those characteristics The best thing about the G4 in that sense is that there are no sub 999 G4s As a result Apple s return on invested capital is improving its profit margins are improving and eventually assuming Motorola gets its act together its profits will improve as well Apple will never be what it once was But it has a chance to do a great job of being what it is
