        hey this is Bryan how you doing     this Jay in Dallas how are you   im fine thanks nice to meet you   good where are you from   im from right right now im living in Utah but my familys in Plano and thats where im at right now   oh okay yeah   so calling pretty close at home right now well you ready to give this topic a a whiz   right that be great   all right here we go  all right would you like to go first or   go ahead   all right um im pretty young so i dont have a whole lot of credit cards i when i first got one i made a big mistake and got pretty far into debt and ever since then ive decided that its if im gonna make a purchase i i make it and have the check written out at within the next week for the purchase i made and that way i i keep my credit cards at an even balance   yeah thats right i i think thats what happened to everybody out there gets back when they just sent them to you without any ive got i dont know how many tons of them but uh i use uh well this one particular one for everything i mean everything i buy including groceries   uhhuh   and it runs up pretty high every month but i then i pay it off because i get a a air uh advantage miles on American   right   with it so i i can get a you know ive already gotten a free trip just from using that card so i dont uh i dont have any carry over balances any more   uhhuh right   but i just i was wiped out there for years but that was the way to do stuff and uh you i think you have to make the decision     yeah right   but um Texas is uh you know its a debtor state and if you get in too big of a trap you you can just blow them off and thats not good but i know lot of people do it   yeah   its what runs that interest rate up you know pretty high yeah   right umhum and i agree you know i think theres a lot of benefits for example i know that my sister and brotherinlaw as well as my parents they they use them quite like you do you know they just theyre within every month theyre within five dollars knowing within five dollars of what it is and   umhum   and then they right it off but to that advantage it gets     yeah   you know the privileges of like you said like the the mileage and the   well its uh the interest rates are still crazy up there you know i i i mean theyve come down every  except the credit cards       uhhuh   so its not uh its not really an advantage to have them now theyre uh some of mine are up i think up over twenty percent i dont use them anymore but i think think theyve gone over twenty percent a year   youre kidding wow   and some of them you know i think the one im using is about fifteen but i dont use the interest anymore so it doesnt make a difference   right   and then when i travel i travel a lot in Europe i use Diners Club and that gets         all  my um uh insurance on rental cars and  and plus they have a pretty good uh       uh plan on the gifts and things like that i try to get something out of them now   uhhuh   so   well thats right you know i i think too one of the things that ive become very aware of in terms of when im looking for a credit card is im looking i look for something that doesnt have an annual fee   right absolutely theres no use paying that fifty or whatever it is a month a a year   absolutely i just you know i think that if youre doing that youre pretty stupid because you could be using that on something that you really want   oh sure um personally the not my next project i think is to take those that i do have uh listed and cut them up   yeah   that im not using uh especially the ones that dont i that theres a working asset to these that gives a lot of uh   yep   money to um the environment and things like that thats my second here but ive got one Cigna Visa that doesnt give you a damn thing so   right     uh i think ill cut it up this year for my New Years resolution   yeah and i think i agree with you too you know im im should have a Visa i havent this is my first year ive had a Visa and i think im gonna cut up everything that im not using its just stupid to have them around and   yeah ive got a lot of um gasoline credit cards that i dont use anymore because they take all the others so i might as well pitch them i mean its just weight carrying it in your pocket   right yeah and i agree and i think the one the one thing that ive really learned too is that if youre gonna have a credit card just you know if youre not gonna use it for example like you said a with a Visa card really you can almost do anything now and id just as soon have it all on one card so i know exactly where its my bills are gonna come from and   absolutely yeah   i think a lot of times especially like im a student so i dont have a really big income but i have to you know be really careful not to over extend myself and when im using it on other cards it   oh yeah you can i was absolutely um IRS checked me one time and they said nobody in the world could have paid this much interest   uhhuh   and i said well im glad you mentioned that because ive got receipts for all that       but you know something else i couldnt have proven but uh   yeah   that was uh im not young anymore so i uh took a long time to learn but a lot of young people do get trapped on it its easy you know you dont have any money and yeah   yep and i think its uh i think you know i was really lucky in that this summer when when i did it i i had enough and i was working enough that i could basically pay it all off within you know six months or so so it wasnt where i was over my head but i i got enough of a taste of it to realize what i didnt wanna do anymore   yeah oh sure and they got all those late charges now and stuff they didnt used to have and if you go over the limit theres a charge i mean theyre theyre really starting to hit us   oh yeah   you know a lot harder than they used to theyve theyve
