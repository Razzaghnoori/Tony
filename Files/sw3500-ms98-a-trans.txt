                in in light the light of what has been happening lately with the doctors that i know and lawyers and whatnot i think national health insurance is a way to throw a lot of money at a very small problem   do you why   why well if you took half the money that they would spend in the state of Texas for health insurance and gave it to qualified students to so they could become doctors the problem would go away   you think the problem is not enough doctors   i think the problem is that the doctor  doctors have conspired to limit the number of doctors and that the lawyers have conspired to make sure that if you are a doctor you are going to pay high premiums on your health uh unemployment i mean on your liability   gosh i really have a different point of view on this  well because im a nurse for one thing   oh uhhuh and you think there are plenty of doctors   oh yeah i dont think there is a shortage of doctors and i do know that OB which is my field the doctors health insurance the doctors malpractice insurance is over two hundred thousand dollars a year   uhhuh its astronomical   that deliver babies now they cant doing anything about that i dont think theyre in a conspiracy i think its our fault because we as people just sue them   no people dont sue   people are very sue sue conscious   lawyers sue if you put a ten thousand dollar cap on the amount of money that a lawyer could make from a law suit against a doctor   yeah   they wouldnt sue a one of them   well thats probably true too   you know   but people are very conscious of how much money they can get real fast these days   well sure but you know when you think about reasonableness now i believe that a law suit should have some foundation in the the tort theory you know what tort theory is   and so no   well a tort is when you do something wrong   right   well it uh an OBGYN doctor cannot control the fetus in the womb a hundred percent   thats right   if the baby is born dead well that happens if if they have complications and   well it depends   well i know i mean there are guys that are real slobs but you know there are also people out there that are really doing their job and the people that are really doing their job are paying for everybody else   well thats true they are because doctors are performing many more tests many of them are unnecessary they are doing so many C sections   you know   just to prevent a a law suit   just to prevent because they have all these monitors now and if anything looks even a little bit funny   yeah   their only safety precaution is to go in and get that baby and so its costing more all around in health insurance for tests for surgery for longer hospital stay so its terrible   yeah uhhuh see i believe that there there is a system already in place for health care   uhhuh   you know they have indigent health care you show up at Parkland bleeding and theyll fix you   youll get it thats true   you know   in fact youll get it at Presbyterian if you show up there too and we have that happen we have patients that go through Parkland through the clinic and at the last minute they come to us well   yeah uhhuh uhhuh   uh we cant turn them away so   yeah i think that if you just wrote the lawyers out of the equation the problem would pretty much evaporate   yeah im for that ive been through a two year divorce where the only one that came out ahead was my lawyer so id like to wipe them all out   yeah well i i happen to know a few and i even claim one as a friend       hes a divorce attorney   he better not be mine   but   i think hell go nameless for the for the purposes of this conversation but i also know an uh OBGYN who has stopped practicing   yeah some they do   uh he just said   they stop their OB at least   yeah i mean hes not going to deliver any more babies ever his malpractice was five hundred thousand dollars a year   right right thats incredible   and you know he said i had to he had to earn gross two million to take home as much as his malpractice   yeah and most of them are very sincere most of them do the best they can they are human occasionally   uh yeah this this guy is Catholic   something will go wrong   yeah i mean you know   well you can be human and Catholic   yeah i know you can be human and Catholic but youre not likely to find somebody who is going to you know have a less conscientious effort i mean     yeah no most of them do i really believe that from dealing with doctors dealing with lawyers there is no doubt in my mind who is more conscientious but   well you know who is getting rich insurance companies   yeah they are   you know if you were able to write a malpractice insurance that would negate any financial obligation on the part of the doctor over and above the insurance say say you have malpractice insurance and a kid dies or is malformed or
