 Easy Generalizations and Meta Guilt Nora The only Salter novel I ve read is Light Years which I thought was just great But I find any generalized public whining about the decline of the literary culture annoying even when I essentially agree with the sentiment in part as you say because of the helplessness it inspires And the flip side of Salter s argument in this morning s essay all pop culture is garbage seems to me just so easy and specious Inspired to despair helplessly That has been my ongoing reaction to the Peter Singer piece in the Times magazine the week before last an article to which John Tierney refers in his column in today s Times as well Singer argued that we should regard every 200 we spend on anything inessential as the heartless crypto murder of a Third World child since the donation of that 200 to Oxfam or UNICEF would prevent an infant from dying Do you think there s any real counter argument to the notion that none of us have any moral right to buy expensive clothes or eat at restaurants or go on fancy vacations The fact that I was left feeling upset and more or less speechless by that piece meta guiltier than I ve felt in years made me wonder if this country isn t about to experience a resurgence of old fashioned circa 1965 liberalism A Moebius strip is a self contained closed loop the thing discovered invented by Mr Moebius in the 19th century that s a two dimensional surface with just one side You take a strip of paper give it a half twist and paste the ends together enabling you to draw a continuous never ending line on it It is the one thing from my junior high school topology studies that I remember It s been striking me lately as a useful metaphor I don t believe Shakespeare invented a twelfth of the words he used either And I was also skeptical of another statistic in the paper the Journal I think this morning of the 30 000 CDs released each year only 600 2 percent make money If it s true it would make the movie business look rational You are as you mentioned in the movie business and you re going to Los Angeles momentarily OK I have a question Why don t American screenwriters own the copyrights to their scripts as playwrights do and as I m told screenwriters in Europe do Why in other words doesn t a screenplay that I co wrote revert to me to sell elsewhere after the guys to whom I sold it decide they don t want to make it into a movie Couldn t and shouldn t the Writers Guild simply make this a non negotiable issue and change the custom overnight Also how did your toes turn out this morning Kurt
