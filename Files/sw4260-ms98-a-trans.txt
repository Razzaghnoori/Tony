        in the evening back there now isnt it     pardon   what time is it back there right now   its uh about seven thirty   oh okay   yeah   so have you been golfing yet this year   uh no actually im uh quite a beginner im very green i just got my first set of clubs this year for Christmas but i have uh gone out to the driving range once or twice   uhhuh   to uh see if i can work on my swing a little bit   oh good yeah im not that much ive gone about i guess about twenty twenty five times   yeah   no im not a beginner but im not a novice either   little bit more experience though   yeah yeah it takes quite a bit i used to go just about every day during this one summer and i did really good and then the more i practiced the worse i got   really   so i got frustrated but i heard that happens to everyone   now how how much out of the year or how long out of the year can you play where you live   um we couldnt start playing right now theres a few courses open   uhhuh   um pretty much until end of probably October and if it snows or not   oh thats not bad uhhuh   so it is a quite a long season   i would have thought that uh this time of the year here i might be able to get out a little bit but uh Winter seems to be dragging on up here and we have snow right now   oh   but uh i noticed a lot of the driving ranges outdoor driving ranges do um if if you want to play outside in the cold       you can you can sweep the snow off the uh tees and and play from there but we also have a lot of indoor driving ranges and and thats a little bit strange getting used to swinging the club inside and        and uh hitting the ball into a net instead of letting it fly   yeah because you dont know for sure can you tell if youre slice much on those   um i can tell i can because i slice so terribly bad  im still trying to work on that       uhhuh   but uh i dont know ive noticed that its mostly the real beginners like myself that that will do that it seems like the real experienced peoplell wait um until they can play outside and really hit the ball   uhhuh do you use your own balls on those on the net   i im sorry using own balls my own balls   yeah when you hit against a net and indoor   you can get a bucket of balls like you would on an outdoor  were going to try something new we havent done this yet a a few of us are going to go to a place where they have big uh video screens   oh they okay provide   and they advertise courses like Pebble Beach and a few others   yeah i played that once  Pebble Beach i played   did you do that once oh really the real Pebble Beach   um no no i wish  the the screen one   yeah oh okay you did that so that must be fairly common   yeah well they were trying it out here is i did it about gee six or seven years ago   uhhuh   and so i dont how much more advanced they got when i tried it it was all right   was it is it like fairly realistic or   yeah maybe they improved on that because when i did it it was all right but it wasnt that impressive   no well we havent done it yet but uh it it sounds like fun and it looked like fun so we figure wed just go do it once to see what its like   yeah i kind of experienced it once   but im getting kind of antsy to to really polish my stroke up a little bit more my fatherinlaws a real avid golfer he plays six days a week three hundred and sixty five days out of the year   oh really retired   yeah yeah hes retired and living out on the west coast where its warm enough that he can play outside all year round     you imagine doing that   no i dont think i can its funny because he uh his his knees are shot from uh he was a surgeon and his knees are shot from being on his feet all day everyday   oh really   and uh he has artificial knees he doesnt get around to well but he still plays eighteen holes of golf everyday   wow i didnt know that would hurt hurt hurt you standing all the time   evidently yeah so he uh i dont know hes got his own little golf cart that he putts over to the country club in and      huh   and he gets around okay in fact i did go out with him when we were out there for Christmas and went right after i got my clubs i did go out with him once and we uh knocked the ball right it was pretty dull for him seeing how i had to hit it about twenty times before i got onto the green     thats why ive never chored so much in my life until i went golfing      yeah uh do you you belong to a club or anything   no its just just once in but ill probably go about three or four times during the summer i dont even have my own clubs   yeah   i usually get a hold of someone that lets me use them i really enjoy the game   well im left handed and i found that i couldnt always get a hold of good left handed clubs or any left handed clubs whatsoever really   oh yeah   and i did try it once im hopeless im not even i cant do anything with my right hand but i did try using right handed clubs once and it it was so awkward for me       so i i figured it it might be a good investment i i better be sure and serious about getting into it or else the uh the investment isnt very good   uhhuh has your wife golfed   um a little bit here and there not a whole lot shes uh she used to play more but um her shoulders started bothering her
