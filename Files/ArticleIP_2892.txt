 The Death of the Show Tune In the run up to the 1991 Broadway hit The Will Rogers Follies composer Cy Coleman took to doing the big song Never Met a Man I Didn t Like at benefit performances all over town Just before opening night he sang it at the Eye Ear and Throat Hospital You should have seen him said his lyricist Adolph Green There wasn t a dry eye ear and throat in the house But where else would you hear the song Years ago we used to have records of our stuff on the radio before the show opened Cy sighs Not anymore When did you last hear a show tune on the air I don t mean Natalie Cole doing Rodgers and Hart but new Broadway numbers from say Big or Victor Victoria The last Broadway song to make the charts was Gloria Gaynor s disco version of I Am What I Am from La Cage Aux Folles and she had to change a few of Jerry Herman s notes to pull that off Before rock the theater song sat at the apex of popular music the most famous songwriters were show writers and the pop boys the Tin Pan Alleymen longed to cross the tracks as Irving Berlin did and George Gershwin Jule Styne Frank Loesser But Bill Haley and Elvis painted Broadway into a corner it never quite got out of Musicals stood aloof from rock and became by definition staid conservative middle aged something your parents go see on their wedding anniversary Never mind that on Broadway in 1948 long before Rock Around the Clock the score to As the Girls Go by old timers Jimmy Sunny Side of the Street McHugh and Harold Time on My Hands Adamson included a number called Rock Rock Rock with the tempo marking Groovy Now David Geffen figures he can bridge that 40 year gulf Rent launched at the Democratic Convention and including a guest appearance by Stevie Wonder on its Act II opener is supposed to be a cast album you can play on pop radio stations As every New York Times reader knows Rent is a Pulitzer and Tony winning rock opera version of La Boh me with a dramatis personae of HIV positive performance artists transsexuals and drug addicts from the East Village whose cachet was greatly enhanced by the death on the eve of opening of its young composer lyricist librettist Jonathan Larson The show makes an interesting contrast with that other Puccini retread Miss Saigon The latter a British musical relocates Madame Butterfly to the most controversial conflict of our time paints its story on a big sweeping canvas and has gone on to play around the world the other brings La Boh me home to Greenwich Village and thus further reinforces the parochialism of the New York musical as it shrivels away to its core audience I would doubt its potential on the road or overseas But Rent won its awards not just for its subject but also for its score According to Stephen Sondheim Jonathan Larson had managed to do what so many Broadway writers had tried and failed for years to do He d used the language of rock to propel a theater piece He d fused contemporary pop and drama Rock n roles Just for the record there s a bit of Puccini in Rent At the end Roger the songwriter finally finishes his song for Mimi Your Eyes LINK TO AUDIO CLIP and in it we also hear a brief snatch of Musetta s Waltz As it s played on an electric guitar though it s reminiscent less of Boh me than of Don t You Know a pop adaptation of the waltz that was a hit in the 50s for Della Reese LINK TO AUDIO CLIP and which contains one of the laziest filler couplets in lyric writing history I have fallen in love with youFor the rest of my whole life through As the waltz echoes alarmingly through Rent s finale you re reminded of a basic fact Music is music If a tune s muscular enough you can do it as an operatic waltz a big pop ballad an electric guitar solo Rock like swing or disco or bluegrass is a style and in the theater its usefulness depends on the story you re trying to tell Musicals can t be on the so called cutting edge because they take so many years to get up on stage By the time your grunge musical opens grunge will be out and splurge will be in That s the problem with Rent Only on Broadway could it be mistaken for state of the art rock The big driving numbers like What You Own LINK TO AUDIO come out sounding like say Blue yster Cult full of the same charmingly overheated metaphors You re living in AmericaAt the end of the millenniumYou re living in AmericaLeave your conscience at the tone The ballads on the other hand are overwrought and declarative The best Seasons of Love LINK TO AUDIO CLIP affects the same ensemble solidarity as What I Did for Love in A Chorus Line LINK TO AUDIO CLIP Both can find no better use for the pop ballad than as group therapy one for those suffering the vicissitudes of life as a chorus gypsy the other for those living in the shadow of AIDS But the spare slightly awkward chanted admonition measure in love is still a world away from the best pop lyric writing Alan Jay Lerner used to bemoan the fact that writers like Paul Simon never went into the theater But since the advent of the LP and the gatefold sleeve with the printed lyrics and the college courses that study rock songs for their elusive allusiveness pop texts have been freed from the first requirement of a Broadway lyric that it be made up of words you can catch when you re sitting in a theater and they re flying through the air at you Paul Simon once took me through one of his songs Hearts and Bones which begins One and one half wandering Jews LINK TO AUDIO CLIP He explained to me that it was one and one half because the song was about him and he s Jewish and his then wife Carrie Fisher is the daughter of Eddie Fisher who s also Jewish and Debbie Reynolds who s not hence one and a half So far we d spent about 10 minutes decoding just five words but I felt on top of them and was ready to move on Then Simon said But it s also a reference to the flower Pardon There s a flower called Wandering Jew There s a flower Yes Ah And I realized that had Simon followed Lerner s advice and started writing musicals we d have had to get to the theater at 10 30 in the morning to read up on the textual footnotes In that sense despite Geffen s marketing efforts Larson is straightforwardly Broadway The Act I finale La Vie Boh me LINK TO AUDIO CLIP is a rock gloss on the hoariest of musical comedy staples the bravura laundry list The master was Cole Porter You re a rose You re Inferno s Dante You re the noseOn the great Durante Next to Porter s marriage of the erudite and the everyday Larson s catalog seems somewhat single minded To SontagTo SondheimTo anything taboo The Sondheim reference is apposite Songs like Tango Maureen LINK TO AUDIO CLIP glib brittle dialogue at odds with the exotic tango rhythms are a reminder of such early Sondheim works as Barcelona LINK TO AUDIO CLIP In Company Sondheim used the click buzz of the telephone as a leitmotif for urban neurosis in Rent Larson tries to pull something similar with his Voice Mail numbers a series of a cappella answering machine messages There are two good songs in Rent They re called White Christmas and Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer and they re briefly quoted in a yuletide scene But Larson s own title for that number Christmas Bells reveals his greatest weakness Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer is a title so s I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus But Christmas Bells isn t neither is You ll See or Out Tonight or We re Okay all titles of songs in Rent Without You is a good title but it s already been used in My Fair Lady and as a hit for Nilsson and Mariah Carey Ira Gershwin used to say A title Is vitalOnce you ve itProve it A good title usually indicates a good song idea a good central lyric thrust something to resolve As pop and theater have drifted apart it seems that the rock crowd pays more heed to Gershwin s advice than the musical men Wake Me Up Before You Go Go George Michael or Get Outta My Dreams Get Into My Car Billy Ocean are better titles and stronger images than you get in most show tunes In Rent there are few strong song ideas few resolved lyric thrusts That s one reason why it s deficient as drama but also why it will be hard to play on pop radio David Geffen is likely to be disappointed Rent continues the American musical s long fade out to a twilight limbo caught somewhere between not quite serious music and no longer popular pop music
