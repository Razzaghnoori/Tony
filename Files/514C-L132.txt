 December 6 1991 Name Address City ST Zip Dear Name Students in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs now as much as 20 years ago bring a rich diversity of backgrounds and interests to the school Interacting with our faculty and their fellow students they develop skills and perspectives that will help them meet the complex challenges that face our society in the coming years Despite our efforts at innovation and efficiency however the cost of providing a quality educational experience continues to rise Because of the financial generosity of alumni and friends SPEA is able to enliven and enrich the student experience by allowing us to provide extra support that is not available from state and university funds This support helps in a number of areas on all of our campuses Student support through scholarships and assistantships Classroom activities such as field trips Colloquiums with guest speakers from around the world Your generosity over the past four years has provided an extra bonus to the SPEA program Your renewed gift to the School will enable us to sustain our reputation of excellence to prepare our students for successful satisfying careers and at the same time to enhance the value to you of your Indiana University degree We very much appreciate your assistance Sincerely yours A James Barnes Dean
