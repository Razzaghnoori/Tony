s Wrap Up Among his many accomplishments Dr Johnson was the first of the great Scot bashers elevating a common anti immigrant prejudice to a wittier sort of anti immigrant prejudice and a way to tweak his great friend James Boswell Some examples taken from the delightful Samuel Johnson Sound Bite Page maintained by Frank Lynch When Boswell boasted about his country s landscape saying it had many noble prospects Johnson replied The noblest prospect which a Scotchman ever sees is the high road that leads him to England What enemy would invade Scotland where there is nothing to be got At dinner Mrs Thrale expressed a wish to go and see Scotland Johnson Seeing Scotland Madam is only seeing a worse England It is seeing the flower gradually fade away to the naked stalk Knowledge was divided

learn it It is all gardening with you Things which grow wild here must be cultivated with great care in Scotland Pray now throwing himself back in his chair and laughing are you ever able to bring the sloe to perfection All taken from Boswell s Life of Johnson unless otherwise noted D j Vu Answer Each was the subject of a biography by James Mackay that faced charges of plagiarism The prolific
