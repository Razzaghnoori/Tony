 okay so are you a freshwater or mostly freshwater uh i yeah i i used to fish uh when i was real young down in Galveston with my parents and freshwater i never really got into that too much because you have to get in the boat really to do anything and i didn t know anybody who had a boat now so i don t fish too much in saltwater um hum most of my fishing has been in the saltwater oh really huh mostly deep sea fishing for grouper and bottom fish oh neat and uh huh i have caught one or two small sharks oh really and uh yes what d you do with them put them back you didn t get a big kick out of killing them like some people do no no no i love shark steak but uh the ones i caught were never large enough to uh really do anything uh do they have a limit on sharks i mean is that like a a sport fish can you actually catch those and there s no limit is there a limit i have no idea i know i my home is in uh Pensacola Florida so uh huh it s they do a lot of shark fishing in that you know in the gulf right and um a certain period of time during the year they have all along the gulf coast from i guess from Galveston to Mayport they have uh shark tournaments and you know there s part either as part of or separate from the uh bill fishing tournaments they usually have so i have not done uh much freshwater uh fishing not right oh really oh for you know lake lake fishing for bass and so forth but uh maybe some what they call uh brim and those sorts of things but right uh huh nothing i think i ve been trout fishing once uh i ve never fly fished have you fly fished uh no i haven t i don t know that i could do that that looks awful tiring well i ve tried it once yes uh a friend of mine did you didn t like it no i could never get the hang of it it looks complicated to me it s a rhythm or something uh huh i usually ended snagging my uh fishing partners or catching tree bass right did you that would have been something the trees along the bank yes almost got an owl once but uh so do you do you fish mainly for trophies or do you do you eat what you fish oh no no no no i used uh when i was uh working in Florida i used to do a lot of surf um fishing uh huh mostly for relaxation right you know there are there are people who fish and then there are people who catch right well i m a fisher you just like to sit down and watch it right that s right i i ve never caught that much but uh really oh and occasionally we d go out on a you know uh full day trip you know three or four other people and do right either again bottom fishing or for grouper or i used to catch you know i ve caught a few right worthwhile snappers red snappers and gray snappers and so forth that s nice what about you you a well most of my fishing is done at um area lakes around here freshwater lakes and um hum um most of it i haven t been really in a long time last time i went i actually was in Galveston trying to saltwater fish and it just wasn t working with my freshwater tackle that was real fun um but um i went fishing at i don t know if you ve ever heard of uh Lake Worth it s a fairly new lake in Texas oh yes and uh we went fishing there last Memorial Day and i caught my first bass that was actually big enough to keep i was so excited and um that s really about it mostly just the lakes around here and i i fish to take home and cook i don t i don t get too much joy out of just sitting and watching i get a little bit of relaxation from it but mainly i um i want to say i brought something home i want to say i did this i was out there for a reason the last time i went uh bass fishing uh i was with my daughter a friend of hers and well a friend of mine and his daughter we i was the only one who did not catch a single fish my daughter caught fish his daughter caught fish he caught fish really everybody but you i did not even i did not even i have been i was out on a party boat a few years ago and we we were grouper fishing or you know actually we were uh snapper fishing everyone on the boat was catching snapper snappers except it had to be you you couldn t catch one to save your life guess who i could i that s right i would go from one side of the boat to the other and uh the uh the party boat captain could not understand you know he even even he started baiting my hook and holding holding the uh the fishing rod how funny just hoping maybe he could fool them right and it was it was really really really bad uh i as i said i am a fisher i m not a catcher but uh right i enjoy it though i don t really get out as much as i uh as i would like too and uh yeah they do of course you know here in um we re only just a few not a few minutes we re you know forty five minutes to an hour away from the eastern shore here in Maryland right and they do a lot of fishing there of course what i used to like to do though is uh go snorkeling for scallops in some of the bays or uh oh yeah or oyster for oysters that would be fun and uh that i was able to do uh when i could go in and go down and actually pick them off the bottom right hand picked that s right the weirdest fishing experience i ever had and uh people to this day are still trying to figure out if i really caught what i think i caught we were in uh Rockport which is close to Corpus um hum and we had been fishing in a canal they had all these canals up through this one little retirement area and uh we d been fishing in the canals and all we were catching were catfish and we were pretty bored with that so we thought well maybe there are some crab in here we ll try to catch some crab so i got my chicken neck and all my little net and everything and something i had a rock to weight it down something grabs and just runs with it and of course there s no hook so it can t be a fish i m sure it s not a fish right um hum and crab they don t bite like that they don t just run with your food so i netted it and it was the ugliest fish i ve ever seen in my life It had real teeth like human teeth and it looked archaic i i had no idea what it was i called my father long distance just to describe the thing and it had the rock in it s mouth it not the chicken but the rock itself is what it had grabbed they say it s a dogfish from everything i ve described it was brown with these little white dots and it made a loud kind of almost a croaking noise like a croaker does hm uh huh uh huh it it was the strangest thing it oh i ll never get over that to this day i don t want to get in the water anywhere around salt water because i m sure one of those fish are there well we used to i guess the weirdest thing i ve ever caught is uh in some of the inlets and the rivers around Rehoboth Delaware um hum they have a fish that s called an oyster cracker i don t know if you ve ever heard of it i ve never heard of that one and it has a huge strong mouth and they actually uh use their teeth to open oysters that s where it gets its name obviously huh um hum and this is the ugliest fish i have ever seen and i mean and they come in all size you know i ve i ve caught them from you know three or four inches long um hum up to uh i guess the largest largest one i ever caught was probably eight or ten inches long but just huge ugly things just terrible huh can you eat them no no ooh i i don t think i d want to even if you could if they re that ugly but they just they just look as though you do not want to do anything with them that s like this dogfish it was it scared me to death um hum it was ugly it really it didn t look like it looked like it was something out of the dark ages that just never died well the first time i went uh surf fishing was in and i threw my line out and the first thing i caught was a sand shark which was probably a foot and a half or uh two feet long and scared me to death i i had never seen anything and then i was fished fished for another half hour or forty five minutes caught a few white fish and so forth oh and then i felt something relatively heavy and i thought oh really here i m really going to get one and i pulled
