        okay   so are you a freshwater or   mostly freshwater uh i yeah i i used to fish uh when i was real young down in Galveston with my parents and   freshwater   i never really got into that too much because you have to get in the boat really to do anything and i didnt know anybody who had a boat now so i dont fish too much in saltwater   umhum most of my fishing has been in the saltwater   oh really   huh mostly deep sea fishing for grouper and bottom fish   oh neat   and uh huh i have caught one or two small sharks   oh really   and uh yes   whatd you do with them   put them back   you didnt get a big kick out of killing them like some people do   no no no i love shark steak but uh the ones i caught were never large enough to uh really do anything uh   do they have a limit on sharks i mean is that like a a sport fish can you actually catch those and theres no limit   is there a limit i have no idea i know i my home is in uh Pensacola Florida so   uhhuh   its they do a lot of shark fishing in that you know in the gulf   right   and um a certain period of time during the year they have all along the gulf coast from i guess from Galveston to Mayport they have uh shark tournaments and you know theres part either as part of or separate from the uh bill fishing tournaments they usually have so i have not done uh much freshwater uh fishing not   right oh really   oh for you know lake lake fishing for bass and so forth but uh maybe some what they call uh brim and those sorts of things but   right uhhuh   nothing i think ive been trout fishing once uh ive never fly fished have you fly fished   uh no i havent i dont know that i could do that that looks awful tiring     well ive tried it once yes uh a friend of mine   did you didnt like it   no       i could never get the hang of it   it looks complicated to me its a rhythm or something   uhhuh i usually ended snagging my uh fishing partners or     catching tree bass right  did you  that would have been something   the trees along the bank yes almost got an owl once  but uh   so do you do you fish mainly for trophies or do you do you eat what you fish   oh no no no no i used uh when i was uh working in Florida i used to do a lot of surf um fishing   uhhuh   mostly for relaxation   right   you know there are there are people who fish and then there are people who catch   right   well im a fisher   you just like to sit down and watch it right   thats right i ive never caught that much but uh   really   oh and occasionally wed go out on a you know uh full day trip you know three or four other people and do   right   either again bottom fishing or for grouper or i used to catch you know ive caught a few   right   worthwhile snappers red snappers and gray snappers and so forth   thats nice   what about you you a   well most of my fishing is done at um area lakes around here freshwater lakes and   umhum   um most of it i havent been really in a long time last time i went i actually was in Galveston trying to saltwater fish and it just wasnt working with my freshwater tackle that was real fun  um but       um i went fishing at i dont know if youve ever heard of uh Lake Worth its a fairly new lake in Texas   oh yes   and uh we went fishing there last Memorial Day and i caught my first bass that was actually big enough to keep i was so excited and um thats really about it mostly just the lakes around here and i i fish to take home and cook  i dont i dont get too much joy out of just sitting and watching i get a little bit of relaxation from it but mainly i um i want to say i brought something home i want to say i did this i was out there for a reason     the last time i went uh bass fishing uh i was with my daughter a friend of hers and well a friend of mine and his daughter we i was the only one who did not catch a single fish my daughter caught fish his daughter caught fish he caught fish     really     everybody but you   i did not even i did not even i have been i was out on a party boat a few years ago and we we were grouper fishing or you know actually we were uh snapper fishing everyone on the boat was catching snapper snappers except   it had to be you you couldnt catch one to save your life   guess who  i could i thats right i would go from one side of the boat to the other and uh       the uh the party boat captain could not understand you know he even even he started baiting my hook  and holding holding the uh the fishing rod         how funny just hoping maybe he could fool them   right  and it was it was really really really bad uh i as i said i am a fisher im not a catcher but uh   right   i enjoy it though i dont really get out as much as i uh as i would like too and uh   yeah   they do of course you know here in um were only just a few not a few minutes were you know forty five minutes to an hour away from the eastern shore here in Maryland   right   and they do a lot of fishing there of course what i used to like to do though is uh go snorkeling for scallops in some of the bays or uh   oh yeah   or oyster for oysters   that would be fun   and uh that i was able to do uh when i could go in and go down and actually pick them off the bottom   right  hand picked   thats right   the weirdest fishing experience i ever had and uh people to this day are still trying to figure out if i really caught what i think i caught we were in uh Rockport which is close to Corpus   umhum   and we had been fishing in a canal they had all these canals up through this one little retirement area and uh wed been fishing in the canals and all we were catching were catfish and we were pretty bored with that so we thought well maybe there are some crab in here well try to catch some crab so i got my chicken neck and all my little net and everything and something i had a rock to weight it down something grabs and just runs with it and of course theres no hook so it cant be a fish im sure its not a fish right   umhum   and crab they dont bite like that they dont just run with your food so i netted it and it was the ugliest fish ive ever seen in my life It had real teeth like human teeth and it looked archaic i i had no idea what it was i called my father long distance just to describe the thing and it had the rock in its mouth it not the chicken but the rock itself is what it had grabbed they say its a dogfish from everything ive described it was brown with these little white dots and it made a loud kind of almost a croaking noise like a croaker does   hm uhhuh uhhuh   it it was the strangest thing it oh ill never get over that to this day i dont want to get in the water anywhere around salt water because im sure one of those fish are there     well we used to i guess the weirdest thing ive ever caught is uh in some of the inlets and the rivers around Rehoboth Delaware   umhum   they have a fish thats called an oyster cracker i dont know if youve ever heard of it   ive never heard of that one   and it has a huge strong mouth and they actually uh use their teeth to open oysters   thats where it gets its name obviously huh   umhum and this is the ugliest       fish i have ever seen and i mean and they come in all size you know ive ive caught them from you know three or four inches long   umhum   up to uh i guess the largest largest one i ever caught was probably eight or ten inches long but just huge ugly things just terrible   huh can you eat them   no no   ooh i i dont think id want to even if you could if theyre that ugly but   they just they just look as though you do not want to do anything with them   thats like this dogfish it was it scared me to death   umhum   it was ugly it really it didnt look like it looked like it was something out of the dark ages that just never died   well the first time i went uh surf fishing was in and i threw my line out and the first thing i caught was a sand shark which was probably a foot and a half or uh two feet long and scared me to death i  i had never seen anything and then i was fished fished for another half hour or forty five minutes caught a few white fish and so forth   oh     and then i felt something relatively heavy and i thought oh really here im really going to get one       and i pulled
