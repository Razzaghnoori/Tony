                     OK         If you could state your name and your um date of birth your age and where you were born and where just basically just a brief sketch of all the places youve lived real quickly if you can                     Raymond Borel Junior born September th          They tell me at Riverside Memorial Hospital or something in NJ         There I resided until  um  or one when we moved to northeastern PA more specifically a little squirt of a town called Laceyville and there I lived until I was seven  in  and I moved here to Belmont NC                              And how OK can you tell me any flood stories about growing up in Penn                     Oh we lived uh not far from the Susquehanna River where our church was down that way Skinners Eddy United Methodist Church specifically and I dont know if it was in the year that the king died there in  or if it was  but a flood came and course the kids were all you know told to leave school parents would come get you the buses ran special routes and so forth         I remember going down to the church and there was a group of men there that were organizing an uh evacuation of all the valuables of the church take them to the second floor         We had a large tractortrailer parked out front and uh         these guys all assembled to take the pews out of the church         Well of all these groups of adults there now         Im maybe Im maybe nine  years old and uh of all these adults assembled there not one of them had a pair of pliers or a wrench         I fortunately remembered when Mom and I left to go to the church to bring a wrench and couple pairs of pliers because of course the pews were bolted to the floor         This as a young child kind of stunned me you know that were going to go evacuate pews from a church and were not going to bring any tools with us of course this was predating Makita battery tools looking back in retrospect we could have used Makita tools would have been far more productive but carrying the pews out of that church and loading them in that truck and by the time we got done the trailer wheels were covered with water and uh we just kind of made it by the skin of our teeth that we got everything out of there                     Yeah um how about because I know weather always reeked uh certainly during the wintertime and all of the snowstorms that would come uh                               Ah yeah fond fond memories                              One of my favorite         one of my favorite stories is the one about with you and my brother Ryan the one day that you went sledding                     Sleigh riding down a uh property line that divided our house our land from another neighbor that was kind of a a swell or a ditch if you will there and that would freeze the water would freeze in that so you basically had a uh like a luge is that what it is                     Uhhuh                     Ice with a little bit of snow on top of it and we were in a little toboggan sled there not the not the kind roll up there like a plastic sheet but a boat sled                     Right                     And uh we we were moving pretty quickly down through there and I happened to glance up the road and there was a car coming         So         I have my sisters kid here and Im going to kill him underneath this vehicle shortly                  So we uh through tremendous diversionary tactics of dragging my leg and my elbow and so forth we managed to stop just at the the edge of the road after blistering my elbow on a big knot of ice but uh I dont think Marsha knew about that until a few years ago I guess I dont know its been a while but uh yeah the snow there in the winters were exciting to say the least         I remember many mornings walking down to the bus where you know whatever you had in your nose would freeze         It would just crunch and you went to blow your nose nothing liquid came out it was crystals and youd get on the school bus and it would be so damn cold that the floor of the bus would just be a solid sheet of ice youd have rock salt scattered on the floor of the bus in order to keep some kind of traction and uh had a couple of deviant children there on the bus and ones name was Robbie Share         He would pick chewing gum up off the floor and chew it disgusting things he was a deviant little sucker         And uh I dont remember         the specifics as to what he did but the bus driver Louie was about four and a half feet tall driving a passenger         diesel bus         Uh he would he would try to straighten out Robbie so he would call Robbie up to the front of the bus and hed tell him Boy I want you to sit there on that top step dont say a sound dont make a sound dont move I dont want to even know youre there         And every stop we make now you got to remember when those bus doors open what little heat thats in that bus goes out that door and the cold comes in                  Every time we stop I want you to get off and let whoever Im letting on in and then you get back in sit on the step         All the way through that hour and  minute bus route old Robbie get off hed stand outside the bus let the kids on and hed get back in         I dont know whatever became of Robbie not much I imagine         And then snow ice uh I can remember me and another boy once we got about sixth or seventh grade wed stop uh you couldnt run with chains on your bus on state maintained highways         You can do that on your on your county roads and I think they call them a borough if I remember right up that way         Um you could run with chains on those secondary roads um but once you got on a state road you couldnt so it would be a point in our bus route that we would have to get out and it would be you know I dont know   degrees wind blowing and wed help Louie get the chains off the bus         That was you know you kind of felt important at that point because youve youve graduated to next level of adolescence youre now helping the bus driver         We uh we would run our safety drills at the elementary school                  And uh the elementary school as you got to the high school of course that was different than it is down here our elementary school only ran until sixth grade and we went to the high school building at seventh grade so you had seven through  all in one big building         Of course you only had a thousand students through all those six grades                     Uhhuh                     But once you got to that point you still stopped at the elementary school and we would help those kids get off the bus we would have emergency drills and that sort of thing         You would open the back door and you felt like you were big stuff         We had one spot on our route at the top of Browntown Mountain which was about a two mile drag downhill which you know could be deadly for large trucks or cars on ice in any situation         I can remember sitting there and Louie saying Everybody be quiet shutup         It would be so damn foggy you could not see the yellow line on that divided highway in front of you and we to turn left out onto this highway         We would all slide the windows down on the bus open the door stick your head out the door you couldnt hear anything coming that way you couldnt hear anything coming the other way and hed just drop it in low and gun it we would make it another morning         That seems like that was two or three weeks out of the school year in the spring especially that the fog would just be outrageous         We never had any uh         never had any problems         I can remember it being so cold again that uh one circumstance coming from uh Springhill where I live down into town which was Laceyville the bus wouldnt run it kept cutting off it was diesel         It was so cold that the fuel does what they call congeals the fuel becomes like gelatin         Wed basically coasted down into town and got about  gallons of kerosene and pumped it in the fuel tank so that so that the fuel would actually run through the fuel lines and the bus would run         And youre going to school in those conditions                     Right                     That was uh that was the most exciting part of you know most important most exciting part of going to school was getting there for me                  Alive                     How about um your motorcycle                     Um yes yall need to include that picture with my little dysentery here uh disinter I guess it is                           I guess it was  my dad bought me a little Yamaha  motorcycle I could cruise through the fields and dirt roads and so forth which uh I had real good luck with that I guess up until um I dont know what year that was there         Groundhog hole found the front tire of the motorcycle and I managed to fly over the handlebars         I guess I lay there unconscious awhile         I dont remember but only only a fractured collarbone which I recommend to anyone that needs to break a bone break a collarbone                     Uhhuh                     Its a relatively painless experience and not very cumbersome to deal with not bad         My son reminds me of a story I told him or I think his grandmother told him         Our neighbor had a pool and we were kind of like the Hatfields and McCoys they werent very nice people and they didnt like us         I guess I had a friend staying overnight         We thought it would be cool to see just how far a BB would shoot                           Well we found out a couple of days later when the neighbor walked over and informed my dad that he found BB in the filter pump of his swimming pool         So I guess they went that far         We lived in uh in dairy land country and uh little things you missed which now I dont know if I like or not         We had a barn a dairy farm that was maybe quarter of a mile from the house and uh Mama say We need milk         Well the town was three miles away and the barn was a  feet so you grab your little stainless steel kettle with a lid on it and a handle         Youd walk down the road with a dollar bill in your hand now this is in the midseventies but still milk was twice that in the store I guess                     Uhhuh                     Youd go down to this big stainless steel vat that was would hold a thousand gallons of milk then youll pull the lid of this vat and lower youre kettle down in to it         Ice cold milk and uh pull it out of course it was whole milk and cream on top         If you forgot to shake it in the morning your cereal was kind of disgusting                     Yeah                     It was kind of like eating it with whipping cream         But I know uh your father used to love it         You couldnt leave it if you didnt rinse your glass out after you got drinking after you got done drinking it would stick to the glass to the point where youd have to scrape it         Now they tell you thats not good to do         You shouldnt drink that nonpasteurized milk but hey it never hurt us                     Um what other now I know you worked with your dad in the beginning there when you were quite younger                     Um  or                      Your father is a a builder                     Uhhum                     And and you took up the trade too                     Met my first girlfriend that way         Walked through her bedroom around  seven oclock in the morning you know                     Really                     Yeah         We were putting siding on her house and beat on the door nobody comes to the door its summertime everybody sleeping until          Were there early in the morning to beat the heat         I got to get the windows open in order to pin bend the metal around them and so forth this girl and I had always had a love hate relationship on the bus         I love to hate her         And uh me and my friend there wed always sit together in the first or second seat on the bus         Well when she we would pick her up on the route shed want to sit with us         It was the closest seat she was only on the bus a few minutes and then we were dumping the elementary kids and we had plenty of room again         So she we would always fuss about her sitting with us but anyway this one morning I putting siding dad and I are putting siding on her house and nobody come to the door         The door was unlocked and I had to get the windows open so I just kind of go cruising through the house upstairs try to find my way to the window         Well that window happened to be through her room so I just kind of walked on through the room and she looked up at me and I said Good morning and she just screamed         I went on through unlocked the window         and left         Later we laughed about it but wasnt really funny at the time for her I guess                                       Do you remember the first jobs that you that you did um because I did you I dont think you started working with your dad did you         You got a job cutting siding wasnt it                     Well that was for Dad         Yeah he had a guy that would help him on Wednesdays it was the local barber         He was paying him five bucks an hour and he would he could work all day Wednesday and uh but I believe it was on that job there that Kavalo that Dad said Look boy you can read a tape measure better that this forty year old man can so Ill give you five bucks an hour if you prove you can do it         Excuse me         You can prove what you can do                     Yeah                     So after two or three days he called Callgrove and said Dont bother coming in I found a guy better than you         Well when Callgrove found out it was me that that kind of hurt his feelings a little you know but ever since then Pop and I worked all summers every summer we did the Kavalo job then we built a barn the following year for the Reamuses down on the river         I fell off that roof theres a little miracle I missed a boulder by about six inches which would have probably shattered my spine when I fell off that but you get youre lucky everybodys here for a reason just what condition youre in when youre still here         Fortunately Im all in functioning                     Yeah                     All my digits um still work                     Do you remember                              I didnt oh I when I was a kid I dont even remember that son         I only heard about it                     Do you remember any stories or do you have any stories about your grandparents                     Uh not so much stories about Grandmom and Grandpop um                     Because they were living in a in an apartment basically                     Yeah when I was about  I guess I was  or          I went and stayed with Grandmom and Grandpop Borel in their little two bed one bedroom apartment in NJ and uh I guess I stayed five or six days         Grandmom smoked Saratoga  cigarettes which are about eight and a half inches long         Grandpop was a very quiet somber man he wouldnt say much but uh Gra ndmom was a little more boisterous         They had a small poodle named Fifi it was disgusting         but I learned uh you know how you learn respect for for people in in different ways um for you know for all Grandpop didnt say much Grandpop had more love and affection for that dog and showed it to that dog probably more than most parents show to their kids today         I mean man had hip replacements and bad knees and everything else and hed get on his knees and play with that dog and give it its medicine put peanut butter on his finger and feed it to that dog to keep that dog alive         Um I know a lot of people wouldnt couldnt I mean and for him he wouldnt have bent down to pick up a quarter because it would have hurt him too much                     Yeah                     Um but hed bend down and stay down to help that dog         My grandmom was pretty much a chain smoker         She uh shed had laryngitis and the doctor told her if you dont quit smoking youll never talk         She told him to shutup and get her a pack of cigarettes         She got gangrene in her foot and he said if you dont quit smoking youre going to lose your foot         She said Im going shoe shopping and kept on smoking         Died with both feet and talking the whole way         Uh  she would have smoking all the whole way                               Smoking the whole way          Yeah                     And that time I spent with them was the coolest because grandmom would let me smoke and at   years old         you know being able to         sit there and smoke cigarettes with grandma                     Do you smoke her Saratogas                     Oh yeah man they were good cigarettes         Now that was uh man the most flavorful cigarette Id ever smoked course at  what did you ever smoke you know                  But uh come mealtime boy this little apartment with central air conditioning running the smoke hung about four and a half five feet down from the ceiling         I mean literally you could just see it hang it looked like a fire scene on the news it was awful         I mean you have smoked potatoes and smoked roast beef smoked sandwiches smoked syrup everything tasted like smoke         And clothes everything just reeked of it especially if you went outside for  minutes and actually got huh fresh smog         SF Yeah                     And then came back in oh my gosh the second hand smoke in there was enough to kill uh a farm full of people         Terrible                     Well I think what was worse about their place is not only the smoke hanging in the air but they kept it at   degrees                               Uhhum         It was always warm                               All the time          Even in the in I mean NJ winters are really cold but                     And Grandpop would complain that it was still cold in there                     Yeah                     At  he was still cold                     Yeah                     He liked it a little warmer         Not too many stories about Grandmom and Grandpop though they were pretty quiet                     Do you remember any stories about Grandma Mackton your moms a little bit                     The only stories I remember about         Grandmom Mackton would be uh when uh Grandpop Mackton uh he was a watch repairman and so forth and this was even actually before my time I remember this just being translated to me from my dad um my sisters Marsha and Rayona would be over there visiting with my mom and dad and Grandpop would be working on a watch and hed drop a part         Now you can picture the part out of a watch how small this is and for a guy that in his probably sixties at that point difficult for him to see lighting in that day and time not being what it is now of course hed lose his part and hed say Tootles well first hed have his fit Nothing but damn junk junk junk         Hed say about these watches he was fixing Nothing but a bunch of GD junk         I can remember Mom and Dad saying Grandmom in the kitchen hollering Daddy Daddy Daddy I wish you wouldnt talk like that in front of the girls         Then Grandpop hed calm down Tootles you see this part here         I dropped one of those sons of bitches on the floor again                  Can you find one just like it for Grandpa         And he they would get down there and theyd find it and find it for him         I remember too Dad say that Grandmom would fuss at him for giving the girls money I say I dont remember now how much it was but if pack of cigarettes was  cents hed give the girls a quarter                     Uhhuh                     Now this is going back to the fifties and early sixties when you could still do that but hed send these young girls  or  years old maybe down to the general store and get him a pack of cigarettes well with the change they could buy licorice and candy and what not         Daddy Daddy Daddy send those girls to get those filthy cigarettes         Well they get candy Mom                  You know thats how he justified it they were getting something out of it         He wasnt sending them there for nothing         Im told Im a lot like him         Which I dont know I never met him dont remember him                     How about do remember any stories that that youve been told by your by your sisters about them growing up or have they told stories about you growing up that you can remember                     Well some of them that uh with your mother Marsha uh I she was I believe about  when I was born         I was a mistake         An oops         And uh everyone you know going out to eat or anything like that then uh the waiter would say to my parents What would you like what would you like         and then they ask my sister what would she like for my son         Shed go Oh no hes not mine         Hes theirs         You know she wasnt going to claim me                  My sister had uh an apartment in NJ and I remember there was she had a roommate young girl which hindsight is  she used to say she was going to kidnap in the middle of the night put me in bed with her         I would just scream and scream you know that No no dont do that         But stories I remember hearing one of uh I believe it was Marsha uh the wind caught the storm door there she was she was uh hanging on to the back storm door and I guess pulled it open a little bit to see what was going on and the wind caught it and threw her right out in the yard                     Yard                     Hello         I dont know uh any other fantastic tales that I have                     How about um your kids         Youve got three kids now                              Uhhuh         Yeah                              Born and raised in in uh  NC                               NC          The fine county of Gaston         Yeah I have a son that uh likes to relive the tragedy of his split lip         Um took a little spill and had to get a stitch huh                     Uhhuh                     Huh yeah         But uh no theyve had pretty uneventful childhoods I think weve had our moments of comedy                     Yeah                     We were helping my niece and nephew paint a new house that they bought and uh he uh little Raymond was with us         He said Daddy I have to go poopoo         And I said Well son the Portojohn is way down there in the neighborhood         Hold it as long as you can                  Tell me when you feel it peeping out and then well run like hell                  And my one sister Rayona she reminds me of that story and laughs every time we tell it                  But you held it didnt you                     Umhuh                     I dont know do I have any other fantastic stories Ive told you                     Im trying to remember         I can well you know we just relived the story today of when you built the house over on um  Songbird                               Songbird          We were there working                     And the day that you put the the shower and the tub in         Do you remember that                     Um yeah when Dad busted my ear because he stopped moving                     Yeah                     Yeah         And those moments of idiotic stupidity we uh we put some scaffolding out on the front of the house and uh I just shot a twobyfour out the side of the house with a couple of nails in it and got out there and climbed on top of it         Theres my dad reminds me from time to time         What if those nails would have pulled out         But fortunately they didnt         One story does come to my mind though where you painted the foundation coating on the house and got tar all over you                  Do you remember that                     Yeah                     And you said How do I get this tar off of me uncle         I said Well you can use paint thinner or turpentine or gasoline         Well what do you have         I said

   You had put some type of beam between the two floor joists and you went to hit it with a hammer and you were hitting it backwards and it smacked it into your chest                     Smacked my chest         Oh Ive done that a number of times         Had my head up between ceiling joists nailing rafters glanced off the rafter and hit myself in the head with a hammer                     How about um how about this story of Grandpop and his son of your dad                     Oh yeah         That was when we first moved here to NC we uh had a job across the street from where we build him a house uh Truman house         And uh we were borrowing a guys saw chop saw miter saw and um I upstairs nailing down trim and I hear the saw every once in a while so I know hes down there working and all of a sudden dont hear the saw and I run out of new trim         Are you down there         I look nobody is standing at the saw         I look around well he was right here         I see a few drops of blood on the floor         I look out the window and there hes booking across the yard heading for the house         I get over to the house         He said that saw drifted down and hit him right across the back of his thumb                     Ouch                     Yeah so hes kind of standing there at the kitchen sink and my moms running around like a chicken with her head cut off                  Need a BandAid need some gauze need some tape         Well she cant find any of it         My moms not real organized when it comes to things like that                  BandAids are at the kitchen sink the peroxide is in the basement you know the gauze is in the bathroom and the tape for that is upstairs                     Right                     Oh lord shes running around carrying on well Dad makes the mistake of looking at his wound and his knees go out from under him         He buckles down onto the floor         I think uhoh  pounds of mush going to be laying on the floor         Ill never get him up you know                  So we quick think and I go well grab a paper towel and wet it and throw a couple of ice cubes in and put it on his hand get him up to his feet and haul him off to the emergency room         Well meantime my Mom is running around she doesnt hardly know that we left         Shes still looking for BandAids                  Take him to the First Med Place         They stitch him up good went back to work later that afternoon         Hes a trooper that way he that doesnt make any difference as far as him being hurt hell work                     Yeah                     Hell work it off         I remember um one of the best trips we had which was why weve since created the Borel Family Reunion was a funeral we had a funeral for my grandfather Grandpop Borel         My sisters and I decided we would all ride up together in  the upchuck wagon         You were there the upchuck wagon                               I think yeah Ryan and I were there          Yeah now you have to explain the upchuck wagon                     I believe it was a Dodge wasnt it                     If my father bought it it would have to be a Dodge                              Yes thats true                     It was a Chevy                      Oh                               It was a Chevy          A Chevy conversion van at  miles an hour would make the freakiest noises which would wake my sister up to prompt her to poke me and tell m e to slow down                  And uh somewhere in the middle of VA                     Because we were driving from  NC all the way up to Riverside NJ                               NC all the way up to Riverside NJ          Of course we had to do it in a day because we couldnt take enough time everybody         Somewhere in VA Marsha sees a billboard for this restaurant to eat at         Its a very attractive billboard but it was not anything franchised where you could actually say Oh yes I know that         So we took a chance on it and started following the billboards         I swear to God it must have been  miles later like on three secondary roads down a dirt road at the end of a trail was this nice kind of western looking restaurant that we ended up eating at         I believe that there was a pond even that it kind of overlooked in the back         It was kind of it was nice         But it kind of killed an hour out of our trip as far as time but we had a lot of fun at that uh that funeral         I had a cousin there that had a he was I guess in his twenties and uh he loaded the trunk of his car with beer and after the funeral we all kind of stood out in the parking lot drinking beer smoking cigarettes and it wasnt um until after Grandmom died and uh we were sitting at uh a cousins house sitting in his basement and um his name was Raymond Ward and he was kind of hosting the post funeral procession there that goes on         And I said to some of my cousins that I had only the last I had seen was at Grandpops funeral         I said You know this really sucks we all have a really good time and its a really sad occasion         Why dont we do this in spite of not dont have a funeral lets just get together         And we were just sitting there and the majority of the family at that point lived in PA and the rest of it lived here in NC and sitting there with him we just kind of said You know we ought to find a place in the middle         And uh my parents and I had stopped many times in a little town called New Market VA which was just a  little  yeah it seemed like a halfway point                      Halfway                              And uh so we uh put some plans together         My older sister Rayona she put together that reunion         Turns out it was  miles to New Market from PA and  miles from NC to New Market         And now we can sit around drink beer by the pool smoke cigarettes and tell stories without somebody dying                     Right                     But I know ironically I dont think why in fact I know we had one reunion and then we lost a family member that Raymond Ward that we met at his house         Any more interesting stories you know that I tell                     I was just well I always thought the one with um about Aunt Ann and the bird                     Aunt Ann and the bird                     The bird that that flew into the house                     Oh well that was Rosemary her mother was gone         They lived across the street from us in PA         Thats my dads brother and uh his family and um one of his daughters call over there and she says We got a bird stuck in the house and it wont get out         And Aunt Ann has a lot of knickknacks                     Uhhum                     A lot of crystal and plates and she had a plate rail in the dining room that ran around you know so far down from the ceiling and that damn little bird would walk behind those plates and you you just knew he was going to knock a plate knock off a plate off but he never did         Chased him all the way up to the upstairs I dont think the bird ever even pooped in the house not that we found                     Wow                     Not that we found but he got upstairs in the house and we locked in the bedroom and opened all the windows in the bedroom and after about half an hour it kind of ran out but I dont think Aunt Ann ever noticed that         I dont think Aunt Ann noticed that bird was ever in the house                              I wont tell                  We wont let her see the tape                     OK                              Thank thank you for your stories
