 The Bridle of Frankenfood The Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times lead with the adoption in Montreal of an international trade agreement on genetically altered food products The cornerstone of the treaty is its support for the precautionary principle which allows countries to ban the import of genetically altered products without conclusive scientific proof that said products are hazardous The New York Times off leads with the Montreal agreement and leads with an article exploring the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1996 Under the act cities and states are suing to take control of their prisons back from the courts Ten localities have sued successfully with at least ten more suits in the works The NYT notes that the Montreal talks were focused on reducing biotechnology s impact on the environment and didn t address 1 potential risks to human health caused by biotechnology products 2 regulations on human pharmaceuticals The treaty also requires exporters to secure permission from target countries before importing living modified organisms such as genetically altered seeds The most contentious issue was the establishment of a notification system for foods produced with genetically altered seeds US representatives claimed that such a system would be a bureaucratic nightmare and after four days of intense negotiation the delegates agreed to table the issue for at least two years The American Civil Liberties Union and other advocacy groups mourn the effects of the Prison Litigation Reform Act saying that it leaves no way to prevent prisons from backsliding into the inhumane conditions that warranted judiciary intervention Some also maintain that the act is unconstitutional the Supreme Court agreed last year to review a case claiming that the law in effect allows Congress to dictate judicial policy Supporters of the claim that many judges had overstepped their authority and that overly strict standards made it very difficult to end court intervention A

elections is currently negotiating with the conservative People s Party The WP and NYT tuck the story inside but everyone mentions party leader Jeorg Haider s infamous statements praising the employment policies of Nazi Germany Coalition negotiations between the People s Party and the Social Democrats broke down last week The NYT front notes that the price of oil which has nearly doubled since last winter is inflating gas heating and airline ticket prices The raise in prices are a result of last March s OPEC production cut and diminished domestic stockpiles of heating oil brought about by milder winters and stricter regulations on storage facilities Given the overall health of the economy no one believes that the price hikes will cause a recession The Post runs a front page
