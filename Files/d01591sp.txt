used both when people discuss their own finances and when policymakers and economists discuss national saving For people and for the nation saving means forgoing consumption today so they can enjoy a better standard of living in the future National saving the portion of a nation s current income not consumed is the sum of saving by households businesses and all levels of government National saving represents resources available for investment to replace old factories and equipment and to buy more and better capital goods Higher saving and investment in a nation s capital stock contribute to increased productivity and stronger economic growth over the long term Saving today increases a nation s capacity to produce goods and services in the future and therefore helps to increase the standard of living for future generations Since the 1970s combined saving by households and business has declined For much of that time the federal government did not contribute to saving instead it was a borrower its deficits absorbing a share of the saving pool available for investment For the nation as a whole saving has rebounded somewhat from its low point in the early 1990s but remains relatively low by U S historical standards In fiscal year 1998 the federal government began to contribute to the pool of saving by running its first surplus since 1969 Federal budget surpluses now are projected for at least the next decade But even with the advent of federal government saving in the late 1990s national saving available for new investment remains relatively low in large part because personal saving has dramatically declined The U S has been able to invest more than it saves by borrowing from abroad but economists question whether this is a viable strategy for the long term Personal saving plays a dual role ensuring both individuals retirement security and the nation s economic security While Social Security provides a foundation for retirement income saving through pensions and by individuals on their own behalf contribute substantially to retirement income Even as more people are accumulating balances through employer sponsored 401 k saving plans and individual retirement accounts personal saving which does not reflect gains on existing assets has declined The personal saving rate has plunged with American households spending virtually all of their current income Although aggregate household wealth has risen in part as a result of the stock market boom over the 1990s many individual households have accumulated little if any wealth America faces a demographic tidal wave that poses significant challenges for individuals retirement security and our economy as a whole More people are living longer in retirement and there will be relatively fewer workers supporting each retiree in the future Without meaningful reform the Social Security and Medicare programs face long term financing problems Although public attention usually focuses on the dates by which the trust funds are projected to become insolvent the effects associated with financing cash deficits for these programs will be felt sooner as the baby boom generation begins to retire As the population ages spending for Social Security and federal health programs will leave increasingly less room for spending on other national priorities Increasing national saving is an important way to bolster retirement security for current workers and to allow future workers to more easily bear the costs of financing federal retirement and health programs while maintaining their standard of living As we have reported in the past the surest way for the federal government to affect national saving is through federal fiscal policy particularly in what it chooses to do with the budget surpluses projected over the next decade Policymakers appear to have agreed to save the Social Security surpluses and the fiscal policy debate has centered on what to do with the balance of the anticipated surpluses To the extent that they are used to reduce federal debt held by the public surpluses represent an opportunity to increase national saving In addition how surpluses are used has long term implications for future economic growth Policy debates surrounding Social Security and Medicare reform also have implications for all levels of saving government personal and ultimately national This report is designed to present information about national saving as measured in the National Income and Product Accounts and its implications for economic growth and retirement security in a concise and easily understandable manner In general this report is based on widely accepted economic principles and we identify those areas where many economists do not agree Although many excellent studies and books have been written on national saving and long term economic growth these discussions tend to be complex and technical Also most discussion of the decline in personal saving focuses on the adequacy of individuals retirement saving rather than on the significance of personal saving for the economy as a whole For example one point that is sometimes overlooked is that low personal saving has consequences for U S reliance on foreign borrowing long term economic growth and standards of living for future generations This report addresses the following questions 1 What is personal saving how is it related to national saving and what are the implications of low personal saving for Americans retirement security 2 What is national saving and how does current saving in the United States compare to historical trends and saving in other countries 3 How does national saving affect the economy and how would higher saving affect the longterm outlook 4 How does federal fiscal policy affect national saving what federal policies have been aimed at increasing private saving and how would Social Security and Medicare reform affect national saving And 5 what are key issues in evaluating national saving For a quick overview of the topics discussed in this report see the summary section For easy access to definitions of key terms we include a glossary at the end of this report Terms contained in the glossary appear in bold type in the text the first time they are used in the major sections For readers who are interested in more detailed information on the topics covered here we also include a bibliography This report was prepared under the direction of Paul L Posner Managing Director of Federal Budget Analysis and Susan J Irving Director of Federal Budget

Strategic Issues Summary of Major Sections Personal Saving and Retirement Security The personal saving rate as measured in the National Income and Product Accounts NIPA reflects how much households in aggregate are saving from their current disposable income In evaluating personal saving it is important to distinguish between saving as a way for an individual household to finance future consumption and saving as a way to finance the nation s capital formation Strange as it may seem to the typical household capital gains on its existing assets do not contribute to saving as measured in NIPA That is because capital gains reflect a revaluation of the nation s existing capital stock and do not provide resources for financing investment that adds to the capital stock Whereas employer contributions to pension funds as well as pension funds interest and dividend income are part of personal income and contribute to personal saving increases in the market value of assets held by pension funds for example are not counted as personal income and saving Although an individual household can tap its wealth by selling assets to finance consumption or accumulate other assets the sale of an existing asset merely transfers ownership it does not generate new economic output The personal saving rate has largely declined since the 1980s plummeting in recent years to levels not seen since the Great Depression as shown in figure S 1 A low personal saving rate raises questions about whether households have adequate resources to sustain their rate of spending A negative saving rate means that in aggregate households are spending more than their current income by drawing down past saving selling existing assets or borrowing 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 Source Bureau of Economic Analysis Department of Commerce Economists use several theories to explain what motivates people to save Despite a great deal of study economists have found no single reason that convincingly explains the decline in the personal saving rate One possible explanation is that surging household wealth in recent years contributed to the virtual disappearance of personal saving Since the mid 1990s aggregate household wealth has swelled relative to disposable personal income largely due to increases in the market value of households existing assets see figure 1 2 Yet despite the stock market boom of the 1990s many households have accumulated little if any wealth see figure 1 3 and half of American households did not own stocks as of 1998 While Social Security provides a foundation for retirement income Social Security benefits replace only about 40 percent of pre retirement income for the average worker As a result Social Security benefits must be supplemented by private pensions accumulated assets or other resources in order for individuals to maintain a reasonable standard of living in retirement compared to their final working years Pensions income from accumulated assets and earnings from continued employment largely determine which households will have the highest retirement income see figures 1 4 and 1 5 Pensions are not a universal source of retirement income and more than half of those working in 1998 lacked a pension plan While most families say they recognize the need to save for retirement National Saving Overview fewer than half of those surveyed in early 2001 had tried to calculate how much they need to save Over the next 75 years the elderly population will nearly double as a share of the total U S population see figure 1 6 As more people live longer there will be relatively fewer workers supporting each retiree unless retirement patterns change While today there are 3 4 workers for each Social Security beneficiary by 2030 there will be only about 2 workers paying taxes to support each beneficiary see figure 1 7 Both Social Security and Medicare face long term financing problems and the Social Security and Medicare s Hospital Insurance trust funds eventually will be exhausted as the baby boomers draw their benefits see figures 1 8 and 1 9 Absent reform Social Security and Medicare costs would constitute a substantial drain on the earnings of future workers see figure 1 10 Anticipating potential benefit cuts people could choose to save more now work longer to delay retirement or experience a lower standard of living in retirement With an aging population and a slowly growing workforce saving more today and increasing the nation s future economic capacity is critical to ensuring retirement security in the 21st century In the NIPA national saving is the sum of saving by households businesses and all levels of government Gross national saving which reflects resources available both to replace old worn out capital goods and to expand the capital stock has rebounded as a share of gross domestic product GDP from its low in the 1990s but remains below the level of the 1960s see figure 2 1 Depreciation as a share of GDP has increased slightly over the past 4 decades and net national saving which excludes depreciation remains well below the 1960s average as shown in figure S 2 Through much of the 1980s and early 1990s federal deficits absorbed funds saved by households and businesses and reduced overall national saving available to finance private investment see figure 2 2 Even as federal surpluses have contributed to national saving in recent years personal saving has steadily declined as a share of GDP and personal dissaving in 2000 absorbed resources that otherwise would have been available for investment Although gross national saving in 2000 was low by U S historical standards U S gross national saving has generally been lower than other major industrialized countries over the past 4 decades see figure 2 3 National Saving and the Economy 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 Source GAO analysis of NIPA data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis Department of Commerce National saving represents resources available for investment in the nation s stock of capital goods such as plant equipment and housing The nation s human capital and knowledge forms of intangible capital are not part of the NIPA definitions of saving and investment Also NIPA focuses on the incomes arising from current production of goods and services and thus does not count revaluation of existing assets in national saving Changes in the market value of existing tangible and financial assets such as land and stocks reflect expectations about the productive potential of the underlying capital but fluctuations in asset values may not represent real permanent changes in the nation s productive capacity National saving together with borrowing from abroad provides the resources for investment that can boost productivity and lead to higher economic growth and future living standards see figure 3 1 Investment in new capital is an important way to raise the productivity of the slowly growing workforce as the population ages Greater economic growth from saving more now would make it easier for future workers to achieve a rising standard of living for themselves while also paying for the government s commitments to the elderly Economic growth also depends on education to enhance the knowledge and skills of the nation s work National Saving and the Government force the nation s human capital as well as research and development to spur technological advances Even though national saving remains relatively low by U S historical standards economic growth in recent years has been high because more and better investments were made Each dollar saved bought more investment goods and a greater share of saving was invested in highly productive information technology Also the United States was able to invest more than it saved by borrowing from abroad see figure 3 2 Persistent U S current account deficits have translated into a rising level of indebtedness to other countries i e net U S holdings of foreign assets see figure 3 3 Many other nations currently financing investment in the United States also will face aging populations and declining national saving so relying on foreign savers to finance a large share of U S domestic investment is not a viable strategy for the long run Current saving and investment decisions have profound implications for the nation s level of well being in the future Our simulations using a longterm economic growth model show that even assuming the United States could maintain national saving constant at its 2000 share of GDP future incomes would fall short of the rise in living standards enjoyed by prior generations whose income generally doubled every 35 years see figures 3 4 and 3 5 Saving more would improve the nation s long term economic outlook but this requires consuming less now Federal fiscal policy affects the amount of federal government saving and this in turn directly affects national saving From the 1970s through the mid 1990s federal deficits absorbed a large share of private saving and reduced the amount of national saving available for investment see figure 4 1 Borrowing to finance these deficits added to the federal debt held by the public In recent years federal surpluses added to national saving and increased funds available for investment So far the federal government has used surplus funds to reduce its debt held by the public Accumulating nonfederal financial assets such as stocks could be another way that government saving could translate into resources available for investment but this idea is controversial An additional dollar of government saving and debt reduction does not automatically increase national saving and investment by a dollar because changes in saving by households and businesses will tend to offset some of the change in government saving While attention has focused on budget surpluses projected over the next decade the federal budget will increasingly be driven by one certainty the population is aging and there will be fewer workers supporting each retiree In our simulations saving only the Social Security surpluses will not be sufficient to accommodate both the projected growth in Social Security and health entitlements as well as other important national priorities in the long term see figure 4 2 Absent program changes saving the Social Security surpluses and even the Medicare surpluses is not enough to ensure retirement security for the aging population without placing a heavy burden on future generations Social Security and health spending alone eventually would exceed total federal revenue and squeeze out most or all other spending see figure 4 3 Even if the entire unified surplus were saved our simulations show that the rise in living standards measured in terms of GDP per capita would fall short of the rise enjoyed by prior generations whose income generally doubled every 35 years see figure 4 4 Reforming retirement and health entitlement programs is critical to putting the federal budget on a more sustainable footing for the long term and to freeing up future resources for other competing needs Although increasing government saving is the most direct way for the federal government to increase national saving budget surpluses also could be used to finance federal investment intended to promote long term economic growth or to encourage personal saving Whereas unified budget surpluses increase national saving available for private investment increasing federal spending on national infrastructure if properly designed and administered can be another way to increase the nation s capital stock In addition federal spending on education and research and development while not counting as investment in NIPA can if properly designed and administered promote the nation s long term productivity and economic growth The federal government also has sought to encourage personal saving both to enhance households financial security and to boost national saving But developing policies that have the desired effect is difficult Tax incentives affect how people save for retirement but do not necessarily increase the overall level of personal saving Even with preferential tax treatment for employer sponsored retirement saving plans and individual retirement accounts the personal saving rate has steadily declined Economists disagree about whether tax incentives are effective in increasing the overall level of personal saving The net effect of a tax incentive on national saving depends on whether the tax incentive induces enough additional saving by households to make up for the lower government saving resulting from the government s revenue loss In recent years policymakers have explored using government matching or creating new individual accounts to encourage Americans to save more Congress found that a leading obstacle to expanding retirement saving has been that many Americans do not know how to save for retirement let alone how much The Department of Labor maintains an outreach program to raise public awareness about the advantages of saving and to help educate workers about how much they need to save for retirement Other federal agencies also play a role in educating the public about saving Individualized statements now sent annually by the Social Security Administration to most workers aged 25 and older provide important information for personal retirement planning but knowing more about Social Security s financial status would help workers to understand how to view their personal benefit estimates Restoring Social Security to sustainable solvency and increasing saving are intertwined national goals Saving for the nation s retirement costs is analogous to an individual s retirement planning in that the sooner we increase saving the greater our benefit from compounding growth The way in which Social Security is reformed will influence both the magnitude and timing of any increase in national saving The ultimate effect of Social Security reform on national saving depends on complex interactions between government saving and personal saving both through pension funds and by individuals on their own behalf Various proposals would create new individual accounts as part of Social Security reform or in addition to Social Security The extent to which individual accounts would affect national saving depends on how the accounts are funded how the account program is structured and how people adjust their own saving behavior in response to the new accounts The Medicare program is fiscally burdensome in its current form and Medicare spending see figure 4 5 is expected to drive federal government dissaving over the long run Given the aging of the U S population and the increasing cost of modern medical technology it is inevitable that demands on the Medicare program will grow The current Medicare program lacks incentives to control health care consumption and the cost of health care decisions is not transparent to consumers Although future Medicare costs are expected to consume a growing share of the federal budget and the economy pressure is mounting to expand Medicare s benefit package to cover prescription drugs which will add billions to Medicare program costs In balancing health care spending with other societal priorities it is important to distinguish between health care wants which are virtually unlimited needs which should be defined and addressed and overall affordability which has a limit Reducing federal Medicare spending would improve future levels of government saving but the ultimate effect on national saving depends on how the private sector responds to the reductions Key Issues In light of the virtual disappearance of personal saving concerns about U S reliance on borrowing from abroad to finance domestic investment and the looming fiscal pressures of an aging population federal decisionmakers must consider how much of the anticipated budget surpluses to save spend or use for tax reductions Economic growth will help society bear the burden of financing Social Security and Medicare but it alone will not solve our long term fiscal challenge To participate in the debate over how to reform Social Security and Medicare the public needs to understand the difficult choices the nation faces Section 1 Personal Saving and Retirement Security Q1 1 What is the Personal Saving Rate and What Does it Mean A1 1 The personal saving rate is the most widely cited statistic about how much households save but most people do not know what the rate measures or what it means First it is necessary to distinguish saving from savings In everyday terms saving means spending less than your income and savings are the assets accumulated over time To better distinguish between these concepts in this report the term saving means the money set aside from current income for future consumption i e how much of each period s income is saved rather than spent The terms assets accumulated and wealth are used for the cumulative stock of resources built over time what people commonly think of as savings The personal saving rate as measured in the National Income and Product Accounts NIPA 1 reflects how much American households are setting aside from current income Under NIPA personal saving is what is left over from personal income after taxes and personal spending for goods and services Disposable personal income is the income available for personal spending and saving after federal state and local taxes as well as Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes are paid The NIPA personal saving rate is calculated as the ratio of personal saving to disposable personal income To understand what the personal saving rate means it is helpful to understand the NIPA definitions of persons personal income and personal spending For NIPA purposes persons include not only individuals but also nonprofit institutions primarily serving individuals pension funds and private trust funds NIPA personal income includes wages and salaries interest and dividend income rental income 2 proprietors income government transfer payments such as Social Security veterans and unemployment benefits and employer contributions to pension plans as well as group health and life insurance plans Contributions to traditional defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans such as 401 k plans together with pension 1The national income and product accounts NIPA are the comprehensive set of accounts that show the composition of production and the distribution of incomes earned in production NIPA data reflect production in the United States as well as U S transactions with the rest of the world NIPA data are prepared by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Department of Commerce For more information see Eugene P Seskin and Robert P Parker A Guide to the NIPA s Survey of Current Business Vol 78 No 3 March 1998 pp 26 68 2NIPA treats the net rental value on owner occupied housing as personal income funds interest and dividend income represent an important component of NIPA personal income and saving 3 Benefits paid by pension plans are not a component of NIPA personal income although pension benefits represent an important means for many retirees to finance consumption see Q1 8 NIPA personal spending includes for example food clothing rent utilities and medical care consumer interest payments and consumer durables such as cars and major appliances 4 Strange as it may seem to the average household changes in the value of existing assets such as stocks bonds or real estate do not contribute to NIPA personal income and saving That is because capital gains reflect a revaluation of the nation s existing capital stock and do not provide resources for financing investment that adds to the capital stock Under the current NIPA methodology realized gains do not count as personal income but any taxes paid on such gains reduce disposable personal income and thus personal saving Although the NIPA personal saving rate is the measure most frequently cited by analysts and the media an alternative macroeconomic measure of personal saving is available from the Federal Reserve s Flow of Funds Accounts FFA 5 Whereas NIPA measures saving as what is left over from personal income after taxes and personal spending FFA measures saving as the net increase in households financial and tangible assets less the net increase in households liabilities Both the NIPA and FFA measures count household purchases of houses as saving The FFA personal saving rate also counts household purchases of consumer durables as saving and thus is somewhat higher than the NIPA personal saving rate Both the NIPA and FFA macroeconomic measures focus on saving from the economy s current production and do not include changes in the market value of households existing portfolios In this report we use the NIPA measure of 3A defined benefit pension plan generally provides benefits based on a specific formula linked to the worker s earnings and tenure Typically a defined benefit plan is funded completely by the employer who bears the investment risk of such as arrangement Under a defined contribution plan a percentage of pay is contributed by the employer to an account for each worker with the worker bearing the investment risk The increasingly popular 401 k plans also allow contributions by workers 4This refers to spending by persons in NIPA and not just by individuals 5The Flow of Funds Accounts FFA measure the acquisition of physical and financial assets throughout the U S economy and the sources of funds used to acquire the assets For more information see Guide to the Flow of Funds Accounts Vol 1 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 2000 Q1 2 Why Measure Personal Saving personal saving because it more closely represents the resources available from households for the nation s capital formation For the economy as a whole the personal saving rate provides a measure of how much households are saving compared to current disposable personal income A positive saving rate means that American households in aggregate are saving A low personal saving rate means that households in aggregate are spending virtually all of their current income A negative personal saving rate means that in aggregate American households are spending more than their current income or dissaving Given that the personal saving rate is an aggregate measure some individuals might be saving a lot even while others are drawing down past saving selling existing assets or borrowing to finance their current consumption A1 2 For the economy as a whole personal saving can be a vital source of the nation s saving available to finance private and government investment NIPA personal saving is widely recognized by economists as the key measure of the resources that households contribute to national saving A low personal saving rate unless offset by relatively higher saving by businesses and or government or by borrowing from abroad limits how much the nation can invest and so ultimately limits future economic growth A low personal saving rate can raise questions about whether current generations are setting aside enough to sustain the nation s productive capacity especially if the other components of national saving are not correspondingly higher Some analysts are concerned that the demand for household consumption is in part fueling the U S trade deficit Section 2 discusses the trend and the components of national saving and section 3 explains how saving affects long term economic growth and living standards The personal saving rate also has implications for Americans ability to sustain their current rate of spending Personal spending represents about two thirds of the U S economy A low personal saving rate raises questions about whether Americans have adequate resources to withstand a financial emergency such as unemployment in the event of an economic downturn In addition many policymakers and analysts have questioned whether American households are saving enough to ensure their retirement security Having said this it is important to recognize that macroeconomic measures such as the NIPA personal saving rate do not provide a complete picture of Q1 3 How Has the Personal Saving Rate Changed Over Time the finances of individual households A household s capacity to consume depends on both its current income and its wealth One way to measure households wealth is net worth or the difference between households assets and their liabilities 6 The change in households net worth is broader than the NIPA or FFA measures of personal saving and includes both the flow of saving from current income plus any increase or decrease in the market value of existing assets such as houses and stocks For the economy as a whole however the change in households net worth due to revaluation of households existing assets does not represent resources available to invest in the nation s capital stock 7 A1 3 Figure 1 1 shows the personal saving rate expressed as a percentage of disposable personal income over the past 4 decades The personal saving rate averaged 8 3 percent over the 1960s and increased to an average of 9 6 percent over the 1970s Within each of those 2 decades annual saving rates were relatively steady although they ranged from a low of 7 2 in 1960 to a high of 10 7 percent in 1974 Over the 1980s the personal saving rate was slightly lower than in the 1970s After peaking at 10 9 percent in 1982 the rate generally declined over the 1980s dropping as low as to 7 3 percent in 1987 for the decade the rate averaged 9 1 percent The personal saving rate rebounded from 1987 to 1992 when it reached 8 7 percent Since then the personal saving rate has steadily declined and averaged only 5 9 percent over the 1990s In the late 1990s the personal saving rate dropped below the postwar low of 4 7 percent in 1947 In 1999 the personal saving rate plunged to 2 2 percent an annual rate not seen since the Great Depression As shown in figure 1 1 the personal saving rate in 2000 was estimated to be 0 1 percent 8 With the personal saving rate around zero or negative economists have questioned how to interpret the decline see question 1 7 6Households aggregate net worth is available from the Flow of Funds Accounts balance sheet for the household sector 7For further discussion of whether revaluation of existing assets counts as saving see questions 1 7 and 2 4 8The last time the personal saving rate was negative was in 1932 0 8 percent and 1933 1 5 percent Page 21 GAO 01 591SP National Saving Q1 4 Why Do People Save Figure 1 1 Personal Saving Rate 1960 2000 Percent

saving less let s start with the question of what motivates people to save People save for a variety of reasons such as buying a house taking a vacation providing a college education for their children or preparing for their own retirement They may also save for general reasons such as for a rainy day or to leave money to their heirs People with seemingly identical family and income situations may make different saving choices some may save a great deal while others save little if anything Economists and other analysts use several theories in analyzing how individuals and households decide how much of their current income to save for the future The standard theory for explaining personal saving is the life cycle model 9 The basic hypothesis is that people save and accumulate assets to smooth out their consumption and standard of living over their lifetimes 9A complementary theory of personal saving is the permanent income hypothesis Generally people save a greater share of income when their annual income is higher than their expected long run permanent income and save a smaller share when their income is lower than the expected long run level Page 22 GAO 01 591SP National Saving Young people entering the workforce anticipating that their incomes will increase over their careers save little and may borrow to finance current spending Workers in their peak earning years save to repay past borrowing and to accumulate assets for retirement The life cycle model predicts that saving is hump shaped by age so that wealth accumulation peaks just before retirement Upon leaving the workforce the elderly run down their wealth or dissave In saving for retirement individuals theoretically take into account not only their expected retirement age and the number of years they expect to live in retirement but also project their expected income real returns on assets accumulated and inflation over their lifetime Although providing for retirement is a powerful motive for saving the life cycle model in its simplest form cannot fully explain how people decide to save Faced with the difficulty of reconciling the standard life cycle model with available empirical data economists have examined other motives that may help explain saving behavior While some evidence supports each motive economists do not have a unified theory that fully explains how people choose to save 10 In general the other major incentives or reasons why people save are categorized as follows Precautionary saving motive This is saving to protect against unexpected expenses or possible emergencies such as unemployment or illness In particular individuals who face greater uncertainty about their income and those who are risk averse may tend to save more for a rainy day Precautionary saving may be over and above basic life cycle saving for retirement Some people may choose to save enough to maintain a buffer stock or contingency reserve during their early working years and defer retirement saving until their 40s or 50s 11 Bequest saving motive This is saving beyond basic life cycle saving for retirement Some people may choose to save more in order to bequeath the accumulated wealth to future generations The desire to leave a bequest may explain why the elderly do not fully deplete their wealth and some even continue to save during retirement To some 10For a comprehensive review of personal saving literature see Martin Browning and Annamaria Lusardi Household Saving Micro Theories and Micro Facts Journal of Economic Literature

591SP National Saving extent bequests may be unplanned and thus reflect unspent retirement and precautionary saving Big ticket saving motive This is relatively short term saving to accommodate a mismatch between current income and expenses during the life cycle Some people save to pay for big ticket items such as cars other consumer durables or vacations Some must save in advance because they cannot borrow while others may prefer to save and avoid borrowing Another big ticket is the down payment to buy a home households largely borrow to buy homes and later save by repaying their mortgages Paying for postsecondary education is a big ticket above and beyond life cycle saving for retirement Given that people save for different purposes increasing the rate of return on saving does not necessarily motivate people to save more A higher rate of return has two opposing effects on personal saving On the one hand a higher rate of return may encourage people to save more because future spending becomes less costly relative to spending today the substitution effect On the other hand given a higher rate of return people need to save less now to finance a given level of future consumption This reduced incentive to save as real rates of return increase is called the income effect 12 How people react to an increase in the rate of return depends not only on their preferences about spending today versus spending in the future but also on the real after tax rate of return that is the rate expected after taking into account inflation and taxes 13 Not everyone behaves like a life cycle saver Many people plan over shorter horizons a few years or even paycheck to paycheck Instead of trying to forecast lifetime income and economic conditions in the distant future people may use simple rules of thumb such as saving a fixed share of their income or avoiding debt 14 Many people are target savers who aim for a fixed level of wealth or ratio of wealth to income in order to achieve 12Textbooks in microeconomics discuss these effects in detail For a brief summary of substitution and income effects see N Gregory Mankiw Macroeconomics 4th Edition New York N Y Worth Publishers 2000 pp 446 447 13See section 4 for a discussion of federal tax incentives for personal saving 14People can save for retirement using rules of thumb such as saving a fixed percentage of income in an employer sponsored retirement saving plan or saving 2 000 each year in an individual retirement account IRA Q1 5 Why Has the Personal Saving Rate Declined specific goals such as retirement college education a new car or a vacation Once target savers reach their wealth target they may feel no need to save more Individuals may use mental accounts and even separate bank accounts to earmark the money saved for different uses To ensure saving discipline people may use contractual or automatic mechanisms such as payroll deductions to save A mortgage is a key form of contractual saving in which the homeowner s commitment to repay the principal borrowed compels future saving Even though economists have various theories to explain why people choose to save some people do not save at all 15 Low income and even some moderate income households may feel that they are unable to save Others may be unwilling to save Some people may be impatient and they may discount the future so heavily that retirement saving seems irrelevant compared to current spending A1 5 No one is sure why the personal saving rate has declined Despite a great deal of study economists have found no single reason that convincingly explains the decline Instead research points to a combination of factors that influence the personal saving rate These include but are not limited to demographics government programs for the elderly credit availability and expectations about future income and wealth 16 Demographics Under the basic life cycle model one would expect that an increase in the elderly as a percentage of the total population would reduce the aggregate saving rate However empirical research has found that saving has declined across most age groups There is no 15For more

saving Jonathan Parker in Spendthrift in America On Two Decades of Decline in the U S Saving Rate Working Paper No 7238 Cambridge MA National Bureau of Economic Research July 1999 examined seven possible explanations for the decline consensus that the aging of the U S population caused the decline in the personal saving rate Programs for the elderly Medicare and Social Security affect people s incentives to save for their old age 17 Medicare may reduce the elderly s perceived needs for precautionary saving to cover medical expenses Social Security can have opposing effects on personal saving 18 On the one hand Social Security benefits reduce the amount people need to save on their own for retirement On the other hand Social Security may induce personal saving by encouraging workers to save for earlier retirement the retirement effect In a sense Social Security makes retirement an attainable goal and thus can prompt individuals to plan for retirement People may save more than they would have otherwise to supplement their Social Security benefits with additional retirement income or because they want to retire before they are eligible for Social Security and Medicare benefits Nevertheless some evidence suggests that the existence of Social Security may have reduced personal saving and numerous studies have attempted to estimate the saving offset 19 However given that Social Security was established in 1935 and Medicare in 1965 it seems unlikely that these programs were major contributors to the decline in the personal saving rate over the 1980s and 1990s Credit availability Improved access to credit reduces the need to save before big ticket purchases Over the last 20 years credit cards have become widely available and a smaller down payment is needed to buy a house Easier access to credit may have contributed somewhat to the saving decline The ability to borrow together with a rise in the number of two earner families may have reduced the perceived need for precautionary saving 17Means tested government programs such as Medicaid also may affect the incentive to save For example requirements specifying low levels of financial assets in order to qualify for government benefits may discourage personal saving 18Employer sponsored pension plans also affect individuals incentives to save for retirement on their own As noted above employer pension contributions as well as pension funds interest and dividend income are part of NIPA personal income and saving 19For more on Social Security see Congressional Budget Office Memorandum Social Security and Private Saving A Review of the Empirical Evidence July 1998 Q1 6 What Is the Relationship Between Personal Saving and Wealth Expectations about future income and wealth People decide how much to save based not only on their current income but also on their expectations about their future lifetime income and wealth Since March 1991 the United States has enjoyed its longest postwar economic expansion unemployment and inflation have remained relatively low and stable and the stock market has achieved record highs Over the 1990s the booming economy and stock market may have lulled people into a sense of complacency that good times were here to stay People may have saved less because they were confident about future income prospects and households were wealthier because of gains on their existing assets As discussed below in question 1 6 increased household wealth in recent years appears to have contributed to the plunge in the personal saving rate over the late 1990s A1 6 That Americans save little but households are wealthier is a paradox that can be confusing It is widely known that saving from current income is the way to accumulate assets and repay past borrowing thus increasing net worth The flow of saving is essential to accumulating a stock of wealth as a general rule someone who never saves will have no wealth 20 Conversely dissaving spending more than current income reduces the stock of wealth because amounts saved in the past must be drawn down existing assets sold or borrowing increased Not only does saving affect the stock of wealth but wealth in turn influences the choice to save Under the life cycle model people save to accumulate assets to finance future consumption and attaining their wealth to income target depends in part on the rate of return anticipated Assets accumulated can generate income in the form of interest and dividends that in turn may be saved Moreover the change in net worth not only includes the saving flow from current income but also reflects changes in the market value of assets accumulated by households Economists generally agree that saving and wealth are inversely related increased wealth increases an individual s ability to consume in the future and thus reduces the incentive to save from current income In other words when households existing assets increase in value people can save less from current income and still achieve their wealth income target If households existing assets lose value people have to save more to attain their wealth income target While the idea of wealth 20A nonsaver could get lucky and receive an inheritance or win the lottery targets may seem abstract to the average household increased wealth clearly influences personal saving through traditional defined benefit pension plans For example gains on existing assets reduce the amount of an employer s contribution necessary to fund its pension liability Figure 1 2 shows that even as the personal saving rate has fallen the ratio of aggregate household net worth to disposable personal income the wealth income ratio has risen in recent years Over most of the last 4 decades households wealth income ratio did not fluctuate widely from year to year Over the 1960s through the mid 1990s households aggregate wealth ranged from a high of 5 3 times households disposable income in 1961 and 1996 to a low of 4 3 in 1974 Since 1996 households wealthincome ratio has increased rapidly peaking at 6 4 in 1999 Although the surge in household wealth contributed to the plunge in the personal saving rate in recent years economists agree that increased wealth does not fully explain the timing or magnitude of the decline over the 1980s and 1990s Personal saving percent of Household wealth to disposable disposable personal income personal income ratio 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 Personal saving rate Household wealth to income ratio Source Bureau of Economic Analysis Department of Commerce and GAO analysis of Flow of Funds Accounts data from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors Over the 1990s aggregate household net worth doubled in nominal terms Moreover the mix of assets held by American households has changed dramatically Traditionally real estate has represented households largest asset while the total value of households real estate holdings grew by 50 percent over the 1990s real estate steadily declined as a share of households total assets from 31 percent in 1990 to 23 percent in 1999 Meanwhile the total value of households stock holdings grew more than fourfold over the 1990s and stocks as a share of households total assets increased from 10 percent in 1990 to 28 percent in 1999 21 As figure 1 2 shows household wealth accumulation has swelled relative to disposable personal income even as the flow of saving from current income has dwindled Recent research estimated that the growth in households aggregate net worth over the 1960s and during the early 1990s was roughly equally divided between traditional saving and the increase in the nominal value of existing assets Over the 1970s and 1980s the increase in the nominal value of existing assets was estimated to be about twice as large as the flow from saving 22 In recent years nominal gains on households assets particularly financial assets have dwarfed the saving flow For example in 1999 even though personal saving was less than 150 billion households wealth still grew by 5 2 trillion 14 percent As Americans learned in 2000 when the stock market declined from its peak value what goes up can come down Aggregate household wealth in 2000 declined for the first time since data were available in 1945 According to the latest estimates personal saving in 2000 was 8 5 billion but households wealth declined by nearly 842 billion 2 percent largely as a result of the drop in the market value of households stock holdings The total value of households stock holdings declined by nearly 18 percent in 2000 and stocks as a share of households total assets declined to less than 24 percent Households wealth income ratio dropped from its 1999 peak of 6 4 to 5 9 in 2000 but remains relatively high compared to the 1960s through the mid 1990s The basic life cycle model of saving holds that people are trying to smooth their standard of living over their lifetime Therefore life cycle savers 21Households hold stocks directly as well as indirectly through mutual funds pension funds life insurers and trusts 22William G Gale and John Sabelhaus Perspectives on the Household Saving Rate Brookings Papers on Economic Activity 1 1999 pp 181 224 Page 29 GAO 01 591SP National Saving would not treat gains on existing assets as a windfall to spend today The theory predicts that anticipated wealth changes would not affect planned lifetime spending Likewise changes in wealth perceived to be temporary due to fluctuating market values of assets would not affect planned spending However people can respond to an unexpected increase in wealth that they think will be permanent by spending more of their current income This change in spending in response to a change in wealth is called the wealth effect Some people may tap their wealth by selling stocks or borrowing against their home equity to boost current consumption The wealth effect can also work in the opposite direction A dramatic drop in household wealth for example due to an extended downturn in the stock market could eventually dampen household consumption and lead to an increase in saving The increase in spending at any one time due to the wealth effect would be expected to be small given a life cycle saver s tendency to spread consumption of a significant change in wealth over time Researchers estimate that each dollar in increased wealth increases consumption by a few cents Estimates of the wealth effect range from 1 to 7 cents and the typical estimate is about 3 to 4 cents A recent study estimated that a wealth effect of 3 to 4 cents could explain two fifths to about half of the decline in the personal saving rate since 1988 23 23Annamaria Lusardi Jonathan Skinner and Steven Venti Saving Puzzles and Saving Policies in the United States Working Paper No 8237 Cambridge MA National Bureau of Economic Research April 2001 Page 30 GAO 01 591SP National Saving Q1 7 If Household Wealth Has Increased Does It Matter if the Personal Saving Rate Has Declined A1 7 With the personal saving rate around zero or negative economists have questioned the relevance of the NIPA personal saving measure 24 Wealth measures which reflect the value of existing assets based on current market conditions show a fundamentally different trend as illustrated in figure 1 2 25 Although these supplementary measures may explain why individual households may choose to save less the NIPA personal saving rate shows that people are consuming virtually all of their current income and saving little for the future In evaluating the level of personal saving it is important to distinguish between saving as a source to finance the nation s capital formation and saving as a way for individual households to finance future consumption A key difference between measuring the nation s saving and gauging a household s finances is the treatment of changes in the market value of existing assets As discussed in section 2 it is saving from current income not gains on existing assets that is key to financing capital investment and increasing the nation s capacity to produce goods and services Although an individual household can tap the increased value of its assets to finance additional consumption or accumulate other assets by selling an asset to another household the transaction itself shifts ownership of the existing asset and does not generate new economic output Thus the nation as a whole may not be able to consume and invest more 26 Moreover all households may not be able to simultaneously tap their apparent wealth to finance consumption because large scale asset sales could tend to depress market values 24To some extent spending wealth like spending income drives down the reported personal saving rate As discussed in Q1 1 realized gains do not count as personal income but any taxes paid on such gains reduce disposable personal income and thus saving If households then spend a portion of their realized gains this spending further reduces the saving residual and the saving rate 25For alternative measures including changes in the market value of households existing assets see William G Gale and John Sabelhaus Perspectives on the Household Saving Rate Brookings Papers on Economic Activity 1 1999 pp 181 224 and Richard Peach and Charles Steindel A Nation of Spendthrifts An Analysis of Trends in Personal and Gross Saving Current Issues in Economics and Finance Vol 6 No 10 September 2000 26However the sale of assets to foreigners can affect the nation s ability to consume and invest Although the personal saving rate is low economists do not agree on whether this is a problem or whether private saving is inadequate to finance domestic investment On the one hand some economists are concerned that low personal saving is undercutting national saving and leaving the United States more dependent on foreign capital inflows to maintain domestic investment 27 On the other hand other economists have observed that strong consumer spending boosted by low saving and the wealth effect discussed above has fueled the surge in business investment and strong economic growth in the U S economy in recent years Some economists and analysts are concerned that individual households are living beyond their means and some may have been counting on continued high gains on their assets to finance future consumption If such expectations are not realized and for example there is a sustained stock market downturn or an economic downturn households may have to scale back their consumption This in turn could potentially slow economic growth given that household spending represents about two thirds of the U S economy However some researchers suggest that the risk of a collapse in household spending that would hurt overall economic growth is exaggerated because households have greater resources than the personal saving rate suggests 28 Although the aggregate wealth income ratio rose in recent years wealth is fairly concentrated and not all households have experienced gains in the stock market To gauge the financial situation of individual households requires going beyond aggregate household data The Survey of Consumer Finances provides detailed data on family net worth and holdings of assets and liabilities 29 Figure 1 3 shows that many households have accumulated little if any net worth As one might expect high income families typically have accumulated more net worth than low income families 27See

GAO 01 591SP National Saving Q1 8 How Do Social Security and Personal Saving Compare as Sources of Retirement Income even have a checking account These households might be seen as outside the financial mainstream and thus unlikely to be saving The key to accumulating wealth for retirement is simply the choice to save although investment choices also matter Some workers choose to save over their working lives for retirement while others choose to save little and spend more while working Recent research found that even households with similar lifetime earnings approach retirement with vastly different levels of wealth 31 Even though many low income households have accumulated no wealth as they approach retirement the researchers found that some low income households had managed to accumulate fairly sizeable wealth Moreover the researchers found that a significant portion of higher income households save little Choices about whether to invest for example in the stock market or in less risky lower yielding assets such as a bank saving account also make a difference Regardless of income level those households that do not save much will have few assets on which to enjoy gains A1 8 Traditionally retirement income was characterized as a three legged stool comprising Social Security employer pensions and individuals own saving for retirement In 1998 Social Security benefits contributed 38 percent of the elderly s cash income As figure 1 4 shows saving both through employer sponsored pension plans and by individuals on their own behalf provides a significant part of retirement income Pension benefits accounted for 19 percent of the elderly s cash income in 1998 and income from individuals accumulated assets for another 20 percent In addition the elderly and their spouses may supplement their retirement income by continuing to work As shown in figure 1 4 earnings from continued employment represent a fourth leg on the retirement income stool 31Steven F Venti

reflected Source GAO analysis of data from Social Security Administration Income of the Population 55 or Older 1998 March 2000 Currently many financial planners advise people that they will need to replace about 70 to 80 percent of their pre retirement income to maintain their pre retirement living standard 32 According to the Social Security Administration Social Security benefits currently replace about 39 percent of pre retirement income for a worker with average wages 32 105 in 2000 Given Social Security s progressive benefit formula however the replacement rate varies by income Social Security currently replaces about 53 percent for low earners and about 24 percent for those who earned the taxable maximum 72 600 in 2000 33 While Social Security provides a foundation for retirement income pensions income from accumulated assets and current earnings largely determine which households will have the highest retirement incomes as figure 1 5 shows Social Security makes up over 80 percent of the retirement income for the first lowest and second income quintiles For the third and fourth quintiles Social Security still serves as the most important source of retirement income For the highest quintile pensions are a more significant income source than Social Security but pensions represent a smaller share for this group than either income from accumulated assets or earnings It is important to note that these data reflect in part the fact that pensions are not a universal source of retirement income as is Social Security In 1998 about 48 percent of retirees lacked pension income or annuities and about 53 percent of those employed lacked a pension plan 34 32The replacement rate can be calculated as a simple percentage of pretax income Or the replacement rate considered to be adequate can be computed in a more sophisticated way netting out Social Security taxes other taxes or working expenses that will not be paid in retirement Thus desired or target replacement rates can vary significantly depending on income level and other factors 33These replacement rates are based on applying Social Security benefit rules to hypothetical retired workers age 65 in 2001 who had steady earning levels over their careers The average earner represents a worker who earned the average of covered workers under Social Security each year The low earner earned 45 percent of this average The maximum earner had earnings equal to the maximum taxable amount each year 34Pension Plans Characteristics of Persons in the Labor Force Without Pension Coverage GAO HEHS 00

1997 nearly 63 percent of workers between the ages of 25 and 64 replied that they did not own a retirement saving account such as an employer sponsored 401 k or an individual retirement account IRA 35 According to the 2001 Retirement Confidence Survey 36 about 46 percent of American workers have not tried to calculate how much they need to save for retirement The survey also found that many people particularly those planning to work the longest underestimate how long they will live in retirement Half of men reaching age 65 can expect to be alive at age 82 and half of women reaching age 65 can expect to be alive at age 86 some will live to age 100 and older Yet 15 percent of those surveyed expect their retirement will last for 10 years or less and another 11 percent believe their retirement will last less than 20 years In addition many workers are unaware that the retirement age for full Social Security benefits is gradually rising from age 65 to 67 Researchers do not agree on whether baby boomers and other workers are saving enough for their retirement 37 Research suggests that individuals who are not financially literate tend to save less Many people do not appreciate that saving even small amounts over time is the way to accumulate wealth According to a 1999 opinion survey low and moderate income Americans mistakenly believe they have a better chance of accumulating 500 000 through winning the lottery than through saving and investing a portion of their income 38 One reason for this mistaken notion is that most Americans dramatically underestimate 35Patrick J Purcell

saved can grow over time 39 People might begin to save more if they were aware how much they need for retirement and that saving regularly over time is the key to preserving their future standard of living A1 9 As we have reported the United States faces a demographic tidal wave in the future that poses significant challenges for Social Security Medicare and our economy as a whole 40 More people are living longer and they will need more resources to finance more years of retirement The U S elderly population those aged 65 and over is growing and accounts for an increasing share of the total population see figure 1 6 As a share of the total population the elderly population has grown from 9 1 percent to 12 4 percent over the last 4 decades Over the next 75 years the elderly population share will nearly double to 22 5 percent according to the Social Security Trustees intermediate actuarial projections 41 Although the babyboom generation will contribute heavily to the growth of the elderly population increasing life expectancy and declining fertility rates are also responsible for the aging of the U S population 42 39Compounding can be explained in terms of the rule of 72 To find out how fast an amount saved can double divide the interest rate into 72 For example at an interest rate of 5 percent 100 saved would double to 200 in about 14 years At a rate of 8 percent it

Social Security trust fund for example affects federal government saving and national saving Page 45 GAO 01 591SP National Saving workers are not confident that Social Security 65 percent and Medicare 57 percent will continue to provide benefits equivalent to those received today Anticipating potential benefit cuts people could save more now to supplement their future retirement income and to cushion against future health care costs or they could choose to work longer and delay retirement Alternatively they might not save more or work longer and they would experience a lower standard of living in retirement For the nation personal saving provides resources vital to enhancing the nation s productive capacity Saving more today in turn can improve the outlook for Social Security and Medicare As discussed in section 3 higher saving and investment can boost worker productivity and lead to greater economic growth A larger economy would mean higher real wages for future workers and in turn more payroll taxes to finance Social Security and Medicare With an aging population and a slowly growing workforce increasing the nation s future economic capacity is critical to ensuring retirement security in the 21st century Section 2 National Saving Overview Q2 1 What Is National Saving and How Is It Measured A2 1 Just as for people saving for the national economy is the act of setting some of current income aside for the future instead of spending it for current consumption In NIPA saving is measured as current income less current consumption expenditures National saving is the sum of saving by households businesses and all levels of government federal state and local For the economy as a whole national saving is the portion of the nation s income not used for private and public consumption The sum of national saving and saving borrowed from abroad represents the total amount of resources available for investment that is the purchase of capital goods plant equipment software houses 1 and inventories by businesses and governments 2 Saving and investing today increase the nation s stock of capital goods to be used in the future the capital stock and thus the nation s capacity to produce goods and services in the future National saving is measured in two ways gross national saving or net national saving Gross national saving is a nation s total income minus its consumption and represents resources available for domestic or foreign investment Some portion of gross national saving pays for replacing capital goods that have been worn out or used up in producing goods and services consumption of fixed capital in technical terms or hereafter simply depreciation 3 The other portion of gross national saving which is used to add to the nation s stock of capital goods is net national saving Net national saving is the measure commonly used to gauge whether the nation s capacity to produce goods and services in the future is increasing or decreasing By itself the dollar amount of national saving is not a particularly meaningful indicator of the portion of the nation s income that is not consumed National saving is usually expressed as a share of the nation s 1Investment in owner occupied residential property is defined as business investment 2This represents the current NIPA definition of investment used throughout this primer unless otherwise stated Other ways of thinking about national saving and investment are discussed in Q2 4 and in sections 3 and 4 3For more information on how depreciation is measured in NIPA see Arnold Katz and Shelby Herman Improved Estimates of Fixed Reproducible Tangible Wealth 1929 95 Survey of Current Business Bureau of Economic Analysis Vol 77 No 5 May 1997 pp 69 92 and Barbara M Fraumeni The Measurement of Depreciation in the U S National Income and Product Accounts Survey of Current Business Bureau of Economic Analysis Vol 77 No 7 July 1997 pp 7 23 current income or its economic output 4 Because the primary measure of the nation s economic output is gross domestic product GDP saving is often shown as a percent of GDP Text box 2 1 compares GDP to another measure of economic output gross national product GNP In 2000 gross national saving as a share of GDP was 18 3 percent After subtracting depreciation which was 12 6 percent of GDP net national saving was 5 7 percent of GDP Text Box 2 1 Gross Domestic Product and Gross National Producta GDP is the output of goods and services produced by labor and property located in the United States while GNP is the output of goods and services produced by labor and property supplied by U S residents regardless of where they are located The difference between GDP and GNP is income receipts from the goods and services produced abroad using labor and capital of U S residents less income payments for the goods and services produced in the United States using labor and capital supplied by foreign residents Because both GNP and national saving include these income receipts net of payments the Bureau of Economic Analysis BEA presents national saving as a share of GNP However since 1991 BEA has featured GDP as the primary measure of economic activity because GDP is consistent in coverage with indicators such as domestic investment and productivity GDP is also the measure cited in economic trend analyses and for cross country comparisons by many including the President s Council of Economic Advisers the International Monetary Fund and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD Because this report deals not only with national saving but also with other measures such as investment and the federal budget position we express saving investment and federal government spending as a share of GDP Expressing all of our analysis as a share of GDP provides a consistent frame of reference for comparing economywide shares for the United States and for comparing U S saving rates to those of other countries In the United States the difference between GDP and GNP is small For example in 2000 GDP was 9 963 billion and GNP was 9 959 billion b Given the relatively small difference between the two measures the denominator has little effect on calculating saving as a share of the economy Regardless of which measure is used saving as a share of the U S economy was 18 3 percent in 2000 a Gross Domestic Product as a Measure of U S Production Survey of Current Business Bureau of Economic Analysis Vol 71 No 8 August 1991 p 8 bIn 2000 GNP was less than GDP because income receipts from the rest of the world were less than U S payments to the rest of the world 4The nation s income is the sum of all the payments made to those who produce output This income equals the total spending on the economy s output of goods and services thus the nation s income and output are the same Page 48 GAO 01 591SP National Saving Q2 2 How Has U S National Saving Changed Over Time Both Overall and by Component Gross national saving is a good indicator of resources available both to 1 replace old worn out capital goods with new and sometimes more productive goods and 2 expand the capital stock 5 The share of gross national saving used to replace depreciated capital has increased over the past 40 years This increase in depreciation reflects a shift in the capital stock s composition from long lived assets with relatively low depreciation rates like steel mills to shorter lived assets such as computers and software Even if gross national saving were only sufficient to replace depreciated capital the economy could grow to some extent because replacing worn out and used capital with new equipment tends to bring improved technology into the production process Nevertheless national saving beyond the amount necessary to replace depreciated capital goods is important for increasing the overall size of the capital stock and the nation s future productive capacity A2 2 As figure 2 1 shows gross national saving rebounded from a low of 15 6 percent of GDP during the saving slump of the early 1990s to 18 3 percent in 2000 This rebound is due primarily to increased government saving that has more than made up for the decline in personal saving described in section 1 However despite this rebound national saving as a share of GDP is still below the level of the 1960s an era characterized by high saving and rapid growth in productivity and living standards defined in terms of GDP per capita Since the 1960s depreciation as a share of GDP has increased slightly see Q2 1 and net national saving as a share of GDP has declined more than gross national saving Net national saving rose from 3 4 percent of GDP in 1993 to 5 7 percent in 2000 but remains well below the 1960s average of 10 9 percent 5As discussed in section 3 a nation can use some of its saving to invest abroad and can also borrow from abroad to finance domestic investment Page 49 GAO 01 591SP National

Figure 2 2 breaks net national saving down into components It shows both the aggregate trend and how saving by households businesses and governments affected net national saving As discussed in section 1 personal saving is the amount of aggregate disposable personal income left over after personal spending on goods and services 6 Personal saving averaged 5 7 percent of GDP in the 1960s and increased to an average of almost 7 percent over the 1970s and 1980s Since the early 1990s however personal saving has steadily declined to 0 1 percent of GDP in 2000 the lowest point in over 65 years 6NIPA personal saving is measured net of depreciation on fixed assets owned by unincorporated businesses and owner occupied residential dwellings Because household purchases of residential dwellings are treated as business investment in NIPA the depreciation on these assets is included in gross business saving Page 50 GAO 01 591SP National Saving 1960 1969 1970 1979 1980 1989 1990 1999 1990 1991

unified budget surplus or deficit there are some conceptual differences Text box 4 1 describes how the NIPA and unified budget concepts differ Source GAO analysis of NIPA data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis Department of Commerce Personal and business saving together make up the nation s private saving Business saving reflects the earnings retained by businesses after paying taxes and dividends These retained earnings are available to finance investment For business saving it is important to distinguish between net and gross saving On a gross basis businesses have been the biggest savers in recent years accounting for over 70 percent of gross national saving in 2000 However given that a large portion of business saving is used to replace capital goods worn out or used in the production process business saving net of depreciation is a smaller share about 47 percent of net national saving As shown in figure 2 2 net business saving has averaged about 3 percent of GDP from 1960 to 2000 Government saving arises when federal state and local government revenue exceeds current expenditures Government saving also called a surplus adds to the pool of national saving available to finance investment and allows a government to reduce its outstanding debt or purchase nongovernment assets Conversely government dissaving or a deficit absorbs funds saved by households and businesses and reduces overall national saving available to finance private investments To finance a deficit a government has to borrow or sell assets it owns State and local government net saving has been relatively small ranging from a surplus of 1 1 percent of GDP in 1973 to a deficit of 0 1 percent in 1991 The federal government s effect on net national saving has varied widely over the past 40 years During most of the 1960s the federal government was a net saver However the federal government ran large deficits through much of the 1980s and early 1990s which reduced the overall level of national saving in the economy Federal deficits averaged 3 4 percent of GDP in the 1980s and reached 4 7 percent in 1992 In 1992 and 1993 federal deficits absorbed more than half of private saving Since 1990 deficit reduction initiatives and economic growth have reduced federal dissaving From 1998 through 2000 the federal government achieved surpluses shifting from being a drain on net national saving to become a contributor to it These surpluses also allowed the federal government to reduce its outstanding debt held by the public 7 Section 4 discusses in more detail how federal fiscal policy affects national saving Despite this recent shift in the federal position net national saving as a share of GDP remains well below the average level of the 1960s largely as a result of the decline in personal saving Traditionally personal saving had been a key source of net national saving available for new investment Whereas personal saving represented one half to three quarters of average 7For more information on debt reduction see Federal Debt Answers to Frequently Asked Questions An Update GAO OCG 99 27 May 28 1999 Federal Debt Debt Management in a Period of Budget Surplus

Compare to Other Major Industrialized Nations net national saving in the 1960s and 1970s personal dissaving absorbed resources that otherwise would have been available for private investment in 2000 8 A2 3 Although gross national saving as a share of GDP in the 1990s was low by U S historical standards U S saving as a share of GDP has generally been lower than other major industrialized countries over the past 40 years Since the 1960s U S gross national saving as a share of GDP has ranked sixth among a group of seven major industrialized countries the G 7 Interestingly as figure 2 3 shows saving as a share of GDP across all of these countries has declined since the 1960s 8When federal dissaving peaked in 1992 personal saving as a share of GDP was nearly double net national saving as a share of GDP In a sense government dissaving consumed much of the personal saving leaving relatively little to finance private investment Page 53 GAO 01 591SP National Saving Percent of GDP 40 35 30

comparisons are shown on a gross saving basis aCovers 1990 1997 Source GAO analysis of data from Standard Poor s DRI OECD National Income Accounts database It is not surprising that national saving varies across countries The increased output resulting from a given level of saving and investment depends on the investment choices available and selected in each country In addition national saving may vary across countries due to differences in the price of capital goods income levels growth rates economic and social policies demographics and even culture For example recent research suggests that capital goods are relatively cheaper in the United States than in other countries which means it takes less saving to buy a given amount Q2 4 What Are Other Ways of Defining Saving and Investment of capital goods in the United States than in other developed countries 9 As noted in section 1 Americans may choose to save less because they have ready access to credit and have been confident about the future of the U S 10 economy As figure 2 3 shows Japan s gross national saving as a share of GDP has consistently ranked the highest among the G 7 countries Japan s high saving rate has been attributed to several factors including less access to consumer credit and cultural factors For example Japanese households face greater borrowing constraints than households in the United States and must save a great deal to purchase a home In addition the Japanese are considered to be more risk averse and forward looking than American 11 consumers A2 4 In the context of long term economic growth the NIPA saving definition is traditionally used to describe resources available to sustain and expand the nation s capital stock Since its creation in the 1930s NIPA definitions and measurement have evolved to better portray the changing U S economy NIPA historically recognized tangible investments and considered other spending to be consumption 12 However software a form of intangible capital has played an increasingly important role in the U S economy Recognizing that software like other investment goods provides a flow of services that lasts more than one year NIPA now counts 9Milka S

in 1996 NIPA reclassified government purchases of plant and equipment as investment software as investment 13 Because saving equals investment in the economy a national income accounting identity reclassifying software as investment not only raised the measure of investment but also raised the measure of gross saving and of the nation s total output Although NIPA measurement has evolved the nation s human capital and knowledge also forms of intangible capital are not part of the NIPA definitions of investment and saving This means that under NIPA business computer purchases count as saving and investment but spending to train workers to use the new computers counts as current consumption rather than investment Many economists agree that spending both on education and on general research and development R D enhances future economic capacity and conceptually should be considered investment Nonetheless broadening the NIPA investment definition to include education and R D would be difficult because there is no consensus on which expenditures should be included or how to measure the depreciation and contribution to output of intangible capital Although counting education and R D as investment would raise the measured level of investment this broader measure of investment has also experienced a downward trend Federal Reserve researchers estimated that as of the early 1990s U S investment including education and R D had declined as a share of GDP since the 1970s 14 A more controversial measure of personal saving would include changes in the value of existing assets 15 Since NIPA focuses on the current production of goods and services and on the income arising from that production NIPA income and saving do not reflect changes in the value of existing tangible and financial assets such as land stocks or bonds As discussed 13This change was among those made in the 11th comprehensive revision of the national accounts in 1999 For more information on the recent NIPA definitional and classificational changes see Brent R Moulton Robert P Parker and Eugene P Seskin A Preview of the 1999 Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts Survey

Division Working Papers 97 020A November 1997 15Whether changes in the market value of existing assets should be counted as saving is beyond the scope of this report For a review of the literature see William G Gale and John Sabelhaus Perspectives on the Household Saving Rate Brookings Papers on Economic Activity 1 1999 pp 181 224 in section 1 economists generally agree that wealth based measures that reflect changes in the value of existing assets are useful for gauging individual households finances and retirement preparations However it is uncertain whether wealth based measures are reliable for gauging the growth in the nation s capital stock and whether revaluation of existing assets should count as saving for society as a whole Some portion of the change in the market value of existing assets may reflect increased productive capacity and thus could represent income and saving but it is difficult to isolate that portion 16 Most gains and losses from transferring assets within and between sectors wash out at the national level and may not represent newly available resources for the economy as a whole 17 For example when one household sells an appreciated asset to another household any gain realized may be used to finance the seller s consumption but the transaction does not increase the nation s income or output Moreover the market value of financial assets is often volatile and may not reflect a real permanent change in the productive potential of the underlying capital assets Lastly some of the increased market value of households stock holdings may stem from the use of businesses retained earnings for investment which is already reflected in NIPA saving and investment 16An asset s market value can change as a result of changes in tax treatment investors perceptions of risk taste or households expectations of future economic capacity arising from for example the introduction of new technology Only the last source however may relate to the asset s productive capacity 17However gains and losses arising from sale of assets to foreigners do not wash out and could affect national consumption and investment Page 57 GAO 01 591SP National Saving Section 3 National Saving and the Economy Q3 1 How Does National Saving Contribute to Investment and Ultimately Economic Growth A3 1 National saving provides the resources for a nation to invest domestically and abroad Domestic investment in new factories and equipment can boost productivity of the nation s workforce Increased worker productivity in turn leads to higher real wages and greater economic growth over the long term U S investment abroad does not add to the domestic capital stock used by U S workers to produce goods and services U S investment abroad does increase the nation s wealth and will generate income adding to U S GNP When national saving is lower than domestic investment a nation can borrow from foreign savers to make up the difference 1 The resulting increase in domestic capital would enhance worker s productivity and wages but the payments to foreign lenders flow abroad In general saving today increases a nation s capacity to produce more goods and services and generate higher income in the future Increased economic capacity and rising incomes will be crucial as the population ages because a relatively smaller workforce will bear the burden of financing Social Security and Medicare while also seeking to maintain its own standard of living Saving entails a tradeoff because it requires consuming less now in exchange for consuming more later While those who sacrifice to save now can themselves enjoy higher consumption in the future some of the resulting increase in the nation s capital stock and the related income will also benefit future generations Thus current saving and investment decisions have profound implications for the level of wellbeing in the future and current generations are in a sense stewards of the economy on behalf of future generations Figure 3 1 is a flow chart illustrating saving s central role in providing resources to invest in the capital needed to produce the nation s goods and services In this simplified depiction of the production process capital and labor are the basic inputs used to produce goods and services The resources used for domestic investment come from saving by households businesses and all levels of government In addition a nation can invest more in domestic capital than it saves by borrowing from other countries 1When foreign investment in a nation exceeds that nation s investment abroad the nation s net foreign investment will be negative Q3 3 discusses the extent to which the United States has supplemented its saving and investment by borrowing from abroad Page 58 GAO 01 591SP National Saving The amount of goods and services produced depends not only on the amount of capital and labor but also on how efficiently these inputs are used This is called total factor productivity Total factor productivity is the portion of output not explained by the use of capital and labor and is generally associated with the level of technology and managerial efficiency 2 Education training and R D also can potentially increase output in this simplified flow chart these would influence total factor 2The Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS publishes an official measure of output per unit of combined labor and capital inputs multifactor productivity BLS measure of labor input not only takes into account changes in the size of the labor force but also changes in its composition as measured by education and work experience Capital inputs are measured in terms of efficiency or service flow rather than price or value For more information on multifactor productivity see Productivity Measure Business Sector and Major Subsectors BLS Handbook of Methods Bureau of Labor Statistics April 1997 pp 89 98 and Edwin R Dean and Michael J Harper The BLS Productivity Measurement Program Bureau of Labor Statistics July 5 2000 paper presented to the NBER Conference on Research in Income and Wealth on New Directions in Productivity Analysis March 20 21 1998 productivity A nation s total output of goods and services or its GDP is a function of the hours worked the capital stock and total factor productivity Adding the net income payments received from the rest of the world which can be negative to GDP yields the gross national income or GNP A portion of the nation s income in turn is saved allowing for additional investment in domestic factories equipment and other forms of capital that workers use to produce more goods and services or for investment abroad Investment in the capital stock is a principal source of growth in labor productivity or output per hour worked 3 Through its influence on real wages labor productivity is the fundamental determinant of a nation s standard of living Minimum levels of investment in a nation s physical and human capital are crucial just to maintain labor productivity and living standards Equipment that wears out must be replaced younger workers entering the labor force need to be trained in skills to replace older workers as they retire Even as the population ages the U S labor force itself will continue growing although slowly with annual growth in aggregate hours worked averaging about 0 1 percent after 20204 and the demand for capital goods is likely to increase Not only must capital goods be replaced as they depreciate but new generations of workers must be comparably 3According to neoclassical growth theory the rate of growth of labor productivity depends on the growth rate in the capital labor ratio weighted by capital s share and the growth rate of total factor productivity See Robert M Solow Technical Change in the Aggregate Production Function Review of Economics and Statistics Vol 39 No 3 1957 cited in Dean and Harper 1998 p 7 4The labor force projection reflects the OASDI Trustees 2001 intermediate assumptions including those for fertility immigration and labor force participation trained and equipped capital widening 5 Otherwise output per worker and living standards may fall Beyond the minimum level of investment needed to maintain the capital stock additional investment to expand the capital stock is an important way to increase labor productivity and thus future living standards With the retired population projected to swell after 2010 investment in new capital is an important way to raise the productivity of the slowly growing labor force Investment boosts labor productivity because workers can produce more per hour when they have more and better equipment and better skills capital deepening The essence of this point can be illustrated with a simple example Consider the transformation of ditch digging from a relatively slow and somewhat imprecise process involving several ordinary shovels much labor effort and low skill levels to a faster and more precise process often involving a single power digger controlled by a skilled operator The elements of this example repeated across millions of individual tasks encapsulates the difference between an advanced industrial economy with a high standard of living and a less developed country with a low standard of living Growth in output per worker also depends on total factor productivity growth A higher rate of technological change and improved efficiency in using labor and capital can boost GDP and thus future living standards Even if there were no net investment that is if gross investment were only enough to replace depreciated capital the economy could grow to some extent because the new capital tends to embody improved technology However there is no agreement on how to raise total factor productivity Spending on education and R D is thought to help because 5While the aging of the population is a commonly voiced argument for raising national saving some analysts maintain that the projected decline in labor force growth will increase the capital labor ratio and reduce the return to capital while raising the productivity of labor They conclude that under some circumstances saving should actually decline slightly in response to population aging Other analysts point out however that if the economy is operating below the optimal saving rate saving can rise without overly depressing market rates of return and therefore provide significant improvement to future incomes In addition saving can be invested abroad without lowering the global rate of return See Douglas W Elmendorf and Louise M Sheiner Should America Save for its Old Age Fiscal Policy Population Aging and National Saving Journal of Economic Perspectives Vol 14 No

Sass and Robert K Triest eds Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Conference Series No 41 June 1997 pp 243274 Q3 2 Has the Relatively Low National Saving Rate Affected Investment and Economic Growth What Factors Have Fostered Economic Growth in Recent Years education and training enhance the knowledge and skills of a nation s work force the nation s human capital and R D can spur technological improvement A legal and institutional environment that facilitates the development and enforcement of contracts and discourages crime and corruption may also contribute to economic growth Thus economic growth depends not only on the amount of saving and investment but also on an educated work force an expanding base of knowledge a continuing infusion of innovations and a sound legal and institutional environment A3 2 Although national saving as a share of GDP remains below the 1960s average annual GDP growth in recent years reached levels similar to the 1960s average of 4 2 percent After slowing to 3 2 percent over the 1970s and 1980s and further to only 2 4 percent in the early 1990s annual GDP growth accelerated to an average of 4 3 percent from 1995 to 2000 This higher growth stemmed in part from the rebound in national saving that was largely attributable to federal deficit reduction The U S was also able to borrow from abroad to help finance domestic investment as discussed further below In addition two domestic investment trends helped promote growth in GDP and living standards 1 the price of investment goods declined relative to other goods and 2 investment in high yielding information technology has risen rapidly Thus even though saving as a share of the economy has been low by historical standards economic growth has been high because more and better investments were made A dollar of saving buys more investment goods now than in the past because the price of investment goods has decreased relative to other goods in recent years From 1995 to 2000 the price index for nonresidential investment goods declined 0 9 percent per year on average while overall prices as measured by the GDP price index rose albeit at a modest annual rate of 1 8 percent The major source of the overall decline in investment good prices was the over 22 percent average annual decline in the price of computers and peripheral equipment since 1995 In other words in each succeeding year a dollar spent on computers purchased 22 percent more computing power on average than it did the previous year 6 6See J Steven Landefeld and Bruce T Grimm A Note on the Impact of Hedonics and Computers on Real GDP Survey of Current Business Bureau of Economic Analysis Vol 80 No 12 December 2000 pp 17 22 Page 62 GAO 01 591SP National Saving Not only has each dollar of saving bought more investment goods in recent years but a greater share of that dollar was invested in information technology including computers software and communications equipment From 1990 to 2000 the share of business fixed investment devoted to information equipment and software rose from less than 28 percent to 39 percent The increasing share of investment going to information processing equipment and software helped boost overall economic growth over the 1990s because information technology has appeared to be highly productive in recent years This is true even though rapid depreciation and obsolescence characterize information technology For example computers and related equipment have an estimated annual depreciation rate of 31 percent 7 and new versions of software applications are released every few years Hence for investment in information technology to be profitable its gross rate of return must be quite high Its high rate of return combined with its increasing share of total investment meant that information technology has been a major contributor to the rapid economic growth since 1995 Indeed recent economic research suggests that investment in information technology explains most of the acceleration in labor productivity growth a major component of overall economic growth since 1995 8 From 1995 to 2000 labor productivity growth averaged 2 8 percent per year compared to 1 6 percent from 1970 to 1995 and 2 9 percent during the 1960s 9 7Fixed Reproducible Tangible Wealth in the United States 1925 94 Bureau of Economic Analysis August 1999 p

and nonmarket activities the most widely used measure of labor productivity growth is the rate of increase in nonfarm business sector output per hour worked Economic research suggests investment in information technology also may have led to faster growth in total factor productivity since 1995 10 As noted earlier total factor productivity growth reflects technological change and new and better ways of organizing production Firms producing computers and semiconductors have achieved substantial operating efficiencies and high rates of return on capital investments in recent years despite a large expansion in their capital stock These high rates of return seem to contradict economists general expectations that increasing the supply of capital reduces its return and thus seems to indicate a rise in total factor productivity Although total factor productivity growth appears to have risen the pace of growth may decelerate Technological advances generally come in waves that crest and eventually subside Abundant saving alone does not always generate robust growth because the saving must also be invested well Japan s economy over the 1990s demonstrated that high saving can coincide with economic stagnation Among the reasons offered for Japan s lengthy slowdown is poor investment choices due in part to its less developed financial markets in which savers had fewer options and were left with low returns Also the government s role both in investing in physical infrastructure and in allocating capital to industrial borrowers at preferential rates also resulted in many low yielding investments Finally with its high postwar investment levels Japan s production processes became more capital intensive compared to most other advanced nations With this greater capital intensity diminishing returns to capital have reduced the return on investment in Japan over the years 11 10However some economists are concerned that the acceleration may be concentrated in durable manufacturing rather than widely disseminated throughout the economy See Robert J Gordon Does the New Economy Measure Up to the Great Inventions of the Past Journal of Economic Perspectives Vol 14 No

United States Supplemented Its Saving and Investment by Borrowing Saving From Abroad How Does Such Borrowing Affect the Economy A3 3 An economy that is not open to international trade and investment must rely solely on its own saving to provide the resources to invest in plant equipment and other forms of capital In contrast citizens companies and governments in an open economy such as the United States can finance the gap between domestic investment and national saving with foreign investment in the United States In essence the U S economy can borrow the saving of other countries to finance more investment than U S national saving would permit Figure 3 2 shows the difference between domestic investment and national saving which is defined in the NIPA as net foreign investment Over most of the 1980s and 1990s the U S was able to invest more than it saved by attracting financing from abroad This means that the United States has been a net borrower of saving from other nations 12In practice measurement errors create some divergence between these balances For a more detailed discussion of the current account balance see Douglas B Weinberg U S International Transactions Third Quarter 2000 Survey of Current Business Bureau of Economic Analysis Vol 81 No 1 January 2001 pp 47 55 Craig Elwell The U S Trade Deficit in 1999 Recent Trends and Policy Options Congressional Research Service May 22 2000 and CBO Memorandum Causes and Consequences of the Trade Deficit An Overview Congressional Budget Office March 2000 When the United States runs a trade deficit foreigners buy less than a dollar s worth of U S goods and services with every dollar they earn on their exports sold to the United States They generally invest those excess dollars in U S assets Their willingness to acquire U S assets i e to lend to the United States allows the United States to run trade deficits In fact U S trade deficits may be as much due to foreigners willingness to acquire U S assets as to the U S desire to acquire foreign goods and services While using foreign investors saving allows U S domestic investment to exceed national saving these financial inflows have implications for the nation s economic growth and for future living standards This effect depends in part on how the borrowed funds are used To the extent that borrowing from abroad finances domestic investment the foreign borrowing adds to the nation s capital stock and boosts productive capacity This augments future income although a portion of the income generated by the investment will be paid to foreign lenders However if the borrowing from abroad is used to finance consumption short term wellbeing is improved but the ability to repay the borrowing in the future will not be enhanced In this respect U S experience in the 1990s differs from that of the 1980s Over the 1980s mounting federal deficits and the decline in personal saving reduced the supply of national saving available for investment Although borrowing from abroad helped finance additional investment consumption rose more than domestic investment during the 1980s In contrast since 1992 there has been an upward trend in U S national saving while domestic investment has surged Borrowing from abroad has allowed the United States to overcome its saving shortfall and take advantage of productive investment opportunities The increased investment has contributed to higher GDP growth in recent years and the stronger economy should help in servicing the debt owed to foreigners Persistent U S current account deficits have translated into a rising level of indebtedness to other countries Figure 3 3 shows the net U S ownership of foreign assets the net international investment position13 and net income receipts on net U

National Saving 1986 Although foreign asset holdings in the United States have swelled in recent years not until 1998 did the United States pay more in interest dividends and other investment returns

United States 14 So far the net payments from the United States to foreign lenders have been small as a share of GDP as shown in figure 3 3 Figure 3 3 Net U S Holdings of Foreign Assets and Net Income

Economists and policymakers are concerned about whether the United States can continue to increase its reliance on foreign capital inflows Investors generally try to achieve some balance in the allocation of their portfolios and U S assets already represent a significant share of foreign portfolios Although the United States accounts for 30 percent of global GDP it received two thirds of the saving exported by countries with current account surpluses in 1999 15 Given this it may not be realistic to expect ever increasing foreign investment in the United States as has been the case in recent years Net foreign investment in the United States might even decrease from the recent high rates if foreign investors find more attractive opportunities elsewhere Over the long term many other nations currently financing investment in the United States will themselves be confronted with aging populations and declining national saving Thus continuing to rely on foreign lenders to finance such a large share of U S domestic investment is not a viable strategy over the long run If the net inflow of foreign investment were to diminish the United States would no longer be able to invest so much more in the domestic capital stock than it saves Although a nation can run current account deficits for extended periods of time a low level of national saving implies a low level of domestic investment over the long run According to recent empirical research current account deficits eventually have been followed by periods of declining investment 16 Rather than forgo domestic investment

Investment How Would the Long Term Economic Outlook Change With Higher Levels of National Saving saving that did not finance domestic investment would increase net foreign investment and improve the current account balance 17 A3 4 The current long term economic outlook for U S national saving and investment is subject to wide ranging uncertainty about economic changes and the responses to those changes However one certainty is that the U S population is aging and there will be fewer workers supporting each retiree This demographic shift is expected to cause a decline in economic growth rates when labor force growth slows after 2010 Moreover the aging of the population may exert negative pressure on national saving As discussed in section 1 people tend to draw down their assets in their retirement years As government spending on health and retirement programs for the growing elderly population swells government saving is also likely to decline Q4 3 examines the long term outlook for federal government saving dissaving To get a sense of the long term implications of alternative national saving paths we examined the economic outlook over the next 75 years under two different assumptions 1 gross national saving remains constant at its 2000 share of GDP 18 3 percent and 2 gross national saving varies depending on how much the federal government saves 18 One possible fiscal policy which we used in our simulation would be for the federal government to save only the Social Security surpluses and to spend the non Social Security surpluses projected over the first 10 years on some mix of permanent tax cuts and spending increases For simplicity the Save the Social Security Surpluses simulation assumes that saving by households businesses and state and local governments remains constant as a share of 17The current account balance would improve to the extent that the increase in saving is used to increase net foreign investment rather than domestic investment Research suggests that for each additional dollar of saving perhaps one third is used to increase net foreign investment and two thirds is used to increase domestic investment See Martin Feldstein and Philippe Bacchetta National Saving and International Investment National Saving and Economic Performance D Bernheim and J Shoven eds Chicago University of Chicago Press 1991 pp 201 226 18Long term simulations are useful for comparing the potential outcome of alternative national saving paths within a common economic framework Such simulations can illustrate the long term economic consequences of saving choices that are made today Simulations should not be viewed as forecasts of economic outcomes 50 or 75 years in the future Rather they should be seen only as illustrations of the economic outcomes associated with alternative saving paths based on common demographic and economic assumptions See appendix II for a detailed description of the modeling methodology GDP at 16 1 percent average nonfederal saving as a share of GDP since 1998 19 As figure 3 4 shows gross national saving as a share of GDP remains fairly steady over the next decade under the Save the Social Security Surpluses simulation After 2010 as spending for health and retirement programs mounts dissaving by the federal government begins crowding out other saving and national saving begins to decline By 2024 gross national saving as a share of GDP drops below the mid 15 percent range experienced during the saving slump in the early 1990s By 2042 gross national saving would plunge below 5 percent lower than during the Great Depression Under the Save the Social Security Surpluses simulation gross national saving eventually disappears and the nation begins dissaving in 2047 19The 3 year period coincides with federal surpluses and its use avoids extending the unusually low nonfederal saving rate of 2000 throughout the simulation period Page 71 GAO 01 591SP National Saving Percent of GDP 1990 2000 2010

illustrative purposes Ultimately this would be a doomsday scenario for the U S economy National saving would be inadequate to finance even the investment necessary to maintain the nation s capital stock Figure 3 5 shows that as the nation s capital stock eroded future living standards measured in terms of GDP per capita inevitably would fall However before such catastrophic effects low national saving would probably result in higher interest rates rising inflation and the increasing reluctance of foreign investors to lend to a weakening U S economy These more immediate consequences would force action before national saving plunged to the levels shown in the simulation The simulation is not a prediction of what will happen in the future Rather it serves as a warning that the United States must both save more in the near term and reform entitlement programs for the elderly to put the budget on a more sustainable footing for the long term Figure 3 5 GDP Per Capita Under

This simulation can be run only through 2056 due to elimination of the capital stock Source GAO s March 2001 analysis Figure 3 5 is not solely a warning It also illustrates how saving more would improve the long term economic outlook Just as we enjoy a higher living standard today than our grandparents did future generations of Americans will reasonably expect to enjoy rising standards of living Living standards can be compared in terms of real GDP per capita which historically in the United States has doubled every 35 years 20 In considering future living standards doubling every 35 years represents a way to gauge whether future generations will enjoy an improvement comparable to that enjoyed by previous generations Suppose the United States could maintain gross national saving at its 2000 GDP share of 18 3 percent through some combination of personal business and government saving This constant saving rate is roughly comparable to saving the Social Security surpluses over the next decade but is considerably higher after 2010 as shown in figure 3 4 As shown in figure 3 5 GDP per capita under the Constant 2000 National Saving Rate simulation would fall short of doubling every 35 years GDP per capita in 2035 would be nearly double the 2000 level falling short by about 8 percent and by 2070 GDP per capita would fall almost 13 percent short of doubling the 2035 level Yet the Constant 2000 National Saving Rate simulation yields a vast improvement in future living standards compared to saving the Social Security surpluses Although national saving in 2000 was relatively low compared to past U S experience maintaining that level 18 3 percent of GDP over the long run would not be easy as the population ages The Constant 2000 National Saving Rate simulation is intended only to show how saving more results in higher economic growth over the long term It should not be interpreted as a recommendation about how much the United States needs to save because saving is not free and there are other ways in which governments businesses and individuals can and will adjust For example as people live longer rather than save more to finance more years of retirement individuals could choose to work longer and postpone retirement Clearly saving more would improve the nation s long term economic outlook but how much more do we need to save Establishing a tradeoff between the consumption of current and future generations entails value judgments that economic theory alone cannot provide Initially increasing saving and investment adds to the capital stock and boosts worker productivity and the economy s rate of growth In the long run a larger capital stock also requires more saving just to replace depreciating capital After reaching this long run equilibrium increased saving and investment yields a higher level of GDP per capita but does not boost worker productivity and economic growth Permanently boosting the rate of GDP growth would require ever increasing relative shares of saving and 20Since World War II annual growth in GDP per capita has averaged roughly 2 percent Of course growth was faster during some periods the 1950s and 1960s and the second half of the 1990s and slower during other periods the 1970s Page 74 GAO 01 591SP National Saving investment From a macroeconomic perspective any increase in saving up to the golden rule saving rate allows a nation to increase consumption in the long run 21 Below the golden rule rate saving and investing more today permits increased consumption Saving beyond the golden rule rate is counterproductive and would reduce consumption not only initially but also in the long term However the nation s saving rate is unlikely to reach the golden rule level much less exceed it Given the steady decline in the personal saving rate it is doubtful that Americans would willingly reduce consumption so much that the nation would be at risk of saving too much Estimates based on our long term growth model suggest that the golden rule saving rate for the United States would be more than 30 percent These estimates also suggest that increasing U S national saving would not substantially decrease the return to capital and therefore could provide significant improvement to future incomes and consumption Although the golden rule saving rate can be a useful analytical concept in evaluating a nation s saving the golden rule is not the best policy for saving Maximizing consumption per capita over the long term may not be socially optimal if people value current consumption more than future consumption and discount the future Another way to gauge national saving is to estimate how much we need to save to achieve specific national objectives In simple terms the nation could act like a target saver For example a key target would be saving enough to afford the nation s costs for supporting the aging population Boosting saving and GDP is unlikely to prevent a rise in the share of GDP devoted to government spending on the elderly because economic growth also tends to increase health spending and raise retirement benefits although with a lengthy lag for the latter A more realistic goal would be to increase saving by an amount that would generate a rise in future GDP equivalent to the increase in spending on the elderly Recent economic research estimated that increasing saving as a share of GDP by one percentage point above the 1999 rate would boost GDP enough to cover 95 percent of the increase in elderly costs between now and 2050 22 This is 21The golden rule saving rate maximizes consumption per capita over the long run For a more extensive discussion see N Gregory Mankiw Macroeconomics Fourth Edition New York N Y Worth Publishers 2000 pp 90 97 or

January 26 2000 Page 75 GAO 01 591SP National Saving equivalent to increasing national saving to 19 3 percent of GDP from 18 3 percent used in our Constant 2000 Saving Rate simulation While it is unclear just what the right level of saving is it is clear that America needs to begin saving more if it is to avoid severe problems in the future Saving now is vital because expanding the nation s productive capacity through national saving and investment is a long term process While saving the Social Security surpluses is a laudable fiscal policy goal Americans need to save more to ensure their own retirement security as well as the nation s future prosperity Increased saving by current generations would expand the nation s capital stock allowing future generations to better afford the nation s retirement costs while also enjoying higher standards of living Section 4 National Saving and the Government Q4 1 How Has Federal Fiscal Policy Affected U S National Saving A4 1 Federal fiscal policy affects the federal surplus or deficit which when measured on a NIPA basis represents the amount of federal government saving or dissaving which in turn directly affects national saving Federal deficits subtract from national saving by absorbing funds saved by households businesses and other levels of government that would otherwise be available for investment To finance a budget deficit the federal government borrows from the public by issuing debt securities adding to its debt held by the public 1 Conversely federal surpluses as measured under NIPA add to national saving and increase resources available for investment When a budget surplus occurs the federal government can use excess funds to reduce the debt held by the public Text box 4 1 explains how the NIPA surplus or deficit differs from the federal unified budget surplus or deficit While the NIPA measure reflects how government saving affects national saving available for investment the unified budget measure is the more common frame of reference for discussing federal fiscal policy issues Given that the two measures are roughly similar as a share of GDP in this section we use the unified budget measure unless otherwise specified 1Federal debt held by the public is also called publicly held debt but is not the same as public debt Debt held by the public plus debt held by government accounts such as budget trust funds compose gross federal debt For more information see Federal Debt Answers to Frequently Asked Questions An Update GAO OCG 99 27 May 1999 Page 77 GAO 01 591SP National Saving Text Box 4 1 How do the NIPA and federal unified budget concepts of federal surpluses and deficits differ In 2000 the NIPA federal surplus was 2 2 percent of GDP while the unified budget surplus was 2 4 percent Although the two measures are roughly similar there are some conceptual differences The federal unified budget measure is generally a cash or cash equivalent measure in which receipts are recorded when received and expenditures are recorded when paid regardless of the accounting period in which the receipts are earned or the costs incurred Thus the unified surplus reflects the difference between federal receipts and all federal government outlays including those used to purchase capital goods such as roads buildings and weapons systems The NIPA federal budget surplus however reflects the current or operating account of the federal government and does not count purchases of capital goods as current spending Instead NIPA includes a depreciation charge consumption of general government fixed capital in current spending as a proxy for the contribution of capital to the output of government services The NIPA and federal unified budget measures also differ in their treatment of federal employees pension programs In the unified budget federal employee pension benefits are recorded as outlays when paid in cash these outlays are offset in whole or in part by the government s and employees contributions to the pension programs NIPA on the other hand counts the government s contribution to the pension programs as an outlay to the household sector where the contribution is added to personal income and saving The benefits paid by the pension programs are not counted as government outlays under NIPA but rather as a drawdown of accumulated household assets Other differences between the unified budget and NIPA measures arise because NIPA focuses on current income and production within the United States For example NIPA excludes capital transfers like estate tax receipts which are recorded as revenue in the unified budget and investment grants in aid to state and local governments which the unified budget records as outlays Lastly revenue and spending related to Puerto Rico the Virgin Islands and other U S territories are counted in the federal unified budget but not in NIPA The unified budget measure is useful in explaining annual changes in the federal debt held by the public The NIPA measure is useful in explaining how government saving has affected net national saving available for investment Again these measures yield roughly similar estimates of the federal government s budget position as a share of GDP In order to provide a consistent frame of reference for discussing federal fiscal policy issues this section refers to the unified budget measure unless otherwise specified Note For more details see Laura M Beall and Sean P Keehan Federal Budget Estimates Fiscal Year 2001 Survey of Current Business Bureau of Economic

federal deficits consumed a large share of increasingly scarce private saving and reduced the amount of national saving available for investment 2 Since 1990 the Congress and the President have taken action to eliminate the annual federal budget deficit through several initiatives including the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 As noted in section 2 the combination of these policy actions and strong economic growth reduced federal government dissaving over the 1990s see figure 4 1 With the swing to surplus in recent years federal government saving added to the saving of other sectors to increase the amount of national saving available for investment Unified budget surpluses since 1998 have been the longest running surpluses in over 50 years and federal budget surpluses are projected for the next decade So far the federal government has used excess funds to reduce debt held by the public paying down 223 billion in fiscal year 2000 alone 3 2See figure 2 2 for the composition of net national saving from 1960 to 2000 3Federal Debt Debt Management Actions and Future Challenges GAO 01 317 February 28 2001

Note The saving of households businesses and state and local governments makes up nonfederal saving National saving data are on a NIPA basis The NIPA federal surplus deficit measure as a share of GDP is roughly similar to the unified budget measure Source GAO analysis of NIPA data from the Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis Although one might expect an increase in federal saving to lead to an increase in national saving changes in federal saving do not flow through to changes in national saving and investment in a dollar for dollar relationship Figure 4 1 illustrates that federal and nonfederal saving which consist mainly of private saving tend to be inversely related In other words when federal government saving increases smaller deficits or larger surpluses private saving may decrease somewhat When federal saving decreases smaller surpluses or larger deficits private saving may increase For example in figure 4 1 although federal government saving increased as a share of GDP by 5 5 percentage points from 1990 to 2000 net national saving increased by only 1 1 percentage points because private saving as a share of GDP decreased by 4 9 percentage points over the same period 4 4The total change in net national saving from 1990 to 2000 was also affected by an increase in state and local government saving of about 0 6 percentage points Page 80 GAO 01 591SP National Saving Q4 2 Why Do Government and Private Saving Tend to Move in Opposite Directions A4 2 Government and private saving tend to move in opposite directions for several reasons three of which are discussed here First federal borrowing can be large enough to affect current interest rates which in turn may influence private saving and investment Government dissaving absorbs funds available for private investment and puts upward pressure on interest rates Higher interest rates both raise the return on saving and reduce the market value of existing financial assets issued when rates were lower 5 The combination of higher returns to saving and reduced wealth might encourage households and businesses to save more Conversely an increase in government saving adds to the supply of resources available for investment and may put downward pressure on interest rates Lower interest rates both reduce the return on saving and increase the market value of existing financial assets issued when rates were higher Lower returns to saving and increased wealth might dampen private saving Second if federal budget surpluses are achieved in part through higher taxes those higher taxes reduce households disposable personal income As discussed in section 1 disposable personal income is the after tax personal income including government transfer payments available for households consumption and saving Households may choose to save less of their disposable income and maintain their current level of consumption especially if they consider the higher tax payments to be temporary Reduced personal saving would tend to offset the increased government saving due to higher taxes Third some economists believe that government saving has some effect on households expectations about future tax rates even across generations This Ricardian equivalence hypothesis holds that people are forward looking and recognize that current government surpluses or deficits affect government debt and future tax rates 6 Thus when the government runs deficits and accumulates debt Ricardian consumers would save more to ensure that they or their descendants can pay the expected higher future taxes Alternatively when the government runs 5For example market prices of interest bearing securities such as Treasury securities fluctuate inversely with market interest rates The market price of a Treasury security falls when the current interest rate on Treasury securities of equal maturity rises 6Although this view is named after the 19th century economist David Ricardo who first explored the possible relationship the seminal work on this theory is Robert Barro Are Government Bonds Net Wealth Journal of Political Economy Vol 82 No 6 1974 pp 1095 1117 Q4 3 What Is the Long Term Outlook for Federal Government Saving Dissaving surpluses and reduces debt held by the public as in 1998 through 2000 Ricardian consumers would save less in anticipation of future tax cuts If all consumers were fully Ricardian private saving would fully offset any change in government saving and national saving would be unchanged Economists continue to debate how well the Ricardian equivalence theory works in practice People may be too shortsighted in their saving decisions to look ahead to the implications of current government debt on future generations When federal budget deficits and debt mounted in the 1980s private saving declined the opposite of what the Ricardian equivalence hypothesis would suggest However in recent years as figure 4 1 illustrates private saving which is the major component of nonfederal saving declined as federal saving rose which is consistent with the Ricardian equivalence hypothesis In summary it is unclear how much each additional dollar of government saving will ultimately increase national saving Evidence shows that changes in saving by households and businesses tend to offset some of the changes in government saving While economists disagree over the magnitude of the private saving offset studies generally suggest it is less than one for one This means that for each additional dollar of government saving aggregate private saving falls by less than a dollar To what extent the aggregate offset is due to the changes in interest rates wealth disposable personal income expectations of future tax rates or other reasons is ambiguous Estimating the private saving offset is complicated by the fact that individuals may respond differently to changes in government saving 7 A4 3 While media attention has focused on budget surpluses projected for the next 10 years the long term outlook for federal government saving has received considerably less attention The outlook for government saving over the next 75 years is subject to wide ranging uncertainty due to economic changes and future legislation However one certainty is that as life expectancy rises and the baby boom generation retires the U S population will age and fewer workers will support each retiree The 7For example some households live paycheck to paycheck and might spend all of a tax cut whereas other households might spend only a portion a Ricardian household might save all of a tax cut in anticipation of future tax increases For further discussion about accommodating consumer behavior in modeling fiscal policy see N Gregory Mankiw The Saver Spender Theory of Fiscal Policy NBER Working Paper 7571 February 2000 Page 82 GAO 01 591SP National Saving federal budget will increasingly be driven by demographic trends Absent changes to current law government saving is likely to decline as government health and retirement programs for the growing elderly population claim a larger share of federal resources Any fiscal policy path in which some portion of the anticipated budget surpluses is saved ultimately leads to a stronger fiscal position than annually balancing the budget in each of the next 10 years But what does it mean to save the surplus If the surplus is not spent on government programs or used for tax cuts it is saved Saving some portion of the projected budget surpluses would allow the federal government to reduce the overhang of federal debt built over decades of deficit spending Using surpluses to reduce debt held by the public results in lower interest costs today all other things being equal and a lower debt burden for future generations 8 Within this decade the projected surpluses may likely exceed the amount of debt held by the public available to be redeemed Text box 4 2 discusses government saving in an environment where reducing federal debt held by the public is not an option 8For more information on using surpluses to redeem debt held by the public see Federal Debt Answers to Frequently Asked

Challenges GAO 01 317 February 28 2001 Page 83 GAO 01 591SP National Saving Text Box 4 2 Government Saving When Reducing Publicly Held Federal Debt is Not an Option If the projected budget surpluses materialize the federal government will reach the point at which the annual surpluses will exceed the amount of debt available to be redeemed or that can be bought back at reasonable prices Although estimates as to when this point will be reached vary depending on several assumptions most analysts agree that it could occur within the decade estimates range from the Congressional Budget Office s CBO January 2001 estimate of 2006 to the Office of Management and Budget s March 2001 estimate of 2008 This point will occur before the debt held by the public is eliminated and the resulting accumulation of cash will require decisions about what to do with these cash balances This raises the question of how the federal government can save if reducing federal debt held by the public is not an option Just as the flow of personal saving affects the stock of financial assets accumulated by households government saving affects the stock of federal debt The federal government borrows from the public to finance a deficit Conversely when a budget surplus occurs the federal government can use excess funds to reduce the debt held by the public accumulate cash balances or acquire nonfederal financial assets Holding cash or nonfederal financial assets would not reduce debt held by the public but would reduce the net debt of the federal government Net debt represents the federal government s total financial liabilities including debt held by the public less its total financial assets Positive amounts of net debt reflect how much of the nation s private wealth has been absorbed to finance federal deficits Negative amounts of net debt reflect how much of the nation s private financial assets have been acquired by the federal government Acquiring nonfederal financial assets could be another way to translate budget surpluses into resources available for investment However the issue of the federal ownership of nonfederal assets is controversial Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan among others has expressed concern that there would be tremendous political pressure to steer the federal government s asset selection to achieve economic social or political purposes Although the governance issues may not be insurmountable another possible concern is that the federal government could become the largest single investor There is a growing body of experience by other governments that might help policymakers address the question of whether and how the federal government can or should acquire nonfederal financial instruments Investing in the financial markets is a standard practice for state and local government pension funds in the United States Also other nations have decided that the potential risks of political interference can be managed and are outweighed by what those nations perceive as the risk of failing to save for the future or provide a cushion for contingencies In the future we plan to study how other nations invest in nongovernmental assets to learn more about how they deal with governance and other issues Note The net debt concept is based on the OECD definition of net financial liabilities that can be calculated by subtracting financial assets from financial liabilities In recent years the fiscal policy debate has focused on the importance of saving the Social Security portion of projected unified budget surpluses While policymakers appear to have generally agreed to save Social Security surpluses there is considerable debate over whether and how to use the non Social Security surpluses After recent years of fiscal discipline and focus on fiscal responsibility the anticipated surpluses offer a chance to meet pent up demand for discretionary domestic spending increase defense spending cut taxes shore up Social Security and Medicare reduce the debt or do some combination of these How the surpluses are used has long term implications for federal government saving national saving and ultimately the nation s future living standards 9 To get a sense of the long term implications of broad fiscal policy choices we examined the fiscal and economic outlook over the next 75 years under two alternatives 1 assuming that the federal government saves only the Social Security surpluses and 2 assuming that the federal government saves the entire unified surpluses 10 For simplicity these fiscal policy simulations assume that saving by households businesses and state and local governments remains constant as a share of GDP and that the surpluses saved are used to reduce debt held by the public 11 Once debt held by the public is eliminated these simulations assume excess cash is used to acquire an unspecified mix of nonfederal assets with a rate of return equivalent to the average interest rate on Treasury securities 12

would be treated as spending Saving the Social Security surpluses produces unified budget surpluses for almost 20 years as shown in figure 4 2 and eliminates the debt held by the public by 2015 Under the Save the Social Security Surpluses simulation the non Social Security surpluses are eliminated by an unspecified mix of permanent tax cuts and spending increases Under this scenario unified budget deficits emerge again in 2019 just as the Social Security and Medicare programs are being strained by the retiring baby boom generation As discussed in section 3 the large deficits and debt under this simulation imply a substantial reduction in national saving and investment in the capital stock leading to a decline in living standards in terms of GDP per capita Although policymakers would likely act to reduce the budget deficits and to promote higher national saving before facing the economic doomsday implied under the Save the Social Security Surpluses simulation this scenario serves as a reminder to be cautious in committing surpluses to large permanent tax cuts and spending increases Percent of GDP 2000 2010 2020 2030 2040 2050 2060 2075 aData end when deficits reach 20 percent of GDP Source GAO s March 2001 analysis Figure 4 2 also shows an alternative fiscal policy path assuming the federal government saves all of the projected unified surpluses Under the Save the Unified Surpluses simulation federal budget surpluses would be higher over the next 40 years but deficits would emerge in the 2040s Although the Q4 4 How Does Saving Affect Future Budgetary Flexibility government would have to borrow again from the public to finance deficits over the long run the simulation implies that absent policy or economic change debt held by the public could be fully eliminated before the end of the decade 13 Just as the Save the Social Security Surpluses simulation is an implausible doomsday scenario the Save the Unified Surpluses simulation can also be viewed as implausible Under this simulation annual federal surpluses which peak at 5 percent of GDP would last longer than ever before in the nation s history and the government would hold nonfederal financial assets for over 50 years A4 4 Government saving directly affects future budgetary flexibility through its effect on interest payment spending In the past interest payments contributed to deficits and helped fuel a rising debt burden Rising debt in turn raised interest costs to the budget and the federal government increased debt held by the public to finance these interest payments A change from a budget deficit to a surplus reduces federal debt and replaces this vicious cycle with a virtuous cycle in which saving some portion of the budget surpluses results in lower debt levels Lower debt levels lead to lower interest payments possibly at lower interest rates These lower interest payments in turn lead to larger potential surpluses and or increased budget flexibility Figure 4 3 shows the long term implications for budgetary flexibility of saving the Social Security surpluses Again this simulation assumes that nonfederal saving remains constant as a share of GDP at 16 1 percent the average nonfederal saving rate since 1998 Absent program changes saving the Social Security surpluses and even the Medicare surpluses14 is not enough by itself to finance the retirement and health programs for the elderly As figure 4 3 shows saving only the Social Security surpluses will not be sufficient to accommodate both the projected growth in Social Security and health entitlements and other national priorities in the long term These programs will eventually squeeze out most or all other spending By 2030 saving the Social Security surpluses results in a 13Although estimates as to when this point will be reached vary depending on several assumptions most analysts agree that it could occur within the decade see Federal Debt Debt Management Actions and Future Challenges GAO 01

health care providers Budget flexibility declines drastically so that by 2050 net interest on the debt would absorb roughly half of all federal revenue Furthermore Social Security and health spending alone would exceed total federal revenue 15These fiscal policy simulations do not reflect other federal commitments and responsibilities not fully recognized in the federal budget including the costs

to avert massive government dissaving reduce the economic burden of government spending for an aging population and restore budgetary flexibility to address other national priorities Q4 10 and Q4 12 discuss the need for Social Security and Medicare reform more fully Just as saving more of the anticipated budget surpluses would enhance future budgetary flexibility increasing private saving would also improve the federal government s budget outlook As discussed in section 3 increasing national saving boosts investment and economic growth Because the U S economy is essentially the tax base for the federal government economic growth in turn increases government revenue Increased economic growth thus could provide the resources to help Q4 5 What are the Implications of Current Fiscal Policy Choices for Future Living Standards finance the retirement and health programs for the elderly as well as increase budget flexibility to pay for other federal programs and activities A4 5 Fiscal policy choices about how much of the surpluses to save affect not only the level of government saving but ultimately the nation s longterm economic outlook Saving the Social Security surpluses would allow Americans to enjoy higher standards of living in the future as figure 4 4 shows However under the Save the Social Security Surpluses simulation GDP per capita growth slows and eventually turns negative Even if the entire unified surplus were saved GDP per capita would fall somewhat short of the U S historical average of doubling every 35 years The implication of such simulations is that even if government saving is sustained at unprecedented levels future generations of workers might not enjoy a rise in living standards comparable to that enjoyed by previous generations Thus saving Social Security surpluses is not enough to ensure retirement security for the aging population without placing a heavy burden on future generations Q4 10 and Q4 12 discuss how Social Security and

recent good news about the budget does not mean that difficult budget choices are a thing of the past The history of budget forecasts should be a reminder not to be complacent about the certainty that large surpluses will materialize over the next 10 years as projected Not so long ago the forecasts were for deficits as far as the eye can see Budget projections are inherently uncertain and even a small change in one assumption can lead to very large changes in the fiscal outlook over a decade The Congressional Budget Office CBO describes its projections as more tentative than usual because the increase in CBO s productivity growth assumption is based on data only for the past few years 16 According to CBO that limited time span is insufficient to determine whether the rate of 16For more information about potential sources of uncertainty in CBO s projections see The Uncertainties of Budget Projections Chapter 5 The Budget and Economic Outlook Fiscal Years 2002 2011 Congressional Budget Office January 2001 pp 93 103 Page 91 GAO 01 591SP National Saving productivity growth has indeed accelerated or has just temporarily deviated from underlying historical trends as it has many times in the past 17 Some observers have declared that the U S economy has entered a new era of more rapid economic growth and it is possible that future growth could be even more robust than CBO s baseline economic projections assume However CBO has pointed out that the recent burst in productivity may prove temporary if the new economy turns out to be just a flash in the pan In addition to the greater than usual uncertainty about productivity growth it is too soon to tell whether recent boosts in federal revenue reflect a structural change in the economy or a more temporary divergence from historical trends CBO has pointed out that simply assuming a return to historical trends and slightly faster growth in health care spending would dramatically reduce the surpluses projected Given these uncertainties lower unified surpluses and even deficits are possible budget outcomes over the next decade Caution is warranted before committing the anticipated surpluses to permanent changes on either the revenue or spending side Although policymakers appear to have generally agreed to save Social Security surpluses there is considerable debate over whether and how to use the rest of the projected surpluses Yet the amounts available for new tax or spending initiatives may be considerably less than policymakers and the public anticipate 18 CBO s budget projections are intended to provide estimates of federal spending and revenue assuming current law related to taxation and entitlement programs is unchanged For this reason CBO s projections do not reflect the full cost of maintaining current policies if maintaining those policies would require enacting new legislation For example the budget projections do not reflect the costs of laws that are regularly extended for a few years at a time such as continuing payments to farmers that have been provided for the last three years or extending tax credits due to expire The projections also do not reflect the expected

discretionary spending historically has grown faster than the rate of inflation A4 6 Not only does government saving directly affect national saving available for private investment but the federal government also is a key contributor to the nation s capital stock and productivity through its own investment spending 19 For example the federal government invests in building roads training workers and conducting scientific research Although unified budget surpluses increase national saving available for private investment increasing federal spending on infrastructure if properly designed and administered can be another way to increase national saving and investment Federal spending on education and R D while it does not count as NIPA investment can if properly designed and administered also promote the nation s long term productivity and economic growth GAO has reported that well chosen federal spending for infrastructure education and R D that is directly intended to enhance the private sector s long term productivity can be viewed as federal investment 20 However CBO has questioned whether increasing federal investment spending could significantly increase economic growth 21 A sound public infrastructure plays a vital role in the nation s capacity to produce goods and services in the future Public facilities such as transportation systems and water supplies are vital to meeting the 19Fiscal policy choices affect not only how much the government saves and invests but also affect how businesses and households save and invest Q4 7 discusses federal policies aimed at encouraging private saving 20For more information about defining federal investment for long term economic growth see Budget Issues Choosing Public Investment Programs GAO AIMD 93 25 July 23 1993 and related GAO products listed in appendix V 21CBO concluded that increased federal spending on investment in infrastructure education and training and R D was unlikely to increase economic growth and could possibly reduce growth According to CBO many federal investments have little net economic benefit either because they are selected for political or other noneconomic reasons or because they displace more productive private sector or state and local investments See The Economic Effects of Federal Spending on Infrastructure and Other Investments Congressional Budget Office June 1998 immediate as well as long term public demands for safety health and improved quality of life While most infrastructure spending takes place at the state local or private sector level the federal government also invests in infrastructure such as highways bridges and air traffic control 22 As federal unified deficits declined over the 1990s federal investment in nondefense physical assets remained relatively constant as a share of GDP Federal spending on education and nondefense R D which is intended to enhance the nation s long term productivity also remained relatively constant as a share of GDP over the 1990s At some point reducing federal unified deficits or maintaining unified surpluses at the expense of federal R D and education spending raises concerns about future workers skills technological advancement and thus economic growth R D and education have long been seen as areas for government activity given the private sector s inability to capture all of the societal benefits that such investments provide The federal government has played a central role in supporting R D and thus enhancing the nation s long term productivity One rationale for this has been that the societal gains from R D for example are often not felt until far in the future and so might not provide much profit for an individual firm The Internet computers communications satellites jet aircraft and semiconductors are all examples of benefits from federal R D investments over the past 50 years Federal R D investment spending on genetic medicine and biotechnology has helped lead to the mapping of human genes Although the Human Genome Project has been hailed as the most important most wondrous map ever produced by humankind its full societal benefits will not be seen for years to come 23 Fiscal policy choices about the allocation of government spending between consumption and investment are influenced in part by the federal budget process The federal government s cash based budget process is largely a short term plan focusing on the short to medium term cash implications of government obligations and fiscal decisions The budget seeks to serve 22For more on the federal government s role in infrastructure investment see U S Infrastructure Funding Trends and Opportunities to Improve Investment Decisions GAO RCED AIMD 00 35 February 7 2000 23 Remarks by the President

Genomics Corporation on the Completion of the First Survey of the Entire Human Genome Project The White House Office of the Press Secretary June 26 2000 Q4 7 What Policies of the Federal Government Have Been Aimed at Encouraging Nonfederal Saving and Investment many purposes but one of its primary functions is to control obligations up front before the government commitment is made As a result the budget process tends to view a dollar spent on consumption the same as a dollar spent on investment because both represent commitments by the government and represent resources taken out of the private sector for use by the government Some have argued that the budget may actually favor short term consumption because the cost of both must be scored up front as part of the Budget Enforcement Act process even though most of the benefits from investment programs accrue in the future 24 In the past GAO has suggested that the budget could better facilitate policymakers weighing choices between federal investment and consumption by incorporating an investment component with agreed upon levels of investment spending This could promote the consideration of spending intended to benefit the economy over the long term while maintaining overall fiscal discipline 25 As the Congress moves to modify the federal budget process with the expiration of the Budget Enforcement Act attention is warranted as to how the process considers the long term implications of alternative spending choices A4 7 Although increasing government saving is the most direct way for the federal government to increase national saving the federal government can also encourage saving and investment by state and local governments and the private sector For example the federal government provides funding such as grants loans or loan guarantees to state and local governments to finance the construction and improvement of the nation s highways mass transit systems and water systems The federal government also provides financial aid to encourage postsecondary education In addition to its direct spending the federal government offers tax incentives to encourage nonfederal saving and investment The revenue loss associated with a tax incentive represents the federal government s budgetary cost of promoting saving and investment for particular purposes The current income tax system provides preferential treatment such as special exemptions special deductions and or credits as well as special 24Budget Trends Federal Investment Outlays Fiscal Years 1981 2003 GAO AIMD 98 184 June 15 1998

law some types of saving and investment are exempt from taxes while other types are fully taxed some forms of consumption in particular health care receive preferential treatment Although a comprehensive discussion of income versus consumption taxes is beyond the scope of this primer it is helpful to highlight various federal tax incentives for saving and investment 26 The federal government uses tax incentives to encourage particular forms of investment Some tax provisions allow accelerated depreciation so that businesses can more quickly recover the costs of investing in certain types of equipment and structures Other tax incentives encourage investment in the nation s infrastructure For example interest income on state and local government bonds which are used primarily for infrastructure purposes are exempt from federal taxes This tax preference allows state and local governments to borrow at lower rates to build highways schools mass transit facilities and water systems In addition tax preferences may encourage particular forms of infrastructure investment such as special tax credits for investments in developing low income rental housing Also special tax credits and deductions are aimed at spurring private R D The federal government also has sought to encourage personal saving both to enhance households financial security and to boost national saving Table 4 1 highlights some tax provisions aimed at encouraging saving for retirement buying homes and investing in education 27 The largest tax incentive for saving in terms of the tax revenue loss is the preferential tax treatment of employer sponsored pension plans additional tax incentives encourage retirement saving outside of employer pensions The second largest category of tax incentives aimed at encouraging saving promotes home ownership Other tax incentives encourage college and other postsecondary education While some tax incentives for education encourage households to accumulate assets such as U S Series EE savings 26For more information about the differences between income and consumption taxes and the current tax treatment of saving and investment see Tax Administration Potential Impact of Alternative Taxes on Taxpayers and Administrators GAO GGD 98 37 January 14 1998 pp 55 77 27While this discussion focuses on tax incentives encouraging personal saving some federal programs and tax provisions may actually discourage people from saving As discussed in section 1 Social Security also affects people s incentives to save for retirement Capital gains taxation and estate transfer taxes may also affect household decisions about saving and asset accumulation bonds or education savings accounts to pay for college other provisions such as the HOPE credit are aimed more at making college more affordable Table 4 1 Selected Federal Income Tax Provisions That Influence Personal Saving 2 Individual Retirement Accounts IRAs 15 200 3 Keogh plans

incentives increase the after tax return on saving for particular purposes or on specific types of assets accumulated This would narrow the wedge between the individual s return on saving and society s return on investment that results from the taxation of income from saving As explained in section 1 higher rates of return may or may not encourage people to save more For the federal government tax incentives reduce tax revenue and hence government saving How tax incentives affect personal saving and ultimately national saving is less certain The net effect on national saving discussed further in Q4 8 depends on the interaction between any additional personal saving and government dissaving associated with financing the incentive Tax incentives affect how people save for retirement but do not necessarily increase the overall level of personal saving Since the 1970s preferential tax treatment has been granted to Individual Retirement Accounts IRAs and employer sponsored 401 k pension plans Even with these retirement saving incentives the personal saving rate has steadily declined Although the tax benefits indeed seem to encourage individuals to contribute to these kinds of accounts the amounts contributed may not be totally new saving Some contributions may represent saving that would have occurred even without the tax incentives or amounts merely shifted from taxable assets or even financed by borrowing Economists disagree about whether tax incentives are effective in increasing the overall level of personal saving In a 1996 symposium examining universal IRAs available in the early 1980s 28 researchers reached three widely divergent conclusions 1 yes most contributions represented new saving 2 no most IRA contributions were not new saving and 3 maybe about 26 cents of each dollar contributed may have represented new saving 29 Even if tax incentives do not increase personal saving much in the short term they may encourage individual households to earmark resources specifically for retirement Once the funds are earmarked in retirement accounts the prospect of taxes and penalties for early withdrawals might induce some households to save more outside of retirement accounts to achieve nonretirement goals However if people can readily withdraw money from tax preferred accounts for purposes other than retirement there is no assurance that tax incentives would ultimately enhance individuals retirement security Allowing access to voluntary accounts like IRAs or 401 k plans before retirement through borrowing or early withdrawals to buy a home or to pay for education or medical expenses is a double edged sword Access 28The Journal of Economic Perspectives Vol 10 No 4 Fall 1996 presented three papers representing these viewpoints James M Poterba

and R Glenn Hubbard and Jonathan S Skinner Assessing the Effectiveness of Saving Incentives pp 73 90 29Researchers have also attempted to estimate the effect of employer sponsored 401 k plans on personal saving For a recent summary of this empirical debate see William Gale The Impact of Pensions and 401 k Plans on Saving A Critical Assessment of the State of the Literature paper presented at ERISA After 25 Years A Framework for Evaluating Pension Reform Washington D C September 17 1999 Q4 8 Given That Experts Disagree About Whether Retirement Saving Tax Incentives Are Effective In Increasing Personal Saving Overall How Do These Tax Incentives Affect National Saving provisions may increase saving because more people may choose to participate and to contribute larger amounts 30 Yet borrowing and early withdrawals can ultimately reduce individuals retirement income There would be little benefit to national saving from allowing early access to mandatory accounts with set contribution levels which has been proposed for Social Security see Q4 10 and Q4 11 A4 8 The net effect on national saving depends on whether a tax incentive induces enough additional saving by households to make up for the government s revenue loss To gain a better understanding of how tax incentives affect national saving look at one example how a tax deduction for a traditional tax deferred IRA may affect government and ultimately national saving For simplicity consider a married couple in which neither spouse is covered by an employer sponsored pension plan and each contributes 2 000 the maximum per person per year allowed under current law to a traditional IRA As shown in table 4 2 how much the couple s 4 000 annual contribution adds to national saving that year depends on 1 how much their IRA tax deduction costs the government and 2 whether their contributions represent new saving or were shifted from existing assets Further assume for simplicity that our hypothetical couple s marginal tax rate is 28 percent so their deduction costs the federal government 1 120 28 percent of 4 000 In other words government saving decreases by 1 120 or government dissaving increases by that amount depending on the government s surplus deficit position for the year If the couple would have otherwise spent the 4 000 i e their contributions represent new saving national saving would increase by 2 880 the 4 000 increase in personal saving less the 1 120 decrease in government saving At the other extreme if the couple merely shifted the funds from another account or asset to the IRAs i e no increase in personal saving national saving would fall by the amount of the government s tax loss The actual change in national saving probably falls somewhere between these two examples Table 4 2 also provides a third scenario the impact on national saving if about 26 percent of the couple s contributions represent new saving In this case national saving would drop slightly but the couple would have saved more and expressly earmarked more of their assets for retirement 30401 k Pension Plans Loan Provisions Enhance Participation But May Affect Income Security for Some GAO HEHS 98

2 000 to a traditional IRA Their 4 000 IRA contributions are fully deductible If either spouse is covered by an employer sponsored plan their contributions may not be fully deductible depending on their income aChange in personal saving depends on how much of the 4 000 IRA contribution represents new saving These assumptions were drawn from three papers presented in the Fall 1996 Journal of Economic Perspectives see footnote 28 bChange in government saving represents tax revenue loss in first year due solely to tax deduction for IRA contribution Amount does not include revenue forgone as a result of tax deferral on investment income Taxes on contribution and investment income are deferred until amounts are withdrawn cChange in national saving represents the sum of the change in personal and government saving for a simplified example focused on one household and one type of IRA The ultimate effect of any tax incentive on national saving would depend on how households in aggregate respond Source GAO analysis based on 1999 individual income tax rates and IRS publication 590 Individual Retirement Arrangements Table 4 2 also shows the effect on national saving of tax deductible IRA contributions under different tax brackets If our hypothetical couple were in the highest income tax bracket and their contributions represented all new saving their 4 000 deduction would cost the government 1 584 and add 2 416 to national saving If they were in the lowest tax bracket their deduction would cost the government 600 and add as much as 3 400 to national saving Of course this simplified example focuses on one household and one type of IRA 31 The ultimate effect of any tax incentive on national saving would depend on how households in aggregate respond A tax incentive for retirement saving may encourage some households to save more while encouraging others to shift their existing balances into tax preferred accounts Again the net effect of a tax incentive on national saving depends on whether the tax incentive induces enough additional personal saving to make up for the government s revenue loss As illustrated in table 4 2 deductions for taxpayers in higher tax brackets are more costly for the government Although deductions for lower income taxpayers appear to yield a greater net increase in national saving because they are less costly for the government they also offer relatively less incentive for lowerincome families to save Low and moderate income households have fewer resources and may have less capacity to contribute to an IRA or to earmark more assets for retirement Most people saving through taxpreferred retirement accounts are middle to upper income Although higher income households might be encouraged to save more by increasing the annual contribution limits to IRAs and employer sponsored 401 k plans currently 2 000 and 10 500 respectively increasing contribution limits alone is not likely to induce more saving from low income households Nonrefundable tax incentives may not be particularly effective in encouraging saving by lower income taxpayers who already owe relatively little or no federal income taxes In recent years policymakers have explored providing refundable tax incentives and government matching to encourage Americans to save more Text box 4 3 describes two federal initiatives allowing governmentsubsidized saving accounts for low income families First the 1996 welfare 31Besides the tax deductible traditional IRA other retirement saving vehicles also receive preferential tax treatment Depending on their circumstances people may also be able to choose from nondeductible traditional IRAs new Roth IRAs SEP IRAs for the selfemployed SIMPLE IRAs sponsored by small employers and the popular 401 k employersponsored saving plans The oddly named education IRA is not a retirement arrangement Page 101 GAO 01 591SP National Saving reform law allowed states to use Temporary Assistance for Needy Families TANF funds to establish subsidized saving accounts for TANF recipients Second the Assets for Independence Act of 1998 authorized federal funding for a 5 year demonstration project to evaluate the effectiveness of matching incentives for certain low income savers Text Box 4 3 Individual Development Accounts for Low Income Savers Individual development accounts IDAs are special saving accounts for low income families In theory IDAs help lowincome families save accumulate assets and achieve economic self sufficiency IDAs are like the better known IRAs in the sense that the assets accumulated are to be used only for limited purposes Whereas IRAs are for retirement IDAs can be used to buy a first home to pay for college or other job training or to start a small business IDAs are special in that low income savers receive matching funds from federal and state governments as well as private sector organizations as an incentive to save Usually IDA account holders must undergo economic literacy training as a condition of participation The 1996 welfare reform law allowed states to use Temporary Assistance for Needy Family TANF funds to establish subsidized saving accounts for TANF recipients TANF recipients are to make contributions from earnings and state matching funds used for IDAs count towards a state s maintenance of effort spending requirement IDA balances generally are not to be considered in determining eligibility and benefits for means tested federal programs According to the Center for Social Development as of January 2001 29 states had passed legislation establishing IDA programs and 32 states had incorporated IDAs into their TANF plans Matching rates and dollar limits vary by state Matching rates range from two to one in Virginia to three to one in Indiana and Missouri Limits on IDA balances range from 4 000 in Virginia to 10 000 in South Carolina and 50 000 in Missouri Some states restrict IDA use to paying for education or training The Assets for Independence Act of 1998 authorized federal funding for a 5 year demonstration project to evaluate the effectiveness of matching incentives for low income savers The IDA demonstration project provides direct federal funding to state and local governments as well as nonprofit community organizations to match saving contributions by low income families eligible for TANF or the Earned Income Tax Credit In fiscal years 1999 and 2000 10 million was appropriated each year for the demonstration project In those 2 years awards totaling 17 7 million were made to 65 grantees sponsoring IDA programs For fiscal year 2001 25 million was appropriated for the IDA demonstration Because the first grants were awarded in September 1999 it is too soon in the demonstration project to fully evaluate the effectiveness of IDAs as a saving incentive Sources The Center for Social Development Washington University in St Louis and Vee Burke Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Individual Development Accounts Congressional Research Service January 17 2001 Recent proposals have aimed at creating a broader system of subsidized accounts to encourage more Americans to save for retirement For example President Clinton s 2000 Retirement Savings Accounts RSAs proposal would have provided government matching on voluntary Page 102 GAO 01 591SP National Saving retirement contributions for low and moderate income families 32 Under the RSA proposal a worker between the ages of 25 and 60 with family earnings of at least 5 000 could contribute up to 1 000 annually through either an employer sponsored saving plan or a tax deferred individual account 33 A worker earning up to 12 500 was to receive a two to one 200 percent match on the first 100 contributed each year and a one to one match 100 percent on additional contributions The progressive matching formula was to phase down as income increased A worker earning between 25 000 and 40 000 was to receive a 20 percent match on the first 100 contributed and additional contributions For individuals who did not owe federal income taxes the government match was to be in the form of a tax credit to the employer or financial institution holding the taxpayer s account Although the RSAs were aimed at accumulating assets for retirement the proposal would have allowed limited withdrawals after 5 years for such purposes as buying a home or paying educational or medical expenses At this time it is unclear how new tax subsidized saving accounts might affect personal saving and ultimately national saving Like any tax incentive matching tax credits would clearly reduce federal revenue and government saving The tax credits by themselves would have no net effect on national saving absent any change in household consumption personal saving would increase by the amount of the government match but government saving would decrease by the same amount Of course the purpose of matching is to change household behavior Government matching of voluntary contributions could increase national saving if these incentives indeed induce people to save more 34 A progressive match providing a higher match for low income workers and eliminating the match for high income workers would serve to target low income 32President Clinton s 1999 Universal Savings Accounts USA proposal would have created a more costly centralized system of accounts with a flat annual general tax credit of up to 300 for low and moderate income workers plus a 50 to 100 percent government match on voluntary contributions Low income workers were to receive a one to one match on their contributions and the match progressively declined based on income so that higher income workers would receive a lower match or none at all 33Contribution limits and eligibility thresholds for RSAs for a couple were twice the amount for an individual For example a couple could contribute up to 2 000 annually 34Depending on the design and implementation government matching could potentially reduce national saving For example a household could transfer amounts from existing assets to get the government match and then increase consumption in response to its increased wealth Q4 9 What Is the Federal Government Doing to Educate the Public About Why Saving Matters workers who now receive little tax benefit from existing retirement saving incentives Even with generous matching low income workers may not voluntarily save more for retirement In light of the conflicting expert views on how existing tax incentives affect personal saving it is unclear how new matching incentives might affect individuals saving choices and retirement security A4 9 While a great deal of attention focuses on how much retirement saving tax incentives cost the government and how much if any new personal saving they generate what is sometimes overlooked is that tax incentives remind people to save for retirement The existence of IRAs and 401 k s serves to raise public awareness about retirement saving opportunities Advertising by financial institutions offering IRAs and information about employer sponsored 401 k options serve as reminders about ways to save for retirement Yet even as the tax code provides more opportunities than ever to save for retirement Americans may not understand why saving matters In the Savings Are Vital for Everyone s Retirement Act of 1997 SAVER Act the Congress found that a leading obstacle to expanding retirement saving is that many Americans do not know how to save for retirement let alone how much According to the 1998 National Summit on Retirement Savings the nation must do a better job of educating the public employers and individuals alike about the importance of saving more today to secure the nation s retirement security 35 Increasing personal saving is vital to enhancing individual households retirement security to increasing national saving available to invest in the nation s capital stock and ultimately to reducing the burden on future generations of financing government programs for the elderly As mandated by the SAVER Act the Department of Labor maintains an outreach program to raise public awareness about the advantages of saving and to help educate workers about how much they need to save for retirement The Department of Labor s original Retirement Savings Education Campaign was launched in 1995 in partnership with the 35Final Report on The National Summit on Retirement Savings Department of Labor September 1998 This bipartisan summit held June 4 5 1998 was mandated by the SAVER Act Additional national summits are to be held in 2001 and 2005 Page 104 GAO 01 591SP National Saving Department of the Treasury and other public and private organizations 36 The SAVER Act also requires the Department of Labor to coordinate with similar efforts undertaken by other public and private organizations In addition to the Department of Labor s outreach program other federal agencies also play a role in saving education The Securities and Exchange Commission s Office of Investor Education and Assistance promotes financial literacy and seeks to encourage Americans to save wisely and plan for the future The Administration on Aging and FirstGov for Seniors also provide information to educate the public about how they can better prepare for a more financially secure retirement In 2000 the Department of the Treasury launched the National Partners for Financial Empowerment This new coalition planned to raise public awareness about the importance of financial literacy and saving and to help Americans develop the skills they need to take charge of their financial future Education campaigns to promote financial literacy and retirement saving represent a potentially valuable tool for encouraging people to save more Building on policymakers efforts to enhance tax incentives for retirement saving education campaigns are a means to convey easy to understand information about the variety of saving vehicles available 37 Efforts such as the Department of Labor s saving outreach program can serve as a catalyst to educate employers about pension plan options they can offer to their employees as well as to encourage individuals to save more on their own behalf Public education campaigns are one way to get people started with retirement planning The key steps are to calculate how much income they need to retire estimate how much retirement income they can expect from Social Security and employer sponsored pensions and decide how much more they need to save Individualized Social Security statements now sent annually by the Social Security Administration to most workers aged 25 and older provide important information for personal retirement planning The statement provides estimates of potential retirement disability and survivor benefits It also asks statement recipients to check their listed earnings to help correct errors and ensure benefits are correct when workers retire become disabled or die The newly revised statement more successfully 36These public private partnerships were a catalyst in 1995 for forming the American Savings Education Council This coalition of public and private entities undertakes initiatives aimed at raising public awareness about personal finance and retirement planning 37Appendix IV includes a list of educational websites on saving Page 105 GAO 01 591SP National Saving Q4 10 How Would Social Security Reform Affect National Saving meets its purpose of providing basic information to individual workers but further improvement is always possible 38 For example readers may not understand that the current dollar estimates provided reflect today s price level not the price level that will exist when they actually start to receive benefits The Social Security Administration will need to continue to review and streamline the statement to make it clearer and easier to understand Individualized Social Security statements also explain that Social Security benefits were not intended to be the only source of retirement income and the statements encourage workers to supplement their benefits with pensions and personal saving Once they know their Social Security benefits promised under current law workers can calculate how much they can expect from employer sponsored pension plans and how much they need to save on their own for retirement 39 Knowing more about Social Security s financial status would help workers to understand how to view their personal benefit estimates As discussed in section 1 Social Security benefits are projected to exceed the program s cash revenue in 2016 and the trust fund will be depleted in 2038 At that time Social Security revenue would only be sufficient to pay for roughly 73 percent of promised benefits The individualized statements disclose that absent a change in the law only a portion of the benefits estimated may be payable Knowing this can help workers understand that some combination of revenue increases and benefit reductions will be necessary to restore the program s long term solvency A4 10 Restoring Social Security to sustainable solvency and increasing saving are intertwined national goals Saving more today would alleviate the burden of financing Social Security commitments Increased saving and investing can lead to greater economic growth and a larger economy in turn would mean higher real wages resulting in more government revenue to pay benefits Social Security reform depending on the elements of the reform package and the timing of implementation could foster saving and 38Social Security Providing Useful Information to the Public GAO T HEHS 00 101 April 11 2000 39The Social Security Administration also offers an online retirement planner with calculators to help workers understand how much they can expect from Social Security under different retirement scenarios Page 106 GAO 01 591SP National Saving provide resources for capital formation and economic growth Prompt action is vital because economic growth is a long term process A bigger economic pie would make it easier for future workers to meet the dual challenges of paying for the baby boomers retirement while achieving a rising standard of living for themselves For individuals and the nation as a whole saving more means forgoing consumption today in order to consume more in the future However this trade off between today s consumption and tomorrow s consumption is somewhat different for an individual than for the nation When an individual delays retirement saving that individual enjoys the additional consumption in the early years and then personally bears the burden of saving larger amounts later working longer or accepting a lower standard of living in retirement From the nation s perspective if current generations forgo saving for their retirement costs they also forgo investment opportunities and the economic growth that would result Therefore their saving choices affect not only their own retirement income but also potentially affect the standard of living for future workers Greater economic growth from saving more now could alleviate the burden that a slow growing workforce will bear in producing the goods and services to be consumed by a society with a large retired population that consumes but does not work In other respects saving for the nation s retirement costs is analogous to an individual s retirement preparations The sooner we begin the less we have to save per year and the greater our benefit from compounding growth The conventional measure of Social Security solvency is gauged in terms of the actuarial balance of the program s trust fund over a 75 year period According to the Social Security Trustees 2001 intermediate projections restoring the program s actuarial balance over the next 75 years would require a combination of reform options equal to 1 86 percent of taxable payroll In simple terms increasing payroll taxes by 1 86 percent a 15percent increase over the 2001 rate paid by employers and workers now could head off a Social Security shortfall for 75 years Delaying reform until Social Security s insolvency is imminent would necessitate drastic changes over a shorter period Absent reform by 2038 Social Security s annual deficit would require cutting benefits by about a quarter 26 percent or raising payroll taxes by about a third 35 percent just to restore balance for that year Restoring Social Security s long term solvency will require some combination of increased revenues and reduced expenditures Various options are available within the current structure of the program including raising the retirement age reducing the cost of living adjustment altering the benefit formula increasing payroll taxes and investing trust fund surpluses in higher yielding assets In addition some proposals would fundamentally alter the program structure by setting up individual retirement accounts Before trying to explore how various reform options might affect national saving it is useful to highlight how the current Social Security program affects personal saving the Social Security trust fund and government saving Personal saving As discussed in Q1 5 some evidence suggests that the existence of Social Security may have reduced personal saving The retirement benefits promised under current law reduce the amount people believe they need to save on their own for retirement Although some may view their payroll tax contributions as a form of retirement saving workers need to understand that their contributions are not deposited into interest bearing accounts for each individual but are largely used to finance current benefits Social Security trust fund In the federal budget a trust fund is simply an accounting mechanism to record earmarked receipts and expenditures 40 From Social Security s perspective its annual cash surpluses are saved in the trust fund and the trust fund balance represents resources accumulated to help pay future benefits However the accumulation and exhaustion of the trust fund s balance does not reflect how Social Security finances affect federal government and national saving The extent to which cash surpluses saved in the Social Security trust fund translate into increased national saving depends on federal saving as a whole Although the trust fund appears solvent until 2038 Social Security will begin dissaving at the point that program cash deficits emerge in 2016 shown in figure 1 8 Government saving For the years since the 1983 reforms until 1998 Social Security surpluses partially offset a deficit in all other 40For more information about trust funds in the federal budget see Federal Trust and Other Earmarked Funds Answers to Frequently Asked Questions GAO 01 199SP January 2001 Page 108 GAO 01 591SP National Saving government accounts within the unified budget 41 In effect Social Security surpluses reduced the magnitude of government dissaving and the government s need to borrow from the public Since 1998 when the federal government began running unified surpluses policymakers appear to have agreed to using the Social Security surpluses to reduce federal debt held by the public and these amounts would translate dollar for dollar into government saving When the trust fund begins running cash deficits in 2016 the government as a whole must come up with the cash to finance Social Security s cash deficit by reducing any projected non Social Security surpluses borrowing from the public raising other taxes or reducing other government spending The Save the Social Security Surpluses simulation illustrates the magnitude of fiscal challenges associated with our aging society Absent reform Social Security deficits would contribute to government dissaving shown in figure 4 2 and greatly constrain budgetary flexibility over the long run shown in figure 4 3 In evaluating reform proposals it is important to consider whether a reform package will truly increase national saving and grow the economic pie From a macroeconomic perspective increasing the trust fund s balance without underlying reform does nothing to enhance the government s fiscal capacity to finance future benefits For example crediting additional securities to the trust fund or increasing the interest rate paid on the trust fund s securities would commit additional future general revenue to the Social Security program but does not increase the government s overall revenue or reduce its costs Reforms that reallocate the composition of the nation s saving and asset portfolio may serve only to redistribute the existing pie For example individual accounts discussed more fully in Q4 11 affect the contributions of government and personal saving relative to national saving Investing Social Security surpluses in the stock market affects the government s asset holdings but does not directly increase national saving As we reported in 1998 potentially higher returns albeit with greater risk on the government s stock holdings could boost Social Security s financing and reduce the size of other revenue increases or benefit 41During the late 1970s and early 1980s Social Security s expenditures regularly exceeded revenues causing a rapid decline in the trust fund s balance and raising concerns about the program s solvency In response the Congress passed reforms in 1977 and 1983 that together were intended to assure Social Security s solvency for a 75 year period Page 109 GAO 01 591SP National Saving reductions needed to restore solvency 42 Acquiring stocks or other nonfederal financial assets would have approximately the same effect on national saving as using the same amount of money to reduce debt held by the public If reducing federal debt held by the public is not an option as discussed in text box 4 2 investing in nonfederal financial assets on behalf of the Social Security trust fund could be another way for government saving to provide resources for private investment Most traditional reform options involve workers paying more for promised benefits or getting lower benefits From the government s perspective increasing payroll taxes or reducing benefits would improve Social Security s finances and increase government saving assuming no other changes in government spending or taxes The ultimate effect of Social Security reform on national saving depends on complex interactions between government saving and personal saving both through pension funds and by individuals on their own behalf The way in which Social Security is reformed will influence both the magnitude and timing of any increase in national saving To illustrate the complexities in evaluating how traditional program reforms might affect national saving let s examine two basic options that would directly improve Social Security s financial imbalance increasing payroll taxes and reducing benefits Payroll tax increases At first glance increasing payroll taxes appears to be a straightforward way to increase saving now to take advantage of compounding growth Payroll tax increases are easy to implement and directly improve the trust fund s finances However the extent to which payroll tax increases would translate into increased government saving depends on whether the cash generated by the payroll tax increase is used to finance new spending or a general tax cut Thus increased Social Security surpluses will not necessarily increase government saving Even if the federal government saves all of the increased Social Security surpluses national saving would not increase dollar for dollar Changes in personal saving may counterbalance any increase in government saving resulting from higher taxes Higher payroll taxes may depress personal saving to the extent that households have less disposable income to save How people adjust their saving in response to payroll tax increases may also depend on the form of the increase 42Social Security Financing Implications of Government Stock Investing for the Trust Fund the Federal Budget and the Economy GAO AIMD HEHS 98 74 April 22 1998 Page 110 GAO 01 591SP National Saving Raising the payroll tax rate would affect all workers whereas increasing the maximum taxable earning level would affect high income earners Benefit reductions Options reducing initial benefits or raising the retirement age take time to implement or phase in allowing time for people to adjust their retirement plans Reducing future benefits obviously reduces future spending for Social Security retirement benefits and stems government dissaving At first glance reducing future benefits promised to current workers would not seem to increase resources available to invest now However changes in personal saving may complement any increase in government saving resulting from benefit reductions If Social Security reform reduces anticipated retirement income many analysts expect that workers might to some degree want to offset this effect by increasing their saving outside the Social Security system If people adjust their retirement plan to reflect benefit reductions increased personal saving today could provide new resources to invest For example raising the retirement age reduces benefits and could induce some individuals to save more now in order to retire before they are eligible for Social Security In evaluating a Social Security reform proposal it is important to consider that increasing national saving is one criterion in assessing the extent to which the proposal achieves sustainable solvency Beyond weighing how a proposal would affect the federal budget and the economy policymakers need to consider the balance struck between the twin goals of income adequacy level and certainty of benefits and individual equity rates of return on individual contributions 43 Reform elements that could increase national saving may not satisfy these adequacy and equity goals For example benefit cuts depending on how they are structured could leave those most reliant on Social Security with inadequate retirement income Also increasing payroll taxes reduces the implicit rate of return for future beneficiaries It is crucial to evaluate the effects of an entire reform package considering interactions between individual reform elements as well as how the package as a whole achieves policymakers most important goals for Social Security 43For more information about the analytical framework for assessing Social Security reform proposals offered by GAO see Social Security Criteria for Evaluating Social Security Reform Proposals GAO T HEHS 99 94 March 25 1999 and Social Security Evaluating Reform Proposals GAO AIMD HEHS 00 29 November 4 1999 Page 111 GAO 01 591SP National Saving Q4 11 How Would Establishing Individual Accounts Affect National Saving A4 11 Evaluating the potential effect of proposals to establish individual accounts can be confusing Various proposals have been advanced that would create a new system of individual accounts as part of comprehensive Social Security reform while other proposals would create new accounts outside of Social Security Individual account proposals also differ as to whether individuals participation would be mandatory or voluntary As we have previously reported the extent to which individual accounts would affect national saving depends on how they are financed how the program is structured and how people adjust their own saving behavior in response to individual accounts 44 To understand how individual accounts might affect national saving it is necessary to examine the first order effects accounting for how the government might fund the accounts and then to consider how people might adjust their saving in response to a new account program One important determinant of the effect on national saving is the funding source for the individual accounts Shifting funds from the federal government would affect the relative contributions of the federal government and households to national saving For instance diverting funding from the Social Security trust fund such as a carve out from current payroll taxes would likely reduce government saving by the same amount that the accounts increase personal saving Although national saving would be unchanged financing of the Social Security program absent other changes would be worsened If accounts are funded outside of the Social Security system using general revenues the effect on national saving is unclear and would depend on what would have been done instead with the general funds If the general funds would have been used to redeem federal debt held by the public or acquire nonfederal financial assets national saving initially would be unchanged because personal saving would increase by the amount that government saving decreases In a sense individual accounts could serve as a way to channel saving through the government into resources for private investment while avoiding issues associated with government ownership of nonfederal assets 44See Social Security Capital Markets and Educational Issues Associated With Individual Accounts GAO GGD 99 115 June 28 1999 Page 112 GAO 01 591SP National Saving If the general funds would have been spent on additional government consumption then any increase in personal saving due to the individual accounts would represent an increase in national saving If the general funds would have been used for infrastructure investment national saving would be unchanged but more funds would be available for private investment If the general funds would have been used for a general tax cut then national saving would initially increase because personal saving would increase by the amount of individual accounts whereas some portion of a tax cut would be consumed National saving also would be affected by how households and businesses respond to individual accounts Regardless of the financing source the effect of individual accounts would be to raise at least to some extent the level of personal saving unless households fully offset the new accounts by reducing their other saving Households for whom individual accounts closely resemble 401 k s and IRAs and who are currently saving as much as they choose for retirement would probably reduce their own saving in the presence of individual accounts The extent of the behavioral effects would depend in part on the structure of the individual account program and any limits on accessing the funds For instance mandatory account proposals are more likely to increase private saving because such a program would require households that do not currently save such as many low income individuals or families to place some amount in an individual account Prohibitions or restrictions on borrowing or other forms of pre retirement distributions could limit the ability of some households to reduce their other saving in response to individual accounts In addition to the effects on household saving choices individual accounts may also affect the relationship and interactions between Social Security and private pensions 45 45Social Security Reform Implications for Private Pensions GAO HEHS 00 187 September 14 2000 Page 113 GAO 01 591SP National Saving Q4 12 How Would Medicare Reform Affect National Saving A4 12 As we have reported the current Medicare program without improvements is ill suited to serve future generations of Americans 46 The program is fiscally unsustainable in its current form and growing Medicare spending is expected to drive federal government dissaving over the long run Despite this looming financial problem pressure is mounting to update Medicare s outdated benefit design Given the aging of the U S population and the increasing cost of modern medical technology it is inevitable that demands on the Medicare program will grow In addition to the aging population and the increasing cost of modern medical technology the current Medicare program lacks incentives to control health care consumption The actual costs of health care are not transparent and third party payers generally insulate consumers from the cost of health care decisions In traditional Medicare for example the effect of cost sharing provisions designed to curb the use of services is muted because many Medicare beneficiaries have some form of supplemental health care coverage such as Medigap insurance that pays these costs For these reasons among others Medicare presents a great fiscal challenge over the long term In the past Medicare s fiscal health has generally been gauged by the solvency of the HI trust fund projected over a 75 year period Although the HI trust fund is viewed as solvent through 2029 HI outlays are predicted to exceed HI revenues beginning in 2016 According to the Medicare Trustees 2001 intermediate assumption restoring the HI program s actuarial balance over the next 75 years would require a combination of reform options equal to 1 97 percent of taxable payroll In other words averting a HI shortfall for 75 years now would require an increase in payroll taxes by 1 97 percent a 68 percent increase over the 2001 rate paid by employers and workers47 a cut in HI spending by 37 percent or some combination of the two According to the Office of the Actuary at the Health Care Financing Administration the estimated net present value of future additional resources needed to fund HI benefits alone over the 75 years is 4 6 trillion 46Medicare Higher Expected Spending and Call for New Benefit Underscore Need for Meaningful Reform GAO 01 539T March 22 2001 See appendix V for other GAO products related to Medicare financing and reform 47Medicare payroll taxes are paid on all earnings whereas Social Security payroll taxes apply to earnings up to an annual maximum 76 200 in 2000 Page 114 GAO 01 591SP National Saving But these estimates do not reflect the growing cost of the SMI component which accounts for somewhat more than 40 percent of Medicare spending When viewed from the perspective of federal saving and the economy the growth in total Medicare spending will be become increasingly burdensome over the long run According to the Medicare Trustees 2001 intermediate estimates Medicare costs will grow at 1 percentage point above the growth in GDP per capita each year 48 As shown in figure 4 5 total Medicare spending Part A HI and Part B SMI combined is expected to consume 5 percent of GDP by 2035 more than double today s share of 2 percent By 2075 Medicare would consume over 8 percent of GDP according to the Medicare Trustees 2001 intermediate estimates 49 Under the Save the Social Security Surpluses simulation federal health care spending will greatly constrain budgetary flexibility shown in figure 4 3 Absent cost containment reforms Medicare spending would contribute to federal dissaving over the long term even if the unified surpluses projected over the next decade are saved 48These latest actuarial projections incorporate more realistic assumptions about long term health care spending and as result Medicare spending is expected to grow faster than previously estimated For further discussion of the Medicare Trustees 2001 estimates see Medicare Higher Expected Spending and Call for New Benefit Underscore Need for Meaningful Reform GAO

Health Care Financing Administration Although future Medicare costs are expected to consume a growing share of the federal budget and the economy pressure is mounting to expand Medicare s benefit package to cover prescription drugs which will add billions to Medicare program costs It is a given that prescription drugs play a far greater role in health care now than when Medicare was created Today Medicare beneficiaries tend to need and use more drugs than other Americans Overall the nation s spending on prescription drugs has been increasing about twice as fast as spending on other health care services and it is expected to keep growing Adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare will be costly but the cost consequences ultimately depend on choices about the benefit s scope and financing Any option to expand Medicare s benefit package absent other reforms runs the risk of exacerbating the program s fiscal imbalance and increasing government dissaving Any substantial benefit reform should be coupled with adequate and effective cost containment measures to avoid worsening Medicare s long range financial condition Ultimately we will need to look at broader health care reforms to balance health care spending with other societal priorities It is important to note the fundamental differences between health care wants which are virtually unlimited needs which should be defined and addressed and overall affordability which has a limit Realistically reforms to address Medicare s huge long range financial imbalance will need to proceed incrementally To avoid more painful and disruptive changes once the baby boomers begin retiring the time to begin these difficult but necessary steps is now Reform options that reduce Medicare s growth rates or strengthen the program s underlying sustainability would raise future levels of government saving assuming no other changes in government spending and taxes However the effect of reduced federal Medicare spending on national saving depends on how the private sector responds to the reductions For example greater private spending for elderly health care by beneficiaries themselves or by employers and insurers on beneficiaries behalf could offset some or all of the improvement in government saving in the short run Over time personal saving could increase if individuals choose to save more to pay for health care in their old age Section 5 National Saving and Current Policy Issues Q5 1 What Are Key Issues in Evaluating National Saving A5 1 Each generation is a steward for the economy it bequeaths to future generations and the nation s long term economic future depends in part on today s decisions about consumption and saving The federal government has gone from the budget deficits of recent decades to surplus as a result of a growing economy and difficult decisions to reduce deficits We appear at least for the near future to have slain the deficit dragon However today s fiscal good fortune will not survive over the long run If the prospect of surpluses over the next decade lulls us into complacency the nation could face daunting demographic challenges without having changed the path of programs for the elderly or having built the economic capacity to bear the costs of the programs as currently structured Economic growth will help society bear the burden of financing Social Security and Medicare but it alone will not solve the long term fiscal challenge Increasing the nation s economic capacity is a long term process Thus saving now and making meaningful Social Security and Medicare reform sooner rather than later are important Because every generation is in part responsible for the economy it passes on to the next today s fiscal policy choices must be informed by the long term Common sense tells us that the nation needs to save more when it has a healthy economy sufficient resources to meet some current needs while still building our capacity for the future and a relatively large workforce National saving pays future dividends but we need to begin soon to permit compounding to work for us From a macroeconomic perspective it does not matter who does the saving any mix of increased saving by households businesses and government would help to grow the economic pie Yet in light of the virtual disappearance of personal saving concerns about U S reliance on borrowing from abroad to finance domestic investment and the looming fiscal pressures of an aging population now is an opportune time for the federal government to save some portion of its anticipated budget surpluses Higher federal saving to the extent that the increased government saving is not offset by reduced private saving would increase national saving and tend to improve the nation s current account balance although typically not on a dollar for dollar basis In considering how much of the anticipated budget surpluses to save policy choices must balance today s unmet needs and tomorrow s fiscal challenges Saving the surpluses would allow the federal government to reduce the debt overhang from past deficit spending and enhance future budgetary flexibility Choices about federal spending for infrastructure education and R D as well as tax incentives for private saving and investment also have implications for future economic growth Increased government saving and entitlement reform go hand in hand Over the long term the federal government cannot avoid massive dissaving without reforming retirement and health programs for the elderly Increasing national saving and thus long term economic growth is crucial to the long term sustainable solvency of Social Security and Medicare Since the economy provides the tax base for the government economic growth increases government revenue which helps finance these programs as well as other federal programs and activities and increases budget flexibility But saving and economic growth alone cannot solve the looming demographic challenges Saving the Social Security surpluses and even the Medicare surpluses is not enough by itself to finance the government s commitments to the elderly Program reform is needed as well or Social Security and Medicare will constitute a heavy drain on the earnings of future workers In a sense saving more yields a bigger pie but policymakers will still face the difficult choice of how to divide the pie between retirees and workers The federal government can also undertake steps to encourage personal saving Saving education campaigns are one tool to encourage people to save more for their own retirement To participate in the debate over how to reform Social Security and Medicare the public needs to understand the difficult choices the nation faces Announcing any benefits changes sooner rather than later would make it easier for individuals to plan for retirement and to adjust their saving behavior accordingly The federal government can explore how to design tax incentives that induce households to save enough to make up for the government s revenue loss and the lower government saving that would result Appendix I Objectives Scope and Methodology Personal Saving Household Wealth and Retirement Security This report is designed to present information about national saving and its implications for economic growth and retirement security Specifically this report addresses the following questions 1 What is personal saving how is it related to national saving and what are the implications of low personal saving for Americans retirement security 2 What is national saving and how does current saving in the United States compare to historical trends and saving in other countries 3 How does national saving affect the economy and how would higher saving affect the longterm outlook 4 How does federal fiscal policy affect national saving what federal policies have been aimed at increasing private saving and how would Social Security and Medicare reform affect national saving And 5 what are key issues in evaluating national saving Because this report focuses on the macroeconomic implications of saving and investment we used saving data from the National Income and Product Accounts NIPA compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis BEA 1 This report presents the trend in the personal saving rate as measured on a NIPA basis As a comparison point we also examined an alternative personal saving rate available from the Federal Reserve s Flow of Funds Accounts FFA 2 Because FFA counts household purchases of consumer durables as saving the FFA personal saving rate is somewhat higher than the NIPA personal saving rate but also shows a downward trend Both the NIPA and FFA measures focus on saving as a flow from the economy s current production and do not include changes in the market value of households existing portfolios For information about the stock of wealth accumulated by households we obtained net worth data from the FFAs balance sheet aggregated for the household sector In addition to 1The NIPA data presented throughout this report reflect changes made in the 11th comprehensive revision of the national accounts in 1999 including the reclassification of software purchases as investment which is discussed in Q2 5 Historical NIPA data were downloaded from BEA s website www bea doc gov bea dnl htm and reflect

March 9 2001 National Saving and Investment these macroeconomic data we used results from the Federal Reserve s 1998 Survey of Consumer Finance to present a snapshot of individual households net worth by income level 3 Fully exploring the dynamics of personal saving behavior and gauging the adequacy of retirement saving are beyond the scope of this national saving report The literature attempting to explain why and how people save or do not save as the case may be is extensive and the empirical research is conflicting For this report we provide an overview of the major theories about why people save and describe various factors associated with the decline in personal saving Appendix IV lists the major references used in preparing this report For demographic trends and the financial outlook for the Social Security and Medicare Hospital Insurance programs we used the intermediate actuarial projections which reflect the best estimate of the Social Security and Medicare Boards of Trustees We also examined income sources and amounts for those aged 65 and older using the Social Security Administration s Income of the Population 55 or Older 1998 4 We also used NIPA data to describe historical trends in 1 U S national saving by component 2 domestic and foreign investment in the United States and 3 the U S net international investment position To provide a long term perspective we focused on saving trends over the last 4 decades from 1960 to 2000 We also compared U S national saving to the saving of other major industrialized nations Specifically we relied on national saving data for the G 7 nations Canada France Germany Italy 3The Survey of Consumer Finances is a triennial survey of U S families sponsored by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve with the cooperation of the Department of the Treasury For results from the latest Survey of Consumer Finance see Arthur B Kennickell Martha Starr McCluer and Brian J Surette Recent Changes in U S

Census Bureau data from the Current Population Survey Long Term Simulations Japan the United Kingdom and the United States compiled by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 5 Our national saving trend analysis is based on current NIPA definitions of saving and investment We also examined literature that presents other ways of thinking about national saving For example a broader saving and investment measure might encompass spending on education as well as research and development These are not included in the conventional NIPA measures but are related to long term productive capacity We used our long term economic growth model to simulate alternative fiscal policies and national saving rates Long term simulations are useful for comparing the potential outcomes of alternative saving rates within a common economic framework Such simulations can help policymakers assess the long term consequences of fiscal policy and saving choices made today While long term simulations provide a useful perspective they should be interpreted carefully Given the range of uncertainty about future economic changes and the responses to those changes the simulation results should not be viewed as forecasts of budgetary or economic outcomes 50 or 75 years in the future Rather they should be seen only as illustrations of the different budget and economic outcomes associated with alternative fiscal policy and saving paths based on common demographic and economic assumptions In our simulations we used a model originally developed by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that relates long term economic growth measured in terms of gross domestic product GDP to economic and budget factors The key interaction between the budget and the economy is the effect of the federal deficit surplus on the amount of national saving available for investment 6 Conversely the rate of economic growth helps determine the overall federal surplus or deficit through its effect on federal revenue and spending In our model the level of national saving affects investment and in turn GDP growth 5OECD National Income Account data were downloaded from Standard and Poor s DRI database 6Text box 4 1 explains how the NIPA surplus or deficit differs from the federal unified budget surplus or deficit Both measures are roughly similar as a share of GDP Page 124 GAO 01 591SP National Saving In general federal deficits measured on a NIPA basis represent dissaving they subtract from national saving by absorbing nonfederal funds that otherwise would be used for investment Conversely federal surpluses add to national saving While the NIPA measure of government saving directly affects national saving the unified budget measure is the more common frame of reference for discussing federal fiscal policy issues Our simulation results reflect unified budget deficits surpluses Our simulations are based on the Congressional Budget Office s CBO January 2001 10 year budgetary and economic projections7 through calendar year 2010 8 Beyond that we used long term actuarial projections for Social Security and Medicare 9 We assume that current law benefits are paid in full i e we assume that all promised Social Security benefits are paid even after the projected exhaustion of the OASDI Trust Funds in 2038 For Medicaid in the out years we used the growth rates from CBO s October 2000 long term analysis 10 Interest spending is determined by interest rates which are held constant over the long term and the level of federal debt held by the public which depends on the path of budget deficits surpluses within each simulation All other spending as well as federal revenue are assumed to grow at essentially the same rate as the economy In other words other spending and revenue both remain constant as shares of GDP Appendix II presents a more detailed description of the model and the assumptions we used We present two fiscal policy simulations 1 Save the Unified Surpluses and 2 Save the Social Security Surpluses The Save the Unified Surpluses simulation assumes the entire unified surpluses are saved and used to reduce federal debt held by the public The Save the Social Security 7The Budget and Economic Outlook Fiscal Years 2002 2011 Congressional Budget Office January 2001 8In our modeling all CBO budget projections were converted from a

II for more details about the Medicaid assumption Surpluses simulation assumes that only the Social Security surpluses are saved and used to reduce federal debt held by the public Unspecified policy actions spending increases and or tax cuts are taken that eliminate the non Social Security surpluses through 2010 These unspecified policy actions are left in place through the end of the simulation period For simplicity we assumed nonfederal saving saving by households businesses and state and local governments would remain constant as a share of GDP in both fiscal policy simulations As a reference point we also simulated a path assuming that national saving remains constant at the 2000 level of 18 3 percent of GDP The Constant 2000 National Saving Rate simulation reflects an unspecified mix of saving by households businesses and all levels of government To provide a useful perspective on how alternative levels of national saving affect future living standards we also compared our simulation results to a historical benchmark In the United States GDP per capita has doubled about every 35 years Since World War II annual growth in GDP per capita has averaged roughly 2 percent Of course growth was faster during some periods the 1950s and 1960s and the second half of the 1990s and slower during other periods the 1970s Doubling GDP per capita every 35 years represents a way to gauge whether future generations will enjoy a rise in living standards comparable to that enjoyed by previous generations While this report discusses the potential consequences of alternative saving paths it does not suggest any particular course of action The choice of the most appropriate fiscal policy path is a policy decision to be made by the Congress and the President While fiscal policy is the most direct way to increase national saving how much the nation saves also depends on the saving choices of households and businesses We did our work in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards from December 1999 through May 2001 in Washington D C We requested comments from BEA OMB and several subject matter experts Staff from BEA and OMB and the experts we consulted provided technical and clarifying comments which we incorporated in this report where appropriate Appendix II The Economic Model and Key Assumptions In this report we simulated the effect of different saving rates on the nation s standard of living using a standard model of economic growth originally developed by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York The major determinants of economic growth in the model are changes in the labor force capital formation and the growth in total factor productivity To analyze the effect of fiscal policy on saving and growth we modified the original model to include a set of relationships that describe the federal budget and its links to the economy using the framework of the National Income and Product Accounts NIPA To isolate the effect of changes in saving on growth we varied the saving rate while using the same assumptions for the growth in the labor force and total factor productivity The model is helpful for exploring the long term implications of national saving and fiscal policy and for comparing alternative paths within a common economic framework Since 1992 GAO has provided the Congress with a long term perspective on alternative fiscal policy paths 1 The results provide illustrations rather than precise forecasts of the economic outcomes associated with alternative policy or saving rate assumptions The model depicts the links between saving and the economy over the long term and does not reflect their interrelationships during short term business cycles We have made several simplifying assumptions such as holding interest rates and total factor productivity growth constant but sensitivity analyses suggest that variations in these assumptions generally would not affect the relative outcomes of alternative policies These simulations are not predictions of what will happen in the future as policymakers would likely take action to prevent damaging out year fiscal and economic consequences Overview of the Model In the model GDP is determined by the labor force capital stock and total factor productivity GDP in turn influences nonfederal saving which 1See Budget

GDP also helps determine the NIPA federal budget surplus or deficit Nonfederal and federal saving together compose national saving which influences investment and the next period s capital stock Capital combines with labor and total factor productivity to determine GDP in the next period and the process continues The model allows us to focus on the contribution of national saving to output and living standards through the linkage between saving and the capital stock In particular the model provides a useful framework for assessing the long term implications of alternative budget policies through their effect on national saving Our model does not differentiate between tax policy changes and spending changes The aggregate effect on the amount of federal government saving is what affects the level of national saving and economic growth Federal surpluses increase national saving while deficits reduce national saving and higher saving translates into higher GDP Higher GDP in turn lessens the share of the nation s output dedicated to government transfer programs in our modeling because we use a simplifying assumption that such programs do not simply keep pace with overall economic growth 2 In our simulations we make the simplifying assumption that the combined saving rate of the household business and state and local government sectors will remain constant throughout the simulation period at 16 1 percent of GDP average nonfederal saving as a share of GDP since 1998 3 Future saving rates of these sectors will of course vary in response to a variety of influences such as demographics expectations and changes in preferences Nonetheless this simplifying assumption allows us to assess the effect of budget policy on saving investment and output in the future Labor Input Economic growth is partly dependent on how much labor is employed In our simulations we used the labor input assumptions of the Social Security Administration actuaries underlying the intermediate projections in 2A more sophisticated approach would be to model the feedbacks between the economy and government transfer programs because economic growth tends to increase health spending and raise retirement benefits although with a lengthy lag for the latter 3The 3 year period coincides with federal surpluses and its use avoids extending the unusually low nonfederal saving rate of 2000 throughout the simulation period Page 128 GAO 01 591SP National Saving Total Factor Productivity The 2001 Annual Report of the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old Age and Survivors Insurance and Disability Trust Funds The intermediate projections which reflect the Trustees best estimate reflect changes in the working age population particularly the increasing rate of retirement by the baby boom generation after 2010 They also reflect projections of labor force participation rates unemployment rates and weekly hours worked The demographic and economic assumptions imply a sharp drop in the average annual growth of aggregate hours worked from 0 7 percent through 2010 to 0 2 percent from 2020 through 2075 The three sources of economic growth in the model are increased labor input capital accumulation and the advance of total factor productivity 4 The latter is a catch all category reflecting sources of growth not captured in straightforward measures of aggregate labor input and aggregate physical capital employed These include not only the improvements in products and processes yielded by advancing technology but also the improved quality of labor and capital inputs reallocation of inputs to uses where they are more productive and improvements in physical and social infrastructure Our simulations assume that total factor productivity growth in the nonfarm business sector will average 1 5 percent annually over the 75 year period Basically we used the productivity assumption underlying CBO s January 2001 10 year budget projections In its most recent long term modeling report CBO assumed total factor productivity growth of 1 7 percent beyond 2010 5 The intermediate projections in the 2001 OASDI Trustees report assume that labor productivity for the entire economy will increase 1 5 percent annually over the next 75 years The Trustees longterm assumption reflects the average labor productivity growth over the 4The Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS publishes an official measure of output per unit of combined labor and capital inputs multifactor productivity BLS measure of labor input not only takes into account changes in the size of the labor force but also changes in its composition as measured by education and work experience Capital inputs are measured in terms of efficiency or service flow rather than price or value For more information on multifactor productivity see Productivity Measure Business Sector and Major Subsectors BLS Handbook of Methods Bureau of Labor Statistics April 1997 pp 89 98 and Edwin R Dean and Michael J Harper The BLS Productivity Measurement Program Bureau of Labor Statistics July 5 2000 paper presented to the NBER Conference on Research in Income and Wealth on New Directions in Productivity Analysis March 20 21 1998 5The Long Term Budget Outlook Congressional Budget Office October 2000 International Financial Flows last 30 years and would correspond to a lower assumption for total factor productivity growth than CBO s most recent assumption Our use of CBO s January 2001 10 year assumption for total factor productivity growth throughout the 75 year simulation period places our long term assumption between the Trustees and CBO s current long term assumptions There are also important links between national saving and investment and the international sector In an open economy such as the United States an increase in saving due to for example an increase in the federal budget surplus may not result in an equivalent increase in domestic investment Instead part of the increased saving may flow abroad in the form of an increase in U S net foreign investment The income earned on U S owned foreign assets adds to the nation s income GNP The portion of an increase in national saving used for domestic investment adds to the capital stock available for workers to produce goods and services in the United States GDP The model incorporates a simple representation of net financial flows between the U S economy and the rest of the world Essentially the rest of the world is treated as analogous to a bank where the United States can make deposits or withdrawals or draw on a credit line Every year there are income flows to or from this bank corresponding to interest received on deposits or paid on advances The amount corresponding to the bank balance positive or negative is called the net international investment position NIIP of the United States which generates a net flow of income receipts A key model assumption affecting international flows is the allocation of gross saving between its foreign and domestic investment uses Over the long run we assume that market forces such as adjustments in exchange rates interest rates and prices will tend to move net foreign investment and the current account balance towards zero To reflect this tendency to move towards equilibrium we hold net foreign investment constant at the nominal dollar level in 2000 This reduces the ratio of net foreign investment to GDP over time as GDP grows Changes in national saving cause the ratio of net foreign investment to GDP to move around its longterm trend We assume that net foreign investment rises by one third of any increase in the national saving rate Basically for each additional dollar saved about 66 6 cents are used for domestic investment and 33 3 cents are invested abroad Conversely each dollar decrease in national saving is offset by 33 3 cents in foreign investment in the United States Our Budget and Other Assumptions assumption is consistent with the strong correlation between national saving and domestic investment that persists even in the context of a global 6 economy This is a highly stylized representation of the foreign sector of one country in isolation A more sophisticated approach would be to model a changing international environment in detail A more detailed approach would confront major uncertainties concerning the actual course of world economic development exchange rates and rates of return Table II 1 lists the key assumptions incorporated in the model Several of the assumptions used tend to provide conservative estimates of the benefit of running surpluses or lower deficits and of the harm of increasing deficits The interest rate on the national debt is held constant for example even when deficits climb and the national saving rate plummets Under such conditions the more likely result would be a rise in the rate of interest and a more rapid increase in federal interest payments than our simulations display Another conservative assumption is that the rate of total factor productivity growth is unaffected by the amount of investment Productivity is assumed to advance 1 5 percent each year through the end of the simulation period even if investment collapses Finally one third of any saving decline is assumed to be offset by net inflows of foreign capital even in the event of a dramatic saving decline that might set off a flight of capital from the United States Such assumptions tend to moderate the effect of changes in national saving in our simulations Sensitivity analyses reveal that variations in these assumptions generally would not affect the relative outcomes of alternative policies 6See Martin Feldstein and Philippe Bacchetta National Saving and International

intermediate projections of the 2001 OASDI Trustees Report 10 Long term Medicare spending reflects the intermediate projections of the 2001 HI and SMI Trustees Reports 11 the long term Medicaid spending path reflects CBO s October 2000 long term projections 12 We assume that current law benefits are paid in full even after the projected exhaustion of the OASDI and HI Trust Funds Other mandatory spending is a residual category consisting of all non Social Security nonhealth mandatory spending It is equivalent to CBO s NIPA projection for Transfers Grants and Subsidies less Health OASDI and other discretionary spending Through 2010 CBO assumptions are the main determinant of other mandatory spending after which it grows at the same rate as GDP In our Save the Unified Surpluses base simulation receipts follow CBO s dollar projections through 2010 Thereafter receipts remain at 20 2 percent of GAO s simulated GDP on a NIPA basis which is the rate that CBO projects for 2010 On a unified budget basis revenues remain at 20 4 percent of GDP after 2010 9If spending were to keep pace with population growth and inflation over the long term discretionary spending would generally grow slower than the economy and the long term budget surplus deficit would be improved For example see Analytical Perspectives Budget of the United States Government Fiscal Year 2001 Executive Office

Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund March 2001 12CBO s long term health care cost growth assumptions are generally consistent with those in the 2001 Medicare Trustees Reports Both CBO and the Medicare Trustees generally assume per beneficiary costs to grow at GDP per capita plus 1 percentage point over the long term See The Long Term Budget Outlook Congressional Budget Office October 2000 and the 2001 HI and SMI Trustees Reports Our interest rate assumption for 2000 through 2005 is consistent with the average rate on the debt held by the public implied by CBO s interest payment projections in its baseline To avoid the substantial volatility in the implied interest rate after 2005 as a result of declining debt interest rates are held constant at 5 4 percent the average interest rate assumed by CBO on short and long term Treasury securities from 2005 through the end of the simulation period This interest rate is both paid on outstanding debt held by the public and earned on nonfederal financial assets acquired by the government once debt held by the public is eliminated 13 Our simulation period from 2000 through 2075 coincides with the 75year period used for the Social Security Trustees Report where actuaries calculate trust fund solvency over a long term horizon that is at least as long as an individual s working life Because our model assumptions are based on current budget projections and recent long term actuarial projections for Social Security and Medicare our current model assumptions differ somewhat from those used in our earlier reports Also these simulations reflect discretionary spending growing with inflation after 2001 in our earlier reports discretionary spending was assumed to comply with statutory caps in effect through 2002 As a result these simulation results should not be compared directly to those in our earlier reports 13Under this interest rate assumption the level of net interest payments and net debt would be the same if the government began acquiring nonfederal financial assets before debt held by the public was eliminated Page 134 GAO 01 591SP National Saving Appendix III Glossary Wealth effect The change in
