 Special Sauce By Matt Miller posted Wednesday Aug 5 1998 Evening The Oval Office President Clinton works on papers at his desk A door opens and Monica Lewinsky enters carrying a large bag She is wearing a blue cocktail dress Clinton doesn t look up Monica waits a moment then speaks ML Hi Mr President BC Oh hi Monica Don t you look nice Why don t we go in here He motions to adjacent study It s more private He smiles ML Sure They walk into the study BC Did anyone see you come in ML No BC Do you think anyone knows what we re up to ML No To be honest I think the Secret Service guys think we re having an affair She giggles BC That s OK That s better than if they suspected the truth ML Don t you think people are going to wonder why I m here so much BC If I thought my science advisers would take me seriously I d go to them directly with this But I need some kind of proof or I m telling you they ll laugh their heads off ML Indicating bag I brought the hamburgers and the golf balls BC Good Did you remember to make them ML Big Macs And Titleists BC That s my intern He starts to line the balls up on the floor ML How d you get the idea again I want to get it right for our records Pulls out notebook and pen This could be historical someday BC It s like I said I was golfing with Vernon and when I was teed up on the 10 th I was finishing this Big Mac and some of the sauce fell off and went plop right on my Titleist I thought What the hell and just hit it and I swear to God it went 50 yards farther than any drive I d ever hit So I thought Maybe there s something to this ML Like Flubber when Robin Williams invented that stuff BC You can t imagine the applications this kind of thing could have That s why we ve got to be able to replicate it ML What does Mrs Clinton think BC I told her we can make some money on this after I leave office but she thinks I m useless in that department It s better to work on this when she s out of town She can always smell a Big Mac on me He finishes lining up the balls BC There Clinton reaches for a putter leaning against the wall and stands above the first ball OK Hand me a Big Mac Monica ML Here Mr President Clinton takes stock of himself with putter in one hand and hamburger in the other BC Quite a sight eh He s suddenly self conscious Hey Monica promise me you won t tell anyone about this ML She puts her pen down If it s important to you Mr President sure BC It s too embarrassing Let s keep it just between us If anyone ever presses you about all these visits just tell them we were having sex He laughs No one would care they all think I m fooling around anyway This they d run me out of town for A red phone rings Clinton both hands full turns abruptly to Monica BC Can you hold this Monica nods He hands her the Big Mac grabs the phone BC Boris Hi Yeah I m working on it now I ll let you know Yeah I promise He hangs up Monica is fussing with her dress BC What happened ML It s nothing She reaches for the Kleenex box on the end table BC Sees the stain I feel terrible It s my fault Let me get it cleaned for you ML That s OK Mr President I m sure it ll come out She brightens Or maybe I ll just save it As a souvenir of our little experiment BC Sure why not Thomas Edison s intern probably had a few popped bulbs in the closet herself Although ML What Mr President BC No forget it For a second I thought some people might get the wrong idea The longer I m in this job the more paranoid I get All right Ms Lewinsky back to work Clinton holds Big Mac over ball and swings putter back Monica stands poised with pen to record results Curtain More Flytrap
