 Dead Kennedys Drawn by the scent of blood in the water the media have swarmed the crash site of John F Kennedy Jr While pedestrian reporters investigate the disaster pundits debate the more entertaining question Why does this keep happening to the Kennedys Some say the whole family is reckless Others argue that the Kennedys are admirably bold and that it s unseemly to criticize them Each camp oversimplifies the truth There are two Kennedy traditions courage gravity and martyrdom on one side recklessness frivolity and mayhem on the other The recklessness spin fueled by talk radio and the Internet says the Kennedys seek adventure live close to the edge are wild and addicted to risk and have a dangerous streak This spin laughably equates all dangerous behavior Taking physical risks is a Kennedy family tradition says Newsweek During World War II the oldest son Joe Jr died on a virtual suicide mission Jack Kennedy chose PT boats rickety crafts whose crews boasted that they were expendable Bobby Kennedy s children always seemed to be falling out of trees To prove that young John Kennedy was reckless these spinners paste together weak bits of evidence As a boy he used to evade his Secret Service agents He once took a survival course Another time he went to Africa and was charged by a rhinoceros He learned through all these experiences to make light of danger asserts Newsweek Later he enjoyed rock climbing paragliding scuba diving kayaking and Rollerblading He asked permission to rappel down Mount Rushmore He launched a magazine demonstrating according to Reuters that like other members of his legendary family Kennedy had a taste for danger and took risks He invited Larry Flynt to a black tie dinner He even lived in an edgy warehouse district The courage spin puts an equally simplistic gloss of nobility on the family s escapades As questions about recklessness bounced around the Sunday talk shows Kennedy pal Douglas Brinkley argued that John Jr and the Kennedy family are in the arena and they re living a vigorous life They re bold agreed Sen Joe Lieberman D Conn They have always had courage They ve always wanted to live to the fullest Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen admonished critics It is an active family an achieving family and so its members have taken some chances The New York Times boasted that the Kennedys have always been risk takers in play politics and war At its best there is a certain nobility to the Kennedys refusal to let life intimidate them But not all the family s risk taking has been bold or wild Some Kennedys have been far more reckless than others Was John Kennedy s death reckless Let s consider the criteria 1 Who caused the tragedy Most of the coverage depicts John as the victim of a family curse The Kennedys are stalked by tragedy suffering bad luck or a near biblical blight that has been inflicted according to Mario Cuomo by gods Not only were Jack and Bobby assassinated but the younger generation of Kennedys has been haunted by bad news as well says the Post as if fate were picking them off laments Time This passive language obscures an important distinction Whereas Jack and Bobby were murdered the younger generation far from being haunted or picked off caused its own grief Joe overturned a jeep leaving his brother s girlfriend paralyzed Bobby Jr introduced mescaline to his 13 year old brother David who eventually died of a drug overdose Michael slept with his kids teen age baby sitter and later skied into a tree William Kennedy Smith their cousin went out on the town with Uncle Teddy brought home a woman and ended up being tried unsuccessfully for rape Which of these traditions does John Kennedy belong to The Times argued that like Jack and Bobby John was cut down far too early Again passive language distorts the facts John was at the controls when his vehicle crashed just like Cousin Joe and Uncle Teddy 2 Who s the victim On Meet the Press Tim Russert played the 30 year old video clip in which Ted Kennedy tried to explain to the nation why having driven his car off a bridge after a party on Chappaquiddick Island and having swum to safety while his young campaign aide Mary Jo Kopechne drowned in the car he had failed to report the accident to police In the clip Kennedy raised the question whether some awful curse did actually hang over all the Kennedys whether there was some justifiable reason for me to doubt what had happened and to delay my report Russert offered the clip as an omen of the curse that would strike John Kennedy 30 years later Russert s guest columnist Mike Barnicle heaped praise and sympathy on Ted Kennedy for having borne so many family tragedies Nobody pointed out that at Chappaquiddick unlike Dallas and Los Angeles the person most responsible for the tragedy was a Kennedy whereas the victim was not and that Ted Kennedy s invocation of the family curse was a clever way of papering over these differences Thanks to this blurring of the victim perpetrator distinction Ted s nephew Joe was able to get elected to Congress despite his own car accident which likewise devastated his passenger four years after Chappaquiddick Which tradition does John Kennedy belong to Most pundits recalling Jack s and Bobby s assassinations have cast his family as the ultimate victim of his crash Stop blaming John It is enough that tragedy once again punished the Kennedys wrote Cohen But attention is gradually shifting to the Bessette family whose daughters were passengers on John s plane The Chappaquiddick analogies can t be far behind 3 For what purpose was the risk taken To illustrate the Kennedys penchant for adventure recklessness and disaster the Post compares John s crash to the death of Joe Kennedy Jr in a World War II bombing mission and to Michael Kennedy s fatal crash into a tree while playing football on skis Newsweek s Jonathan Alter likens John s flying to his father s piloting of a PT boat in the war They both grabbed life by the lapels These comparisons obscure the difference between risking one s life in war as Jack and Joe did and risking it playing football Which tradition does John belong to He was flying to a wedding a more commendable pursuit than the one that killed Michael but nothing like the war that killed Uncle Joe 4 What precautions were taken Critics point out that John Kennedy was an inexperienced pilot took off after sunset wasn t licensed to fly in the poor visibility he encountered Friday flew the more dangerous route over water and never contacted air traffic controllers for assistance His defenders point out that he was trained at a top flight facility and usually brought along a flight instructor but that Friday s weather reports offered no warning of poor visibility Barnicle like Cohen argued that to accuse Kennedy of poor judgment is way out of bounds because he could just as well have been killed in a subway accident By enumerating Kennedy s usual precautions his defenders show that he was more careful than many of his cousins But against that background and comments from other pilots who say they decided the weather was too dangerous for flying his decisions last Friday appear all the more unwise John Kennedy would be alive today if he had taken his usual precautions and certainly if he had taken a train instead 5 Was the protagonist morally reckless Recklessness theorists associate John Kennedy s lack of judgment with his cousins debauchery According to the Post the family s fearless adventurism has sometimes played out in scandal for example the drug problems of Robert Jr Patrick and David or Michael s notorious involvement with his teenage babysitter Time says of John If he was less reckless than his cousins it was not saying much there were friends who turned down the invitation to take to the skies with him The magazine quotes one family member who said The Kennedy story is really about karma about people who broke the rules and were ultimately broken by them This critique confuses different dimensions of judgment and breaking the rules To err in assessing the weather is human to pork the baby sitter is depraved John Kennedy knew the difference In 1997 he observed in George that his cousin Michael had surrendered his judgment Recklessness theorists such as Newsweek which casually associated John s succession of stunning girlfriends as a bachelor with his father s sexual snacking as a married man show far worse judgment than John ever did Barnicle and other Kennedy defenders however gloss over the same moral differences when they demand that the nation stand with Uncle Teddy and mourn the loss of another Kennedy instead of assessing judgment Judgment is precisely what should be assessed John Kennedy should never have taken off last Friday The risk was unnecessary and two people who entrusted him with their lives are dead because he screwed up But let s not confuse one catastrophic misjudgment with a pattern of decadence John Kennedy s death was far less noble than the tragedies suffered by the best men in his family and far less blameworthy than the tragedies wrought by the worst
