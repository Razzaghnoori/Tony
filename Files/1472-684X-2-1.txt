                    Background        Are we able to recognize when someone is dying Previous        authors have noted that there is an assumption by the        public and the medical profession that the end of life is        discernible     Results from the SUPPORT study        however suggest that our ability to detect the end of life        is limited the median predicted chance for twomonth        survival was no better than  just one week before        death Maintaining a high suspicion for the possibility of        death in moderately to severely ill patients would        therefore seem prudent             To coordinate care and provide optimal support for dying        patients and their families conversations about care must        occur while the patient still has a considerable chance of        surviving the current illness      Given our inability        to accurately predict the end of life it may be necessary        to develop simultaneous plans in the face of serious        illness one which facilitates the support of patients and        family through death and bereavement and a second which        provides maximal efforts to restore physiologic balance                       How physicians approach care decisions in seriously ill        hospitalised patients remains poorly understood Even in        the critically ill discriminating between patients who        have an imminently terminal illness and those who are        seriously ill but unlikely to die soon is difficult at        best Understanding how physicians think about prognosis in        these patients  how they determine the likelihood of a        patients potential impending death  may provide insight        into how care decisions are approached        We asked internal medicine residents caring for severely        ill patients would you be surprised if this patient died             We aimed to stimulate reflection and discussion        regarding the possibility of death with the goal of better        understanding how residents think about prognosis and        approach care decisions when caring for critically ill        patients                    Methods                  Study Design Qualitative study                      Study participants and setting            The Internal Medicine Training Program at the            University of Colorado Health Sciences Center UCHSC            is a threeyear program that provides education for            approximately  residents in  hospitals and            affiliated outpatient clinics During each of the first            two years and rarely in the third year residents            rotate through the University of Colorado Hospital            UCH Medical intensive Care Unit MICU as part of a            required pulmonarycritical care month Four teams            each consisting of two first year residents Rs a            supervising second year resident R a            pulmonarycritical care fellow and attending physician            provide care to all patients admitted to the MICU As            these rotations occur early in training most interns            will have had little or no prior critical care            experience whereas Rs will typically have had             months of prior ICU exposure A second hospital            provides additional ICU experience for interns and            Rs            We chose to study residents at UCH based on an            already established comfortable forum for open            discussion Ethics and Discharge Planning EDP rounds            EDP rounds occur weekly and are attended by internal            medicine residents a social worker and chaplain and            less commonly nurses While not excluded explicitly            the supervising fellow andor the attending physician            rarely attend EDP rounds An ethics faculty physician            author JDA  the coordinator of EDP rounds for more            than  years  facilitates all discussions On a            typical afternoon one to three residents present one            or more patient cases over a minute period The            multidisciplinary group discusses the medical and            social aspects of these cases in order to  assist the            primary team in discharge planning and             prospectively identify and clarify difficult social or            ethical issues regarding the care of severely ill            patients and their families                                Data collection and analysis            Following Institutional Review Board approval we            conducted structured discussions with first and second            year internal medicine residents over a onemonth            period at EDP rounds All residents who presented at            EDP rounds during the study month agreed to            participate Participation was optional and informed            consent was obtained for all interactions            During the course of each structured discussion            residents were asked the question Would you be            surprised if this patient died The facilitator posed            questions based on the flow diagram illustrated in            Figure  We attempted to integrate questions into the            natural flow of the discussion to minimise disruption            While we did not formally pilottest the study tool            the authors created and fieldtested these questions            based on prior teaching experiences in EDP Rounds            inpatient and outpatient settings with the Would you            be surprised question Author DCJ R recorded            meeting notes and audiotaped and transcribed all            structured discussions Not atypical for EDP rounds no            supervising clinical faculty or nurses participated in            any encounters during the study month            Two of the authors reviewed the pattern of responses            as the data was collected We decided not to alter the            original questionnaire as the surprise question was            generating substantial discussion about approaches to            care We used template analysis to organise and segment            the data attempting to identify major categories of            responses and common domains across each category                Within the framework of possible responses to the            structured discussion questions and based on our             a priori theoretical            understanding of the issues we first defined four            categories why or why not surprised management            changes and barriers to management changes Initial            broad domains or codings were identified by            preliminary reading of the text Codings were refined            and revised based on reflexive iterative reading and            sorting the discussion text Independent readings and            subsequent recodings of the transcriptions by two of            the authors resulted in the identification of             salient themes among  broad categories of responses as            described below No unique themes emerged from analysis            of responses to discussion questions of the final             encounters of the study                                      Results                  Why or why not surprised          We identified four domains within the category of why          residents would be surprised if their patients died the          presence of a reversible disease the rapid onset of an          acute illness improving clinical course and prior          survival under similar circumstances Worsening clinical          course was the only identified domain in cases where          residents would           not be surprised One resident          admitted that while he was uncomfortable acknowledging          that his critically ill patient might be dying his          patients death would not come as a surprise                          Changes in management          Four residents proposed management changes after          acknowledging that their patients might die In three          instances these changes whether planned or          hypothetical reflected primarily palliative behaviors              clarifying care goals improving communication          with the patient and family and obtaining fewer          laboratory tests Several residents indicated that they          would spend additional time speaking with patients and          families about care options Three residents implied that          treatment efforts were already complete everything was          being done and that without new changes in the clinical          course no alterations to the care plan were indicated          Two residents appeared to react somewhat apprehensively          initially responding with I dont know and wellyou          mean technically                          Barriers to changes in management          Residents indicated that barriers within the medical          system impeded potential management changes Three          residents cited lack of time as a barrier to changing          management knowing that a patient might die Five made          reference to competing clinical priorities and two          residents cited insufficient knowledge and experience          noting that an inadequate understanding of the natural          progression of a disease limited discussions about goals          of care One resident felt that her inexperience          contributed to a reluctance to suggest an alternative          approach to care despite her feeling that the patients          needs were not being adequately addressed          Other barriers to management changes were implied          rather than stated Four residents referred to the idea          of doing everything when caring for severely ill          patients Decisions to do everything in some cases          appeared to encourage assumptions about a patients          andor familys expectations Similarly when a patients          condition improved doing better several residents          indicated that family meetings were postponed or not          planned as teams narrowed treatment efforts toward          sustaining physiologic gains Two residents appeared to          curtail dialogue with patients and their families knowing          that their patients were not in immediate danger of          dying In one case the uncertain aetiology of the          patients confusion resulted in the healthcare teams          apparent acceptance of the patients pain as an          unavoidable complication of their diagnostic evaluation          Their primary stated goal  to determine the cause of          the patients confusion  appeared to overshadow concerns          for pain relief                            Discussion        In this study we use the question would you be        surprised if this patient died to explore how residents        think about their critically ill patients This inquiry        appears to stimulate reflection and dialogue about the        potential for a patients death and as hinted by one        residents response may be less threatening than is your        patient dying As such this approach may offer physicians        a safer space to acknowledge the possibility of death by        encouraging reflection without impugning a physicians        intentions or competence        These encounters provide preliminary insight into how        residents think about prognosis when caring for seriously        ill hospitalised patients Residents appear to frequently        utilise clinical course  whether a patient is getting        better or worse  to determine the likelihood of a        patients death This may be an important finding as this        iterativetype approach is unlike common prognosticating        instruments such as the APACHE or SUPPORT score which        attempt to determine prognosis based on a single evaluation             Traditional prognostic tools might also fail to        capture other elements cited by residents when assessing a        patients likelihood of dying prior survival under similar        conditions reversibility of the disease and sudden onset        of an acute illness Previous authors have noted that        quantitative models are rarely used in clinical practice            in part because clinicians may not know how to use        them in a meaningful and effective way     and such        models apply to populations and fail to account for the        uniqueness of the individual     While the accuracy of        the residentreported elements remains unknown perhaps        prognostic models that account for prior experience and        trajectory of the illness may be more clinical useful and        intuitively understandable to patients families and        providers        This study identifies several potential barriers to        management changes after recognising that a patient might        be dying Understanding these barriers  whether real or        perceived  may be important in efforts to improve ICU        care Multiple residents cited lack of time as a barrier        to changing management once their patient had been        identified as possibly dying This may reflect the current        culture of medical training in one prior study  of        surgical residents reported feeling constrained by time        when caring for terminally ill patients and their families            Alternatively residents might be using lack of        time as an excuse  either consciously or otherwise  to        avoid difficult seemingly timeintensive conversations        with patients and families As such this perceived barrier        might highlight a potential misconception that not talking        with patients takes less time A time flow study might help        to clarify the validity of this perception        Residents may not recognise or explicitly express other        important real barriers For example the cited responses        suggest that residents seek to present themselves as        selfgoverning autonomous decisionmakers when in fact        they may be strongly influenced by the cultural milieu of        the ICU Residents may fail to recognise or admit the        importance of peer pressure or conforming to the norm in        their decisionmaking Furthermore the ICU cultural milieu        may profoundly impact how residents prioritise        responsibilities Balancing competing demands within a        cult of curability may encourage physicians to evaluate        success on the basis of curing rather than on the basis of        providing the best care for patients     In such a        system it is easy to imagine how a residents reluctance        to propose alternative care approaches could result from        intimidation by the accepted system rather than her own        selfacknowledged lack of experience Feelings of increased        stress and less collegial support when managing dying        patients might further contribute to this apprehension                   Another potential barrier is suggested by residents        frequent references to doing everything It is often        misleadingly assumed in this phrase that there exists some        common understanding of what everything entails While        some residents may have had detailed conversation with        patients and families resident responses seem to suggest        otherwise  that care goals were often poorly understood        Statements like we are doing everything or there is        nothing more we can do likely mirror the culture of        medical training McCue in a  JAMA article describes        medicine as a culture of action  it is better to do        something more tests another medication than to do        nothing even if the action is known to have no benefit            In one study almost half  of physicians and        nurses surveyed reported acting contrary to conscience in        providing care to the terminally ill with four times as        many providing overly burdensome treatment than        undertreatment     The propensity to refer to        everything even in cases with specific known goals        might inadvertently promote futile attempts to prolong life        and deflect attention away from patients pain and        suffering Understanding why we choose such language        whether due to a poor understanding of specific goals or        simply a convenient construct for describing curative care        might help in the design of practical interventions that        would promote more comprehensive care        Some residents were quite hesitant about answering        questions regarding changing management While this        openended inquiry is inherently ambiguous these        apprehensive responses might also suggest residents        discomfort with changing a plan recommended by supervising        physicians Alternatively the hesitation may also        highlight residents discomfort with managing patients who        may be dying Medical education traditionally focuses on        training physicians to diagnose cure and prolong life        with only minimum attention given to the techniques of        caring for the patient for whom cure is of less relevance             An ABIM survey of more than  IM residents        found that  reported receiving adequate training in        managing pain and other symptoms  in breaking bad news        to patients  in educating the patient and family about        the dying process and  in responding to patients who        request assistance in dying      Further heightening        apprehension might be residents emotional inexperience        especially in an environment where the emotional needs of        care providers may be inadequately addressed        Likewise physicians may also lack the skill to        recognise or elicit the needs of patients and their        families Eric Cassell writes that this lack of recognition        and treatment of suffering does not come about because of        an absence of compassion or concern but more often results        from physicians poor diagnostic and therapeutic knowledge        and skills about persons Cassell challenges physicians to        learn and teach methods in empathic attentiveness in        order to know patients as individual persons well enough to        understand the origin of their suffering and ultimately its        best treatment            How might the information from this study help to        improve patient care First this study hints that at least        some residents may be more inclined to think about the        concurrent palliative needs of patients and families after        considering the possibility that their patients may be        dying The surprise question as such could be a direct        means to impacting breadth of care Future studies might        prospectively examine variation in care management        following this routine inquiry coupled with followup        questions such as Has asking this question changed your        opinion about whether the patient might dying or Will        you change your management of the patient because I asked        this question As Eric Cassell notes the act of        consciously thinking about information whatever its        origins  numbers on a printout a report of pain or in        this case the possibility for death  makes it objective        an object of consciousness            Second clinical course and other factors appear to        influence communication  knowingly or not  with patients        and their families Some of these residents appear to        postpone or avoid potentially goaldefining conversations        with patients and families if the chance for immediate        death seems unlikely or remote As many patients and        families may embrace an approach of doing everything in        cases where the disease trajectory is not straightforward        postponing conversations regarding goals of care may        effectively limit care options until no more curative        treatments remain and such discussions become a practical        necessity More indepth studies are needed to better        understand how and to what extent these factors alter        decisionand communication in the ICU setting        This study has multiple limitations First whether the        findings from this small exploratory study are transferable        to a broader sample of interns and residents is unknown        Although this study was integrated into a realworld        established setting the core question may not provide        similar insightful dialogue in other venues From at least        the general perspective of medical education these        observations seem relevant While the credibility of the        study is enhanced through the facilitating facultys         years of EDP field experience member checking  reviews        from the participating residents  and independent peer        examination would have increased validity     More        purposive sampling governed by emerging insights would have        helped to clarify details of the promising themes Next it        is unlikely given the limited encounters that saturation        of resident responses was achieved Although no new themes        emerged during the last several interactions we chose to        not to collect additional data in part because the        primary goal of this study  to provide a basic        preliminary framework into how residents approach decisions        in the ICU  had been achieved We believe these        preliminary data support more extensive exploration of        identified themes While following the question flow        diagram provided a consistent inquiry the dependability of        the process may have been compromised by not specifying a        time frame with the question would you be surprised An        additional assessment of study dependability or        confirmability through audit would have improved the        trustworthiness of these data Finally we did not account        for differences between patients severity of illness        variations in residents critical or palliative care        experience comfort in caring for dying patients or the        influence of the fellow or attending physician on        management decisions Capturing data on these other factors        would have helped define their potential influence on        resident responses                    Conclusions        Whether asking the question would you be surprised if        this patient died might serve to alter care by        illuminating the possibility of death warrants further        investigation Although much work remains preliminary        insight suggests these selected physiciansintraining        depend highly on clinical course among other factors when        approaching decisions regarding the care of severely ill        patients Understanding how these factors influence        communication may help to illuminate why previous attempts        to improve care for critically ill patients and their        families have been disappointing                    Competing interests        None declared                    Authors contributions
