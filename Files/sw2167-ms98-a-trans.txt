 oh mostly we watch college basketball oh do you yeah and uh you know we re from uh originally from Louisville Kentucky and they ve got a fairly decent ball club down there uh huh yeah it s been around for a long time hadn t it uh as long as i can remember yeah who s the coach s name Denny Crum yeah that sounds familiar yeah Denny Crum s pretty good yeah he uh i don t know he s got a million dollar contract when he quits and with pro ball you mean uh no with uh uh when he quits they ll give him a million dollars who will the opponents Denny Crum uh uh Louisville University the university gives him a million dollars when he quits well why that doesn t make sense does it because because he s good and it s giving him an incentitive to stay around and uh he s been there for something twenty something years uh huh and uh i really don t know the uh full reason why they re doing it but they ve got confidence in the man yeah yeah well to me i d want to quit oh he gets too much he gets you know he oh that just shows how much he gets paid anyway yeah huh he s got a TV show down there and everything really where are y all living now in Denison Denison Texas yeah do you ever watch the Mavericks sometimes yeah not a lot uh i i don t really care for pro basketball i like college basketball and pro football hm but i do watch some uh pro football basketball mostly it s uh i watch certain players yeah like who oh Magic Johnson uh uh huh Larry Bird yeah uh Michael Jordan yeah he s good too and i can name a few more i just can t think of their names right off hand uh i used to watch basketball in fact of of the pro sports i guess it s my favorite it s just that i haven t watched many sports this year or in the past several years yeah well the uh NC double A tournament s going on right now and uh i haven t watched it this year because Louisville s out of it this year how come oh they just uh they had three tall guys who had uh didn t meet the requirements you know uh the uh academic requirements uh huh yeah yeah academically they didn t meet the requirements so they couldn t play this year so four of them they had four people huh my husband s sitting here putting four fingers in my face four uh but they weren t very good but they was uh four out of five hurts huh four out of five hurt yeah well i think they got i think that was almost everyone of them that he recruited uh recruited for this year huh he didn t and none of them got to play yeah well no wonder they re out of it uh sorry i said no wonder they re out of it yeah well they put up a good show they did pretty good for uh yes you know having all short people and uh we only had uh huh one we only had one senior on the team so they ll be back so next year they ll be back and back with a vengeance uh huh well do you agree with that requirement that they meet those uh academic in some states yeah because it s reasonable now uh you know me with me being from Louisville i m going to say at Louisville is unfair because Louisville s got the highest uh uh the line the line the line drawn i don t know the correct word for it but Louisville s is higher than most other universities and uh huh well i didn t realize it could vary from state to state or university yeah yeah they they vary from university not just state to state university huh if they d been anywhere else i don t you know i don t care where it was anywhere in the United States they could have played but beings they was in Louisville they couldn t play how does that coach feel about that oh he s highly upset he uh went on uh he was on uh Twenty Twenty or Sixty Minutes i can t remember which one and got blasted uh you know they uh that s where it all came about because he said a few remarks of uh on that uh talk show or uh huh news show and then they uh next thing you know well they re in violation if they don t uh if they stop if they keep playing they re in violation hm so but uh Denny Crum ran his mouth a little bit too much him on national TV on national TV he messed up but uh yeah it s all politics probably that s probably what it mostly is i i can t say say that for sure but you know uh right now though Kentucky s just now getting off of a uh their yeah suspension from playing on uh TV and then games um hum next year they ll be uh playing and i know Memphis State was even in a few of them where they got uh couldn t play huh in uh games and stuff because of uh uh Dana Kirk that was their coach down there uh or over there uh he he was uh we was living in Memphis for a while that s why i know about Memphis State uh huh uh he was selling soda machines at the uh selling like Coca Cola had given him uh huh uh for this little uh this little uh kid s a a basketball camp that s what it is these little kids would come here and uh Coca Cola had sponsored the uh sodas you know just give them to him told him to give them to the boys well he sold them for something like fifty seventy five cents to these boys when he s supposed to given them to them uh huh uh huh oh for heaven s sake what a cheapskate and uh yeah he was a he s uh we call him Dana Jerk yeah oh yeah and he blames all of his uh tax problems on his elementary school wife his elementary school wife yeah yeah she she never even got out of elementary school oh really um well she might have been the cause of it well no he was just a jerk he put uh he put the blame on everyone but himself he went out and you know bought uh bought recruits yeah yeah no i m sure you know that s one thing you don t do uh yeah he went out and did that and he got caught and then he got caught with the taxes and then he got caught with the sodas and that soda really went over on the people in Memphis they really got hot about that yeah i can imagine especially the kids that were buying them yeah these were young kids too they couldn t have been out of middle school yeah huh well that almighty dollar yeah well that s uh yeah i ll agree there um hum more powerful than you think yeah it is well i think we met our time limit yeah i think guess we did too all right well well you have a good day so uh huh thank you very much bye bye bye bye
