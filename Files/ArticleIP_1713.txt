 If Paula Jones hadn t been made the victim of a White House campaign to destroy her credibility she would have abandoned her lawsuit against President Clinton last summer and nobody would ever have heard of Monica Lewinsky her husband Steve Jones told the Daily Telegraph of London In an interview published Thursday in the conservative paper Jones said his wife had been under such pressure that she had come within a whisker of abandoning the lawsuit Pressed to accept a financial settlement that would have let the president off without so much as an apology she is now adamant that Clinton be made to atone for calling her a pathetic liar The only settlement we re going to accept from Bill Clinton is I was wrong I apologise I admit that I was in that room with Paula Jones said We gave him wiggle room before We were willing to let him say I may have But now we ve collected a lot more evidence and the days of wiggle room are over The word may has been stricken He is going to have to confess to everything on our terms now or face Paula in court The interview was conducted at the couple s home in Long Beach Calif by Ambrose Evans Pritchard who as a former Washington correspondent of the London Sunday Telegraph used to work with right wing American political campaigners conspirators Hillary Clinton would call them to expose financial and sexual sleaze involving the president

children running amok and raiding the fridge while her husband spoke on her behalf Evans Pritchard wrote These people in Washington just don t seem to understand that being called a whore means something something we can t live with Steve Jones told him singling out Clinton lawyer Bob Bennett as the person mainly responsible for bringing disaster on the president If it had not been for Bob Bennett coming out on TV and saying that Paula s story was tabloid trash for cash this whole thing could have been settled a long time ago with a quiet apology Steve Jones said He chose the wrong girl to pick a fight with didn t he And now he s brought the President to the brink of impeachment If I could give one piece of advice to Bill Clinton it s get rid of Bob Bennett Fast Jones is not alone in his opinion of Bennett See this dispatch by Slate s Jake Weisberg Coverage of Monicagate Sexgate Sexygate and increasingly in Britain Fornigate continued to be enormous in Europe but much less extensive in the rest of the world Editorial opinion almost everywhere continued to be dominated by two hopes 1 that the American president whatever his mistakes should complete his term of office and 2 that the crisis should be rapidly resolved As the headline over an article by the London Guardian s chief pundit Hugo Young put it Thursday Let s hope the lecher survives In Nigeria an editorial in the independent Post Express deplored the way the United States was willing to put its business with Israel and Iraq on hold in order to explore such inanities as that of a woman Paula Jones who is claiming 700 000 or 2 million just because as she claims she has intimate knowledge of the president s genitalia This claim is as wild as any the editorial continued pointing out that a recent survey in Britain showed that even long married wives were unable to properly identify their husbands genitalia under experimental conditions Incredulous that the American system would make a monumental event out of Lewinsky s contradictory claims it concludes So far all the ballyhoo over Bill Clinton s alleged involvement with these women could serve only one purpose That of reminding us that after winning the cold war America has lost control Perhaps the cold war was a symbolic reminder to the world that the preservation of democracy can best come about through the natural conflict of dialectical forces In the present circumstances we may have to start thinking in terms of reinventing the Soviet Union If only to help the Americans get their act together Quoted in his own newspaper Corriere della Sera of Milan Gianni Agnelli the Italian industrialist lawyer and senator said Clinton s plight reminded him of what Thomas Jefferson had said when he was criticized for having a mistress What do they want A eunuch in the White House Agnelli spoke warmly too of Hillary Clinton saying I know her well She is a woman of the first rank Of great quality I wouldn t want her against me as a lawyer In fact Hillary seems especially popular in Italy Also in Corriere columnist Ennio Caretto wrote The facts have proved that among many wrong personal choices made by Clinton Hillary was the right one The Lady Macbeth of Little Rock as her enemies call her because of her toughness and her imperiousness has been and still is his inspiration his ace in the sleeve Referring to her TV appearances this week Caretto concluded It is certain in any case that Hillary with her dignity and her firmness under the able management of her dressers her make up her haircut her outfit her imperial eagle pin were all new enchanted a good part of America If Bill isn t among the best presidents of history she on the other hand is among the best first ladies
