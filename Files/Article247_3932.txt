 What Fools These Mortals Be Dear Lisa Back for more It s always fun to share favorite authors Someone once said that the world could be divided into two categories those who laughed at the Three Stooges and those who wondered why Not to stretch the Dawn Curly analogy too far but you know what I mean As for my editing process I ve messed with the letters somewhat less than I did with the diaries for the simple reason that Dawn had already edited the letters before she sent them out With the diaries she was writing solely for herself at least in theory and sometimes became a little sloppy or redundant as we will in purely personal jottings or first drafts Since I already felt a little uncomfortable publishing the diaries I d never want that done to me I thought it important to tidy her up here and there All of the words in the published Diaries are Dawn s own but some of the external structures are mine With the letters I ve trimmed them and occasionally deleted passages and names but otherwise they re pretty much as she wrote them Although it s a reading edition from the start I ve always tried to be a Powell purist As you know when the marvelous Steerforth press brought out one of Dawn s genuine masterpieces originally released as The Tenth Moon I asked them to call it Come Back to Sorrento for that was Powell s title and we know from her diaries that she was furious about the name her publishers had inflicted on her Moreover I ve asked Steerforth not to reissue Whither 1925 which was the first novel that she published It s not quite as bad as she thought it was but since she spent the rest of her life buying up any copy she found and destroying it and never mentioned it in any lists of her work I think it ought to rest in peace don t you John Howard Lawson 1894 1977 was a gifted and original playwright Unfortunately he was also a philanderer what they used to call a ladies man as well as a rigid Stalinist As such he was hardly Dawn s type can you imagine her mouthing Marxian jargon with any sort of straight face but he seems to have been the great romantic love of her life after her husband to whom it should be remembered that she remained married for 42 years I believe that Powell s third novel The Bride s House not one of her best but very interesting for a biographer is deeply autobiographical It was written at the beginning of her probable affair with Lawson while she was also still living at home with her husband and son and it is wracked with private haunting And yes I think Powell had a tough life certainly a difficult one but it was also as you say a good life as well in its way Her humor was the key I think that and her passion for work It can safely be said that Powell lived to write her art so rich in its laughter even in some passages of her saddest books buoyed her up How could she have stood all that she went through otherwise an impaired son a difficult marriage recurring health problems impoverishment and what was essentially a period of homelessness this last when she was in her 60s She was one strong woman and humor was her shield I agree with you that sexism likely played a part in her long underappreciation On the other hand I have found that some feminists actively resent Powell for making fun of her gender as brilliantly as she made fun of men I think the literary left was unhappy that her workers were likely to be as silly as her bosses I think social conservatives were unhappy with all of those Powell characters who drank too much slept around behaved foolishly and yet remained funny agreeable company Powell was never an uplifter She was an equal opportunity satirist and took her fun where she found it She has some of the bright distanced amusement we find in the best comedies of Greek and Roman antiquity Or if you prefer she echoes Shakespeare What fools these mortals be And we are But she liked us anyway Yours till next time Tim
