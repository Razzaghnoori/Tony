        who uh does your family keep a budget at all or     well i sort of i mean in my mind i do i dont write anything down or anything like that   yeah ah   i just know what my bills are and how much i need for that and whats extra im a nurse and so i kind of figure im taking home a hundred dollars a day   ah huh oh really   so when i look at things like to buy or anything i think of it in days   uhhuh   if i hear something is three hundred dollars i think hm thats three extra days you know something like that so so everything in my mind is by days and thats thats about the extent of my budget yeah   you three extra days youd a yeah about it huh yeah weve uh weve been trying to save for a house weve been really trying to penny pinch and   oh thats a good one   i tell you it gets tough when you know we have ive tried to write something out on a computer and stuff but it seems like every week theres something that comes up and makes it about impossible to   well thats what happens thats exactly what happens it   car breaks down or somebody gets sick or   umhum umhum so just when you think you might get a little ahead thats right thats what happens   exactly   so thats kind of hard but   but are you uh are you able to plan or save anything for the healthy future or no i know it its a day to day thing   no  no not at all not at all i i barely get by   yeah i know all thats we i have my wife and a daughter and its about impossible   yeah its hard its real hard and uh it doesnt get much better either thats how it goes but i know but you know i just think that   well thats good to hear   youre marked and youre supposed to have x amount of dollars and thats the way its gonna be you know i mean thats just thats how it feels really because its its just some people are just   and theres nothing you can do about it huh yeah   have more money and some dont and thats it  so  uhhuh and and im lucky i have a very low mortgage payment because i i had my house for a long time and   yeah it makes you wonder how they get it all i mean oh do you huh   i dont have a car payment and you know i i dont have a lot of things so im pretty lucky but i have to make come up with the money totally by myself so thats hard too you know   just it yeah well thats whats amazed us is weve been trying to get into a house and i just i just with what we make a payment i mean its about double what we pay for rent i just cant see how people do it these days   yeah how is housing there   so well its actually Utahs been lucky we havent been hit by the recession so housing prices have stayed up the only thing thats helping us is that the mortgage rates are going down but uh its still moving pretty brisk and   yeah   i say weve been kind of lucky we havent been hit with the same kind of stuff that the rest of the nation has   yeah yeah   weve been able to stay out of you know that we havent lost many jobs or anything like that up around   yeah well im lucky ill never lose   yeah that nursing   but you know it doesnt matter if i lose a job one place ill just go somewhere else so   yeah ive often said if i had it to do all over again i think id go into something like that i seems like theres always you look in the paper and theres a huge demand for nursing and stuff so   yeah oh oh yeah really and and they get a little picky in one place and i know where i am now theres a whole big new administration and theyre theyre scaring everybody to death but i dont work on staff i just work on call   umhum oh do you you just work on call huh   and umhum and so i have a couple of agencies that i work for and i make much more money that way and i can be independent i dont have to go to all the meetings and get into the politics and   huh yeah   i dont get the benefits but i think its more than worth it then i just pay for that so yeah its a great thing but its risky and most people dont wanna   oh yeah definitely definitely sounds yeah but it sounds like youve been doing all right with it so   do that yeah ive i feel like it you know and its much more interesting that way too you dont get burned out so much so     umhum yeah so do you have a family or   yeah i have a twelve year old and so yeah i have to you know take care of her so yeah so we know weve got to cover certain things its not just me so umhum   oh do you enough to keep you kind of busy  yeah yeah thats true yeah i uh thats what uh you know were trying to we well i mean weve got a long ways off before school starts my daughters just eighteen months but   oh   you know you think about it i had to struggle my whole time through college you know pay for my own and get an occasional grant here and there but i just dont know how you know they can ever do it in ten years fifteen years from now when i have to go and   well i know what you mean it does look impossible you look around you and i dont know how young people buy houses today or anything i really dont know and     yeah and a small little you know two bedroom home with you know five hundred square feet is about sixty thousand it seems like and those are pretty hefty payments to   oh thats terrible yeah   well thats in Utah like i say i think were were probably below the market for the most part were pretty lucky that way but   oh yeah well its not too bad in this area really the thing is theres a lot of money and like im in Plano so its a little bit north of Dallas but   hasnt it uhhuh   but theres so much money in this town and there are things that are three hundred and five hundred thousand and lots and lots of them   ooh   but you can buy a nice three bedroom home for like eighty thousand   oh thats not bad   so it really isnt its low compared to the rest of the country you know and theres all kinds of   umhum
