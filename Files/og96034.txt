from mobile handsets that transmit a code identification number without any form of validation If the public safety organization decides to receive all calls from these carriers the Order requires GAO OGC 96 34 carriers to route all such calls even if they do not come from units that generate any code identification The Order also requires that within 1 year covered carriers must be capable of transmitting wireless 911 calls made by hearing or speech impaired individuals through the use of TTY or similar devices The Order also requires covered carriers to offer certain 911 enhancements in the next 18 months including the ability to relay a caller s phone number and the location of the base station or cell site receiving a 911 call Within the next 5 years the Order requires carriers to provide a very specific geographical location under some circumstances At the same time the Commission is issuing this Final Report and Order it is also issuing a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking

SYSTEMS WIRELESS E911 RULES FCC 96 264 i Cost benefit analysis The Commission stated in its submission to us that it was not required to prepare and did not prepare a cost benefit analysis of this Report and Order ii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 U S C 603 605 607 and 609 Section 603 Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The Commission initiated this proceeding with a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that addressed issues raised by the provision of 911 and enhanced 911 services through certain technologies Revision of the Commission s Rules to Ensure Compatibility with Enhanced 911 Emergency Calling Systems CC Docket No 94102 9 FCC Rcd 6170 1994 In that Notice the Commission prepared and published an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis and invited written public comments on the proposed rulemaking including comments on the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The analysis included in the proposed rulemaking provides the information required by sections 603 b 1 and 2 It describes the reasons for the proposed action and its objectives and legal basis The information required by sections 603 b 3 and 4 concerning the estimate of the classes of small entities subject to the Report and Order and the projected reporting recordkeeping and other compliance requirements of the proposed rulemaking is also included In accordance with section 603 b 5 the Commission stated its belief that the proposed Report and Order does not duplicate overlap or conflict with any other relevant federal rules Finally in considering any significant alternatives minimizing the impact on small entities the Commission asks for comments on whether the rule should be applied in situations with very limited PBX configurations in compliance with section 603 c GAO OGC 96 34 Section 604 Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The Supplementary Information published in the Federal Register includes the full text of the Commission s Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 61 Fed Reg 40348 The analysis includes information required by section 604 including a description of the need for and purpose of this Report and Order The Commission s analysis describes how this Report and Order will make 911 and enhanced 911 services for users of wireless telephones more widely available and much more effective Although no comments were submitted in direct response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis the Commission noted that a number of the general comments on the Notice might have an effect on small entities particularly on site specific Specialized Mobile Radio SMR licensees and on rural cellular providers The Commission describes how in response to these comments it attempted to minimize the burdens on small entities by limiting the regulations to mass market two way voice services providing for waivers for small rural carriers accepting the recommendation of trade associations and public safety organizations to extend the implementation period for some provisions over a 5 year period and offsetting the burden on small entities by requiring that a cost recovery mechanism will be in place before requiring implementation of the requirements The analysis further describes the small entities covered by the Report and Order addressing separately cellular licensees broadband personal communication service licensees and specialized mobile radio licensees The analysis also discusses the projected reporting recordkeeping and other compliance requirements of the Report and Order Finally in compliance with section 604 a 5 the analysis describes the significant alternatives considered and rejected including universal applicability to commercial mobile voice services automatic exclusion of all rural cellular carriers and a Commission developed set of standards for implementation The analysis discusses why the Commission rejected these alternatives and instead selected those adopted in the Final Report and Order Page 2 GAO OGC 96 34 Section 609 Participation by small entities The Commission offered the opportunity to comment on the proposed Report and Order to any interested parties including small entities In its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking the Commission specifically stated that the proposed regulation would affect a number of entities both large and small The Commission published the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in both the Federal Register and the FCC Record publications that should be easily obtained by small as well as large entities in the telecommunications industry The
