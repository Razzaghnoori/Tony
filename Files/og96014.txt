ii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 U S C 603 605 607 and 609 Section 603 Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The proposed rulemaking 60 Fed Reg 55529 November 1 1995 incorporated an initial regulatory flexibility analysis of the expected impact on small entities The analysis included in the proposed rulemaking provides the information required by paragraphs 603 b 1 through 3 It describes the reasons for the proposed agency action and its objectives and legal basis It also describes the small entities PCS licensees to which the proposed rule will apply The information required by paragraph 603 b 4 concerning an estimate of the classes of small entities subject to the requirement and the type of professional skills necessary for preparation of the

Supplementary Information published in the Federal Register with the final rule includes the full text of the Commission s final regulatory flexibility analysis 61 Fed Reg 29688 This analysis includes the information required by paragraph 604 a by summarizing and evaluating comments received GAO OGC 96 14 Numerous comments were received regarding the proposed plan to convert microwave incumbents to secondary status when the relocation rules sunset in 2005 and thereafter licensees would not be required to pay relocation costs after that date to such incumbents The American Public Power Association commented that conversion to secondary status would have a severe impact on the limited budgets of small non profit public utility systems Incumbent commentators noted that this will encourage licensees to wait out incumbents and increase the likelihood that incumbents would have to assume the costs of their own relocation PCS licensees argued that by 2005 most incumbent s equipment would be fully amortized or in need of replacement In an attempt to balance the interests the Commission has decided to retain the sunset date of 2005 as the date after which licensees would not have to pay relocation costs to incumbents but decided that incumbents would not convert to secondary status until and unless an emerging technology licensee required use of the spectrum regardless of the sunset date The final analysis was forwarded to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration Section 605 Avoidance of duplicative or unnecessary analysis The Commission did not invoke any of the exemptions or special procedures authorized by section 605 in preparing its regulatory flexibility analysis Section 607 Preparation of analysis The Commission s analysis uses both quantifiable and general descriptions of the effects of the rule on small entities Section 609 Participation by small entities In addition to the actions required by 5 U S C 553 the Commission also made available a complete copy of the proposed and final rulemaking materials via the Internet iii Agency actions relevant to sections 202 205 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of
