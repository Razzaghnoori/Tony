 Background The results of life detection experiments performed almost three decades ago on Mars by the Viking lander have long been subject to controversy 1 2 3 Many scientists though certainly not all 3 4 have concluded that results of Viking biological experiments can be interpreted as an indication of the presence of strong oxidants in the Martian soil 5 6 7 rather than biological activity They suggest that these oxidants are capable of oxidizing organic materials causing release of carbon dioxide as seen in the Viking experiments Since oxygen was also released after humidifying a sample of Martian soil these proposed oxidants would also oxidize water The spontaneous reduction of Ferrate VI in water forms molecular oxygen and Fe III 8 The rate of this reaction is strongly pH dependent 9 Other observations by Viking have complicated data interpretation including the transient absorption of generated carbon dioxide perhaps indicating an alkaline soil Also different thermal sensitivity of carbon dioxide and oxygen released implied that more than one oxidant might have been involved in the observed processes or that biology might indeed have been responsible for the observed results 3 Goldfield et al 5 and Tsapin et al 10 suggested that the actual source of oxidative power of Martian soil could be highly redox active oxygen species formed in the atmosphere by ultraviolet UV irradiation and Hunten 11 examined this hypothesis much earlier Further these oxidative equivalents may then be stabilized in the form of high oxidation states of some elements that are particularly abundant in Martian soil The most likely element is iron which is thought to represent a major fraction of the Martian soil matrix 12 13 Iron has a set of oxidation states between 2 and 6 with the higher oxidation states being very strong oxidants The reduction potential of FeO 4 2 in acidic conditions has been determined to be E 0 2 20 V and in alkaline conditions E 0 0 72 V 14 Thus these authors 5 10 proposed that Fe VI as ferrate dianion FeO 4 2 which is more stable under alkaline rather than acidic conditions might be an important component of the pool of Martian oxidants They demonstrated that Fe VI displays the essential features of organic oxidation to carbon dioxide and water decomposition to oxygen that were found with Martian soil during the Viking biology experiments Goldfield et al 5 further propose that the presence of a strong oxidant such as ferrate would make the Martian surface self sterilizing eliminating the possibility for detection of life or its remnants on that planet In support of their hypothesis they conducted spectral and polymerase chain reaction PCR experiments with Fe VI finding that it destroys DNA nucleotides proteins and amino acids It is quite possible that iron in the 5 and or 6 oxidation states is present in the soil of Mars However recent observations by the Mars Odyssey orbiter indicate that significant amounts of water ice exist at or near the surface of Mars 15 Since transient temperatures above freezing occur at some locations on Mars 16 this water likely would be present at least briefly in the liquid form Under slightly alkaline conditions as found on Mars and in the presence of liquid water Fe VI reacts quickly with water and is oxidized to Fe III Thus in regions where liquid water forms even briefly Fe VI is less likely to exist However Mars is a relatively large planet and conditions across its surface vary We cannot assume that iron exists in the same oxidation state s everywhere on Mars It is possible that some regions of Mars might harbor Fe V and Fe VI while regions with a frequent occurrence of liquid water might be dominated by Fe III Also it is possible the Fe VI if removed might be reformed in a continuing cycle through interactions with the planet s atmosphere Stoker and Bullock 17 examined the oxidation of glycine under simulated Martian conditions and concluded that any organic matter brought to the Mars surface by meteorites likely would be destroyed by UV radiation faster than it might be delivered They further suggested that no organic compounds found on Mars by the Viking Lander Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer experiment could be explained without invoking the presence of strong oxidants in the surface soils They felt their estimates of the organic destruction rate caused by irradiation at the Mars surface were an upper limit for a globally averaged biomass production rate that might be comparable to the slow growing cryptoendolithic microbial communities found in dry Antarctica deserts 17 An alternative hypothesis is that given the possible presence of ferrate in the soil the present environmental conditions on Mars are not highly conducive to ferrate based oxidation reactions including those potentially affecting dormant and hostile environment resistant life forms Mars is exposed to high fluxes of UV radiation and is very dry atmospheric water 210 ppm and cold average temperature is about 218 K 55 C 67 F with only traces of oxygen and with an atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide CO 2 95 32 N 2 2 7 Ar 1 6 O 2 0 13 CO 0 08 H 2 O 210 ppm NO 100 ppm Ne 2 5 ppm HDO 0 85 ppm Kr 0 3 ppm and Xe 0 08 ppm 18 Thus in this work experiments were performed to further examine the possibility that a Martian soil containing significant amounts of ferrate might be self sterilizing due to the highly reactive nature of Fe VI Here synthetic K 2 FeO 4 was prepared and added to dry silica sand at a concentration of 20 by weight Dry endospores of the bacterium Bacillus subtilis were then added and the mixture incubated under a simulated Mars environment carbon dioxide atmosphere at 20 C for a period of weeks Results were examined for indications of whether or not the presence of ferrate in and of itself was sufficient to make the Martian surrogate soil self sterilizing over a non geologic time frame The potential sporocidal activity of a combination of a powerful soil oxidant permanganate and high fluxes of UV light was also examined Finally our data were discussed in light of published literature regarding the possible survival of ancient bacteria in earthly environments The United States and other spacefaring nations are required by treaty to protect Mars and other non earthly planetary systems from contamination by earthly microorganisms From work reported here it appears that environmentally robust endospores if delivered to Mars on spacecraft could survive for extended periods of time in the cold dry preserving environment of Mars despite the presence of strong oxidants in the soil Results Under ambient environmental conditions synthetic ferrate VI degraded some organic molecules mixed into sand For example five mg of ferrate removed about 10 mg of 2 4 6 trinitrotoluene TNT from the reaction mixture Figure 1 However a mixture of dodecane and hexadecane was not degraded in the ferrate VI soil mixture Figure 2 The degradative activity toward TNT was dependent on the addition of water All the organic moieties were stable in the dry sand ferrate mixture Results of spore survival over time in the control and ferrate VI enriched or permanganate enriched Mars surrogate soils under simulated Martian environmental conditions are shown in Figure 3 The endospores survived exposure to high levels of ferrate under the imposed conditions for the duration of the experiment up to six weeks At the times of sampling the surrogate soil suspensions contained the characteristic crimson color of ferrate VI Figure 4 or similar color of permanganate After spreading on the agar medium the ferrate present in the inoculum was reduced over 30 minutes to give a characteristic brown oxyhydroxy polymer precipitate of Fe III residue on the plate surface indicating that ferrate VI was stable under the simulated Mars conditions and had been available as a potential biocide for the duration of the experiment Spore survival was similarly high in a surrogate soil containing permanganate in place of ferrate An important observation relevant to the Mars environment was that transient exposure of spores to K 2 FeO 4 in the presence of liquid water was not sporocidal Once Fe VI is reduced to Fe III a rapid process it becomes non toxic to the spores Spores placed into a dry permanganate enriched surrogate soil and exposed within a column to a sterilizing flux of UV light at the column surface were killed within only the first 5 mm of the column Figure 5 This was in the presence of air and at a temperature of 25 C Discussion Ferrate VI is a very strong oxidizing agent and will readily oxidize many organic molecules in aqueous solution 19 20 21 High oxidation power selectivity and by production of non toxic Fe III make potassium ferrate VI an environmentally friendly oxidant for removal of industrial contaminants from natural waters 22 We confirmed this degradative activity of ferrate using 2 4 6 trinitrotoluene TNT though a mixture of dodecane and hexadecane as might be found within microbial membranes was not degraded by ferrate VI Figures 1and 2 Fe VI is known to be highly active in water as a biocide For example the kinetics of inactivation of a bacteriophage by potassium ferrate was studied with the F specific RNA coliphage Q beta Inactivation in phosphate buffer pH 6 7 and 8 containing ferrate was effective and could be described by Hom s model 23 The effectiveness of ferrate VI in wastewater treatment has been studied and it exhibits a strong bactericidal effect on both coliforms and total bacteria 24 However the conditions used in those prior experiments with ferrate VI do not at all mimic the conditions that might be encountered on the surface or in the subsurface of much of Mars where there is thought to be essentially no available water 15 there is a highly oxidized atmosphere of mostly CO 2 and average temperatures are very low typically 60 to 80 C but sometimes reaching temperatures near 0 C in areas of sunlight These Mars like conditions were used in the experiments reported here Certainly these conditions did not exactly duplicate the Martian atmosphere which would have required use of a vacuum chamber The pressure of CO 2 used was much higher than on Mars However since CO 2 is unreactive the higher pressure should not have significantly affected the results It is of course possible that at very low CO 2 pressures endospores might be more sensitive to their environmental conditions than at one atmosphere This experiment will require a more sophisticated apparatus than is presently available to us though we hope to obtain such equipment soon in order to further examine this question It is likely that liquid water exists at least transiently on the surface of some locations on Mars 16 Because of the high reactivity of ferrate with water especially under alkaline conditions it is likely that these locations on Mars contain iron mostly in the non toxic Fe III oxyhydroxide state Also endospores were not killed by transient exposure to ferrate in the presence of water at room temperature Thus the transient occurrence of liquid water in the soils of Mars is insufficient reason to reject the general conclusion that if ferrate is present in the soils of Mars it probably is not a sporocidal agent In locations where other forms of iron dominate spores would be even more stable However additional experiments looking at spore survival that involve additions of small amounts of water e g 1 w w to a Mars surrogate ferrate enriched soil with brief fluxes of temperature between 80 C and about 5 C would be useful to further address this question Though UV light is a potent biocide and is present at high levels on the Mars surface beneath the surface or under objects such as rocks even the natural high flux of ultraviolet radiation on Mars will likely be greatly attenuated We tested this hypothesis confirming that spores are protected from the UV flux even in the presence of a strong soil oxidant permanganate by a few mm of soil cover The UV light provided by a mercury vapor lamp was not filtered to exactly duplicate its passage through the atmosphere of Mars though this might be accomplished with the appropriate apparatus e g an irradiated vacuum chamber The intervening gas was normal air at about 21 oxygen 0 03 CO 2 and 78 N 2 This clearly did not filter enough of the lethal wavelengths e g 254 nm to significantly affect the strongly sporocidal quality of the light On Mars however the thinner atmosphere might allow better passage of other shorter lethal wavelengths e g around 200 nm that might be filtered to some extent under the conditions used here However the likely effect of the difference in light wavelength filtration on Mars versus the experiments described here would be the ultimate soil cover depth needed to protect spores from UV damage and this difference is likely not to be very large less than an order of magnitude Also some endospores are considerably more UV resistant than those we employed 25 and substitution of such spores likely would have changed the results survival vs depth to some degree The important observation is the demonstrated protective effect of soil materials Earthly life forms can produce dormancy structures that are highly resistant to adverse environmental conditions including the presence of chemical oxidants and ionizing radiation conditions that are thought to occur on Mars Bacterial endospores are a prime example of resistant dormancy structures and recent research indicates that such dormant forms of bacteria can survive for even millions of years under appropriate conditions Cano and Borucki 26 revived a bacterial spore from the abdominal contents of extinct bees preserved for 25 to 40 million years in buried Dominican amber and cultured and identified it Greenblatt et al 27 reported successful culture of bacteria from Israeli Lebanese lode amber dated at 120 million years old Vreeland et al 28 reported the isolation and growth of a previously unrecognized spore forming bacterium a Bacillus species designated 2 9 3 from a brine inclusion within a 250 million year old salt crystal from the Permian Salado Formation Due to the difficulty in absolutely excluding modern contamination as sources of these isolates these reports have been controversial However to date these claims have not been invalidated 29 Thus even studies of earthly systems indicate that under environmental conditions possibly less life preserving than those encountered on Mars dormant life forms may have survived on Earth for very long periods even of geological time scales The most important factor for such survival appears to be desiccation a defining characteristic of amber earthly brines and much of the Mars environment Though there apparently is water in the soil of the polar regions of Mars Mars Odyssey mission observations it is thought to be present as ice and probably is not biologically available Little work has been done in the study of microbial survival in the extraterrestrial environment Horneck et al 30 did observe survival of a significant fraction of Bacillus subtilis spores after 11 months of exposure to the space environment on board the European Retrievable Carrier EURECA They exposed spores of Bacillus subtilis to space for about two weeks in the BIOPAN facility of the European Space Agency onboard the Russian Earth orbiting FOTON satellite The spores were exposed under a variety of conditions in dry layers without any protecting agent mixed with clay red sandstone Martian analogue soil or meteorite powder or in artificial meteorites cubes filled with clay and spores in naturally occurring concentrations Unprotected spores in layers open to space or behind a quartz window were completely or nearly completely inactivated and similarly low survival was obtained behind a thin layer of clay acting as an optical filter Survival was increased by five or more orders of magnitude when the spores in the dry layer were directly mixed with powder of clay rock or meteorites Up to 100 survival was reached in soil mixtures with spores comparable to the natural soil to spore ratio These data confirm the deleterious effects of extraterrestrial solar UV radiation but also confirm that thin layers of clay rock or meteorite can successfully shield spores from UV damage if they are in direct contact with the spores Mileikowsky et al 31 considered the probability of natural transfer of viable microbes from Mars to Earth in meteoroids ejected from Mars during the period 4 Ga BP to the present and during the 700 Ma from Ga 4 5 to 3 8 They used NASA s HZETRN transport code to calculate probabilities examining many variables potentially affecting microbe survival The species modeled used the environmentally robust bacteria Bacillus subtilis spore former and Deinococcus radiodurans highly radiation resistant Their modeling suggested that if microbes existed or exist on Mars viable transfer to Earth is not only possible but also highly probable due to these microbes impressive resistance to the hazards of space transfer and to the dense traffic of Martian meteorites that have fallen to Earth since the dawn of our planetary system Conclusions Here the hypothesis was examined that if the surface soil of Mars contains significant amounts of ferrate VI it will be self sterilizing Dried but living dormant endospores of Bacillus subtilis were incubated in a Mars surrogate soil containing 20 by weight of K 2 FeO 4 Incubation conditions similar to those now on Mars dry cold and a CO 2 enriched atmosphere were used Under these conditions the endospores were not immediately killed but in fact were resistant to inactivation by the ferrate enriched or permanganate enriched soil Figure 3 Though some delay in colony formation compared to controls was observed upon addition of water prior to plate counting the Bacillus spores survived both storage in a ferrate rich soil and the brief simultaneous presence of ferrate and water during analysis This simple experiment indicates that ferrate does not necessarily provide an environment that is self sterilizing on non geological time scale It is possible that a thin coating of ferric hydroxide on the surface of our ferrate crystals might have afforded some protection to the spores from ferrate exposure since small traces of water vapor might still have been present despite our attempt to exclude it However this coating would likely be only a few angstroms thick ferrate was of very high purity at 99 pure and probably was insignificant compared to the overall amount of ferrate present This is supported by the observation that the presence of an alternative strong oxidant that does not have the potential for such a coating permanganate crystals at 20 w w final concentration also did not kill the endospores supports this Figure 3 The finding that organic molecules were degraded only after the addition of water to the soil also supports the inactivity of ferrate under Mars conditions Significant amounts of liquid water are thus required for ferrate s degradative or biocidal activities Ferrate must be in solution in order to act as an oxidant Assuming the soil of Mars contains about 1 by weight of water mostly in the form of ice 15 32 33 34 complete thawing would fail to approach the slurry conditions used here to accomplish oxidation of TNT 30 mg surrogate soil 60 mg liquid water Even these saturated conditions did not promote the oxidation of hydrocarbons The traces of water 200 ppm in the Martian atmosphere 18 might also form thin layers of rust on soil particles there making the surrogate soil system used here even more like the proposed ferrate enriched soil of Mars The data Figure 5 show that below the immediate surface high fluxes of UV radiation in the presence of strong oxidants are attenuated and are not sporocidal If dormancy structures similar to endospores were produced at some point by life forms on Mars data reported here suggest they could still be present and viable This might actually be demonstrated as in the surrogate soil experiments described here with Martian soil samples Rejuvenation experiments could be performed remotely in situ or in a contained laboratory setting after return of samples to Earth The first such experiment in fact was essentially performed in the original biology experiments aboard Viking though the results were inconclusive The experiments need to be repeated with modifications based on all we have learned in the succeeding years There are now improved ways to monitor microbial signatures and metabolic processes that are indicative of life in soil 35 36 37 The fact that spores appear to survive for many decades and perhaps hundreds of millions of years in earthly systems further supports the possibility for survival of similar life forms on Mars The conditions on Mars might actually be even more conducive than those on Earth for long term survival of such living entities because of the unique combination of cold dehydration lack of oxygen and protection from direct UV exposure In the original Viking experiments where investigators searched for organic compounds in Martian soil 38 four samples were examined one surface and one subsurface sample from each of two locations Gas chromatography mass spectrometry at a sensitivity of parts per billion ppb for some compounds yielded negative results Presumably if microorganisms had been present organic compounds would have been detected However these results suffer from the limitations of all negative results They cannot prove the absence of life since there was the inherent limitation of analytical sensitivity and only two locations close to the landing site on the Martian surface were examined One endospore weighs approximately 10 13g Assuming there were one such spore per gram of Martian soil and one could detect 100 of the organic matter in that spore this would require an analytical sensitivity of 0 1 ppb In reality the organic matter in a cell or spore contains many classes of compounds with few classes representing more than a few percent of the total and considerably less than 100 efficiency in extraction and detection is possible Thus the actual sensitivity required for Viking to detect 1 spore g of soil would have been in the ppt range Detection of 1000 spores g would have required at least 1 ppb sensitivity These requirements are well below the sensitivity of the GC MS used aboard Viking However techniques based on growing of cells from spores or measuring their physiological activity after germination not performed by Viking could provide a sensitivity as low as a few spores g of soil 37 It has been suggested that the oxidizing nature of the Martian soil is due to the photochemical reactions that create hydrogen peroxide and superoxides in the surface soil Using data obtained from the Viking gas exchange experiment and assuming that all oxygen came from H 2 O 2 the concentration range of hydrogen peroxide has been calculated to be 25 250 ppm 39 Some soil bacteria survive at a concentration of 30 000 ppm of H 2 O 2 39 suggesting that presence of this peroxide alone on Mars surface would not make the soil self sterilizing Mars of course has been dry and cold for a very long time and it is not possible to run experiments such as ours over geologic time scales It may be that an oxidant like ferrate VI might be biocidal over periods lasting millions of years even in the dry cold storage environment of Mars However we conclude that the occurrence of ferrate VI in Mars soils if present will not necessarily promote immediate self sterilization of the soils The United States and other spacefaring nations are required by treaty to protect Mars and other non earthly planetary systems from contamination by earthly microorganisms Bacterial endospores that are particularly resistant to agents such as disinfectants e g vapor phase hydrogen peroxide extreme desiccation and even gamma radiation are the most common contaminants found on surfaces of cleaned spacecraft assembled in spacecraft assembly clean rooms 25 These survivors include cultivable species such as Bacillus licheniformis B pumilus B cereus and B circulans as well as other strains that have not yet been cultivated but can be observed through their DNA 16S rDNA fingerprints From work reported here it appears that such robust spores if delivered to Mars on spacecraft could survive for extended if not indefinite periods of time in the cold dry preserving environment of Mars despite the presence of strong oxidants in the soil This might compromise later experiments aimed at detecting life on the Red Planet and or influence its future ecology over geologic time scales Methods Synthesis of potassium ferrate Crimson colored Fe VI as potassium ferrate K 2 FeO 4 was prepared and stored dry according to the method of Thompson et al 40 Its purity and state of oxidation was confirmed by an oxidimetric titration using arsenite cerate method 41 This method measures only Fe VI and V leaving any ferric ions in the preparation unreduced The fresh K 2 FeO 4 was 99 pure Ferrate oxidation of organic moieties within a sand matrix Two sets of reaction mixtures were prepared Treatment mixtures contained 25 mg of pure silica sand as a soil surrogate about 5 mg K 2 FeO 4 and different amounts of the nitrated organic compound 2 4 6 trinitrotoluene TNT amounts of TNT were 5 10 15 or 20 mg A control set contained only TNT and sand All experiments were prepared using four replicates All samples were twice mixed by vortexing and centrifuged for 2 min at 16 kG in order to remove reagents from walls of vials There was no detectable reaction at this step To every vial 60 ul of deionized water were added Reactants were mixed centrifuged and incubated for 15 min at room temperature After 15 min 1 ml of methanol was added about 40 50 mg of sodium sulfate were later added to remove water from the mixture After vortexing the reaction mixture was centrifuged for 4 min at 16 kG Supernatant was diluted 20 in methanol for electrospray tandem mass spectrometric analysis ES MS MS or 20 in acetonitrile for gas chromatography mass spectrometry GC MS analysis Similar experiments were performed using hexadecane and dodecane Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry GC MS was used for quantitative measurement of TNT and hydrocarbon concentrations in soil extracts Sample 2 ul was injected into the GC using a HP 7683 series injector split less injection The mass spectrometer s Hewlett Packard 5989A scan range was from 50 to 800 Da Temperature of the source was held at 250 C and of the quadropole at 120 C The ion source was set on positive electron impact ionization mode The temperature of the injector on the gas chromatograph Hewlett Packard 5890 series II and the MS interface was 280 C For separations we used a Phenomenex ZB 5 column 30 m 0 25 mm 1 25 m The initial oven temperature was 100 C held for 1 minute This was increased 10 C per min until the final temperature of 300 C which was held for 3 min Perfluorotributylamine was used for auto tuning the MS Preparation of a Mars surrogate soil Pure silica sand Fisher was dried by heating overnight at 110 C and then stored in desiccators containing calcium chloride Potassium ferrate was added see below to a level of 20 w w and mixed thoroughly into the sand to form a Mars surrogate soil The soil was used for microbiological experiments as soon as possible after preparation always less than 24 hours The second soil was prepared similarly substituting KMnO 4 for K 2 FeO 4 Control soil contained only sand Preparation of bacterial cells and endospores Our own laboratory strain of Bacillus subtilis was grown in a simple yeast extract based broth through late logarithmic phase of growth and allowed to sporulate The spores were collected by centrifugation washed twice with 100 mL of sterile water freeze dried and stored under desiccation until used The bacterial strain used is a typical Bacillus subtilis strain and is available from the corresponding author upon request Exposure of cells and spores to a simulated Martian soil environment Microbiological experiments were performed with data points collected in triplicate using small microcosms comprised of 50mL serum bottles Surrogate soil 100 mg microcosm and spores about 2 10 4per gram of soil were placed together into the bottles To ensure complete mixing and uniform exposure of all cells or spores to the ferrate component of the soil they were first suspended in a small amount of sterile water This was thoroughly mixed into the sand fraction of the surrogate soil which was then lyophilized The ferrate component of the surrogate soil was next thoroughly mixed into the microbe enriched dry sand within a sterile laminar flow hood and the bottles were flushed with pure CO 2 and sealed with sterile stoppers and crimp seals The CO 2 was provided from a bottle of reagent grade carbon dioxide 99 purity as compressed gas and was scrubbed to remove traces of oxygen and water The microcosms were sparged with multiple volumes of gas under normal atmospheric pressure The sealed microcosms were immediately placed in a freezer at 20 C Periodically triplicate bottles were removed and opened for analysis A small amount of water 1 ml was added and 0 1 ml of the suspension was quickly removed using an aseptic technique and spread onto a plate of nutrient agar Difco The plates were incubated at 30 C and then examined periodically for outgrowth of Bacillus subtilis colonies Plates were inoculated in triplicate and colony forming units determined after 24 hours and again after 48 hours of incubation Controls without ferrate were run simultaneously Similar experiments were performed after replacing ferrate with an equal amount of potassium permanganate Protection of spores in dry soil from killing by surface UV irradiation in the presence of 20 permanganate A surrogate soil containing 20 by weight permanganate in sand was inoculated with spores of Bacillus subtilis and placed within a Forma Scientific UV illuminated laminar flow hood under its full UV illumination and in the presence of air for 96 hours The open surface of the microcosm was placed approximately 50 cm from the 15 watt mercury vapor light source The hood is calibrated annually for effectiveness and under these conditions will produce 10
