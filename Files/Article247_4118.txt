 Hanukkah and Combination Skin Dear Margo An editor at Slate a Jew notes that we are ideally matched partners because we share an obsession with the Chosen People So I am sure you will understand my feelings of discomfort on this third day of Hanukkah As originally conceived Hanukkah was a celebration of Jewish resistance to a Greek invasion It has evolved into a test of our ability to withstand a grease invasion For the last few days Jews around the world have consumed an unspeakable amount of a delicacy called latkes potato pancakes cooked in vats of oil Today I am sorry to report this Jew is doing a terrible job of resisting the grease December is already an unkind month for those of us with combination skin But on this third day of latkes many of us awoke to find that our faces haven t been this splotchy since our bar mitzvahs A little sympathy Margo or a suggestion for a home remedy Prudie please I am currently en route to Phoenix for tonight s debate between the Republican presidential nominees Yes there is a debate tonight Yes Massa George W Bush will be there But oddly John McCain won t be in his home state The way I understand it he ll be piped in via satellite from New Hampshire I happen to think that this is the latest in a series of shrewd moves by the Angry White Candidate who graces the cover of Time magazine this week Let Bush share the stage with Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer and Steve Forbes It can only help to diminish him Meanwhile John McCain looks above the fray in his remote studio And if he gets a tough question he can always claim that technical problems have prevented him from hearing it This same group of GOPers got together last week and pretty much exhausted pretty much every available topic of contention Therefore I predict tonight will be especially raucous Without anything else of substance to talk about the candidates can fill their time with the ad hominem attacks they ve been saving up Desperate candidates like Bauer have been threatening to take the gloves off Before every debate Bauer aides promise Tonight you ll really see Gary unplugged I m still waiting and hoping that he ll finally be barking mad Before we get off politics and onto more important questions like the death of the sitcom what is it with drama critic Peter Marks piece on campaign ads on the front page of the Times I like the idea of having critics write on politics The Times seems to want to make it a regular feature with recent contributions by Caryn James and Michiko Kakutani And our friend Frank Rich does it brilliantly But what we like about Frank is that he takes his sharpened pencil and jabs into politicians the same way that he would a third rate revival Steve Forbes would be as devastated as badly as Footloose the musical But Marks Kakutani and James seem to be holding back The paper is probably afraid of launching napalm filled lorries from the front page So why waste the space If we wanted to talk about Jews this morning there are plenty of ways to get started There is the burning question Did the West Nile virus originate in Israel Then there is the intriguing Safra murder I would probably rather talk about the decline of the sitcom which the Times diagnoses It argues the genre is worn out and will be challenged by the rise of the game show This strikes me as bunk Sitcoms have been expanding exponentially over the 90s The wild success of Friends I think kicked off the era But TV is the classic Me Too medium Success breeds infinite imitation and infinite imitation means loads of dreck that garners poor ratings and cancellation Soon we ll be reading stories about The End of the Game Show What we re seeing isn t the end of the genre but a return to equilibrium We ll have as many sitcoms as we had in say 1991 And to this trend I say Amen If you re looking for me tonight on TV I ll be the Jew with the bad complexion Unctuously Frank
