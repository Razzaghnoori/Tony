                                 Hanukkah and Combination Skin                        Dear Margo            An editor at                   Slate               a Jewnotes that we are ideallymatched partners because we share an obsession with the Chosen People So I amsure you will understand my feelings of discomfort on this third day ofHanukkah            As originally conceived Hanukkah was a celebration of Jewish resistance toa Greek invasion It has evolved into a test of our ability to withstand agrease invasion For the last few days Jews around the world have consumed anunspeakable amount of a delicacy called latkespotato pancakes cooked in vatsof oil Today I am sorry to report this Jew is doing a terrible job ofresisting the grease December is already an unkind month for those of us withcombination skin But on this third day of latkes many of us awoke to findthat our faces havent been this splotchy since our bar mitzvahs A littlesympathy Margo or a suggestion for a homeremedy Prudie please             I am currently en route to Phoenix for tonights debate between theRepublican presidential nominees Yes there is a debate tonight Yes MassaGeorge W Bush will be there But oddly John McCain wont be in his homestate The way I understand it hell be piped in via satellite from NewHampshire I happen to think that this is the latest in a series of shrewdmoves by the Angry White Candidate who graces the cover of Timemagazine this week Let Bush share the stage with Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer andSteve Forbes It can only help to diminish him Meanwhile John McCain looksabove the fray in his remote studio And if he gets a tough question he canalways claim that technical problems have prevented him from hearing it            This same group of GOPers got together last week and pretty much exhaustedpretty much every available topic of contention Therefore I predict tonightwill be especially raucous Without anything else of substance to talk aboutthe candidates can fill their time with the ad hominem attacks theyve beensaving up Desperate candidates like Bauer have been threatening to take thegloves off Before every debate Bauer aides promise Tonight youll reallysee Gary unplugged Im still waiting and hoping that hell finally be barkingmad            Before we get off politics and onto more important questionslike the deathof the sitcomwhat is it with drama critic Peter Marks piece on campaign adson the front page of the Times  I like the idea of having critics writeon politics The Times seems to want to make it a regular feature withrecent contributions by Caryn James and Michiko Kakutani And our friend FrankRich does it brilliantly But what we like about Frank is that he takes hissharpened pencil and jabs into politicians the same way that he would athirdrate revival Steve Forbes would be as devastated as badly asFootloose the musical But Marks Kakutani and James seem to be holdingback The paper is probably afraid of launching napalmfilled lorries from thefront page So why waste the space            If we wanted to talk about Jews this morning there are plenty of ways toget started There is the burning question Did the West Nile virus originatein Israel Then there is the intriguing Safra murder I would probably rathertalk about the decline of the sitcom which the Times diagnoses Itargues the genre is worn out and will be challenged by the rise of the gameshow This strikes me as bunk Sitcoms have been expanding exponentially overthe s The wild success of Friends  I think kicked off the era ButTV is the classic Me Too medium Success breeds infinite imitation andinfinite imitation means loads of dreck that garners poor ratings andcancellation Soon well be reading stories about The End of the Game ShowWhat were seeing isnt the end of the genre but a return to equilibriumWell have as many sitcoms as we had in say  And to this trend I sayAmen            If youre looking for me tonight on TV Ill be the Jew with the badcomplexion            UnctuouslyFrank
