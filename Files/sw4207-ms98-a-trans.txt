        uh actually it took me quite a while to get someone uh about six minutes so i have had some time to think about this and you know what is been done and whats could be done and should be done         um i think up to this point and time the problem with uh recollection or waste what ever is that it is sort of on a voluntary uh bases were you know have to actually  except personal effort to make it happen you know like take your papers to the   umhum      uh recycling center you take this uh one place or another and um in Portola Valley where i live the i gets  i use  garbage company i dont know what they do in Mountain View but uh   yeah we have our own   uh they have a program that uh they send a truck through basically you dont have to do anything all you have to do is put your papers uh out put your bottle out in a bag put your paper out in a bad and they do the recollection for you basically they come by in a cycle quite a bit like garbage pickup um and in fact   yeah that that that also what they do here in Mountain View in fact there is um uh for each area like for our area there is a person who a recycling block leader where i dont know if its that way were you where they put up a sign       um telling people in the community that its uh the recycling day coming up the next day so that people are aware of it and so people are its a reminded to tell people to do that and yeah where even uh an official recycling block black liters of     i see oh okay   for our area the other i now some people living in New Jersey and they said where they live um its mandatory that you do recycling and if the garbage people and i dont know how thoroughly they they check this but if they find certain essentially contra banned um   the garbage is  inspected   things in your  uh yeah basic basically your garbage is being inspected if they find certain contraband things in there you can be fine for it  it       oh thats interesting   yeah i i thought that was really amazing and it uh its sort of another way of uh uh encouraging or try new uh enforce that that type of um proper behavior   well i think the only way to make it really successful is to make it as easy as possible for people and i i think that uh practice here uh you know i lived previously in Dallas up to uh a year or so ago practice here of sort of making it an automated part of garbage pickup uh seem to be a step forward   yeah i think it i think its true and i think that um do you think it would help if there were um financial incentives like you know were people bring the um uh there cans and um and you get a penny a can or something do you think those type of uh remediation are to   well my sisterinlaw lives in northern Wisconsin and they have a financial system there actually i cant recall exactly what it is but you have uh sort of a free pick up of sorted garbage if you sort it and its actually pretty tedious     sorted or sorted   sort of sorted not  free pickup the uh free pickup of sorted garbage uh but you its actually pretty     probably some of that to   nitpicking how you have to sort it uh and for sorted garbage uh indiscriminate garbage there is a fee oh a rather exorbitant fee   umhum oh really if you mix and match things improperly   uh well uh uh uh it i guess in it this is also a subject inspection as you well mention but uh i a it basically on an all name basics if you this the uh sorted stuff that you put out is uh quite a healthy fee for for picking that up and i think its free or something like that for the stuff that is sorted   huh yeah around here also im in Mountain View and i presume in this whole area i expect that the kind of pickup that that you have in Porta Valley and we have here are now very common uh at least in this area and we also have um uh day when theres um uh two days a year when theres hazardous waste um dropoff were weve dropped off things like cans of paint that are in or garage and dropoff um other things     hum umhum   uh and its a different sort of recycling but its also uh very helpful to keep stuff from going down the drain and into the water system and wherever else that goes and i dont know what they do with the one that happen seems like its a uh significant problem for thing that you dont wont people to put down the drain and i dont i dont know if those go into landfills or   right   i dont know landfills  actually dont seem like a good solution either for them   yeah yeah it would be nice if we had a continuing cycle here where every
