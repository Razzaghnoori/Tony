 Family Matters Please send your questions for publication to prudence slate com Dear Prudence How does one get over a spouse s affair How long does it take for the hurt to lessen Susan From Bethlehem Dear Sus As with bleeding healing takes different amounts of time for different people Alas some people bleed to death Prudie wishes you peace of mind wherever you may find it Give yourself some time to see how things play out and see how you re feeling about things well about him If you can t get over it get out of it Prudie understandingly Dear Prudence I am having an ongoing ordeal over whether my 12 year old daughter should refer to her stepfather as Dad Stepdad or by his first name I ve been remarried for six years to my present husband and he insists that my daughter should refer to him as either Dad or Mr Giles when addressing him My daughter calls my husband by his first name which infuriates him because he believes it is disrespectful My daughter insists he doesn t deserve to be called Dad and now only makes reference to him when mentioning her stepfather to friends or relatives Please advise about what would be the most appropriate way to handle the situation Mrs Giles Dear Mrs Mr Giles sounds like a real beaut The form of address you understand is merely the battleground for the simmering war between them Your daughter won t call him Dad which he wants and he won t permit a first name address which is perfectly acceptable which is what she wants And for whatever it s worth Prudie has never heard of anyone saying Stepdad please pass the salt so forget that one Someone maybe a family counselor needs to deal with the alienation the youngster feels and the hostility harbored by your husband If you can find a way to deal with and improve their relationship what she calls him will become a moot point Reading between the lines it may be that the child s biological father and your husband s own offspring situation are part of the equation Prudie worriedly Dear P Tell me if I m overreacting I was having lunch with Danielle who works in hospital billings in the cafeteria Just in passing I mentioned that I never received a thank you note for my small wedding gift Danielle insisted I was wrong and to prove it took me to her office where she pulled out this book of friends In it she had a page for each of her friends and on my page was listed what I gave her and the date she wrote a thank you note What was troubling was not so much that but the other entries including how friend responded to death of her father i e flowers card etc I think her accountant s mind has gone too far I mean you can t measure everything and keeping a ledger on your friends is odd I told her this and she said that in the Jewish tradition they believe all your actions are inscribed in the book and she is doing just that What do you think Unsure Dear Un Prudie thinks this woman is one sandwich shy of a picnic What she is referring to is God s accounting not hers The poor dear must have been reading Marvel comics in school when they talked about this It is true that the humanistic Jewish view holds that the substance of one s life is created by good deeds but a ledger toting up flowers and cards does not figure in Her misunderstanding reminds Prudie of the policeman who asked a driver what gear she was in at the moment her car hit another Gucci sweats and Reeboks she said Prudie rationally Prudence I am a 20 year old female and I have been married for six years and have a 5 year old son with my husband He works a lot and our marriage hasn t been on track for about 5 months now and we seem to be more like roommates than a married couple I don t know if he s cheating on me but he has been acting strangely He s been coming home at 6 a m when he gets out of work at 1 30 in the morning He tells me it s because he goes to have coffee with his boss after they close the store where he works I don t know whether my marriage is over and whether to talk to him about all this and ask if we can work things out One thing I do know is that if my husband is cheating I wouldn t be able to stay with him Confused Dear Con My dear if your husband really is drinking coffee from 1 30 to 6 a m he would need to wear Depends If you suspect he is taking an after work breather with someone other than his employer you could call the man and ask He may however not level with you In any case girlfriend or pool parlor you must get the problem out in the open When you state your age and the age of your child it sounds like you are in Romeo and Juliet territory If this is not a typo you are far too young to be dealing with all the factors you mention Confront your husband with both your suspicions and your awareness that things have gone off track See where the conversation goes If he has a million complaints consider counseling if he s willing or separate maintenance You cannot live like this and needn t tolerate his in your face behavior Prudie proactively
