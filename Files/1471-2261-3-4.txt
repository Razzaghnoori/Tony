 Background The human disorder of sitosterolemia also known as phytosterolemia MIM 210250 is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the marked elevation of plasma phytosterols e g sitosterol campesterol and stigmasterol 1 2 Hypercholesterolemia primarily during childhood accelerated atherosclerosis in some adult patients leading to premature death as well a hemolytic anaemia arthralgias and tendon and tuberous xanthoma formations are other clinical features Studies have shown that the sitosterolemic patients hyperabsorb all sterols cholesterol and phytosterols and fail to excrete phytosterols into bile 3 4 5 6 7 Positional mapping of the STSL locus to human chromosome 2p21 led to the identification of two genes ATP binding cassette ABC half transporters G5 and G8 that were mutated in affected individuals 8 9 10 11 12 The protein products of these two genes sterolin 1 and sterolin 2 respectively are thought to form heterodimers to constitute a functional transporter based primarily on the genetic evidence that affected individuals are either completely mutated in sterolin 1 or sterolin 2 but not both 12 More recently evidence from in vitro expression of these proteins has been presented that these two proteins co immunoprecipitate supporting this conclusion 13 ABCG5 and ABCG8 appear to be present in all mammalian genomes examined to date and are highly conserved between species indicating that these genes may have a similar function in other species In order to identify naturally occurring animal models of sitosterolemia we previously reported a screen of 20 in bred mouse strains 14 This screen showed considerable genetic variation at these loci in the mouse strains but none of these strains exhibited sitosterolemia However a literature search revealed that a few strains of rats studied primarily for investigation of hypertension and stroke have been reported to be sitosterolemic as well 15 16 We hypothesised that these rat strains may be mutated in either Abcg5 or Abcg8 Tissue and plasma plant sterol levels in the Wistar Kyoto WKY rat the spontaneously hypertensive rat SHR and the stroke prone spontaneously hypertensive rat SHRSP were significantly higher than in Wistar and WKA rats fed either a regular chow diet or diets that have higher plant sterols and these were correlated with increased death or red cell hemolysis etc 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Dietary sterol absorption rates were increased with a decrease in sterol excretion 16 characteristics similar to that observed in sitosterolemic patients In this study we report the gene structure organisation cDNA and tissue expression patterns of rat Abcg5 and Abcg8 Using fluorescence in situ hybridization the rat STSL locus was assigned to the chromosomal 6q12 Interestingly a cluster of 2 blood pressure BP quantitative trait loci QTL in GH BN F2 with LOD scores 4 63 tail BP and 6 82 intra arterial BP has also been reported to map to rat chromosome 6 between D6Mit3 and D6Mit12 an area containing the STSL locus We interrogated this region for genetic variations and found a correlation between sitosterolemic strains and a missense mutation in Abcg5 Methods DNA Samples of rat strains The DNA samples from the following rat strains were used Sprague Dawley SD Charles River Laboratories Wilmington MA Wistar Sea Wistar Outbred SPF Seac Yoshitomi and WKA WKA

Fukuoka Japan GH and BN The genomic DNAs from GH and BN rats were a kind gift from Dr E L Harris New Zealand The liver tissue genomic DNAs from SD WKY and SHR rats were extracted by digestion overnight at 55 C in lysis buffer 10 mM Tris pH8 0 100 mM NaCl 50 mM EDTA 0 5 SDS and 0 2 mg ml proteinase K followed by phenol chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation Genomic analysis and determination of exon intron boundaries Rat cDNAs for Abcg5 and Abcg8 were identified previously by amplification of these sequences from a Sprague Dawley rat enterocyte cDNA library using primers located in areas conserved between mouse and human Genbank AF312714 and AF351785 respectively For Abcg5 the first PCR fragment was obtained by PCR using primers ABCG5 F4 5 ATCCTCAAAGATGTCTCCTTGTAC 3 and ABCG5 R3 5 TCCTGACTCTCCTGGTCGCT 3 For Abcg8 cDNA sequences the primers F11 5 AGATGCTGGCCATCATAGGG 3 and R13 5 GATGGAGAAGGTGAAGTTGCC 3 were used to amplify rat Abcg8 cDNA fragments These products were sequenced and used to design primers specific for rat cDNA and a rat intestinal cDNA library was screened by anchor PCR Direct sequencing of the PCR products led to the identification of rat cDNA sequence and allowed for design of rat specific primers Table 1 see Additional file 1 Based upon the structure of mouse genes putative rat specific exonic primers were designed and used to amplify rat genomic regions as previously described All PCR products were directly sequenced and both strands were sequenced as a routine The complete rat genomic sequences have been deposited with GenBank

situ hybridization FISH For FISH analysis metaphase chromosomes were prepared from rat embryo fibroblasts The cells were cultured in DMEM medium at 37 C for 2 days and treated with 0 05 g ml colcemid for 45 min The cells were harvested by mitotic shake off and resuspended in 0 075 M KCl at room temperature for 10 min Fixation was carried out as described previously 23 Fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH was performed essentially according to Pinkel et al 24 with minor modifications 25 The rat sequences used for FISH labelling were amplified genomic DNA fragments Abcg5 exons 6 10 primers RG5 F6 and RG5 R10 and Abcg8 exons 4 13 primers RG8 F4 and RG8 R13 Table 1 see Additional file 1 The two gene fragments were labelled separately with digoxigenin 11 dUTP Boehringer Mannheim Germany by nick translation Life Technologies Inc Gaithersburg MD Appropriate length 50 to 500 bp of the nick translated fragments was monitored by checking the nick translation products on a 1 agarose gel The two gene fragments were precipitated separately using 800 ng of labelled DNA with 20 g unlabeled rat C o t1 DNA which was included in order to suppress probe hybridization to repetitive sequences The probe DNA mixtures were ethanol precipitated and dissolved in hybridization buffer 50 formamide 2 SSC 10 dextran sulphate After denaturation the highly repetitive sequences in the probe mixture DNA were allowed to bind to the C o t1 DNA 10 min at 37 C The probe mixtures were then applied to rat fibroblast metaphase chromosome slides previously denatured at 73 C for 2 min in 70 formamide 2 SSC Hybridization was allowed to proceed in a moist chamber for 70 h at 37 C Subsequently the slides were washed for 15 min at 45 C in 55 formamide 2 SSC and then in 2 SSC pH 7 0 at 43 C for 9 min The labelled probe molecules were detected with rhodamine anti digoxigenin Oncor Inc Gaithersburg MD and the slides were washed 3 times in PBS and 0 1 Nonidet NP 40 Finally chromosome spreads were counterstained with 4 6 diamino 2 phenylindole DAPI 0 5 g ml in an antifade solution Vectashield Vector Laboratories Inc Burlingame CA The images were captured using the LEICA DM RXA in combination with the Q FISH software for microphotography Tissue expression of Abcg5and Abcg8 A rat multiple tissue Northern blot Origene Technologies Rockville MD containing immobilised poly A mRNA from Sprague Dawley rat was used Rat sterolin cDNA probes were labelled and hybridization and washing steps were performed as described previously 26 Total tissue RNAs were extracted from multiple tissues from a Sprague Dawley rat using Trizol reagent as described previously Random hexamers were used as primers for reverse transcription of 2 g of rat RNA from the multiple tissues The primers were annealed to template at 25 C for 10 min and the reaction were incubated at 53 C for 1 h in the presence of Superscript Reverse transcriptase 5 mM dNTP mix and RN ase Out inhibitor The rat Abcg5 specific primers RG5c F1 and RG5Fc R1 Abcg8 specific primers RG8c F1 and RG8c R1 and actin primers sense 5 CTACGTCGCCCTGGACTTCGAGC 3 antisense 5 GATGGAGCCGCCGATCCACACGG 3 were used for further PCR amplification an initial denaturation at 94 C for 3 min 35 cycles of PCR amplification with each cycle consisting of 30 min at 94 C 45 s at 60 C and 2 min at 72 C followed by an extension step of 72 C for 5 min The resultant PCR products were gel purified and sequenced Real Time PCR For quantitation real time PCR was employed Primers used were based upon previously published mouse primer sets 27 28 or designed using MacVector from cDNA sequences between exons avoiding the amplification of potentially contaminating genomic DNA in the total RNA sample Table 3 Samples of total RNA 2 g from rat livers were reverse transcribed according to the SuperScript First Strand Synthesis System Invitrogen Carlsbad CA using random hexamers with a final volume of 20 l Real time PCR was performed on a PE

PE Biosystems Forest City CA 0 7 l of cDNA template and 100 500 nM of oligonucleotide primers Initial steps of RT PCR were 2 minutes at 50 C for UNG erase activation followed by a 15 minute hold at 95 C Cycles n 40 consisted of a 15 second melt at 95 C followed by a 1 minute annealing extension at 60 C The final step was a 60 C incubation for 1 minute All reactions were performed in triplicate Threshold cycle CT analysis of all samples was set at 0 5 relative fluorescence units The relative amounts of Abcg5 Abcg8 Cyp7a1 HMG CoA reductase and Srebp 2 message from rat liver samples used in real time RT PCR were normalised to GAPDH expression levels to compensate for variations in input RNA amounts The data were analysed using the comparative threshold cycle method CT method Briefly the CT values were averaged from triplicate determinations defining a CT value calculated by taking the average CT of the gene of interest and subtracting it from the average CT of GAPDH The CT was calculated by subtracting the average CT calibrator values from the CT sample The relative quantification was then calculated by the expression 2 Average CT The mRNA quantity for the calibrator SD samples is expressed as 1X sample and all other quantities are expressed as a fold difference relative to the calibrator SD samples Total membrane protein preparations Approximately 500 mg of liver tissue cut into small pieces was homogenised in ice cold lysis buffer 5 mM Tris pH7 5 250 mM sucrose with protease inhibitors PMSF Leupeptin Aprotinin by a dounce homogenizer times10 strokes Samples

resuspended in 25 mM Tris pH7 5 150 mM NaCl 0 1 TritonX 100 and 0 1 SDS by passaging through a 25 gauge needle Membrane protein concentrations were determined by a colorimetric assay according to manufacturer s protocol BioRad Hercules CA and 20 g of total membrane proteins resolved by 7 5 SDS acrylamide gel Immunoblotting and Immunolocalization Proteins resolved by SDS PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and the membranes blocked for 2 hours in 5 dry milk in PBS T Phosphate Buffered saline and 0 1 Tween 20 Blots were then probed with a primary rabbit anti peptide 116 VNGCELRRDQFQDCCVSYLLQS 136 antibody against rat sterolin 1 1 1000 dilution overnight at 4 C The blot was washed once for 5 minutes in PBS T incubated with goat anti rabbit conjugated HRP 1 10000 dilution for 1 hour washed for 5 minutes in PBS T and developed with Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus PerkinElmer Life Sciences Inc Boston MA Snap frozen rat liver and intestine tissues were sectioned to 8 m thickness using a cryotome Bright air dried for 30 min and keep at 80 C until used The slides were stained with hematoxylin Fixation was performed by incubating samples

incubated overnight at 4 C The slides were washed with PBS and secondary antibody goat anti rabbit FITC conjugated was applied for 20 30 min at room temperature washed and the signals captured and analyzed using an Olympus BX 50 microscope with Fluoview software The fluorescent stained images were observed under blue filter excitation and capture excitation images at 488 nm wavelength Nucleotide polymorphisms in Abcg5and Abcg8genes Direct sequencing of PCR amplified genomic fragments was performed as described previously 11 The 5 flanking region all the exons and the 3 UTR region as well as the introns of Abcg5 and Abcg8 with size less than 1 Kb were individually amplified using primers as described in Table 2 The amplified PCR products were sequenced by the use of an automated capillary sequencer The Sprague Dawley nucleotide sequence of Abcg5 and Abcg8 was regarded as wild type Comparisons to mammalian sterolins GenBank accession Nos AF312713 AF312714 AF312715 AF324494 AF324495 AF351785 as well as Fugu GenBank No CAAB01001529 was made using ClustalW 29 Results Genomic organisation and chromosome mapping of the rat STSLlocus Rat cDNA sequences for Abcg5 and Abcg8 were isolated and characterized as indicated in Methods Based upon the known conservation between the murine and human STSL loci 14 we designed oligonucleotides in putative exonic regions and used PCR amplification of rat genomic region to characterise the genome organisation Figure 1shows a summary composite of the genomic organisation The intron exon boundary sequences are indicated in Table 3 In keeping with the human and mouse STSL loci the rat Abcg5 and Abcg8 genes are arranged in a head to head configuration with a distance of 379 bp separating their respective initiation codons The exact start transcriptional sites for either gene has not been definitively established Comparison of the DNA sequence of isolated cDNAs as well as the polypeptide sequence with human and mouse sequences revealed a very high degree of homology 80 To assign the chromosomal location we performed FISH analyses and we were able to unambiguously map the rat STSL locus to chromosome 6q12 Fig 2 There is specific labelling of both chromatids of both homologues of rat chromosome RNO 6 Fig 2Aand 2B Based on the DAPI banding pattern the Abcg5 and Abcg8 genes were sub localized to RNO6q12 The STSL locus was mapped to the same position as shown by the diagrammatic representation of the rat Chr 6 as shown in Fig 2 The human ABCG5 and ABCG8 genes are present in a group of 18 genes ABCG5 ABCG8 SLC8A1 PRKR GCKR KHK PPP1CB APOB POMC1 SDC1 MYCN DDX1 VSNL1 RRM2 ODC1 ID2 TPO and ACP1 in the region HSA2p21 p25 and this group is also present on RNO6 Thus the ABCG5 and ABCG8 genes fit into a group of genes that are syntenic both in HSA2 and in RNO6 A conserved segment between HSA2 RNO6 and MMU17 on RNO6q11 q16 has been demonstrated by Zoo FISH analysis and gene mapping data confirming this synteny 30 31 32 Expression patterns of rat Abcg5and Abcg8mRNAs Rat Abcg5 and Abcg8 mRNA expression patterns were determined using a commercial multiple tissue poly A Northern filter Expression appeared mainly to be confined to the liver Fig 3A with dominant transcripts sizes of 2 5 kb for Abcg5 and of 4 5 kb for Abcg8 However the poly A RNA loaded onto this Northern blot has been adjusted to obtain an identical actin signal and the intestinal RNA loaded may thus have less enterocyte RNA Using a more sensitive RT PCR analyses of RNA obtained from different tissues confirmed that rat Abcg5 and Abcg8 genes were expressed in both in the liver and small intestine with a low level of expression in the colon Fig 3B Additionally while screening an enterocyte cDNA library for full length cDNAs using PCR we consistently amplified two DNA products when using Abcg8 primers flanking exon 2 one of the expected size and another very low copy product 60 bases larger Direct sequencing of these products confirmed both of these contained Abcg8 rat cDNA sequences but the larger product contained a 66 bp insertion resulting in a predicted in frame addition of 22 amino acids between exons 2 and 3 To confirm that this insertion resulted from an alternatively spliced mRNA we amplified and sequenced the intragenic region between exons 2 and 3 and identified a 66 bp exon exon 2b flanked by canonical splice sites see Table 2and Fig 4 We next screened total liver and intestinal RNA using RT PCR from SD SHR and WKY rats Fig 4 In all samples a larger DNA fragment of low abundance was identified Fig 4 and direct sequencing showed that these fragments contained exon 2b sequences data not shown It is not established whether these transcripts are a result of aberrant splicing or are translated and code for a slightly larger sterolin 2 Careful interrogation of the mouse and human genomic sequences did not identify any homologous sequences suggesting this is unique to the rat Additionally both the mouse and human Abcg8 genes have alternatively spliced mRNA involving a CAG repeat at exon 2 and exon 8 splice acceptor sites respectively 12 14 However despite the presence of such a repeat at the rat exon 2 splice acceptor site for Abcg8 Table 2 none of the rat mRNAs showed any heterogeneity of splice site selection at this site Hypertensive rats have sitosterolemia and a mis sense change in Abcg5 A number of different groups have reported that genetically hypertensive strains of rats SHR SHRSP WKY have elevated levels of plasma sitosterol 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Although the WKY strain is not considered hypertensive dietary alterations involving plant sterols appear to increase blood pressure in this strain 21 We screened two commercially available hypertensive rats as well as a genetically hypertensive strain GH for plasma plant sterol levels and compared these to two control strains Sprague Dawley and Wistar Table 4 Our analyses confirmed that WKY and SHR are sitosterolemic on a chow diet but neither the control strains nor the GH rat showed any significant differences To identify if alterations at the STSL locus could account for these observations we amplified and directly sequenced Abcg5 and Abcg8 from Wistar Sprague Dawley WKY WKA GH SHR and SHRSP rats Table 5shows a compilation of both coding and non coding alterations detected There were 24 polymorphic changes detected in Abcg5 and 14 polymorphic changes in Abcg8 However only one non synonymous nucleotide change G1754T resulting in a conservative cysteine substitution for glycine at amino acid 583 Gly583Cys in sterolin 1 was identified Fig 5A This mutation was only detected in SHR SHRSP and WKY rats and was present in all of these strains as a homozygous change Table 5 These hypertensive strains also shared uniquely 4 other nucleotide changes not present in the other strains Table 5 These latter changes were confined to intronic areas and the 3 UTR region Although the intronic changes are unlikely to alter the biology of these genes the 3 UTR insertion in Abcg8 mRNA could be important if message stability were affected This possibility was not formally investigated The identified G1754T Gly583Cys missense mutation of the Abcg5 generates loss of a restriction site for Hae III after PCR amplification of exon 12 and this allowed a PCR RFLP assay to further confirm the detected change Figure 5B Note that the DNA chosen from a single Wistar rat was heterozygous for almost all of these changes The amino acid G583 is conserved between all known mammalian sterolin 1 proteins Fig 5C and its alteration may have functional consequences as it is also conserved in evolution being conserved in the Fugu fish Fig 5C Fugu sterolin 1 shows a 55 homology to rat sterolin 1 at the amino acid level and its gene structure is also organized in a similar fashion data not shown Currently a gap in the Fugu genomic sequence has not been completed that may encode for exon 2 The complete Fugu STSL locus is available on line GenBank No CAAB01001529 In Abcg8 a large insertional polymorphism was identified in exon 13 that resulted in the insertion of 143 nucleotides in the 3 UTR 2099_2100ins143nt WKY SHR SHRSP and GH rats are homozygous Sprague Dawley and WKA strains wild type and the Wistar sample heterozygous for this polymorphism Fig 6 Comparison of expression of Abcg5and Abcg8in hypertensive rat strains Expression levels of Abcg5 and Abcg8 in these rat strains were examined in two ways For mRNA expression quantitative real time PCR was utilised and for protein western blotting analyses as well as immunohistochemistry was employed Fig 7shows the results of the real time PCR assays of liver RNAs from fasted animals Using GAPDH mRNA expression as a control expression of Abcg5 and Abcg8 mRNAs appeared to be increased in liver from SHR compared to Sprague Dawley Fig 7 the message for Cyp7 a1 except for Wistar and WKY HMG CoA reductase SR B1 and SREBP 2 except for SHR were relatively unchanged Interestingly the message for LDL R was reduced in both WKY and SHR livers To compare protein expression levels of the sterolins we performed western blotting A reliable antibody to sterolin 1 was available only and was used to probe liver microsomal lysates from Sprague Dawley SHR and Wistar rats Fig 8 Although equal amounts of microsomal protein lysates were loaded from the livers of these different strains we consistently observed that the protein expression patterns were always different between SHR and the control strains Fig 8 panel C cf tracks 5 6 and 8 Thus all of the data were normalised in one of two ways either by using total microsomal protein or by using the intensity of transferrin signal after western blotting Both of these methods gave consistent results and indicated that expression of Abcg5 was increased approximately 2 fold in the SHR but not the Wistar or SD Fig 8 To further assess if the mutant protein is mis targeted we performed immunolocalization using an anti peptide rabbit antibody on various rat liver and intestinal sections Fig 9 We did not observe any differences between the staining patterns observed for the control rat strains Wistar or SD and the mutant hypertensive strains SHR SHRSP Interestingly we observed a clear apical staining pattern for Abcg5 in the intestine and this was not altered in the mutant strains Fig 9 panel B Discussion Recent studies on ABC transporters have significantly advanced our understanding of intestinal sterol absorption and biliary excretion 33 Sterols are essential constituents of cellular membranes in human animals and plants In humans and animals cholesterol is the sterol that is synthesised absorbed and utilised whereas plants do not synthesise cholesterol but use molecules that are similar such as sitosterol campesterol and stigmasterol Although similar amounts of cholesterol and plant sterols are present in the typical human diet the intestine of normal subjects provides an efficient barrier against the absorption of the majority of plant sterols 3 On average 1 5 of dietary plant sterols are absorbed and retained compared with 55 of dietary cholesterol 3 34 Thus in healthy individuals there exists an exquisite mechanism that allows the body to distinguish between cholesterol and non cholesterol sterols ABCG5 and ABCG8 are two genes located adjacently in a head to head configuration on human chromosome 2p21 encoding for two half transporters sterolin 1 and sterolin 2 respectively 9 10 12 Mutations in either of these genes causes sitosterolemia characterized by hyperabsorption of phytosterols reduced excretion of sterols into the bile and very elevated levels of plasma plant sterol levels In sitosterolemic patients the absorption of phytosterols in intestine is dramatically increased with absorption of plant sterols to about the same extent 60 as cholesterol Interestingly a similar whole body accumulation of plant sterols less severe than in human sitosterolemia has been reported recently in SHR SHRSP and WKY rats but not in the other genetically related rat strains such as SD Wistar and WKA rats 16 These rats exhibit defects at two levels increased absorption of sterols plant and animal at the intestinal level and decreased excretion of sterols into bile 16 The higher sterol absorption in the intestine and the lower biliary excretion of plant sterols in these rat strains led us to hypothesise that Abcg5 or Abcg8 gene mutations may be responsible for the sitosterolemia observed in these hypertensive rats Characterization of the rat STSL locus showed that it is highly conserved in organization and maps to rat chromosome 6q12 a region also syntenic with the mouse and human STSL loci Rat Abcg5 and Abcg8 are expressed in a tissue specific manner with expression confined to the liver and the intestine We sequenced the STSL loci in sitosterolemic and control rat strains and identified a number of nucleotide changes Most of these nucleotide changes were in intronic regions and based upon their locations are likely to be silent However one change G1754T in exon 12 was identified that led to a coding change of Gly583Cys in sterolin 1 Abcg5 This change was found only in rat strains that were confirmed to be sitosterolemic WKY SHR and SHRSP but not in any of the other strains screened SD Wistar WKA GH or BN The significance of other genetic variances in Abcg5 and Abcg8 in different rat strains documented in this study is presently unknown Plant sterol metabolism has been extensively evaluated in different rat strains but the accumulation of plant sterols occurs only in SHR SHRSP and WKY rats The predicted 6 trans membrane domain model of sterolin 1 indicates that the Gly583Cys missense mutation is located within the third extracellular loop residues 554 620 in a conserved region Fig 5C and is adjacent to two potential N glycosylation sites residues 585 and 594 Thus a mutation at residue 583 could disrupt the first site Finally both the sterolin 1 and sterolin 2 are cysteine rich proteins 16 cysteines in sterolin 1 and 14 in sterolin 2 five of these cyteines in sterolin 1 are present in the extracellular loop containing the mutation It is tempting to speculate that the gain of an additional cysteine in sterolin 1 by the Gly583Cys missense mutation might affect intracellular trafficking or the heterodimerization with sterolin 2 This possibility is diminished but not eliminated by the demonstration that in both the mutant and control rats Abcg5 is located apically in the intestine Fig 9 Evidence that sterolin 1 and sterolin 2 may heterodimerize has now been presented based upon in vitro analyses 13 However our preliminary analyses of immunohistochemistry using an antibody to sterolin 1 suggests that the pattern of expression in the liver and intestine is similar for both SD as well as WKY or SHR rats Fig 9 These studies are limited in scope as antibody reagents to detect rat sterolin 2 are not currently available Another formal possibility not excluded is that the Gly583Cys missense mutation may have no significance in the accumulation of phytosterols in WKY SHR and SHRSP and that the alteration in the 3 UTR or even the intronic changes reported above may be the causative mutations Our analyses of the mRNA and protein profiles would not strongly support these possibilities However further investigation will be required to determine if the 3 base insertion in the predicted 3 UTR of Abcg8 has any functional consequence In the absence of a direct assay for sterolin 1 and 2 function the genetic changes presented together with the correlation of the phenotypes remains the strongest evidence that these genetic alterations are functional and that the Gly583Cys is a mutational change A more relevant question raised in this study is whether the plant sterol accumulation in hypertensive rat strains has significance in the pathophysiology of hypertension Recent linkage mapping studies mapped hypertension QTLs to a number of chromosomal regions in SHR and SHRSP rats 35 Our FISH study assigned the STSL locus rat chromosome 6q12 a region where a cluster of blood pressure QTL with Lod score 4 6 has been reported to be present M6MIT12 M6MIT3 39 cM distance in a New Zealand genetically hypertensive rat GH rat 35 With respect to hypertension although the SHR and SHRSP strains carry the Gly583Cys mutation in extensive QTL mapping studies using these strains no loci mapping to the rat STSL region have been reported 35 In our study the GH rat is neither sitosterolemic nor has any nucleotide alteration at the STSL locus that would implicate this region as mutated Thus we do not believe the STSL locus plays a role in determining blood pressure However it may play a significant role in modifying the pathophysiology Studies reported by different investigators have shown that a dietary intake of 10 canola oil as part of semi purified diets significantly shortened the life span of SHRSP rats with accumulation of phytosterols in plasma red blood cells and tissues 15 17 18 19 21 22 Lower red blood cell RBC membrane deformability lower density of platelets as well as a higher blood pressure were also observed when compared to a SHRSP group fed with vegetable oils lower in phytosterols 10 soybean oil vs 10 canola oil Canola oil has a higher sitosterol content than soybean oil In comparison extensive studies on evaluation of high phytosterol diets in SD rats non sitosterolemic have consistently shown to be safe without any adverse consequences 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 These intriguing differences between SHRSP and SD rats may now be explained at least in part by presence of the Gly583Cys missense mutation in sterolin 1 The WKY rat also carries this mutation and a high dietary intake of phytosterols will also increase the blood pressure and decrease the density of platelets though to a lower extent than that observed in SHRSP rats 20 These data support a pathological role of elevated plant sterols in these rats and support the notion that the STSL loci evolved to not only allow for the excretion of cholesterol into bile but also to keep xeno sterols from accumulating in the body With respect to sitosterolemia in humans although atherosclerotic complications have been well described hypertension has not been mentioned as feature However it is not known whether the atherosclerosis in sitosterolemic patients with hypertension is accelerated relative to those affected individuals with lower blood pressures The Gly583Cys mutation in Abcg5 is likely to have originated in the original outbred Wistar colony bred in Kyoto from which WKY was subsequently derived which has been widely employed as a normotensive control in experimental studies of hypertension It gave rise to the SHR and SHRSP strains Thus this mutation in WKY SHR and SHRSP lines may not contribute to the hypertension phenotype per se but may only be responsible for sitosterolemia The original Wistar colony was established at the Wistar Institute in 1906 and the Sprague Dawley colony was derived by Dawley in approximately 1925 from a single male of unknown origin and a Wistar female The SHR strain was derived by selective inbreeding from the Kyoto outbred Wistar colony and both SHR and SHRSP as well as WKY strains have been maintained over many generations through brother sister matings http rgd mcw edu tools strains 43 44 Healthy WKA and GH rat strains were also generated from outbred Wistar rat strains but these strains were isolated independently in Japan and New Zealand respectively and maintained at other sites as well The GH rat was selected for systolic hypertension that increased with successive generations and maintained through filial matings 45 In view of this the Gly583Cys missense mutation of Abcg5 might result from occurrence of a de novo mutation during breeding at the stage of developing inbred WKY strains and propagated into the SHR and SHRSP lines In contrast the 143 nucleotide fragment insertion polymorphism in the 3 UTR of Abcg8 may have resulted from acquisition of a foreign chromosomal fragment during the Wistar rat strain breeding and established as homozygous change in the WKY SHR and SHRSP as well as GH rat strains In this context it is important to note that 3 other mutant loci have been reported in the SHR rat missense mutations in the KAT 1 kynurenine aminotransferase 1 Srebf 1 sterol regulatory element binding factor 1 and CD36 fatty acid translocase are all present as homozygous changes 46 47 48 The generation of congenic lines may assist with addressing many of these issues Such lines will be useful in demonstrating that the variant sterolin 1 protein is responsible for causing sitosterolemia but will allow comparisons between animals that are hypertensive and those that are hypertensive and sitosterolemic Currently there are no appropriate genetic controls available as SHR SHRSP and WKY are all maintained as colonies by brother sister matings While this manuscript was in review Scoggan et al also reported identifying Gly583Cys alteration in Abcg5 of SHR SHRP and WKY rats 49 Conclusion Three rat strain WKY SHR and SHRSP that are hypertensive are also sitosterolemic All of these strains are homozygous mutant for Gly583Cys in sterolin 1 encoded by Abcg5 This mutation is not present in rats that were not sitosterolemic even though one of these was hypertensive the GH rat The rat STSL locus comprising of Abcg5 and Abcg8 maps to rat chromosome 6q12 a region syntenic with both mouse and human STSL loci Preliminary antibody studies show that this mutant protein is expressed and appears to be apically targeted in the intestinal cells Competing Interests None declared Authors contributions HY conceived this study HY BP and KL performed the molecular genetic
