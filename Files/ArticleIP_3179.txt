 The Lie of the Land I have a very clear memory of the meeting declares one central figure Bill Clinton in Washington s ongoing sexual and legal battles and I told the truth I proceeded to explain to Newsweek s Michael Isikoff says another figure onetime Kathleen Willey friend Julie Hiatt Steele that Ms Willey had asked me to lie to support her version of the event and that I had in fact done so There are people who talk a lot observes a third participant Monica Lewinsky s lawyer William H Ginsburg and as part of that scenario peccadilloes they may tell fibs lies exaggerations oversell USA Today summing up the experience of the past two months asked in a headline Who can claim truth or objectivity anymore Ah that old question What is truth demanded Pontius Pilate John 18 38 during his interrogation of Jesus He received no reply Perhaps because it is less accessible or at least less prevalent the act of truth telling has garnered far less attention in popular speech than the act of lying In Roget s Thesaurus words associated with falsity outnumber those associated with veracity by about 5 to 1 Synonyms for truth telling are formal and dull candor honesty veridity Those for conveying falsehoods are colorful and ebullient equivocation mythomania casuistry quackery buncombe cajolery duplicity perjury bamboozlement pettifoggery sugarcoating a crock a con job twaddle The gravitational pull of falsity is so powerful that even words and phrases that start out as truth reinforcers tend over time to acquire the opposite connotation Who is not immediately put on guard when confronted with statements introduced by Frankly To be perfectly honest or The fact of the matter is When Ginsburg described certain testimony as being totally reliable the words were served up in press accounts as unavoidably they also are here within an isolated setting of quotation marks which function as a stage wink The ostensible truth multiplier 1 000 percent from George McGovern s 1972 avowal of support for his running mate Thomas F Eagleton whom he claimed to support 1 000 percent and then summarily dropped from the ticket is now an ironic synonym for don t bet on it or even not on your life In much the same way categorical denials have suffered an irreversible erosion of face value owing to their routine issuance by bombastic politicians aggrieved miscreants and representatives of liberation armies and international terrorists Categorical denial with its serration of easy consonants and regularly spaced vowels seems to be within pronunciation range of all non English speakers Once intended to endow a denial with the qualities of pervasiveness and totality the adjective categorical absolute unqualified explicit now raises doubts and eyebrows The British poet and screenwriter James Lasdun s recent protestation I categorically deny being a neo formalist plants the suspicion that his sympathies are indeed neoformalist Responding to rumors that Disney was planning to add new sequences to the classic animated film Snow White a spokesman for the company declared I categorically deny that we would ever touch Snow White Still the idea of category as it applies to lies is worth exploring and leads into the realm of theology Say what one will about Catholic theology it offers a cosmological taxonomy in which all things have an appointed place and a well thought out definition rendered with lapidary minimalism Truth for instance is helpfully defined in The Catholic Encyclopedia as the accordance or conformity between what is asserted and what is or the conformity of intellection with being Falsity in turn is the deformity of intellection and being In the weeks ahead it will be important to maintain clear theological distinctions per the Encyclopedia among various kinds of lies There is the mendacium jocosum the lie told in jest A second type of lie is the mendacium officiosum or officious lie whose purpose is to achieve some useful end or to prevent some distinct harm Examples might include a doctor misleading a terminally ill patient or a prisoner lying to enemy interrogators A third type of lie is the mendacium perniciosum or pernicious lie a lie that is intended to do harm A fourth type of lie might be called the mendacium universalis the universal or endemic lie This is the type of lie if it is indeed a lie that we seem to be encountering most frequently these days If a lie by definition becomes a lie only in the context of communication speech writing gesture and if a lie is immoral because it destroys the fundamental trust that makes communication possible if all this is so can a lie be told in a context where communication is understood to have no objective value to begin with I give the floor back to the theologians In the extremely difficult situations being considered there is no mutual trust or confidence to destroy In fact a maximum of distrust prevails between the parties and no man in such a position could prudently take the words of the other at their face value In such a case words would cease to a degree to be a medium for the exchange of thought Communication would be broken down and to the extent in which communication of mind with mind has become impossible it would be equally impossible to realize the idea of a lie It seems incontestable that if no communication in the ordinary sense of the word is possible there can be no lie Not all falsehoods of course are lies the key ingredient in a lie is intentionality Nor are all lies deceptions some lies are told without any intention to deceive You ve lost weight Let s do lunch Moreover some deceptions are technically not lies theologically speaking A person could tell a truth with sufficient clarity to avoid making a false statement and sufficient ambiguity and evasiveness to avoid revealing a truth which he wants to keep hidden For instance if you re a presidential candidate and are asked if you have ever smoked marijuana and you have but only in England you might reply that you have broken no state laws A statement that successfully picks its way across this dangerous terrain is said to exhibit an economy of truth and a person who has uttered such a statement is said to have been economical with the truth These characterizations too were originally conferred with a sense of professional appreciation I first heard them on the lips of some Jesuit friends but they have also been pulled out of truth s orbit and into the atmosphere of mendacity Today an economy of truth sometimes just means a lie albeit one whose seriousness may be debatable Julie Burchill wrote recently in the Guardian The idea that one party has to overcome the natural resistance of the other party to sexual intercourse by a combination of gifts and being economical with the truth takes us perilously near to date rape territory The concept of an economy of truth may have lost its purity but it retains considerable utility If nothing else it adds a timely new dimension to the hortatory reminder It s the economy stupid
