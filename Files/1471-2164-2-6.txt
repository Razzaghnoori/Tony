 Background Spermatogenesis is a complex developmental process in which male germ cells progress through mitotic proliferation meiotic division and dramatic morphological changes to form mature sperm This process is vital for the propagation of a species and involves a large portion of the genome of an organism to ensure the quality and quantity of the final products It is estimated that mutations in up to 11 of all genes in Drosophila might lead to male sterility 1 This is likely to be true for humans also considering the extremely high incidence 4 5 of infertility in men 2 Among the genes associated with male infertility is the DAZ Deleted in Azoospermia gene family The family includes the Y linked DAZ genes that are present only in great apes and old world monkeys 3 and the autosomal DAZL1 DAZ like 1 and BOULE genes 4 5 in all mammals Deletion of the DAZ genes is found in about 10 of infertile males with idiopathic azoospermia 2 and disruption of Dazl1 causes infertility in both male and female mice 6 Mutations in the DAZ family members of Drosophila 7 C elegans 8 and Xenopus 9 also affect the fertility in either males females or both sexes The DAZ gene family encodes RNA binding proteins that are expressed specifically in germ cells DAZ and DAZL are expressed in the nucleus and cytoplasm of primordial germ cells and spermatogonia and in the cytoplasm of meiotic spermatocytes 6 10 BOULE is expressed later in the cytoplasm of pachytene spermatocytes 5 Genetic and biochemical studies suggest a role for the DAZ family in the regulation of mRNA translation Drosophila Boule mutants was defective in the translation of the meiosis specific CDC25 homologue Twine 11 and DAZL was found to be associated with polyribosomes in mouse testes 12 More recently DAZL was shown both in vitro and in a yeast three hybrid system to bind specifically to oligo U stretches interspersed by G or C residues including a U rich segment in the 5 UTR of mouse Cdc25C mRNA 13 In an attempt to elucidate the function of the DAZ gene family and to understanding the mechanisms of its action we used a yeast two hybrid system to isolate two human genes encoding DAZ associated proteins DAZAPs 14 One of them DAZAP1 is expressed predominantly in testes It encodes a protein with two RNA binding domains and a proline rich C terminal portion The DAZAP1 protein interacted with both DAZ and DAZL in vitro It also bound to RNA homopolymers We now report our characterization of the mouse Dazap1 gene and its protein product The subcellular localization of DAZAP1 suggests that it is not involved directly in mRNA translation Results Characterization of the mouse Dazap1cDNA Mouse Dazap1 cDNA clones were isolated by library screening and the 5 end of the cDNA was isolated by 5 RACE 15 The near fall length cDNA consists of a 53 bp 5 untranslated region UTR an open reading frame for a protein of 405 amino acid residues and a 362 bp 3 UTR GenBank Accession No AF225910 The coding region shares 89 similarity with that of the human orthologue The 3 UTR sequence is remarkably conserved It contains three segments of 35 bp 133 bp and 90 bp that share 85 90 and 97 similarity with segments in the human 3 UTR respectively These segments probably contain regulatory elements The DAZAP1 protein contains two RNA binding domains RBDS and a C terminal portion that is rich in proline Figure 1 It is highly conserved evolutionarily The mouse and the human proteins differ in 9 amino acids only with 7 substitutions and two deletions insertions The mammalian proteins shares 89 similarity and 81 identity with Xenopus Prrp for proline rich RNA binding protein 16 The two RBDs are especially highly conserved They share 98 and 97 similarity and 97 and 92 identity respectively between DAZAP1 and Prrp These proteins may therefore have a similar RNA binding specificity The C terminal proline rich portions of DAZAP1 and Prrp are less conserved 81 similarity and 71 identity There is an insertion of a 58 bp segment in Prrp cDNA that causes a change of reading frame and results in a shorter Prrp with a different C terminal end sequence Genomic structure of Dazap1and chromosomal mapping Several overlapping lambda clones containing mouse Dazap1 genomic sequences were isolated The locations of exons were determined by PCR amplification across exon intron boundaries following by sequencing All but the first exon were isolated and mapped The genomic structure of the human DAZAP1 gene was also determined by blasting the human genome sequence at National Center for Biotechnology Information with the human DAZAP1 cDNA sequence The mouse and the human genes have very similar structures consisting of 12 exons spanning about 28 kb All intron insertion sites are conserved Table 1 The two RBDs are encoded by exons 1 4 and 5 8 respectively A pair of PCR primers was designed from Dazap1 intronic sequences that amplified mouse but not hamster genomic sequences Using a panel of mouse hamster radiation hybrids the mouse Dazap1 gene was mapped to chromosome 10 placed 27 84 cR from D10Mit260 lod 3 0 data not shown This region is syntenic to human 19p13 3 where the human DAZAP1 gene is located 14 17 It contains no known mutant alleles that are associated with infertility Expression of Dazap1 Northern analyses of adult mouse tissues showed the presence of two Dazap1 transcripts of 1 75 kb and 2 4 kb respectively Figure 2 Only the shorter transcript has been isolated in cDNA clones Dazap1 was expressed most abundantly in the testis much less in liver heart and brain and even less in other tissues This pattern of expression is similar to that of the human DAZAP1 14 RT PCR analyses showed that Dazap1 mRNA was already present in fetal testes at embryonic day 15 similar to Dazl1 mRNA Figure 3 The expression of both Dazl1 and Dazap1 persisted throughout testes development in both the prenatal and postnatal periods Dazl1 and Dazap1 transcripts were also present in the testes of W v W vmutant mice which contained diminished number of germ cells 18 However only Dazap1 was expressed in a mouse germ cell line GCl spg 19 and a Sertoli cell line MT4 The results suggest that Dazap1 is expressed in both somatic and germ cells in the testis To study the expression of the DAZAP1 protein two antibodies against mouse DAZAP1 were generated The anti DAZAP1 C antibody was raised against a recombinant protein containing the C terminal proline rich portion and the anti DAZAP1 P antibody was raised against an oligopeptide containing the last 19 amino acid residue at the C terminus Both antibodies recognized in vitro synthesized DAZAP1 in an immunoprecipitation assay data not shown Western blotting of mouse tissue extracts detected a 45 kD protein that was present most abundantly in the testis and to a lesser degree in spleen liver lung and brain Figure 4 The protein was also present in the ovary The expression of DAZAP1 during germ cell development paralleled that of DAZL Figure 5 It is present at a low level in the testes of 6 days old mice which contained only primitive type A spermatogonia The expression of DAZAP1 increased afterward as the testes contained increasing number of proliferating and meiotic germ cells Subcellular localization of DAZAP1 Our previous fractionation of mouse testis extracts showed that most DAZL were present in the post mitochondrial fraction and some of them were associated with polyribosomes 12 Similar analyses showed that a majority of DAZAP1 in adult mouse testes was also present in the cytoplasmic fraction data not shown However sucrose gradient analyses of the post mitochondria fraction showed that unlike DAZL DAZAP1 did not co sediment with polyribosomes Figure 6 Discussion RNA binding proteins have been found to participate in many cellular functions including RNA transcription pre mRNA processing mRNA transport localization translation and stability 20 A role for the DAZ family in the regulation of mRNA translation is supported by lines of circumstantial evidence including the association of DAZL with polyribosomes 12 The absence of DAZAP1 from polyribosomes indicates that it is not directly involved in protein synthesis This finding is different from two RNA binding proteins FXR1P and FXR2P that were identified through their interaction with another polysomal associated RNA binding protein the fragile X mental retardation protein 21 Both FXR1P and FXR2P are associated with the polyribosomes 22 The significance of the interaction between DAZAP1 and DAZL DAZ remains to be defined These proteins may act together to facilitate the expression of a set of genes in germ cells For example DAZAP1 could be involved in the transport of the mRNAs of the target genes of DAZL Alternatively DAZL and DAZAP1 may act antagonistically to regulate the timing and the level of expression Such an antagonistic interaction between two interacting RNA binding proteins is exemplified by the neuron specific nuclear RNA binding protein Nova 1 Nova 1 regulates the alternative splicing of the pre mRNAs encoding neuronal inhibitory glycine receptor 2 GlyR 2 23 The ability of Nova 1 to activate exon selection in neurons is antagonized by a second RNA binding protein brPTB brain enriched polypyrimidine tract binding protein which interacts with Nova 1 and inhibits its function 24 DAZAP1 could function in a similar manner by binding to DAZL and inhibiting its function Comparing the phenotypes of Dazl1 and Dazap1 single and double knock out mice may provide some clues to the significance of their interaction Dazl1 knock out mice have already been generated and studied 6 The spermatogenic defect in the male becomes apparent only after day 7 post partum when the germ cells are committing to meiosis H Cooke personal communication The genomic structure of Dazap1 delineated here should facilitate the generating of Dazap1 null mutation DAZAP1 was shown to bind RNA homopolymers in vitro with a preference for poly U and poly G Its natural substrates have not been identified Recently the Xenopus orthologue of DAZAP1 Prrp was identified and characterized 16 Prrp binds to a 340 nt sequence in the 3 UTR of Xenopus Vg1 mRNA This Vg1 localization element VLE is sufficient for the migration and clustering of Vg1 mRNA to the vegetal cortex of mature oocyte Prrp also interacts through its proline rich domain with two microfilament associated proteins profilin and Mena which may facilitate the anchoring of Vg1 mRNA to the vegetal cortex The Vg1 RNA encodes a member of the transforming growth factor family that is required for generating dorsal mesoderm at the blastula stage of Xenopus embryogenesis 25 Sequence conservation between the RBDs of DAZAP1 and Prrp suggests that these proteins may bind to similar RNA sequences However a BLAST search of the GenBank for the 340 nt VLE sequence failed to identify any mammalian sequences with significant homology Further mapping of the RNA sequence within VLE that binds Prrp and possibly DAZAP1 may help to identify the natural substrates of DAZAP1 Conclusions DAZAP1 is an evolutionarily conserved RNA binding protein It is present at variable levels in many tissues Its predominant expression in testes suggests a role in spermatogenesis In mouse testes DAZAP1 was found both in the nuclei and in the cytoplasm Its absence from polyribosomes indicates that it is not directly involved in mRNA translation Materials and methods Isolation of mouse Dazap1cDNA clones Dazap1 cDNA clones were isolated from a mouse testis cDNA library 937308 Stratagene La Jolla CA using a human DAZAP1 cDNA as a probe The 5 end of the cDNA was isolated by 5 RACE 15 using prdap11 ttgcgggccatatccttg 749 732 as the primer

These primers amplified a 271 bp fragment from mouse but not hamster genomic DNA DNA samples of a panel of 100 radiation hybrids containing mouse chromosome fragments in a hamster background were

with Freund s adjuvant and injected into rabbits to generate the anti DAZAPl C antibody An oligopeptide containing the last 19 ammo acid residues of the mouse DAZAP1 was synthesized in vitro using the services of Bethyl Laboratories Montgomery TX The peptide was conjugated to KLH as carrier and injected into a goat The anti DAZAP1 P antibody thus produced was purified on an affinity column
