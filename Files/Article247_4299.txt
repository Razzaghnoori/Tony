 How CNBC Exacerbates Stock Price Swings OK so on some days stocks really do go in just one direction see Dot Com Mania Is More Selective Than You Think In any case even though all we re going to get for the next 24 hours at least are a parade of commentators offering up a host of explanations for today s massive sell off in the Nasdaq and the Dow the best rule to follow is just to assume that all those explanations will be wrong or at the very least inadequate Sell offs can get triggered for one reason and continue for different reasons they can reflect genuine changes in investors ideas about the future or simply panic and so on Short term market moves are almost by definition impossible to parse successfully Having said that and you knew this was coming didn t you there are a couple of interesting things to note about what happened today The first is the resurgence of the idea that rising interest rates actually do matter to stock prices I ll have a piece on this for tomorrow The second is that when something like today s sell off happens it makes obvious the extent to which in the short term you can no longer separate the event from the media s coverage of the event What I mean by this is that today s sell off does not happen in a vacuum On the contrary thanks to the spread of the Internet and the rise to prominence of CNNfn and above all CNBC the sell off occurs with real time commentary real time commentary that is already almost before the fact labeling what s occurring as a sell off a prelude to a correction or the first prick of the tech stock bubble And this is commentary that the investors who are making the decisions that will either continue or end the sell off are hearing as they are trying to make those decisions In other words what the media is saying becomes part of the information that is influencing how stock prices are determined This matters because the true magic of a market as I ve written about before is the ability of its collective but decentralized intelligence to reach conclusions that are smarter more accurate than the conclusions any single member of the market could reach which offers some evidence for this That s why markets are better at allocating capital and setting prices than any planning board ever could be The problem is that most of the experimental evidence on collective decision making shows that groups make better decisions when each member of the group reaches his or her decision independently of everyone else In other words it s not through an open debate or an attempt to reach a consensus that the best conclusion is reached It s only through the aggregation of independent individual conclusions that it is But when CNBC is running a show called Special Tuesday s Sell off and its analysts are doing real time commentary from the market floor talking about how traders are feeling it becomes much harder for investors to reach an independent decision about the only question they should actually be considering What are these stocks actually worth This is again a signal to noise problem see Going Bananas Over Stock Splits The signal is material information about companies future earnings prospects about interest rates and about inflation Noise is just about everything else But in today s media saturated investing environment the short term noise can be overpoweringly loud In the long run hard as it may be to believe this does not matter Which is one reason why bubble talk is overblown But in the short run it s a recipe for increased volatility So huge price swings are probably with us to stay Yet another good reason not to adopt a trader s mentality
