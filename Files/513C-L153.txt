 May 1994 Dear Alumnus When I last wrote to you about the Ralph E McDonald Pedodontic Fund it was with the news that expenditures were greater than contributions for 1992 Many of you responded in a positive manner by increasing your contribution or contributing to the fund for the first time Thanks to your efforts the account was again in the black for 1993 The account description written in 1971 for the Ralph E McDonald Pedodontic Fund states Expenditures of the fund shall be approved by the fund committee of six All expenditures should be restricted to the Pedodontic area This fund committee is still in place and I have served as Chairman of the fund since I was elected to that position by the committee in the late 1970 s The Pediatric Dentistry Clinic at the School is scheduled to be relocated later this year The new clinic will be in the old grad pedo area across the hall from the Orthodontic Clinic in the south wing of the School The staff and faculty are looking forward to using a clinic that will be equipped with the newest dental units and systems available The money to pay for the renovation and major equipment will be taken from non departmental funds and hopefully recovered with increased clinic revenues over the next few years However I am sure there will be other items that will be needed in the new facility to enhance the educational experience of students including graduate students I want to encourage you to continue to support your alma mater with contributions to the McDonald Fund and to increase your contribution if possible Please use the enclosed coded card and envelope which will insure that your contribution is deposited directly to our account This Fund provides Indiana s pedo program with enrichment opportunities that are equaled by few if any other programs in the country We are most sincerely grateful for your generosity
