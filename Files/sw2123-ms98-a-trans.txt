 so what kind of eating out do you prefer do you like uh i don t know uh medium priced restaurants usually not anything too nice because we have a four year old uh huh oh really so i usually like things that cater to children things that don t cost too much but you get your money s worth yeah and are loud so when he gets loud it s not too it doesn t bother the other people uh huh but don t don t you lots of fast food too i hate to admit it but yeah but don t don t you like to get away from it all every once in a while and go to a nice quiet restaurant sometime oh yeah yeah then we go to someplace nicer quieter something with uh a cuisine that s a little bit you know more sophisticated like an Italian or French restaurant or something like that um hum yeah there s uh Biraporetti s is one of our favorites it s real nice it s Italian uh huh it s nice and dark and quiet so it just kind of depends on the occasion yeah what do you like to do well i i personally don t like to go to Italian restaurants because i m Italian and so that s just like everyday food for you huh well not really because you know i live i live here in a dorm i i still go to college but oh i i kind of don t eat Italian food if unless i go home because my mom cooks Italian food and it s like you know the you know she i i think that she cooks the best so there s no reason for me to go out and pay enormous sum for something that s just not as good hm yeah hers probably would be the best yeah but you know i also like the the fast food places like Taco Bell because you can get a lot of food for cheap prices oh yeah thirty nine cents or whatever for those little tacos yeah my son likes those yeah yeah fifty nine cents yeah so you knows yeah it s it s something that you know we we go there every Sunday me and my roommate go there every Sunday you know with our hangover from Saturday and we go to uh Taco Bell and get the tacos you know it s something it s it s cheap you don t have to spend a lot of money yeah and it tastes pretty much i mean i like the way it it taste good and it s fast i like that too yeah yeah yeah well i hate to cut this short but i think i better get back to work oh okay so thanks for calling bye yeah bye
