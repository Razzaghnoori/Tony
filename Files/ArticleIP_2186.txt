 Slate A Fashion Statement We certainly don t intend to be a magazine of fashion either in the sense of being about clothing or in the sense of following the fashion in general matters Yet by one of those weird coincidences that less scrupulous publications sometimes turn into special issues we have posted two features relating to fashion in the clothing sense this week and will post a third Wednesday Our Letter From Washington concerns an admirable but possibly doomed campaign to improve the style sense on the Microsoft campus Our Tangled Web column reports on and follows through links the bizarre theories bouncing around the Internet about the unlikely figure of Tommy Hilfiger producer of somewhat mysterious ads in many magazines and apparently of a line of clothing as well Wednesday April 16 brings Clothes Sense our regular monthly column from Anne Hollander Anne s subject this month isn t exactly clothes she writes about a show of Cartier jewelry at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York But that s still fashion You would assume from this onslaught of sartorial hectoring that the staff of Slate must dress in exquisite taste And you would be correct Any one of us could be transported from this sylvan landscape in Redmond Wash strewn with cow chips computer chips and potato chips to the haughty elevators of the Cond Nast Building on Madison Avenue and instantly fit right in stylewise at least We pride ourselves on our fabrics The staffs of other magazines have spats we wear them Other magazines employ heels we wear them Not long ago Bill Gates saw one of Slate s program managers Peter Randall walking across the campus and observed to no one in particular I d kill for that tie But that turned out not to be necessary Lawyer Cake If you haven t checked in since last week two new Dialogues have started And a couple more might have started by the time you read this Ronald Dworkin professor of jurisprudence at Oxford is debating assisted suicide with Michael McConnell who recently left the University of Chicago Law School for the University of Utah Peter Edelman a former Clinton administration official who has become the most vocal critic of the welfare reform President Clinton signed last year is being challenged by Mickey Kaus author of The End of Equality who supports the reform Alan Dershowitz of Harvard Law School will be engaging Akhil Reed Amar of Yale Law School on whether the truth gets short shrift in America s criminal justice system Dershowitz recently reviewed Amar s book on this subject for Slate And Gary Bauer head of the Family Research Council will be engaging Wendell Willkie II general counsel of the Commerce Department under George Bush on the subject of human rights and trade with China Coming soon Undersecretary of State Strobe Talbott and the managing editor of Foreign Affairs Fareed Zakaria on U S support for the expansion of NATO Read our recent Gist on this subject if you need to get up to speed These dialogues conducted by e mail are fulfilling our hope that they would develop into a new mode of civilized debate E mail at its best combines the immediacy of talking with the reflectiveness of writing It also seems to lend itself more than live debates to actual dialectical progress Slate s dialogues tend to feature not just thesis and antithesis but a bit of synthesis as well Occasionally of course a dialogue serves to reveal the utter superiority of one side of the argument as in the recent discussion of the capital gains tax Often we ve discovered the best way to frame an interesting and useful dialogue is not to get a liberal vs a conservative but to get two people from roughly the same part of the spectrum who disagree on the application of their shared values to a particular issue In our current lineup Willkie and Bauer are both conservatives while Dershowitz and Amar are both liberals But we re not beyond the occasional ideological dust up such as the recently concluded exchange on divorce between Katha Pollitt and David Blankenhorn We do seem to end up with a lot of lawyers Sorry about that Michael Kinsley
