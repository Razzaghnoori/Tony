 Let s Mask a Deal Three weeks ago when NATO launched its airstrikes against Yugoslavia President Clinton swore off further talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and ruled out a ground invasion Since then events have obliged Clinton to rethink his options he floated weasel words that would let him wage a ground war while calling it something else This week Clinton s aides are floating weasel words for the opposite scenario negotiations Now that everyone has declared Milosevic a war criminal and has agreed that the United States manhood is at stake the N word is verboten in Washington On Sunday s talk shows pundits asked various U S officials how they could even contemplate negotiating with Mr Milosevic after what he s done The officials dutifully ruled out the idea all the while sketching concessions by which Milosevic could persuade them to halt the bombing The operative question is no longer how American representatives could dare negotiate with Milosevic It s how they re doing it already while pretending not to by masking it in less polite terms Here are the various characterizations in ascending order of preference 1 Cutting a deal This is the most noxious formulation slung as an insult by hawks such as the Weekly Standard and the Wall Street Journal This man who is engaged in this massive ethnic cleansing Standard publisher Bill Kristol spat on This Week We re going to cut another deal with him They cannot cut another deal with Milosevic Warnings against cutting a deal are invariably accompanied by descriptions of Milosevic as a war criminal The implication is that cutting a deal with a criminal is unethical if not illegal 2 Negotiation U S officials hate this word because it connotes capitulation They ve learned to deflect it by juxtaposing it with bombing When asked on Face the Nation whether the United States would negotiate with a war criminal Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott sternly replied We re not negotiating with Milosevic We re bombing him U S Ambassador to Macedonia Christopher Hill likewise told CNN We re not negotiating right now We re conducting an air campaign The false glossed over premise that bombing and negotiation are incompatible goes unchallenged Indeed in this case the bombing is part of the negotiation While hitting Milosevic over the head NATO is offering terms under which it is willing to stop Conversely Milosevic is offering lesser concessions Though NATO rejected his initial offer the latest proposals by Germany and U N Secretary General Kofi Annan which would suspend the bombing in exchange for partial compliance with NATO s demands and would put the United Nations rather than NATO in charge of settling the conflict suggest there will ultimately be a compromise A few days ago when a reporter asked about the N word White House spokesman Joe Lockhart answered We have a military objective now which is to bring President Milosevic to meet these conditions that we have laid out By calling this objective military Clinton s aides obscure its negotiatory aspect 3 Diplomacy Like negotiation this word smells of weakness Again administration officials deflect it by contrasting it with a tougher word force Fourteen months ago when Milosevic started this crisis our policy was one of diplomacy backed by force Talbott argued last weekend Now we have force backed by diplomacy Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and her spokesman Jamie Rubin are fond of the same formulation But the contrast between diplomacy and force is just as deceptive as the contrast between negotiation and bombing NATO hopes to bomb Milosevic to the table Therefore force is still serving diplomacy 4 Political solution This is the administration s code word for deal Clinton says he wants a political solution Albright and Rubin want a political settlement and a political framework based on Rambouillet Toward that end Albright welcomes Russia s support for dealing with the problem in a political way Last week when a reporter asked whether the United States wanted Russia to undertake diplomatic mediation with Belgrade Rubin replied I would put it a little differently The Russians have been part and parcel of our effort to try to find a peaceful solution Rubin expressed hope that the Russians might succeed in convincing the Serbs to turn around and accept our conditions But diplomacy Never 5 Harder and harder Part of the indignity of negotiation is the implication that during the bargaining NATO will offer more and more concessions So American spokesmen tailor their words to create the opposite impression that NATO will offer fewer and fewer concessions as the conflict wears on As Defense Secretary William Cohen put it Sunday every day that goes by with further evidence of Milosevic s brutality would make it far more difficult to deal with him Last week a reporter asked Lockhart whether it was right for an American negotiator now to sit down with Milosevic to try to cut some deal Lockhart replied that such a scenario gets harder every day But I am not going to rule anything out The reporter pressed But it s not off the table yet Lockhart answered Dealing with him gets harder When asked whether at some point dealing with Milosevic would become impossible Lockhart scoffed I am not going to spell out a timetable or what he has to do Refusing to spell out demands or to rule anything out is a classic negotiating posture which Lockhart effectively obscured by repeating the word harder five times during the exchange 6 Demands This is the administration s favorite description Confronted recently with a coarse question as to whether the United States was willing to talk to Milosevic Lockhart stonily replied The NATO alliance has made demands and he needs to meet them Lest anyone confuse these demands with negotiation Albright insisted We re not trying to please President Milosevic The goal of this is to be able to get him to understand these five demands that the international community is making American officials also speak of NATO s terms conditions and requirements There was only one slip up last week when Rubin referred to them as our position The administration s spin is that demands and conditions are the opposite of negotiation Milosevic knows precisely what the conditions are so we re not negotiating Ambassador Hill declared on Late Edition last weekend On Meet the Press White House Chief of Staff John Podesta vowed We re not negotiating Tim He knows what he needs to do to stop the war That s not a negotiation But minutes later Sen Joe Biden D Del betrayed the spin No I don t think we can negotiate with him if you mean can we in fact work out something other than those minimal demands that were stated by NATO It depends in short upon what the meaning of the word negotiation is If the German and U N proposals lead to a settlement with Milosevic Clinton and his diplomats will have to finesse the discrepancy between the demands they touted and the deal they signed Somehow I m confident they can work it out
