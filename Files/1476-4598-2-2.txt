 Background Rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant neoplasm of skeletal muscle and is one of the most common soft tissue malignancies in the children and adolescent population Histopathologically rhabdomyosarcoma can be divided into two major subtypes embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma representing about 80 of the clinical cases and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma representing about 20 of the total cases 1 2 Extensive cytogenetic studies showed that the embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas are generally associated with loss of heterozygosity LOH for multiple closely linked loci at chromosomal 11p15 5 suggesting inactivation of one or more tumor suppressor gene s in this region 2 3 But the gene involved in this region has yet to be identified Many other associated mutation or amplification of oncogenes tumor suppressor genes including p53 K ras N ras and N myc etc are frequently seen but the roles of these gene mutations amplifications in pathogenesis of the tumor remain largely unclear 4 5 The alveolar subtype of rhabdomyosarcoma however is consistently associated with two common chromosomal translocations Most cases of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma are associated with a chromosomal translocation t 2 13 q35 q14 and less commonly with t 1 13 p36 q14 6 7 8 9 The t 2 13 translocation results in fusion of a portion of the Pax3 gene to a portion of the FKHR gene leading to formation of fusion protein Pax3 FKHR Pax3 gene encodes a transcriptional factor important in early development program while FKHR gene encodes another generic transcriptional factor that is widely expressed in mammalian tissues The t 1 13 translocation results in formation of Pax7 FKHR Both Pax3 FKHR and Pax7 FKHR were shown to possess more potent transcriptional activity than its original forms Pax3 and Pax7 10 11 How the chimeric fusion proteins contribute to pathogenesis of rhabdomyosarcoma remains unclear Ataxia telangiectasia mutated gene ATM is a newly identified member of PI3 kinase family that is mutated in human autosomal recessive disease ataxia telangiectasia AT 12 13 ATM gene is large spanning about 150 kbs of genomic DNA and is located on chromosome 11q22 23 In response to DNA damage agents such as ionizing irradiation and chemical agent cisplatin ATM kinase is activated leading to a cascade of kinase reactions regulating cell cycle apoptosis and DNA damage repair 14 15 Many downstream target molecules of ATM kinase were so far identified These target proteins include the c Abl tyrosine kinase the p53 tumor suppressor the Chk1 and Chk2 serine threoine kinase the p34 subunit of replication protein A RPA Chk1 serine threoine kinase and NBS1 kinase which is mutated in human autosomal recessive disease Nijmegan breakage syndrome 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 Clinical characteristics of AT patients include hypersensitivity to irradiation thymic dysplasia immune defects and higher tendency to develop malignant tumor suggesting that ATM function is critical in DNA damage repair and tumor suppression However up to date AT patients are not known to develop rhabdomyosarcoma In this study we report an association of human rhabdomyosarcoma with deletion mutation of ATM gene This is the first report so far of ATM gene associated with solid malignancy except for the mantle cell lymphoma a malignant tumor in lymphoid origin The association of ATM gene mutation deletion with rhabdomyosarcoma suggests a link of ATM gene with cancer risk and ATM kinase may contribute to pathogenesis of rhabdomyosarcoma Results Totally 17 patients specimen were retrieved from the archived tissue blocks The clinical characteristics of these patients were listed as in Table 1 Some patient s clinical information was not available at the time of the study These patients all carried clinical histopathological diagnoses of rhabdomyosarcoma embryonal or alveolar type and showed immunostaining positivity for myogenin a specific skeletal muscle marker Immunofluorescent or immunohistochemical staining with anti ATM antibody was performed on the total of 17 specimens and 7 of the 17 rhabdomyosarcomas were negative for ATM protein 41 see Table 1 Totally 10 of the 17 were positive for ATM kinase 59 ATM protein was predominantly located in cytoplasm in the tumor sections and interestingly predominantly seen in the nuclei in the rhabdomyosarcoma cell line as those seen with myoD staining RD cells Fig 1and 2 There is no difference in staining pattern in regard to the subtypes of the rhabdomyosarcomas namely embryonal or alveolar subtypes It is surprising to note that 7 of the17 41 rhabdomyosarcoma specimens stained negatively for the presence of ATM protein Under the normal condition ATM expression is ubiquitous To further confirm the immunostaining results two different approaches were taken One was to see if the ATM mRNA is properly transcribed and another is to directly see the ATM protein itself by Western blotting analysis from the tumors and compare with the normal form Due to the limited resource of the fresh tumor samples we turned to the cell culture system and used the well established rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines First we designed eight pairs of oligonucleotide primers encompassing the almost entire coding sequence of ATM mRNA based on the published cDNA sequence Genbank accession number U33841 24 Table 2 The primer designing strategy is shown in Fig 3 ATM mRNA is approximately 9 4 kbs in length and contains multiple protein binding domains for its kinase activity and interaction with other cellular proteins Fig 3 We used reverse transcription PCR method to analyze five different rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines RD cells embryonal Rh28 Rh30 alveolar Rh3 Rh4 and mouse normal myoblast C2C12 cells The human foreskin fibroblasts were used as the control cells The mRNA was isolated from these cells and used for RT PCR assays As shown in Fig 4 in normal fibroblasts RD cells Rh28 cells the amplified DNA fragments were identical in regard to the lengths in comparing with the control fibroblasts whereas in Rh30 cells two fragments in 1 and 7 lanes 0 94 kbs in Lane 1 and 1 3 kbs in Lane 7 were absent and in lane 6 the fragment amplified was approximately 200 bps smaller than that seen in the fibroblasts and other rhabdomyosarcoma cells Fig 4 The combined length of missing DNA sequence is estimated 2 4 kb fragment 1 plus fragment 7 and additional 200 bps in lane 6 The next question is whether ATM protein is normally translated from ATM mRNA and expressed in the rhabdomyosarcoma cells We analyzed the ATM protein in different cell lines In human Hela cells and human normal foreskin fibroblasts the ATM was estimated to be 360 kD consistent with the results previously described 12 13 In three rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines RD Rh28 and RH30 there was one aberrant form of ATM protein 260 kD that was significantly smaller than that seen in the normal fibroblasts and the Hela cells Fig 5 The levels of ATM expression in these three rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines are not identical and Rh30 cells seemed to express less ATM than the other two Rhabdomyosarcoma cells The murine ATM proteins from C2C12 and 10T 1 2 cells were significantly different in size and there appeared to be two species of ATM proteins in murine cells Discussion ATM gene is a member of PI3 kinase family ATM kinase is critical in DNA damage signaling pathway In response to DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation or chemical agents such as cisplatin ATM kinase is activated and phosphorylates a number of downstream regulatory proteins important for cell cycle arrest growth control apoptosis and DNA repair 25 26 27 28 AT patients are known to be predisposed to a variety of cancers and the fibroblasts of AT patients are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation 29 Although many reports showed the association of ATM mutation with risk of a number of different human malignancies including prostate cancer breast cancer ovarian cancer B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma the underlying molecular mechanism by which ATM gene causes these changes are not well understood 30 31 32 33 34 35 There is so far no study showing the association of ATM gene with any solid tumor There is enormous epidemiological interest in establishing the link of ATM gene abnormality with cancer risk since the percentage of the ATM heterozygotes is high and estimated to represent 1 5 of total population We studied the immunostaining characteristics of ATM protein in clinical rhabdomyosarcoma cases and found that a significantly high number of cases lacked the proper ATM gene product 41 in 17 cases The clinical significance of this finding is unclear at this point There is high percentage of clinical rhabdomyosarcoma cases associated with p53 gene mutation deletion The p53 mutant mice tend to develop rhabdomyosarcoma 29 P53 is a tumor suppressor regulating cell cycle control and apoptosis and p53 is one of the many downstream targets of ATM kinase 25 27 ATM phosphorylate p53 at Serine 15 in response to DNA damage agents 17 It is unknown how the mutated ATM contributes to pathogenesis of rhabdomyosarcoma in the presence of the mutated p53 In fact the rhabdomyosarcoma cells Rh30 is known to have p53 mutation and is also positive for t 2 13 chromosomal translocation 11 Further investigations are needed to address these important questions The finding of ATM protein predominantly present in the cytoplasm but not the nucleus of the tumor sections suggests a different role of ATM in the tumor cells In the tumor cell lines the ATM protein is present predominantly in the nucleus The underlying significance of this finding is unclear Presumably ATM protein in the cytoplasm may function differently in the tumor cells in vivo from that in the nucleus seen in the cell culture The murine ATM was found significantly different in size although the ATM knockout mice recapitulate the phenotypic features of A T patients 36 This species difference may be important in interpreting the data from human cells and from murine cells Methods Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent staining Human rhabdomyosarcoma tumor specimens were obtained from the Department of Pathology the Children s Hospital San Diego All human tissues were formalin fixed paraffin embedded and were previously used for diagnostic purposes Current study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at University of California San Diego IRB The specimens were sectioned at 5 micron in thickness and used for immunohistochemical staining with ATM antibody as described 18 Briefly the sections were de paraffinized in xylene solution de hydrated and rehydrated in 100 90 and 70 alcohol The specimens were immersed in Antigen Retrieval solution commercially available from Dako Corp CA at 90 C for 30 minutes to unmask the antigen followed by incubation with primary antibody against ATM protein at 4 C overnight The primary anti ATM antibody was kindly provided by Dr Gately and as described previously 18 The second antibody was either immuno peroxidase conjugated for immunochemical stains or Cy3 conjugated anti rabbit IgG for immunofluorescent stains Molecular Probes OR For immunofluorescent staining for the tumor cell lines the tumor cells were cultured on the glass coverslips fixed by 4 paraformaldehyde and stained with primary antibody against ATM and MyoD as described 37 Cell culture RNA isolation reverse transcription and PCR Rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines such as Rh3 Rh4 Rh 28 RH30 and RD cells were obtained from Dr Karen Arden Ludwig Institute of Cancer Research at UCSD The tumor cell lines were cultured and maintained as described 37 The total RNA was isolated from the cultured cells using Trizol RNA isolation kit GBCOL BRL Besthesda MD The cDNA synthesis was performed using the cDNA synthesis kit Supersccript GBCOL BRL using random hexamer and oligo d T primers following the instruction from the manufacturer The total cDNA was directly used as templates for PCR amplification for ATM gene using the primer pairs in Table 2 The primer sequences were based on the ATM sequence Genbank accession number U33841 and were described for mantle cell lymphoma with slight modification 24 The primers were synthesized by Sigma Genosys Woodlands Texas The PCR products were electrophoresed in 1 agarose gel and visualized using ethidium bromide staining Western blotting of ATM protein The rhabdomyosarcoma cells are cultured and maintained as described 37 The cellular proteins were prepared separated on 4 polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane The immobilized proteins were incubated with anti ATM antibody 18 The
