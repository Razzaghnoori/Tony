 The Vast Wasteland of Politics On the market well the Dow is blipping back and forth Nasdaq is on a downward trend high tech stocks are going down Not that I m an expert Just looking at the numbers Not to get heavily into the Bill Clinton thing since I m tired of it too but whether Starr should be judged just an ordinary totalitarian federal prosecutor or the central figure in a witch hunt depends on whether you think the Lewinsky affair should ever have been dragged into the Whitewater investigation in the first place which I obviously don t A terrible sense of public relations I certainly agree with you there but blaming the Clinton spin machine for that insanely prurient report is something of a stretch Gore isn t really Clinton s victim though except in the sense that Clinton s talent as a politician can t help but emphasize Gore s lack of same People are going to vote against him because of him not because of Clinton Let s see right now I suppose I prefer Bradley but that s probably because Bradley hasn t opened his mouth Basically he s of the same New Democrat ilk I don t see any particular reason to vote for Gore who is fundamentally conservative economically and socially as well as married to one of our great anti popular culture pests At least Bush has smoked cocaine No I ll probably vote for some third party candidate and hope the Republicans will lose the House so that whoever wins the presidency nothing much will get done in the next four years From my point of view so long as there is no functioning social movement on the left mainstream politics will continue to be a vast wasteland and my main criterion in voting will be how best to stave off the ultra right lunatics By a functioning left I mean among other things a left with ideas a left whose advocates can put forward an analysis of what s wrong with the restructuring of the economy and the repressiveness of the culture rather than avoid looking at the quality of their own lives via sentimental moralizing about what Neil Strauss Springsteen review actually refers to as the poor huddled masses This is what s really wrong with the review and ultimately with Springsteen himself His wealth is beside the point it s his moral earnestness that grates I confess I had skipped over that story basically because Springsteen at this point is about as newsworthy in terms of contemporary popular culture as say Verdi I don t follow pop music much these days but the genres that are most interesting to me in a larger cultural and political sense are techno and hip hop And I can t say I find much intelligent crit on either
