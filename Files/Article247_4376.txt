 Is Bill Gates Dispensable as CEO The last item in this week s Weekend Cocktail Chatter is a perhaps cruel joke or attempt at a joke at the expense of the former CEO of barnesandnoble com who announced his unexpected resignation and saw his company s stock price barely move The obvious question such an outcome provokes so obvious that I had to ask it is If the stock market doesn t care that I m leaving what good was I doing in the first place The irony of course is that Bulkeley s departure was immediately followed by the resignations of two much higher profile CEOs David Glass at Wal Mart and Bill Gates at Microsoft which just happens to own Slate And in both those cases investors reacted pretty much as they had to Bulkeley s departure Wal Mart s shares are down a tiny bit while Microsoft s shares are actually up almost three points Apparently CEOs are not quite as essential as one might imagine them to be As it happens that s true in the sense that the underlying drivers of any business are more important than the particular individual at the top although you do have to have someone at the top who can recognize and take advantage of those drivers In the case of Bulkeley barnesandnoble com has been struggling for so long without any obvious way of improving its business fundamentals that his departure wasn t seen as making a fundamental difference one way or the other In the cases of Glass and particularly of Gates the economics of the companies they run are so phenomenal that it s hard to imagine the companies falling to pieces in their absence But the picture is more complicated than this Take Gates for example In the first place whatever the economics of Microsoft are he played a major role in creating them certainly a larger role than any other person though probably not a larger role than the advent of personal computing In his single minded focus on software and his insistence that Microsoft create programs that could run on multiple platforms Gates shaped a business that was almost a textbook example of how to achieve increasing returns on capital At the same time the biggest reason why the market did not react badly to the news that Gates was stepping down as CEO is that this was truly a foregone conclusion The groundwork had been laid for Steve Ballmer s accession to the throne and it s been clear for a while that Wall Street is very comfortable with Ballmer at the reins This is oddly to Gates credit The paradoxical answer to the question I asked in the first paragraph in fact is that one measure of how well a CEO has done is the indifference with which the market takes his leaving As William Holden says at the end of Executive Suite the 1954 film about the succession battle at an old line manufacturing company a company can t depend on just one man and still thrive Even when that one man is the company s founder This is not exactly a classic succession of course because Gates is not leaving the company at all and because Wall Street likes the idea that he will now have more time to think deep thoughts and not have to worry about whether the latest version of Excel is shipping on time But when you consider that in the last month Microsoft has gotten a new CFO and a new CEO without even a hint of investor discontent it makes you realize that the strongest management teams are also the deepest Even in the age when intellectual capital supposedly rules all Wall Street doesn t invest in individuals It invests in companies
