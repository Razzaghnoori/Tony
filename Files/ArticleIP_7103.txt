 Party Tricks One of my favorite classroom tricks is to auction off a 20 bill I explain in advance that the 20 goes to the top bidder but the top two bidders have to pay whatever they bid That way if at least two students bid at least 10 I come out ahead In fact it s far better than that As soon as two students are rash enough to enter the bidding I m almost guaranteed an astronomical profit Once Mickey bids a nickel and Minnie bids a dime both are trapped There s never a right time to drop out of the auction If Mickey quits now he loses his nickel but by staying in he can quite reasonably bid a quarter for a 20 bill Minnie of course raises her bid to half a dollar After a few rounds Mickey has bid 9 and Minnie goes to 10 Mickey can t quit without throwing away 9 instead he takes the far more sensible route of bidding 11 to get 20 Now my profit is in the bag But that s only the beginning After a few more rounds Minnie bids 18 and Mickey bids 19 Now Minnie can either bid 20 to get 20 or drop out and pay 18 for nothing she bids 20 At this point poor Mickey can either bid 21 to get 20 accepting a 1 loss or drop out and pay 19 for nothing he opts for the lesser of two evils and bids 21 Similar reasoning leads Minnie to bid 22 The spiral stops escalating only when one or the other runs out of money or exhausts my willingness to extend credit If my students were sufficiently wealthy and sufficiently shortsighted to enter the auction in the first place I could earn a lifetime s income in a 50 minute class period My auction game is a crude but instructive metaphor for political campaign spending It might even be a reasonably accurate metaphor if we lived in a world where the biggest spender always wins In any contested election candidates would continue to spend until they had exhausted all their own and their supporters resources Foreseeing that outcome no politician would ever contest an election The first candidate to file would always win by default But in our world outspending your opponent doesn t always make you a winner it only increases your probability of winning And beyond a certain point it doesn t increase your probability by very much The candidate who runs 10 001 commercials has little advantage over the candidate who runs 10 000 So sooner or later politicians reach a point where one more commercial just can t justify its cost That puts a natural limit on what they re willing to spend Mickey will always bid another dollar to get a 20 bill but he won t always bid another dollar to get a slightly increased chance at a 20 bill All this is important because campaign finance reform is important and you can t predict the effects of campaign finance reform unless you think about the incentives it creates for politicians Let me offer a few potential scenarios First imagine the most simple minded of all possible reforms The government subsidizes each of the two major candidates to the tune of oh say 1 million apiece You might expect that plan to backfire by encouraging the candidates to spend more But think again The subsidies don t affect the cost of the 10 001 st commercial and they don t affect its benefit so if a candidate has already decided not to run that commercial he still won t want to run it Therefore total expenditures don t change they just get covered by the taxpayers instead of the fat cats The only exception is if the candidate is literally out of money and never had the option of running the commercial without the subsidy Here s a different scenario Suppose that instead of giving 1 million apiece to the top two candidates the government agrees to give a million to any candidate who meets certain criteria say a 10 percent showing in major opinion polls Now the main effect is to encourage new candidates to enter With more candidates must there be more total expenditure Not clearly Suppose for example that Al Gore and George W Bush are in the middle of a hotly contested race for the presidency when Colin Powell suddenly throws his hat in the ring and suppose that Powell has a 20 percent chance of winning Then Gore and Bush are no longer battling each other for the presidency they re battling each other for an 80 percent chance at the presidency With the value of the prize diminished they ll be willing to spend less in its pursuit So what Powell spends is at least partly offset by what Gore and Bush choose to save That example points to an important general principle Total expenditure is determined by the value of the prize whether we re talking about presidential campaigns or state lotteries If the Powerball jackpot is worth 50 million and less than 50 million worth of tickets have been sold then the odds are favorable and rational betters will rush in to buy tickets guaranteeing that at least 50 million in tickets will be sold Likewise if the presidency is worth 50 million and there are many potential candidates with essentially identical chances of winning they ll keep entering the race until they ve collectively spent at least 50 million In a state lottery your odds of winning depend only on how many tickets you hold compared with everyone else That s what guarantees that people will keep buying tickets as long as the odds are in their favor That s a good analogy to an election with many equally plausible candidates whose odds of winning might depend only on how much they spend compared with everyone else But if some candidates tower over others the analogy breaks down If you know that the state lottery is likely to be rigged you ll buy fewer tickets And if politicians believe that an election is rigged in the sense that the favorite will probably win regardless of expenditures they ll buy fewer campaign commercials That means there are only two kinds of reform that have any chance of actually reducing total expenditure on presidential elections The first is to reduce the value of the presidency itself say by putting new limits on presidential power or installing a permanent independent counsel or requiring the president to sleep on a bed of nails The second is to reduce the uncertainty about who s going to win How do you reduce uncertainty The most drastic way is to allow only one candidate This makes the outcome completely certain and drives campaign expenditures to zero Short of that you could try to deliver information about the candidates that might drive voters to make up their minds on some basis other than political advertising for example you could sponsor a series of debates But that cuts both ways Suppose it s 2000 the candidates are Gore and Bush and Gore has a slight but not insurmountable lead in the polls Now Gore trounces Bush in a debate substantially widening his lead and making it all but certain that Gore will win Rational creatures that they are both candidates reduce their expenditures rather than try to change a foregone conclusion But suppose on the other hand that Bush wins the debate closing the gap and putting the candidates into a virtual dead heat Then expenditures will rise as each candidate fights to resolve the new uncertainty in his own favor If the debates essentially substitute for commercials then they re equivalent to the scenario where the government gives a certain amount of money to each candidate and expenditures don t change If the debates are fundamentally different from commercials then they re equally liable to cause the race to tighten or to widen and expenditures can go either up or down Of course debates have civic virtues other than their effects on spending so this is not an argument against them But it is an argument for being realistic about what we can and cannot change Whenever there s a big prize to be won whether it s a lottery jackpot or the presidency of the United States people will find a way to spend a lot of money trying to win it
