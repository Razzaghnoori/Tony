 Potemkin Villages Was director Peter Weir poking gentle fun at Seaside Fla when he set The Truman Show there Were the faux neighborliness and picture perfectness a hint that he considers the planned community with its gingerbread cottages and white picket fences and Yale trained architects and grand terminology The New Urbanism and grander utopian ideals a Potemkin Village After all even this architectural utopia has turned out to have its downsides onerous zoning and architectural restrictions rules about what you can and cannot do with your garden a general atmosphere of community mindedness that can grate on a soul if that soul like Truman starts to develop a live free or die approach to things If so the satire has gone over viewers heads Seaside town officials have told the Hollywood Reporter that as soon as the movie opened they started getting calls from tourists looking to rent one of the 270 cottages available to renters One of the movie s producers commented I recall we made Witness in 1985 and the following year tourism went up 39 in Lancaster County Pa Which reminds Culturebox that the first maxim of movies debunking the illusion of movies is It doesn t matter how devastating your expos of an illusion if the illusion s a pretty one some people will always want a piece of it Speaking of The Truman Show What if the Library of Congress announced an event celebrating the top 100 American novels to be chosen from a list of 400 95 percent of which just happened to have been published by publishing firms that had donated big money to the event Or if the Met was to pick the 100 best American paintings most of which were painted with Windsor and Newton oils a major sponsor Seem corrupt to you So why is the American Film Institute doing the same thing with its top 100 films to be chosen from among 400 preselected studio movies when the sponsors are Warner Bros Twentieth Century Fox Disney Miramax Columbia TriStar MGM UA Paramount Universal Polygram HBO Republic Pictures LIVE Entertainment and Orion And what is the stated purpose of the event which will be broadcast on CBS and promoted by Newsweek To stimulate video rentals And as long as we re asking annoying questions Where are all the great films of John Cassavetes most of which have not yet been released on video Shadows which is on the list is not one of his best it just happens to be out on video Ditto for say a dozen great directors and long acknowledged classics But second guessing the list is too easy a sport The more important questions Why are we selling off our greatest cultural heritage to the highest bidder OK OK Culturebox understands that the dictates of the market supersede nitpicky aesthetic judgments no matter how right they happen to be But must we celebrate our tainted taste on television Judith Shulevitz
