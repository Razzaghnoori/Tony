 okay well uh so what do you think about golfing are you a spectator or a player oh i m definitely a player i guess uh there is some question about that when i total up the score but yeah i know how you feel about that that s true what s what s uh what s the best part of your game do you think oh i like to uh i think putting is probably my uh forte um hum what is your worst then i guess i have the most trouble with chipping how about you well i think i think my best part actually is chipping or at least it was last year i haven t been out this year it s kind of been uh kind of strange i hadn t been able to get out yet but uh my biggest problem is staying in the fairway for you know with drives and stuff um yeah i used to have a lot of trouble with that with a wicked slide and so forth but i think i ve overcome a good deal of that um hum yeah i ve i ve gone in the past years from uh having a wicked slice to having a wicked hook to back to having a wicked slice i mean it s just uh and i can t seem to find the middle space you know but i ve got a friend of mine working on it uh i ve trying to help me out i ve been going to the driving range with him and and it seems to be doing some um yeah i ve always threatened to take lessons but i ve never gotten around to it yeah well lessons are are okay if you do it right i think i did i took some lessons uh a couple of years back but to tell you the truth that for a while hurt more than it helped because i it turned out that i couldn t do anything right after that oh really um and even you know like i said my chipping which is one of the best things in my game i couldn t do that i couldn t couldn t drive couldn t you know in in fact it was it wasn t as much at that point that i was hooking and slicing i just i was topping the ball i was you know i was doing a lot of things wrong at that point but i was trying to think of so many different things at the same time because you know it was it it s kind of a funny story whenever i went for for my first lesson the uh the instructor takes me out there and he says all right well take a swing and let me see how you look so he s he s bending down on one knee right so i take a swing and and all of a sudden his head just goes down and and then all of a you know he just kind of slowly brings his head up and looks at me and he says we ve got a lot of work to do so built that confidence right up there huh oh yeah i was feeling real good then so he broke me down from i mean he started me from the very beginning as far as changing just about everything i did and uh uh that can be bad i mean you know a lot of people say well that s like i said it s best to take your lessons right at the beginning before you learn the bad habits i guess oh yeah oh that s definitely true in fact if uh if i ever you know have a son or anything i m definitely going to uh you know teach him have a lesson or something is that yours or mine i think that s mine let me just quick catch it and i ll be back all right i m back okay yeah uh they uh my uh i have an interesting anecdote what s that my uh my uh son who goes up to A M he s had the pleasure of having a hole in one oh yeah yeah well uh you know the only person i ve ever known that had a hole in one was my brother in law but uh and he he said he got his luckily so i don t know that s that s but i mean yeah well i guess there s a certain amount of luck in any hole in one i came so close once just once i mean that s the only time i ve ever been any anywhere near but i mean i it was i used to live out in Midland Texas i don t know if you ve ever been out there but it s you know a real windy place oh thank God i ve never been to Midland but uh yeah i i played on a course out there and like i said it s a very windy place so it s you know the wind was blowing and it was cold and it was like it was about a hundred and i don t know a hundred and seventy or a hundred and eighty year par three and i you know the wind was right in my face so i just pulled out a seven wood right and i put that thing i mean it rolled right by the cup and only ended up three inches off but you know over over past the hole but i mean that s as close as i ve ever been you know because i m not you know that s one of my problems is controlling my my my irons on a par three so i have a lot of trouble hitting the greens yeah so do you do you like watching it though i mean well one of my uh well control and uh and contact are a big problem and they still are this one of the things i was doing wrong was too much back swing and hurrying my back swing yeah well that s that s exactly what my friend has has figured out that i do is my i can actually see the club on my backswing and and uh yeah and he says that what i do is i m actually crossing the plain is what this is his words his technical words for it crossing yeah that sounds like the exact same words my friend tells me yeah because it because i ended up into an inverted C where the weight was on the wrong foot or something so yeah i i ve found that i actually do of uh i get a lot uh better control and distance if i don t you know don t take as big a back swing yeah if i can convince myself not to try and kill it i sure you always get a lot better results yeah what s funny is the idea that uh you know what i consider you know like a three quarter backswing or even a half backswing uh my friend says that s you know that s a full backswing and you don t want to go any further than that so i mean it s a now it s a matter of trying to convince myself that that s right yeah so i don t know it s going to be interesting well you have to prove it to yourself just by doing it a few times um that s probably true well it s a frustrating game golf oh isn t it though i don t know why i do it it s getting more expensive unfortunately too oh that s that s one of the worse things about it it really is but uh you know like you i haven t played any or not much this year i played a couple of times but um hum i went out skiing in February and took uh little tumble down the slopes and so i m nursing a wounded wing right you know that s it you have to be healthy too that s another point i guess yeah well i think that s about it yeah well i love the game so uh i enjoyed talking about it yeah i do too yeah well you take care yeah good luck okay enjoyed it bye bye bye
