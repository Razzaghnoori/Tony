 Pharmaceutical Realism Slate ran an item about Gabriel Garc a M rquez s News of a Kidnapping a couple of weeks ago reporting a general puzzlement among reviewers Some reviewers were said to have regretted the unmagicness of the book s realism and the sobriety of its prose style Someone else was said to have deplored a lack of moral firmness in Garc a M rquez s portrait of Pablo Escobar the Medellin drug lord But those reactions as summarized in Slate don t do justice to the book News of a Kidnapping is a genuinely masterful work in its field though the field is journalism not fiction which may surprise readers but shouldn t Garc a M rquez began his career as a newspaper reporter not as a novelist and he has written journalism from time to time ever since Kidnapping is an old theme of his Years ago he composed a screenplay described as a cinematographic narrative about a real life mass kidnapping of members of the Nicaraguan elite by the leftist Sandinista guerrillas in 1974 during the time of the Somoza dictatorship The screenplay was never filmed so far as I know but came out in book form under the title Viva Sandino or in a later edition El Asalto There you could already see the elements that make up News of a Kidnapping a social background of violence and injustice the United States hovering in the distance a hostage situation But the screenplay about Nicaragua presented these elements as a simple Marxist fable the contemptible elite kidnap victims the loathsome U S imperialists the heroic revolutionary kidnappers Nothing so simple appears in News of a Kidnapping The author says very little about the United States apart from noting that at the beginning of the 1990s when the book takes place the U S wanted to extradite Colombian drug lords to American prisons The 10 kidnap victims seized on Pablo Escobar s orders for the purpose of pressuring the government of Colombia not to extradite anyone are presented as wholly admirable As for Escobar himself Garc a M rquez offers a portrait that is authentically scary The most unsettling and dangerous aspect of his personality was his total inability to distinguish between good and evil Garc a M rquez tells us in one of his only direct commentaries on his own cast of characters He shows us the consequences of this particular inability too the murdered presidential candidates the massacres in the Colombian streets the hundreds of murdered policemen But we do also see the social reality behind Escobar and his drug empire which makes for a complicating factor We meet the young hit men who guarded the kidnap victims and odors of fatalism superstition and barbarism waft upward from the page in an unmistakable indication that we are in the presence of the grimmest poverty Escobar claimed to have been conducting a war on behalf of the Colombian slums avenging the brutality of the police with still more brutality of his own and we can see that in a perverse way he did feel something of a righteous indignation He managed even to demand that the Colombian press publish a human rights report by Americas Watch which was a wonderfully bizarre demand for a crime chief to make And with details like that Garc a M rquez s narrative of the kidnapping the sequestering of the victims in their different safe houses the efforts by the husband of one of the victims to get the president of Colombia sympathetically involved the drawn out negotiations the months of incarceration a killing then another the intervention of a half mad television priest the release of the survivors and at last the surrender of Escobar himself this tale like a tropical downpour conjures up a brilliant leafy green Latin Americanness At least it does in the original Spanish language text In English the leafy green comes out a bit less leafy due to the traumas of translation Translations are always faulty and the present one by Edith Grossman is doubtless better than most Still there are passages that while perfectly clear in the Spanish language original re emerge in translation as pointlessly obscure The kidnap victim whom we get to know best is a prize winning journalist named Maruja Pach n about whom Garc a M rquez says in the English translation In the bloom of her early thirties she had married in the Catholic Church at the age of nineteen and had given her husband five children But in Garc a M rquez had merely written much more simply She was in the flower of her thirties she had been married by the Catholic Church at nineteen and she had given her husband five children And of mangled passages like that now translated with too much freedom now too literally is to cover Garc a M rquez s text with a thin almost invisible varnish of strangeness which is exactly what the author never meant to have happen For if there is a deep theme in News of a Kidnapping it is the same as in some of his other writings the theme of a narrow remote provincial life quaint and familiar as it feels in the Spanish original in which the quaintness has somehow blossomed into something horrific That is exactly how we are meant to see Escobar as a bit of Colombian local color except intensified a thousandfold to the point of monstrosity A primitive among provincials A man whose defective moral sense included a grotesquely exaggerated loyalty to a limited number of people in his own family and in the slums A man with a fortune of 3 billion dollars who still could not figure out how to live outside his own country away from the people trying to hunt him down A cornered beast terrorized and terrorizing Garc a M rquez tells us at the start of the book that writing News of a Kidnapping was the saddest and most difficult task of his life But apart from that and a playful wave at us at the end How incredible says Maruja in the last line Somebody should write a book nothing in the narrative draws attention to the author or to his way of telling the story This too must disappoint readers looking for the pleasures of an intricately constructed novel News of a Kidnapping is about real events however and not about imagination not even about a journalist s imagination By the last chapter I understood Garc a M rquez s Colombia a lot better I understood something about the drug wars But never mind what I understood my hair was standing on end It was because without ever breaking the rules of hard fact journalism Garc a M rquez had given me an experience of fear of death
