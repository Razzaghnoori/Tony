 Office of the General Counsel B 274798 October 17 1996 The Honorable John H Chafee Chairman The Honorable Max Baucus Ranking Minority Member Committee on Environment and Public Works United States Senate The Honorable Thomas J Bliley Jr Chairman The Honorable John D Dingell Ranking Minority Member Committee on Commerce House of Representatives Subject Environmental Protection Agency Control of Air Pollution Final Rule for New Gasoline Spark Ignition Marine Engines Exemptions for New Nonroad Compression Ignition Engines at or above 37 Kilowatts and New Nonroad Spark Ignition Engines at or Below 19 Kilowatts Pursuant to section 801 a 2 A of title 5 United States Code this is our report on a major rule promulgated by Environmental Protection Agency entitled Control of Air Pollution Final Rule for New Gasoline Spark Ignition Marine Engines Exemptions for New Nonroad Compression Ignition Engines at or above 37 Kilowatts and New Nonroad Spark Ignition Engines at or Below 19 Kilowatts RIN 2060 AE54 We received the rule on September 10 1996 It was published in the Federal Register as a final rule on October 4 1996 61 Fed Reg 52087 The rule regulates exhaust emissions from new spark ignition SI gasoline marine engines including outboard engines personal watercraft engines and jet boat engines beginning with the 1998 model year and the rule is fully phased in by the 2006 model year The regulation of these emissions became necessary under section 213 a 3 of the Clean Air Act as amended when EPA found that these nonroad engines were significant contributors to ozone or carbon monoxide concentrations in more than one nonattainment area A nonattainment area is a GAO OGC 96 45 specified area that has failed to attain the applicable National Ambient Air Quality Standard for a given pollutant In addition the rule exempts new nonroad compression ignition engines at or above 37 kilowatts and new nonroad sparkignition engines at or below 19 kilowatts Enclosed is our assessment of the Environmental Protection Agency s compliance with the procedural steps required by sections 801 a 1 B i through iv of title 5 with respect to the rule Our review indicates that the Environmental Protection Agency complied with the applicable requirements If you have any questions about this report please contact James Vickers Senior Attorney at 202 512 8210 The official responsible for GAO evaluation work relating to the Environmental Protection Agency is Peter Guerrero Director Environmental Protection Issues Mr Guerrero can be reached at 202 512 6111 Robert P Murphy General Counsel Enclosure cc Mr Thomas E Kelly Director Office of Regulatory Management and Information Environmental Protection Agency Page 2 GAO OGC 96 45 ENCLOSURE ANALYSIS UNDER 5 U S C 801 a 1 B i iv OF A MAJOR RULE ISSUED BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY ENTITLED CONTROL OF AIR POLLUTION FINAL RULE FOR NEW GASOLINE SPARK IGNITION MARINE ENGINES EXEMPTIONS FOR NEW NONROAD COMPRESSION IGNITION ENGINES AT OR ABOVE 37 KILOWATTS AND NEW NONROAD SPARK IGNITION ENGINES AT OR BELOW 19 KILOWATTS RIN 2060 AE54 i Cost benefit analysis EPA has prepared an analysis of the costs and benefits of the rule which is contained in the Regulatory Impact Analysis The analysis explains the methodologies and the reasons behind their use in arriving at the cost and benefits of the rule In achieving the rule s goal of a 75 percent reduction in hydrocarbon emissions by the year 2025 such a reduction will also contribute to the reduction of volatile organic compounds and ozone in ozone attainment areas The EPA finds that the benefits of a 590 254 tons of hydrocarbons reduced per year by the rule more than offsets the increase in oxides of nitrogen of 25 440 tons per year which will result The annualized costs associated with the rule in 2006 will exceed 370 million which is 7 percent of the projected expenditure on these engines in that year The average increase in cost for the engines would be 10 15 percent or 700 per engine The analysis contains tables which show the annual cost from 1998 the effective date of the rule until the year 2051 by which the EPA expects the entire existing fleet of these engines to have been replaced to be 15 5 million to 336 2 million respectively The cost effectiveness of the rule has been calculated by EPA to be approximately 1 000 per ton of hydrocarbons reduced ii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 U S C 603 605 607 and 609 In the preamble to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 59 Fed Reg 55966 EPA concluded that the rule would have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities especially in view of EPA s implementation of the Act which considers any impact a significant impact GAO OGC 96 45 However in the preamble to the final rule EPA has now determined that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities This change is due to the deletion from the rule of the regulation of stern drive and inboard engines which are mainly manufactured by small entities EPA believes that at most there are only two firms which manufacture outboard or personal watercraft and jetboat engines that qualify as small entities EPA notes in the preamble to the final rule that it has reduced the burdens where possible on these small entities following consideration of the comments received EPA states that it has taken into consideration the potential competitive impact on these firms and has eased the burden by permitting averaging emissions across product lines reduced production line testing reduced in use testing simplified certification procedures and allowing manufacturers to purchase emission credits from the market place as an alternative to employing control technologies to meet the standard iii Agency actions relevant to sections 202 205 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 2 U S C 1532 1535 Based on the cost benefit analysis performed by EPA the rule will not impose an intergovernmental mandate because there are no enforceable duties on State local or tribal governments However the rule will impose a mandate on the private sector in excess of 100 million in any one year EPA has prepared both a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the benefits and costs of the rule in the Regulatory Impact Analysis EPA has considered numerous regulatory alternatives to the final provisions of the rule which are discussed in the Summary and Analysis of Comments but has determined that the requirements expressed in the final rule constitute the most cost effective and least burdensome alternative that would meet the mandate of section 213 a 3 of the Clean Air Act iv Other relevant information or requirements under Acts and Executive orders Administrative Procedure Act 5 U S C 551 et seq Instead of the notice and comment procedures in the Administrative Procedure Act the EPA promulgated this rule using the procedures which have similar notice and comment requirements contained in section 307 d of the Clean Air Act as amended 42 U S C 7607 d The use of these procedures regarding rules pertaining to nonroad engines or vehicles is mandated by section 307 d 1 R of the Clean Air Act Page 2 GAO OGC 96 45 EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on November 9 1994 59 Fed Reg 55930 requesting comments on the proposed rule On February 7 1996 EPA published a Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 61 Fed Reg 4600 to refine some of the proposals made in the prior notice and to respond to comments which had been received In the preamble to the final rule 61 Fed Reg 52090 EPA discusses the changes made in the proposed rule in finalizing the rule and advises that the significant comments received and EPA s responses thereto are available to the public in a Summary and Analysis of Comments document Paperwork Reduction Act 44 U S C 3501 3520 The rule contains information collection requirements which are subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act EPA originally submitted eight information collection requests ICRs to the Office of Management and Budget OMB for approval under the Act in connection with the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking OMB originally denied all eight requests but subsequently approved two of the requests EPA has resubmitted all eight requests based on reduced reporting and recordkeeping requirements resulting from changed requirements in the final rule EPA notes that it has taken steps to reduce the administrative burden as much as possible and in the final rule estimates that the burden for the collection of information under all eight ICRs would average 6 900 hours annually for a typical manufacturer The ICRs contain the information required by the Act including the reasons for the collection of the information the type of information and an estimate of the burden imposed on respondents EPA has solicited comments on the proposed information collection requirements to be sent to both EPA and OMB for consideration during the approval process The information collection requirements of the rule will not be effective until OMB approval is obtained Statutory authorization for the rule The EPA has cited sections 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 213 215 216 and 301 a of the Clean Air Act as amended 42 U S C 7521 7522 7523 7524 7525 7541 7542 7543 7547 7549 7550 and 7601 a In particular section 213 of the Act 42 U S C 7547 requires the Administrator of EPA to regulate emissions from nonroad engines and vehicles and to issue regulations containing standards applicable to emissions from these categories of new nonroad engines and vehicles Executive Order No 12866 OMB reviewed the rule under Executive Order No 12866 as a significant regulatory action The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB approved the Page 3 GAO OGC 96 45 final rule as complying with the requirements of the Order based on the information supplied by EPA including a planned regulatory action document describing the reason for the rule and an assessment of the costs and budgetary impact of the rule Page 4 GAO OGC 96 45
