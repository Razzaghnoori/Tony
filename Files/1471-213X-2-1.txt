 Introduction A key component regulating neuronal migration is the appropriate spatio temporal expression of extracellular matrix ECM molecules which contribute to the highway along which neurons travel Proteins such as serine proteases and their inhibitors could alter the quality of this highway and thus play critical roles in migratory processes 1 Members of the serine protease inhibitor superfamily or serpins act by binding to and permanently inactivating their target protease s One member of this family protease nexin 1 PN 1 was first described by Monard et al 2 Though initially characterized for its ability to stimulate neurite outgrowth 2 3 4 5 PN 1 also modulates neuronal migration as exemplified by Lindner et al 6 Their studies demonstrate that PN 1 slows granule cell movement from the external to internal layers in postnatal mouse cerebellar slice cultures Interestingly this inhibition of migration by protease inhibitors may be balanced by the stimulation of migration via proteases For example in vitro addition of plasmin a serine protease accelerates the migration of neuroblastoma cells through a matrigel base by a factor of five 7 The subsequent addition of aprotinin a plasmin inhibitor decreases the migratory population to the same degree 8 9 Furthermore Seeds et al 10 demonstrated a retardation of granule cell migration in tissue plasminogen activator tPA knock out mice These data support the hypothesis that a balance exists between serine proteases and their inhibitors such that changes in this balance delay or promote neuronal migration The present study was initiated to test this hypothesis in vivo by examining neuronal migration of chick gonadotropin releasing hormone GnRH neurons during embryogenesis The site of origin of these cells in the olfactory placode as well as the time course and migratory route along the olfactory nerve ON and into the forebrain are well documented 11 12 13 14 Previous work in the laboratory has shown that olfactory axons emerge from the olfactory epithelium at stage 18 and are first joined by glia 15 and GnRH neurons 16 at stage 21 In order to test whether proteolysis or its inhibition affect GnRH cellular migration we performed experiments at two critical developmental time points In both of these a protease or its inhibitor was applied by placing protein coated beads at the olfactory placode The first experiments tested whether application of either of these agents over the period of stage 21 to stage 29 affected the initial exit of GnRH neurons from the OE and or their rate of migration along the ON and into the CNS The second experiments tested whether GnRH neurons exited the OE irrespective of the effects of proteolysis on the maturation of the olfactory nerve In this case protein soaked beads were applied prior to GnRH exit stage 17 and the effects were tested at succeeding stages up to and including their normal exit time stages 18 19 20 21 In the latter experiments the effects of proteolysis and its inhibition on the development of the olfactory nerve itself were tested using axonal glial and neuronal outgrowth markers These are the first experiments to demonstrate the critical roles of proteolysis and its inhibition on the regulation of GnRH cellular migration Results PN 1 and trypsin modulate GnRH neuronal migration in vivo during embryogenesis All embryos analyzed were stage 21 at the time of bead implantation and stage 29 at the time of fixation In control embryos n 10 receiving a PB coated bead GnRH neurons in each compartment were counted on the side ipsilateral and contralateral to the bead There was no effect of the bead on GnRH neuronal distribution Table 1 or total number Table 2 Sections counterstained with cresyl violet revealed no morphological abnormalities of the epithelium caused by insertion of the bead Figure 1 In PN 1 treated embryos the distribution of GnRH neurons within the olfactory epithelium nerve and brain on the side contralateral to the bead and that of controls were not significantly different indicating that the contralateral side in experimental embryos served as an internal control Therefore statistical analysis was performed comparing values within embryos i e GnRH neuronal distribution ipsilateral to the bead was compared to that contralateral to the bead Significantly more neurons remained within the epithelium P 0 03 and fewer had crossed into the brain P 0 002 see Table 1 on the PN 1 treated side The effects of PN 1 on GnRH neuronal distribution cannot be attributed to changes in total cell number as there was no difference in this parameter between groups Table 2 Other serine protease inhibitors tested included soybean trypsin inhibitor and Type IV chicken ovoinhibitor data not shown These protease inhibitors demonstrated a range of effects on the distribution of GnRH neurons across the three compartments Both concentrations of soybean trypsin inhibitor tested 1 mg ml n 6 and 10 mg ml n 4 had no significant effect on the distribution of GnRH neurons Application of type IV chicken ovoinhibitor led to a decrease in the percent of GnRH neurons remaining in the OE P 0 02 and a larger percent within the telencephalon P 0 03 PN 1 has four known target proteases urokinase plasminogen activator uPA tissue type plasminogen activator tPA thrombin and trypsin 17 Evidence exists for a role of both trypsin 18 19 and uPA 20 21 in migratory processes Therefore both were tested in our system All comparisons made were of the treated side ipsilateral to the bead and the untreated side contralateral to the bead Trypsin resulted in fewer GnRH neurons within the epithelium P 0 008 and along the olfactory nerve P 0 04 and more within the brain P 0 0001 see Table 1 There was no significant difference in the total number of GnRH neurons Table 2 compared to control The effect of trypsin is specific since in embryos receiving a uPA bead there was no effect of the protease on the distribution of GnRH neurons data not shown GnRH neuronal migration is cell autonomous but modulated by composition of the ECM As PN 1 can stimulate neurite outgrowth 2 3 4 5 we tested its effects on outgrowth and maturation of the olfactory nerve Maturation of the nerve was followed by immunoreactivity to axonal glial and neuronal markers summarized in Table 3 All embryos analyzed were stage 17 at the time of bead implantation and stages 18 21 at the time of fixation Unilateral insertion of PB coated beads into the olfactory placode of stage 17 embryos did not disrupt the development of either axonal or glial components of the olfactory nerve between stages 18 21 Table 3 The time of axonal outgrowth and sequential acquisition of axonal and glial markers were identical to that observed previously 15 The porous nature of the bead was compatible with axonal elongation through the mesenchyme towards the developing telencephalic vesicle In fact immunoreactive axons were found coursing through the bead Figure 2 Likewise there was no alteration in the timing of GnRH neuronal migration out of the epithelium At stage 21 GnRH neurons were found within the olfactory epithelium and along the olfactory nerve Table 3 a distribution appropriate for this stage Implantation of PN 1 beads did not stimulate premature olfactory nerve axogenesis As in controls very few MAP1b immunoreactive neurites were present at stage 18 Table 3 However PN 1 application did accelerate the biochemical differentiation of the axons For instance under normal conditions olfactory axons acquire immunoreactivity to NCAM at stage 20 In PN 1 treated embryos NCAM immunoreactivity was instead present at stage 19 The sequence of appearance of all markers however remained identical to controls As the length of each developmental stage varies 22 it is difficult to determine precisely the amount of time by which biochemical development of the axons is accelerated On average however biochemical differentiation is advanced by 7 hours Just as PN 1 did not alter the timing of axogenesis it also had no effect on the timing of glial entry into the nerve stage 21 Under these conditions that is accelerated biochemical differentiation of olfactory axons GnRH neuronal distribution was not altered GnRH neurons were found within the epithelium and along the nerve and most importantly none had crossed into the brain Implantation of trypsin coated beads at stage 17 had no effect on either the timing of nerve development axonal or glial or the biochemical differentiation of the axons The distribution of GnRH neurons however was altered Table 3 Under normal conditions large numbers of GnRH neurons are within the telencephalon by approximately stage 25 In the presence of trypsin however GnRH neurons crossed the nerve brain junction at stage 21 representing a significant acceleration of this event Even more significantly these cells had continued along their normal migratory path into the presumptive septal and preoptic areas their normal target sites Application of uPA beads at stage 17 had no effect on axonogenesis or the nerve s biochemical differentiation or glial ensheathment The distribution of GnRH neurons was likewise not altered data not shown PN 1 and trypsin expression along the GnRH migratory route Endogenous trypsin immunoreactivity was present in the vast majority of cells within the head of the chick during the time period studied stage 21 29 These cells included those within the olfactory epithelium and throughout the mesenchyme as well as axonal tracts within the developing face including the olfactory nerve figure 3 panel A To ensure that the immunoreactivity we see in chick is specific trypsin protein was pre adsorbed with the anti trypsin antibody This complex was then used to immunostain chick sections stages 21 23 No immunoreactivity was evident suggesting that the staining pattern seen in the chick using the anti trypsin antibody was specific figure 3 panel B Unlike trypsin no immunoreactive uPA was present within regions of the olfactory system or the developing telencephalic vesicle during this time frame data not shown Antibodies that recognize chick PN 1 are not available and thus this protease inhibitor was localized using mouse embryonic tissue at developmental times corresponding to the chick stages 21 29 Double confocal immunofluoresence of mouse tissue embryonic day 15 El 5 demonstrated that MAP1b immunoreactive axons of the vomeronasal nerve VNN the highway for GnRH neurons in the mouse 11 13 express PN 1 protein Figure 4 but not trypsin data not shown Importantly PN 1 immunoreactivity was not limited to MAP1b immunoreactive axons but was also present within the basal laminae of the vomeronasal organ VNO as well as within the adjacent mesenchyme Figure 4 In both El 5 and adult mouse brains PN 1 immunoreactivity within the olfactory bulb was diffuse but appeared to be more concentrated within the glomerular layer data not shown S100 positive glia of the VNN express trypsin Figure 5 within the cell bodies and along major processes the diffuse staining suggested it was also in the matrix of the VNN Figure 5 5B It is clear that PN 1 protein was not present in the same structures as those immunoreactive for trypsin Figure 6 or GnRH data not shown Discussion This is the first report in which the in vivo application of a serine protease or its inhibitor have been demonstrated to affect embryonic neuronal migration Our data demonstrate stage specific effects of PN 1 and trypsin on the distribution of chick GnRH neurons along their migratory route without an alteration of their total population Stage specific introduction of these proteins was via unilateral insertion into either the olfactory epithelium or placode of protein coated Affigel Blue beads The use of these beads is an established method widely utilized to deliver exogenous proteins during development For example in their study of limb development Fallon et al 23 demonstrated depletion of iodinated FGF protein from Affigel Blue beads indicating protein does indeed diffuse out of the bead In fact the authors demonstrated that approximately half the iodinated protein diffused off the bead within the first 24 hours and 70 diffused by approximately 60 hours These data indicate that protein is present and diffusing into the surrounding area up to 60 hours following implantation of the bead Our experiments were carried out within this window of time there are 24 hours between stage 17 to 21 and 60 hours between stage 21 and 29 In addition subsequent studies examining the roles of BMP FGF s and Shh have also utilized Affigel Blue beads to exogenously introduce various protein components 24 25 The results of these studies have been consistent with the known temporal and spatial distributions of these proteins Modification of the extracellular milieu via local shifts in the protease inhibitor balance may regulate neuronal migration This hypothesis is supported by our findings on stage 21 29 embryos In these experiments inhibition of endogenous trypsin like activity by PN 1 resulted in fewer GnRH neurons exiting the olfactory epithelium and a corresponding decrease in the number entering the brain Conversely increasing trypsin availability promoted neuronal crossing of these two boundary zones We hypothesize that the serine protease inhibitor pair act by altering the ECM through which GnRH neurons migrate Matrix involvement in migration is supported by the identification of matrix components throughout the GnRH migratory route At the epithelium GnRH neurons cross the basal laminae to initiate their migratory phase 15 The olfactory nerve expresses several matrix molecules heparan and keratan sulfate proteoglycans 26 laminin 27 phosphocan 28 lectin binding domains 29 Any or all of these may serve as substrates for proteolysis The three domains the olfactory epithelium olfactory nerve and the brain represent regulatory road blocks to the GnRH cell By inhibiting local proteolysis PN 1 produces a non conducive environment at these points Likewise promotion of local proteolysis by trypsin results in a permissive migratory environment Though modification of the ECM composition may indeed explain the data another explanation may lie in the activation inhibition of protease activated receptors PAR s These two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive but rather may work in concert to regulate neuronal migration PAR S are G coupled receptors activated by proteolytic cleavage of their exo domains This cleavage exposes an amino acid sequence which then serves as a tethered ligand activating transmembrane signaling Four PAR S have been identified PAR 1 4 PAR S 1 3 and 4 are activated by thrombin while PAR2 is activated by trypsin 30 Activation of PAR S may alter ECM composition For example Hattori et al 31 demonstrated that thrombin activation of PAR1 led to deposition of P selectin a leukocyte adhesion molecule on the surfaces of endothelial cells This change in matrix composition allows for leukocyte attachment and subsequent infiltration of the endothelium PAR S are expressed in the developing rat CNS 32 as well as in the embryonic chick 33 Though we did not localize PAR expression in our model system it remains a possibility that their activation or inhibition may modulate the ECM composition and thus GnRH neuronal migration The fact that mammalian PN 1 alters neuronal migration in an avian species suggests the presence of endogenous serine protease activity in the region Such a protease with trypsin like immunoreactivity was detected by immunocytochemistry To biochemically characterize this endogenous activity non neurally derived trypsin inhibitors were tested At the concentrations tested soybean trypsin inhibitor had no effect on GnRH migration These results could be due to differences in binding affinity between soybean trypsin inhibitor and PN 1 for the endogenous trypsin like molecule The inhibition of trypsin like proteases by different inhibitors including PN 1 and soybean trypsin inhibitor varies widely and a lack of an effect is not uncommon e g 34 Contrary to the effect seen with PN 1 type IV chick ovoinhibitor accelerated neuronal migration with fewer GnRH neurons in the epithelium and correspondingly more within the brain At least two mechanisms can explain this result First type IV chick ovoinhibitor may not be acting as an inhibitor in our system as it has been demonstrated to be ineffective in other systems 34 35 36 Alternatively if it is serving as a protease inhibitor it may inactivate a molecule different from that affected by PN 1 and in doing so generate an environment permissive for neuronal migration Both non neuronally derived trypsin inhibitors tested yielded results different from that of PN 1 suggesting they possess different protease specificities affinities or functions Regardless of their mechanisms of action these data support the hypothesis that changes in enzymatic activities can influence neuronal migration In contrast to PN 1 trypsin leads to a permissive environment during this developmental period stages 21 29 resulting in a global acceleration of GnRH neuronal migration out of the olfactory epithelium and into the brain Trypsin cleaves peptide bonds at the carboxyl side of either arginine or lysine residues This rather non specific cleavage suggests trypsin may alter many different components of the ECM which themselves vary in each compartment Interestingly in the chick trypsin immunoreactivity was present throughout the head as well as in the olfactory nerve This ubiquitous distribution suggests that the specificity of the protease inhibitor system may be imparted by an avian equivalent of PN 1 We found no effect on GnRH neuronal distribution in uPA treated embryos and no uPA immunoreactivity This result is not surprising in light of a study by Del Bigio et al 37 in which the expression pattern of uPA was analyzed in the postnatal mouse Based on its spatio temporal expression pattern the authors concluded that uPA may function in processes of synaptogenesis and remodeling rather than in cell migration In addition our data indicate that simply coating beads with any serine protease is not sufficient to influence migration Thus not only is our experimental approach unbiased but the antagonistic relationship of PN 1 and trypsin on GnRH neuronal migration is specific A PN 1 specific antibody that cross reacts with chick tissue is not available thus we were unable to follow its expression in the chick Although avian and mammalian serpins are members of the same superfamily they are evolutionarily distinct 38 This divergence likely accounts for the species specificity of the PN 1 antibody To determine whether PN 1 is expressed by the olfactory system during the time of active GnRH neuronal migration we examined its expression in the embryonic mouse where its mRNA is known to be expressed 39 At E15 PN 1 protein is present within MAP1b immunoreactive axons of the vomeronasal nerve the migratory path used by GnRH neurons in mammals PN 1 immunoreactivity was also present within the basal laminae of the vomeronasal organ a barrier crossed by GnRH neurons when they initiate their migration This staining pattern along with our data on PN 1 s effect on migration strengthens our hypothesis that this serine protease inhibitor plays a role in neuronal migration In addition expression of other serine protease inhibitors has been described in other migrating neurons For example Krueger et al 40 demonstrated increased expression of neuroserpin within migrating granule cells of the cerebellum in the post natal mouse In the mouse trypsin immunoreactivity is present within S 100 immunoreactive glia which ensheath axons of the vomeronasal nerve As with PN 1 it is also present in the extracellular matrix where it is likely that the protease inhibitor pair function to regulate at least in part the environment through which GnRH neurons migrate Due to its ability to stimulate neurite outgrowth we asked whether PN 1 could alter the timing of formation of the olfactory nerve and if so what effect this might have on GnRH neuronal migration For these experiments bead implantation into the olfactory placode was performed at stage 17 just prior to olfactory nerve axonogenesis PN 1 did not accelerate neurite outgrowth but did accelerate detectable levels of biochemical differentiation markers of the olfactory nerve These data suggest that the olfactory neurons can respond to PN 1 directly or to changes in the local environment caused by PN 1 The distribution of GnRH neurons was not altered by PN 1 at stages 17 21 in spite of the accelerated maturation of the olfactory nerve Likewise PN 1 did not alter the timing of the nerve s ensheathment by glia This suggests that glial migration is independent of any matrix changes induced by PN 1 The fact that GnRH neurons and the glial ensheathing cells exit at the same time stage 21 may be coincidental or may be due to an interaction between these two populations Alternatively the timing of exit of GnRH neurons and glia may be cell autonomous events Implantation of a trypsin bead at stage 17 had no effect on the biochemical maturation of the olfactory nerve nor on the timing of glial or GnRH neuronal migration At this early stage at least some of the barriers to GnRH neuronal exit from the epithelium are in place 15 Therefore the lack of an effect on migration by trypsin suggests that the initiation of migration is an inherent property of the GnRH neuron and glial cell At stage 21 however trypsin did significantly alter the distribution of GnRH neurons such that a large population was already in the brain These neurons not only entered the brain early but also traveled caudalward within the brain along their normal arching trajectory Taken together these data suggest that in the presence of either trypsin or PN 1 at stage 17 GnRH neurons exit the olfactory epithelium at stage 21 as in controls Therefore the ability to initiate migration resides within the neuron itself such that alterations of ECM composition during this time stage 17 21 are irrelevant to the timing of this initial event The finding that the neurons enter the CNS early in trypsin treated embryos suggests that continued movement may be a cell autonomous event with trypsin induced proteolysis generating a permissive environment Finally these data demonstrate that the GnRH neuron s ability to transit across the glia limitans and through the brain to its target sites is independent of additional maturation of the neuron itself the olfactory nerve or the brain Our data support a role of proteases and their inhibitors in neuronal migration The complex interactions between a neuron and its environment are likely not regulated by proteolysis alone The characteristic directed migratory pattern taken by the GnRH neuron and the cohesiveness of the population suggests a more complex system is in place to ensure their appropriate translocation into the brain In fact Kramer and Wray 42 have identified a novel gene nasal embryonic LHRH GnRH factor or NELF which is expressed by GnRH neurons during their migratory phase and olfactory sensory neurons as they initiate axonogenesis Antisense depletion of NELF led to a decrease in both olfactory axonal outgrowth and the number of GnRH neurons exiting the epithelium The authors suggest that NEFL may function as a migratory factor It seems likely therefore that several components interact to orchestrate the proper migration of neurons Materials and Methods Animal and tissue preparation Chicks Fertilized eggs white leghorn SPAFAS Preston CT

proteases and inhibitors used were active a coagulation assay was performed Blood alone from PD coagulated in approximately 2 minutes Incubation of blood with 1 mg ml uPA delayed coagulation significantly by several minutes Incubation with combined PN 1 and uPA resulted in rapid coagulation as in control Cell counts and statistical analysis Cell counts for PN 1 and serine proteases were performed by PD who was unaware of the experimental status of the embryos Those for the other serine protease inhibitors were carried out by a second observer XLZ Both observers carried out independent counts on separately prepared sets of PB controls An equal number of immunoreactive tissue sections was counted for each side of the face i e the side containing the bead and the contralateral side Selected sections were recounted by AJS to check for accuracy Cell number was determined via a modified optical dissector method 44 45 46 Examination of tissue reveals three focal planes the nucleus being in crisp focus in only one of these planes This profile allows cells nuclei to be counted in each of the three planes Double counting is avoided for those cells in the top and bottom planes by counting alternate sections Immunoreactive GnRH neurons separated into categories depending on location olfactory epithelium OE olfactory nerve ON and telencephalon CNS Numbers in each category were then expressed as a percent of total number of GnRH neurons on that side of the face The contralateral side served as a within animal control To analyze for significant differences in percentage of GnRH neurons in each category an unpaired students t test p 0 05 was performed
