 Cyber Liberty Depends on the Architecture Now we re getting somewhere Richard asks How is it that commerce can bring about a change to the liberty of the Net How is it any different from commerce in real space We don t ordinarily we who are not Reds at least say that the market in general reduces freedom So why in cyberspace should it be any different The answer is simple It s the architecture um Richard Richard begins his questions with Chapter 7 but I think the answers begin in Chapter 1 For the argument of the first part of my book is not that the presence of commerce on the Net by itself reduces the liberty of the Net If the architecture of the Net remained as it was in 1995 then it wouldn t matter who uses the Net for what My argument is that commerce is changing the architecture of the Net and as a byproduct of that change the freedoms of the Net will change Commerce is bringing technologies to the Net that will reduce the initial liberties of the Net not because commerce is evil Nor because it is against liberty But because the architectures that make commerce more efficient can also make control cheaper The very architectures that make it possible to profit will make it easier to regulate Richard pointed to some of these architectures of freedom in his first post He said that physical aggression against neighbors is ruled out in part by the anonymous participation that is possible online I m not quite sure what he imagines here but he is appealing to a feature of the Net to make his argument anonymity But anonymity is not a natural or necessary feature of the Internet We could just as well imagine an Internet where transactions left fingerprints And to the extent that they did the consequence that Richard points to would change To the extent the Net were architected to limit or eliminate anonymity a certain liberty of the original Net would change as well And this is precisely the kind of change my book describes There is an increasing push to layer onto the Net architectures that facilitate identification and tracking The technologies are many I describe one technology extensively in my book the emergence of digital certificates that will function as digital IDs But there are any number of other examples that make very same point emerging architectures that make tracking and identification easier Think about cookies Here s an architecture in the sense I mean the term that was added to the Web by an innovation of Netscape Corporation That innovation would Netscape argued make it easier for servers to track customers When you contact a site the site can deposit an entry in your cookie file that will make it possible for that site to gather data about you in the future That change stripped away a certain amount of anonymity on the Net Now servers could watch where you browse they could watch pages you skip to they could know something they didn t before And all this because of a change in the architecture The point is not that cookies do no good I love the fact that Amazon knows who I am and can recommend books to me when I come to their home page they ve yet to recommend my book to me but I m sure they ll get around to that soon enough But the point is that the freedom that there was has been changed by a change in the architecture Sites now get data for free because the architecture makes it possible But more important changes are just around the corner For example One of the fundamental architectural principles of the original Internet was the principle of end to end First described by network architects Jerome Saltzer David P Reed and David Clark end to end means that you keep the network stupid and build intelligence at the ends in the applications or the users One consequence of this design was that the network could not discriminate So long as you followed the basic Internet protocols the network would carry your traffic And one consequence of this consequence of non discrimination was that new applications could be brought to the Net even if they displaced the dominant existing application No one was in a position to discriminate against a new entrant because the Net was architected to disable discrimination Enter broadband cable at least under the architecture initially proposed by AT T After acquiring as many cable companies as it could AT T and its affiliates are now converting the cable system so that it can carry the Internet But they are architecting this network very differently from how the original Internet was architected They are architecting it so that the network owner gets to choose the Internet service provider that you get your broadband Internet service from And because the architecture allows AT T to choose it allows AT T to control how its network gets used If it doesn t want you to stream video through your computer a possible future with broadband because that competes with streaming video to your television set the past with cable it now has the power to discriminate And it has that power because its network has been architected to give it that power It has been architected that is to be different from the principle of non discrimination in the original Net Now these are not issues that ivory tower libertarians would ignore Indeed I can imagine as I write this Richard chafing to intervene and to say that libertarianism has lots to say to these problems I was Richard s colleague for six years and student for one I know his chafing very well The libertarian would talk about externalities and about minimum regulation to avoid externalities and about the value of common carriers and the like But cyber libertarians say something different They have been slow to defend the principles of the initial architecture against the changes that commerce would impose on that architecture They have been slow because they have been slow to see how the Net is changing And more important slow to see how much of the freedom they enjoy comes not just from the absence of government but also from a constitution of freedom built into the architecture of the Net The argument of my book is that we ought to pay attention to this constitution and to the freedoms that this initial architecture gave us And that we ought to pay attention to the influences that are changing this architecture and therefore changing this freedom You wouldn t disagree with that would you Richard
