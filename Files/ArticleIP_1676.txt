 Leak Soup The Washington Post s publication of President Clinton s deposition in the Paula Jones case is Issue 1 as the commentariat all but ignore other news Pundits can only cover one story and chew gum at the same time chortles Jack Germond Inside Washington Who leaked the pundits ask Washington wags are heavy betting that the president is the source says Juan Williams Fox News Sunday Evan Thomas Inside Washington notes that pre emptive leaking of damaging information is SOP for the Clinton White House The widely cited rationale for a White House leak is to publicize a road map Paul Gigot Fox News Sunday or master script Charles Krauthammer Inside Washington for future witnesses not wishing to contradict the president s sworn deposition Subtle manipulation of the press is what smart lawyers do says Thomas But there are other better ways of transmitting the official White House line contend Ann McDaniel CBS s Face the Nation and George Stephanopoulos ABC s This Week Stephanopoulos argues that the White House would not needlessly admit the existence of presidential love gifts thereby undermining the Story of the Seventh Commandment that it is peddling Nina

Jordan s the helping Monica idea came via Currie but it was originally Clinton s Liasson Fox News Sunday Or by the deposition to be released by Jones lawyers Bill Kristol This Week Or by Kathleen Willey s testimony that Clinton placed her hand on his erect but clothed penis Fred Barnes McLaughlin Group Or by Starr s star witness former Arkansas Gov Jim Tucker a convicted felon William Safire NBC s Meet the Press Robert Novak CNN s Capital Gang Issue 2 is those stupid Republicans Newt Gingrich s disastrous championship of a Puerto Rican statehood bill is ridiculed Almost no Republican voted for it in the House and Trent Lott has banned the measure from the Senate All agree that the Republican leadership was suckered into supporting it by high pressure lobbying and poll results mistakenly believing that this was the way to win Hispanic voters George Will This Week demands to know why the GOP is so full of fear and trembling Many opine that the Republicans have become impotent but no one can explain why this is so Also decide the commentariat the GOP doesn t have a good presidential candidate for 2000 Billion Dollar Bill Gates appearance before Congress is Issue 3 Fred Barnes Pat Buchanan McLaughlin Group and Krauthammer side with Gates government regulation can only bring grief Eleanor Clift McLaughlin Group applauds regulatory vigilance Johnny Chung s

weekend During a NewsHour discussion of Vernon Jordan s testimony Shields comes out with the bizarrely malapropos comment that Vernon Jordan s elocutionary style reminds him of nothing more than
