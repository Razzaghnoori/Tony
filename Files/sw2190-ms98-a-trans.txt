 oh go ahead i i am glad to talk to an expert i always wanted to know who an expert was oh well i m not an expert i just had a little i ve i ve seen a little pollution in my time it s uh uh the the chemicals we were dealing with were uh a Raid repellent and uh that was really quite dangerous i m not certain that that was that s that s really a pollution issue i think pollution issue is is uh is is the argument over over people catching uh things like uh respiratory disease uh well there there s two things uh the one i m interested the most i guess myself uh would be the the Freons i mean for air conditioning the one i guess that s the one i m most curious about is how they re going to replace the Freons in air conditioning that seemed to be the biggest surprise to me and whether when they replace it you know they re going to really come up with something that is not just as bad well the you know that that s another arguable issue and i i ve seen the uh uh uh assuming you can buy into global warming i yeah yeah i uh was uh you know where they were all concerned about that but that that it seems to be well did you see Carl Sagan on Sixty Minutes on uh when he was talking about when if if the if the war started in in Kuwait and they d set those uh all the no i heard about it though uh it was it was it was interesting but uh i m just curious what he has to say now that they ve got them all lit was that before i didn t see it was that before they actually did that or it was what yes and his argument was uh was that that you would see a uh a year with no summer which actually happened and it it actually yes it actually happened uh because of that you know it was a volcano erupted and it was high enough up but uh they had some people from the national meteorological center i think it was the which is the national anyway research people and they said that the uh that the pollution would not go high enough and it s it s going to be interesting to see if Carl Sagan and his billions and billions of stars may have once made a mistake but right the the the the the the general the opinion among among the uh meteorologists at uh i m uh member of the American Meteorological Society and are you don t you don t work at TI yeah i do oh okay but i m uh i only i do that in my formalize where do you work in research or no i m a planner a production planner oh okay but i i i m in the active reserves as a weatherman so no okay yeah uh i i keep up from time to time but what the the argument is that uh that uh maybe there isn t global warming and maybe there is but um if there is uh we probably could do something about it now and if there isn t if there isn t and we do some the right things i think how do you feel about about all this smog and mess stuff on cars yeah uh well i m kind of a car buff myself i was going to ask you another question but uh i i ll do that in a minute i i think that the changing you know from leaded fuel was a tremendous advantage well do you have an older car you know not not using no no no i i have been working on an older car but it to yeah really oh i m a car buff too we ought to work talk about that one day uh uh well i m restoring one i think you can use the you can use high you know the ninety two percent uh ninety two octane i don t think you ll have any trouble i m not having any problem it s a seventy oh yeah yeah and uh no i i think uh i uh work on my own cars and uh i don t think that s a problem i thought i m saying i was glad to get rid of leaded gasoline but did you have another question you said you had another question uh oh yeah i the same thing about the war uh or related to the war on i was watching CNN and i cannot remember what station it was what did you see the advertisements uh when they talked about nuclear war what that would have been like in changing the atmosphere it is so scary that i hope that every one of the government officials saw that because it was just total disaster you know did you see any of those uh i it was yeah no i didn t see that that i know that the uh that s it must have been channel thirteen i don t recall although i thought it was on CNN oh i well that they talked nuclear winner and and i suppose that s that s the ultimate uh pollution problem it was a somewhat of a commercial because it came i saw it regularly and it showed that and it was really devastating and it would uh well how much ash would fall and and how it would essentially literally destroy the world you know well it s interesting that the Chernobyl accident uh actually um because the circulation budget as high as it went um covered a a fairly remarkable amount they did some tracers and they i i think it s drawn in uh i think gets in there because i can t think of the other trace but i saw a a presentation on on that and they it went quite a long ways but i i i guess i can be a little sympathetic but you know there s some argument that in in in the blue grass of Kentucky that the Smoky Mountains that that s the uh the pine trees giving off pollution and oh really yeah there there s probably a lot of natural things uh but the but when you see when you get up in the morning in in Dallas and and see all that haze from west Texas is that is that pollution yeah uh it i guess it s got to be really i don t know i don t know if it s air pollution it s uh it s dust pollution whether it s natural or not i don t know well it that s the thing is that i think i think Dallas really does have a problem in this the idea if we could get some cleaner fuel burning fuel the problem is is it s like Los Angeles people don t people don t want to use mass transit so yeah oh yeah well i live in Arlington and there there there are no buses i mean there there is the only school bus the only buses you see are school buses so but who wants to who wants to um ride a bus well i know it it s uh you know the car is we have this big romance with the car but uh i think people are would be interested if you had one i mean well my boss drives forty miles one way each day yeah and one of the guys that works with me drives forty five miles yeah and and they don t think it well i guess they do think something of it but um not enough to you know you consider how much um but then you get into all these issues of of whether it it s the types of pollution and what it s doing to your lungs and are we going to die of of respiratory so we all move out of the out of the yeah out of downtown so we get away from the the smog my my wife grew up in southern California and they moved out to the valley before Los Angeles uh when when the valley was clean yeah and now the valley is not and so people move out one more valley and well you said you were car buff uh i think that uh all of us could use one electric car right now i mean today because i think uh yes yes you said people drive forty miles and fifty whatever yeah when you go to trips and all you can have one gasoline car but i think we all could in a family say have an electric car where my one of my daughters or my wife my wife she could use one now if they had one you know well do you know because they she don t even she doesn t put fifty miles a day on the car General Motors apparently has one that they re they re testing i think it s no it s alcohol vehicles that they re testing almost no no you re right i i have seen them but uh they have a battery car but they uh i went to the auto show this past week and they did not endorse now that i think of it suppose and i was so interested in the auto show i didn t think to ask anybody there were no electric cars i was surprised but now that you just mentioned that huh well the Road and Track was talking about that this apparently General Motors has some uh they apparently think they re close yeah i i think uh there could be a lot of people i think people close this is really we re were nine years away or less i guess from the next century and i think well there there s still a lot of research i was over in in the research lab a couple i guess it s been about a month ago and saw this there have been research it was a little light that says solar solar powered research yeah they ve got a they ve got a area over in the SE building too which is uh but it s a solar uh it s for uh they got got some money from a power company and it s probably more generating power for you know uh electricity a hundred and twenty volt or whatever yeah well do you work in that C building no i m actually in the south building but uh oh well i m at i was uh i m the facility so i ve been in all most of the buildings anyway oh well i m in i m in the C building been there for all my life oh yeah well the the solar area is right right around from the auditorium now and they they ve got several different uh areas where they re called solar lab huh it s right there on the first floor you ought to walk by there well that s been a i know the focal plain array is they were taking space to for a long time yeah but the solar project you know TI s been into it for years and i guess it s just not uh economical yet because of the other fuels well the problem is that gas at a dollar a a gallon you know who wants to yeah i mean we want to not pollute but uh at a dollar a gallon uh it s hard to beat the amount of energy you get from yeah i ve seen some i think then again i m surprised now i didn t think they d asked anybody when i was in the auto show there was nothing uh and there was no place for air pollution or companies or anyone there it was just pure automobiles well i thought i saw an ad for Volkswagen that had an alcohol there they had one with spots on it and something i didn t go but it was it was showing they i mean uh hum i didn t see did you go an article no i didn t i didn t go so i wish oh i i was uh quite impressed with all the cars you know the engines are so much smaller now and everything and they re they all have brand new engines even General Motors uh very few only the Caprice and them and the Cadillac had eight uh the old V8s they re all brand new engines uh of course they re burning gasoline of course they ve done a lot now and uh whether you know that s one way you know uh uh for on air pollution i i i don t know if the automobiles are the biggest contributor or not really they ve got catalytic converters everyone seem to have gone to that whether they last uh and do a good job and now that they the inspection systems are analyzing that uh well what do you think if you re in that you know if you re concerned about that i mean if you re you re you re knowledgeable on that well there well they uh it s interesting though because my cars are older and so i didn t have to if you live in Dallas County you have to have your have to have it checked and it s great i had a friend with a Fiero that uh they tried and tried and tried and had all kinds of terrible getting that pinned and so apparently
