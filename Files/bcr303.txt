 Introduction In recent years the incidence of breast cancer has become one of the most rapidly increaing among malignant tumours With progress in understanding of the nature of breast cancer diagnosis and treatments have been improved Chemotherapy has become more and more important and is considered to be a major treatment to avoid the recurrence of cancer after surgery 1 Although the remission rate is higher in previously untreated patients relapse occurs soon It has been reported that most initially responsive patients acquire a multidrug resistance MDR phenotype Some other patients show MDR even in their first treatment In metastatic breast cancer the development of a MDR phenotype is primarily responsible for insensitivity to a new drug 2 Attention has been focused recently on the study of the agents for reversing MDR Although hundreds of compounds have been found in vitro to be able to modulate the MDR phenotype their clinical application was limited owing to high toxicity in vivo The key to the clinical use of reversal agents therefore lies in searching for agents with low toxicity and high reversal activity 3 In the past many progestogen compounds such as MG and medroxyprogesterone have been shown to have reversal effects in vitro 4 5 6 7 Unfortunately the effective concentration to reverse drug resistance in vivo is very difficult to achieve 8 Nomegestrol NOM a derivative of megestrol MG has very low toxicity There is almost no incidence of liver lesions pituitory inhibiting activity cortisol like activity or oestrogen like activity which are common in other progestogen compounds 9 NOM might therefore be suitable for clinical use In many previous studies on MDR reversal by compounds related to NOM attention has been paid to the modulation of P glycoprotein P gp function The reversal mechanism consists of for example binding directly to P gp inhibiting the transport function of drug efflux increasing the intracellular accumulation of the drug and changing lipid mobility in the plasma membrane 4 10 11 12 However different compounds have different mechanisms No results on the reversal effect of NOM or on its mechanism were available The present study was directed to the reversal activity of NOM on MDR in adriamycin ADR resistant MCF7 ADR cells and to compare NOM with classic reversal agents verapamil VRP tamoxifen TAM droloxifene DRO and MG A possible reversal mechanism was explored by studying the cell cycle intracellular drug accumulation and the expression of mRNA and proteins of MDR1 glutathione S transferase Pi GST MDR related protein MRP and topoisomerase II TopoII Materials and methods Cell line and cell culture The cell lines MCF7 WT ADR sensitive and MCF7 ADR were used in this study they were obtained from NCI 13 and maintained in Dulbecco s modified Eagle s medium incubated at 37 C in 5 CO 2 95 air at high humidity and passaged every 2 3 days Cells were digested with mixture of 0 025

ester from Pharmaceutical College Shanghai Medical University and other reversal agents including MG TAM DRO a gift from Professor Xia Peng and VRP Shanghai Hualian Pharmaceutical Co Ltd MTT assays were performed as follows 14 MCF7 WT and MCF7 ADR cells were each harvested with 0 05 trypsin EDTA and counted Cell lines were seeded into 96 well plates at 10 4viable cells per well and left to attach to the plate for 24 h After 24 h the medium was changed to one containing or lacking test reversal agents or ADR The final volume was 200 l per well The medium was removed after 72 h of incubation Other medium containing 0 5 mg ml MTT Sigma was added to each well in a volume of 200 l and incubated for 4 h The medium was then removed and 180 l of dimethyl sulphoxide Sigma was added to each well for half an hour at room temperature A 96 well microtitre plate reader Dynatech Chantilly VA USA was used to determine A 570 The mean concentration in each set of three wells was measured To avoid interference by the red fluorescence of ADR concentrations above 8 M a blank well containing the corresponding ADR concentration without MTT was set up and subtracted from the test well absorbance The absorbance of untreated controls was taken as 100 survival and the percentage inhibition was calculated as cell survival rate 100 T B U B and growth inhibition 100 cell survival rate where T treated is the absorbance of drug treated cells U untreated is the absorbance of untreated cells and B blank is the absorbance in the absence of both drug and MTT IC 50 values were determined graphically from relative survival curves The fold reversal was calculated as IC 50 for ADR IC 50 for ADR plus reversal agents Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction RT PCR

against P gp JSB 1 was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim Biochemica monoclonal antibodies against GST and TopoII were purchased from Dako Corporation and Neomarker respectively In brief after three washes with phosphate buffered saline PBS fixed cells in each smear were layered with the primary antibody against P gp 1 20 dilution GST 1 25 dilution and TopoII 1 50 dilution and incubated overnight a minimum of 18 h After three washes with PBS the cells were incubated with secondary antibody mixture of anti mouse Ig 1 200 dilution Huamei BG Co Ltd Shanghai China for 2 h at room temperature The cells were washed as before and then incubated with ABC complex 1 100 dilution Huamei BG Co Ltd for 1 h at room temperature After being washed cells were developed in 0 04 3 3 diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride dihydrate Sigma with 0 02 H 2 O 2 in PBS for 15 30 min Cells were washed again with PBS and counterstained with haematoxylin In each assay five categories of staining were observed as defined previously 17 In brief we first determined the staining grade I 0 no staining 1 pale yellow 2 brown yellow 3 brownish Then we calculated the grade II according to the ratio of positive

was determined as follows total grade 0 negative 1 3 feeble positive 4 or 5 weak positive 6 or 7 moderate positive more than 7 strong positive ADR accumulation Accumulation of ADR was monitored using a standard procedure by incubating MCF7 ADR cells 5 10 5 ml for 2 h at 37 C in the presence of ADR 10 M alone or in combination with NOM 20 10 or 5 M Cells were then harvested and washed twice with cold 0 C PBS then placed in ice water to block the reaction until analysis After half an hour the fluorescence intensity of cells 10 4 ml was determined by flow cytometry FCM FAC SCalibar Becton Dickinson San Jose CA USA Cell cycle analysis Cells were plated at 2 10 5 ml in specific medium supplemented as above After 24 h the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing ADR alone or in combination with NOM 20 M The cells were harvested after 48 h and washed twice with PBS then fixed with 70 v v ethanol The sample was concentrated by removing ethanol and treated with 1 v v Triton X 100 and 0 01 RNase for 10 min Staining of cellular DNA was performed with 0 05 propidium iodide for 20 min at 4 C FCM analysis was performed by acquiring a minimum of 2 10 5nuclei Cell cycle analysis was performed with the MultiCycle software package Phoenix San Diego CA USA Statistical analysis Levels of statistical significance were evaluated with data from at least three independent experiments by using Student s t test P 0 05 was considered statistically significant Results Enhancement of chemosensitivity in treated cells Cytotoxicity was expressed as the percentage growth inhibition compared with untreated control cells MTT assays showed that 1 5 ethanol or 20 M NOM and other various reversal agents showed no toxicity towards the two cell lines In MCF7 ADR cells treated with NOM 5 M for 10 days the cell growth rate was normal compared with control cells as judged by staining with trypan blue The results showed that 20 10 and 5 M NOM significantly increased the sensitivity of MCF7 ADR cells to ADR the degrees of reversal being 21 fold 12 fold and 8 fold respectively Fig 1b The reversal activity of 20 10 and 5 M NOM was markedly stronger than that of the same concentration of DRO and MG Fig 2 and was similar to that of the classic agents VRP and TAM In MCF7 WT cells neither NOM nor other reversal compounds increased chemosensitivity to ADR Table 2 MDR related gene expression in NOM treated cells MDR1 and GST mRNA expression After treatment with 5 M NOM the MDR1 and GST expression levels of MCF7 ADR cells were modulated in a time dependent manner The expression of both mRNA species began to decrease on the second day P 0 05 and P 0 01 respectively and reached the lowest level on the third day both P 0 01 The expression level began to rise as detected on the fifth day P 0 05 and P 0 05 respectively and reached a level close to that of untreated controls on the tenth day Fig 3 Table 3 MRP and TopoII mRNA expression After treatment with NOM the MRP mRNA expression level of MCF7 ADR cells tended to decrease on the second day with no statistical significance No significant change was found in TopoII expression level when measured on the second third fifth and tenth days after treatment in comparison with the control No significant changes in MRP and TopoII mRNA expression levels were found in MCF7 WT cells Table 3 Expression of P gp GST and TopoII proteins MCF7 ADR cells had high expression levels of P gp and GST proteins and a moderate expression level of TopoII protein MCF7 WT cells expressed a high level of TopoII only P gp and GST protein expression were undetectable After treatment with NOM the expression levels of P gp and GST in MCF7 ADR cells gradually declined the lowest level being on the third day on the fifth day their expression levels began to rise No marked difference whose TopoII protein expression was found before and after NOM treatment in either MCF7 ADR or MCF7 WT cells The effects of NOM on the expression of drug resistance protein were similar to those of NOM on mRNA expression Figs 4and 5 ADR accumulation and cell cycle changes in NOM treated cells The accumulation of ADR in MCF7 ADR cells was much less than in MCF7 WT cells Each cell line was treated with 20 10 and 5 M NOM Marked increases in intracellular ADR accumulation were found in MCF7 ADR cells the increases being 2 7 fold 2 3 fold and 1 5 fold respectively However NOM did not increase ADR accumulation in MCF7 WT cells Fig 6 FCM analysis was performed in MCF7 ADR cells treated for 48 h with ADR alone or in combination with 20 M NOM The results showed that when the ADR concentration was increased from 5 M to 40 M only a small increase in arrested cells at the G 2 M phase was found in MCF7 ADR cells treated with ADR alone However when ADR was used in combination with 20 M NOM a marked arrest was seen NOM alone failed to induce any change in the cell cycle Fig 7and Table 4 Discussion The overexpression of P gp in tumour cell membrane is considered to be the major mechanism of MDR P gp is able to pump various anticancer drugs out of cells thus resulting in a low intracellular drug concentration that is insufficient to kill tumour cells 18 To use compounds with low toxicity or with none at all to bind P gp and block its transport function is the most common method of reversing MDR 19 Progesterone and MG belong to the progestogen group Although progesterone is not a substrate for P gp it can directly bind to P gp and block the transport of drug efflux 20 MG is a strong reversal agent its capacity to increase intracellular accumulation of vincristine is 2 3 fold that of progesterone 6 Previous results have shown that a daily dose of 800 mg MG resulted in a plasma concentration of 2 M 21 however to reverse MDR 5 M is necessary in theory Because high doses of MG induce vomiting oedema dizziness and androgen like side effects the ideal effective concentration is difficult to obtain in vivo Therefore the search for new drugs with low toxicity is in progress to meet an urgent need for clinical applications NOM is a progestogen compound used in family planning In recent years biological activities other than contraception have been found 22 Animal experiments have demonstrated that NOM has almost no toxicity Its full chemical name is 3 20 diketo 6 methyl 17 hydroxy 19 norpregna 4 6 diene 9 The present study has demonstrated that NOM significantly sensitizes the MCF7 ADR cell line to ADR in a concentration dependent manner but has no similar effect on MCF7 WT cells The reversal effects of 20 10 and 5 M NOM were 21 fold 12 fold and 8 fold respectively The enhancement of chemosensitivity to ADR by NOM was stronger than that by MG a precursor of NOM at corresponding concentrations P 0 05 The reversal effect of NOM was similar to that of VRP which is a classical reversal agent with a high reversal activity NOM therefore also has a strong reversal activity Both TAM and DRO are anti oestrogen agents TAM is a first line drug used in endocrinotherapy for breast cancer Anti oestrogens can inhibit P gp function by binding it 23 In our study the effect of NOM was significantly greater than that of DRO The development of MCF7 ADR cells was induced by treating MCF7 WT with ADR Its MDR phenotype is not altered after 3 months of serial passaging in drug free medium 24 25 MCF7 ADR cells have been demonstrated to overexpress MDR1 P gp as well as the GST and MRP genes They are therefore good cell models for studying the effect of NOM on breast cancer MDR Semiquantitative RT PCR analysis is a sensitive and specific method 26 27 A variety of methods using either quantitative or semequantitative RT PCR have been used to determine relative initial target mRNA levels in samples However in all of these methods undefined variations in amplification complicated the interpretation of results Most investigators use internal amplification standards in an attempt to correct for variations between tubes In the present study as in many other studies we chose to use endogenous standards The reference mRNA and target mRNA are usually processed together throughout the experiments from RNA extraction until PCR amplification This tends to minimize differences in RNA yields between samples It has been considered that the overexpression of MDR1 P gp is a major mechanism of MDR in tumour cells 28 A few studies have reported that some reversal agents can inhibit MDR1 P gp expression Stein et al 29 have found that cytokines such as interleukin 2 interferon and tumour necrosis factor were capable of decreasing the expression of MDR1 mRNA in the colon carcinoma cell lines HCT15 and HCT16 Liu et al 30 treated MCF7 ADR cells with the Chinese herb Fructus psoraleae for 48 h and found that P gp expression became undetectable However no results on whether or not progestogen can modulate the expression of MDR1 P gp have been reported The present study has demonstrated that NOM significantly inhibited MDR1 P gp expression on the third day after treatment The MDR mRNA expression level was very low and that of P gp almost ceased It is worthy to note that on the fifth day after NOM treatment the expression of MDR1 P gp began to increase again This phenomenon was also observed when treating colon carcinoma cell line with cytokines 29 Some studies have also found that P gp antagonists such as VRP cyclosporin A and reserpine could induce MDR1 P gp expression in the colon carcinoma cell line LS180 Ad50 31 32 A few papers have reported MDR1 expression after treatment with progesterone Lee et al 33 showed that progesterone interacted with P gp inducing its expression in the granulose cell in preovulatory follicles to modulate steroid efflux Our results show that NOM modulated the expression of MDR1 in a time dependent manner Over 5 days of treatment with NOM MDR1 expression became elevated From these findings it seems that NOM and other progestogen compounds show an effect of upregulated MDR1 expression in long term treatment It is unclear how NOM effects this time dependent modulation of the expression of MDR1 P gp If a similar modulation of the MDR phenotype occurs in vivo then the duration of treatment with NOM becomes important It will be of prime importance to verify the time course for modulation by reversal agents and to design appropriate clinical trials In investigating the P gp induced MDR phenotype the overexpression of some non P gp MDR related proteins have been demonstrated These proteins are important in drug resistance in some tumour cell lines 34 35 We also observed the expression of the non P gp MDR related genes GST TopoII and MRP We found that NOM markedly decreased the level of expression of GST mRNA and protein with a time course similar to that of MDR1 P gp The results suggest that NOM possibly acts as a reversal agent of GST MRP belongs to the superfamily of ATP binding cassette protein transporters Like P gp MRP is located in the plasma membrane of resistant tumour cells however the mechanism of MRP might be fundamentally different from that of P gp The extrusion of several drugs by MRP requires glutathione MRP might be identical to the GS X pump 36 MRP related MDR was not reversed by classic reversal agents of P gp such as VRP and cyclosporin A 37 38 39 Our results suggest that NOM cannot modulate MRP gene expression either TopoII as a kind of nuclease is important in the processes of DNA metabolism such as transcription replication and chromosome partitioning during cell division TopoII is present mainly in the S phase 40 TopoII in tumour cells is a target enzyme of some anticancer agents If TopoII activity decreases or a TopoII gene mutation develops TopoII related MDR results 41 42 Our results showed that TopoII expression in MCF7 ADR cells was weaker than in MCF7 WT cells Because TopoII is a target enzyme of ADR MDR to ADR in MCF7 ADR cells might to some extent be related to TopoII However no change in TopoII gene expression level was detected in NOM treated MCF7 ADR cells indicating that the reversal effect of NOM on MDR in MCF7 ADR cells cannot result from modulating the gene expression of TopoII P gp belongs to the ATP dependent transporters It acts as a pump or hydrophobic vacuum cleaner effectively increasing drug efflux and decreasing drug influx 43 Many studies have demonstrated that progestogen compounds directly bind P gp and block the function of the pump efflux 10 44 We studied the effect of NOM on intracellular ADR accumulation in MCF7 ADR cells by using FCM assays ADR can emit fluorescence its intensity represents its accumulation 25 After 2 h of treatment with NOM the intracellular fluorescence intensity of ADR was markedly enhanced suggesting that NOM directly inhibits the P gp pump efflux function in the same way as other progestogen compounds do It has been reported that ADR induces dose dependent G 2 M arrest and that cells in this phase are particularly sensitive to chemical drugs 45 Cell cycle DNA content assays by FCM suggest that NOM enhances the blocking activity of ADR on the cell cycle This enhancement of blocking activity might be partly responsible for the reversal effect of NOM In brief our results indicate that in MCF7 ADR cells NOM can significantly sensitize their chemosensitivity to ADR down regulate MDR1 P gp and GST expression levels in time dependent manner markedly increase intracellular ADR accumulation and enhance the cell cycle blocking activity of ADR At present although a variety of agents inhibit the function of P gp in vitro their clinical use is also limited by the toxicity associated with the doses required to reverse MDR Because NOM can be safely administered at high doses it might be a good candidate for an MDR reversal agent in clinics Abbreviations ADR adriamycin DRO droloxifen GST glutathione S transferase Pi MDR multidrug resistance MG megestrol MRP MDR related protein MTT 3 4 5
