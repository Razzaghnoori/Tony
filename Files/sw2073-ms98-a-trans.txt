 okay i don t know which end do we push but okay okay well um let s see i i think uh there s a lot of people that don t vote because they don t really think their their uh opinion is going to be heard and you know there s such a small voice and such a huge number of people in the United States and that you know their votes votes not going to make that much difference and whether you vote for one person or the other person the issues is what you know what you believe in and that person is going to have a lot of uh since there s so many issues this one person can believe a lot of different ways on all of them so right it d be really difficult to have that one person perfect person that believed exactly what you believed yeah that s true you know a lot of people uh uh i think the that it ends up the people that uh vote every time uh elections come around are more the the polly uh the party type followers the guys that uh you know follow the party lines you know and they you know just go in and if they re Republican they vote Republican vote Republican every year you know and uh the people that are independent hum yeah you know are the ones that don t uh don t really uh show up every year because they can t seem to to decide which are the good aspects and which are the bad aspects of a candidate right yeah that s good yeah yeah i always thought it was back when Anderson was running i was hoping that things would change and he d actually get elected and party politics would start going down the tubes but that didn t work yeah yeah there s uh a lot of extremes on the parties too with the you know the real uh far side of the Democrats they re real liberal now to where probably fifty or a hundred years ago um the Democrat party being liberal like they are now you know would never be thought of it would be the other way that the Republicans were real liberal minded as far as like uh moral standings and those kinds of things um hum but yeah yeah that s uh and and then people always get upset about it too because you know every year the the the politicians are the ones that are usually pushing for more people to vote they they each think that uh if more people vote they ll get more votes um hum i m always amazed at that that each candidate thinks it s going to be the people that come out that will vote for him you know yeah yeah that s that s true i think in uh the Texas governor election i think more people turned out to vote against somebody than for somebody this time yeah well that uh that s something i i know that there s certain issues that can really motivate people because we live in a predominately predominately predominately Catholic type area oh really and when things start uh when when abortion comes on the issues then people just get all inspirational inspired you know and uh right still on the other hand we re also uh this particular community is a Catholic community but uh uh down in DC where where things are a little bit different uh um hum you know it s it s women s rights and the and and that sort of movement and so it s uh quite the opposite so elections start getting very uh the elections where they have that topic seem to be a little bit better attended than some of the other ones yeah that s true and uh but uh yeah that s true that the different places in America that uh you know different issues would be a lot more important than say in another place yeah i can understand why why some of the the rural areas the voter turnout isn t as much because it does seem sometimes like the lobbyists in DC are like controlling things for the the Midwest and uh it doesn t matter who they put in office they re going to fall subject to uh um hum the pressure that lobbyists can put right yeah and it s uh well real true that uh you you know they ll say one thing to get elected and then once they do get elected they don t have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised you know beforehand right you know maybe it just wasn t possible at all in the first place you know like the no new taxes thing you know that s uh with the economy going the way it is and everything that was nearly ridiculous thing to yeah even try to do yeah well i don t think he s going to have to worry about that next year i think he can probably raise taxes and still get elected right uh right after the war uh huh that really uh unfortunately that ll probably even drop lower the voters turn down even more uh turnout even more because more Democrats will think that they don t have a shot so they won t even bother turning out uh that s true yeah they ll just say oh well you know the Republicans have this election we ll see you in four years right yeah uh but yeah i hope some of the local well that s what they they keep saying that it seems like people with it with old fashioned values are the ones that aren t turning out at the at the booths they they say that these older voters that uh you know they they feel like the kids are running the the country so they they don t come out turn out to vote and they re the ones that uh you know really know what s going on have the experience and have seen you know how politicians can you know screw up or whatever um hum but i know my grandmother hasn t voted in years right that s right you know neither has mine as a matter of fact and uh that s true they i think they look at it as well everybody the majority of the people think this way when that s not necessarily true because you know that s what the media says well the majority believes this way so uh they don t even bother turning out to vote to express their uh opinions um hum so that s that s true yeah wonder if they re going to take into account with this commutiv uh this computerized conversation that there s little children you know bouncing in your knee the whole time your talking yeah do you hear the dogs in the background here okay they re no i can t hear them the children next door just opened the fence and they went off yeah but anyway that s i guess we ve uh talked long enough and that was sort of interesting what part of the country are you from oh yeah yeah uh Washington DC um hum are you really wow this is i m in from this is Dallas where i m at the outskirts of Dallas oh okay well i figured with Texas Instruments they d probably have a few uh Texans on the line now and then yeah do do you work for TI in any way no huh uh wow how did you how did they get you or uh basically they they went through engineering companies and uh we re communications i work i work in a com munications company oh oh okay right i work for TI so we saw it on the uh the TV News one day and i thought wow that might be interesting yeah yeah we sort of different yeah they called me at uh ten o clock one night that was very strange well yeah i guess they were doing it Eastern Standard Time i was like well i don t know how long it takes whether it takes five minutes or twenty minutes so i yeah Central Standard Time s what they re doing it by yeah yeah i still haven t figured out what the zero through six days which day is which yet but i didn t study it that hard so maybe i ll figure it out um hum but anyway it was nice to talk to you and uh sort of meet you and that was an interesting topic okay yeah okay well if you re ever in uh DC can look up Wayne Sherman you ll say oh yeah talked to that guy okay okay i m i m Kyle Hunt too if you ever come to to Dallas area well we live right by the airport oh okay yeah yeah yeah so do we oh okay yeah right next to Dulles all right well i ll talk to you later bye bye yeah okay bye
