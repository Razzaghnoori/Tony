 Introduction Enumeration of peripheral blood PB leukemic cells in mycosis fungoides MF S zary syndrome SS can be difficult by morphological methods This is due to difficulties in unequivocally distinguishing neoplastic cells from reactive lymphocytes on standard Wright Giemsa stained PB smears Electron microscopic evaluation of blood samples is impractical for routine use Therefore most centers have relied on flow cytometric evaluation of such specimens Flow cytometric abnormalities in MF SS that have been correlated with the presence of tumor cells include increased populations of CD4 positive and or CD7 negative T cells 1 2 3 We have recently shown that increases in CD4 positive CD26 negative T cell populations are highly associated with the presence of tumor cells in MF SS 4 Another approach to flow cytometric detection of tumor cells has been the identification of phenotypically aberrant populations that express different amounts of cell surface proteins than normal T cell populations Such stable abnormal expression levels of pan T cell markers is a common feature of T cell tumors 5 We sought to identify the frequency of such abnormalities in MF SS in PB and to determine whether these immunophenotypic aberrancies are stable over the course of treatment We report that alterations in expression of multiple T cell markers as detected by flow cytometry are an easily identifiable and stable feature of nearly all cases of MF SS Such immunophenotypic aberrancies can be used to quantify tumor cells from a patient over the course of the disease Methods Patient samples We screened all PB smears from patients referred to our hospital between January 1999 and June 2002 who had a diagnosis of cutaneous atypical lymphoid infiltrate MF or SS and a had a full PB flow cytometry panel Cases were considered morphologically positive if they contained at least 1 tumor cells by manual differential We also included subsequent involved PB samples from these patients Most of the PB smears were reviewed by a single hematopathologist DJ to ensure relatively uniform criteria in counting of tumor cells S zary tumor cells were defined as either those with markedly convoluted nuclear contours or those that were enlarged and had prominent nucleoli Diagnoses were based on criteria outlined in the updated World Health Organization classification 6 Patients were diagnosed to have MF if PB involvement occurred subsequent to patch plaque cutaneous T cell lymphoma or SS if the presenting features included an erythrodermic rash with 500 L PB tumor cells All studies were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and followed a laboratory protocol approved by our institutional review board Flow cytometry We utilized a standard T cell antigen panel to analyze the 100 PB samples from the 44 patients 2 3 or 4 color flow cytometric analysis was performed on all samples following a standard red cell lysis method using mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against CD45 clone 2D1 peridin chlorophyll a protein PerCP conjugated as well as various combinations of CD26 fluorescien isothiocyanate FITC conjugated CD3 SK7 FITC or phycoerythrin PE CD4 SK3 PE CD7 4H9 FITC CD8 SK1 FITC or PE CD19 SJ25C1 FITC and CD26 L272 FITC In addition CD2 S5 2 FITC CD5 L17F12 PE and T cell receptor T10B9 FITC or PE were done in a subset of cases All antibodies were from BD Biosciences San Jose CA and analysis was performed using FACScan or FACScaliber cytometers BD For each antibody negative staining levels were set by comparison to an isotype matched control In a subset of 23 cases cluster analysis using Paint a gate software BD was done to correlate the size of the different lymphocyte populations with the phenotypically aberrant T cell clusters Aberrant T cell populations were defined as discrete immunophenotypic clusters representing a tight cluster of 0 5 or more of analyzed events exhibiting change in levels of expression of T cell antigens relative to an internal immunophenotypically normal T cell population or relative to expected expression of T cell associated antigens As a control group for variations in T cell markers in non neoplastic T cell populations we used the flow cytometry results from 100 patients with MF or cutaneous atypical T cell infiltrates whose PB smears did not show identifiable tumor cells and 10 samples from control patients without any evidence of malignancy or chronic disease The details of these PB cases were previously summarized 4 We have previously shown high levels of correlation between the presence of an abnormal T cell population identified by this flow cytometry panel and the presence of morphologically identifiable tumor cells on examination of the smear 4 The Kruskal Wallis test and Spearman s rank correlation test were used to compare the association of phenotypic aberrancy between different markers Statistical significance was defined as 0 05 Results Immunophenotypic aberrancy of common T cell markers is present in nearly all cases of MF SS In 41 of 44 MF SS patients 93 there was a discrete phenotypically abnormal population s identified by flow cytometric analysis that correlated with the presence of morphologically identifiable tumor cells on PB smear In a group of 100 SS MF patients with morphologically uninvolved PB smears flow cytometric analysis identified a phenotypically abnormal CD4 T cell population in only 2 cases These abnormal populations detected only by flow cytometry comprised 1 and 2 of total white blood cells and were discrete CD4 dim CD26 negative T cell populations Rereview of PB smears from these patients who had typical cutaneous findings of MF did not identify definitive Sezary cells The CD4 CD8 ratio was elevated 4 1 in 77 of the involved PB samples at presentation and in 74 of the followup involved PB samples but in only 13 of the PB samples from MF SS patients without tumor cells seen on smear No flow cytometric abnormalities were detected in CD4 positive T cells from 10 control patients without lymphoproliferative disorders The overall incidence of different immunophenotypic aberrancies among the 44 MF SS patients is summarized in Table 1 We noted abnormal expression levels of CD3 by flow cytometry in 34 of patients tumor cells were dimmer for CD3 than normal T cell levels in 11 patients brighter than normal for CD3 in 2 patients Fig 1A and completely negative for CD3 in 2 patients Similarly abnormal levels of CD4 expression were seen in 24 54 patients 21 dimmer 1 brighter 2 negative Fig 1B Coexpression of CD4 and CD8 was seen in tumor cells from 2 patients In 17 of patients tumor cells showed both CD3 and CD4 aberrancies however the magnitude of these changes were not highly correlated when graded as negative 0 dim 1 normal 2 or bright 3 R value 23 In a subset of cases tested abnormalities in the dimmer expression level of CD 45 were seen in 4 of 10 40 cases Fig 1A T cell receptor alpha beta TCR expression levels were determined in 19 cases and was 100 correlated with CD3 expression in that dim TCR expression in 3 cases was associated with dim CD3 and TCR was negative in the 2 cases that showed absence of surface CD3 CD5 expression was abnormal in 5 of 20 25 of tested cases dimmer in 4 brighter in 1 by standard analysis However the level of CD5 expression in T cells was typically variable and careful cluster analysis in 5 additional cases identified discrete CD5 dim tumor cell populations T cells in normal PB typically showed a continuous variation in CD7 expression level In involved MF SS PB samples tumor cells were uniformly negative in 17 patients 39 and uniformly positive in 10 patients 23 In the remaining 17 patients 38 CD7 expression in tumor was variable Fig 1B and was often indistinguishable from the range of expression seen in normal T cells The T cell activation marker CD26 was uniformly negative in tumor cells from 36 patients 81 uniformly positive in 2 patients and showed variable positivity in 6 Thus in 38 of 44 86 patients CD4 CD26 and CD3 CD26 histograms clearly separated the phenotypically atypical T cell populations Figs 1Cand 2 Multiple phenotypically aberrant T cell populations in MF SS In 5 patients with long standing MF we noted 2 discrete phenotypically abnormal T cell populations in PB In 2 patients these included a CD3 dim population Fig 3A in 2 other patients there were CD4 dim and CD4 negative populations Fig 3B 3C The remaining patient had two discrete populations detected by CD45 and CD5 staining In 4 cases cluster analysis correlated the different phenotypically aberrant populations with the normal sized and large transformed neoplastic T cell populations seen on PB smear This was done by pseudocoloring the abnormal cell cluster in the various antibody panels and correlating the relative cell size of these clusters on the forward side scatter histograms Fig 3A 3C Phenotypic aberrancies in T cells are stable over the course of disease In 38 of the patients we analyzed followup PB samples that had tumor cells identified on smear and a phenotypically abnormal population identified by flow cytometry We examined from 2 to 8 different samples from these patients over the 3 year study period In a subset of cases we used the Paint a gate software on the forward side scatter and other histograms to quantify the size of the aberrant tumor cell T cell population in comparison with the other white blood cell types detected As shown in Table 2 such a technique could be used to document oscillations in tumor cell number that occurred over the course of treatment In 36 of 38 patients phenotypic aberrancies in the levels of CD3 CD4 and CD26 were stable with similar expression levels detected in all involved PB samples In contrast CD7 expression varied in the aberrant tumor cell population in 10 of 38 26 cases Fig 4shows a patient with CD4 dim phenotypic aberrancy in tumor cells that remained constant over the course of disease In this patient intervening treatments with Targretin interferon and photopheresis had no discernible effect on overall PB tumor cell number However initiation of deoxycoformycin pentostatin therapy resulted in a decrease in the size of the aberrant CD7 dim tumor cluster as well as decreases in the population of normal T cells consistent with treatment response In 2 patients there were changes in the phenotype of tumor cells noted over the study period In one case large cell transformation of tumor cells was associated with partial loss of surface CD3 In another case with CD4 dim and CD4 negative tumor cell populations effective treatment was associated with selective loss of the CD4 negative population data not shown Discussion We examined the flow cytometry findings in involved PB samples from 44 MF SS patients most of who had multiple sequential involved PB samples Using a standard T cell cytometry panel we noted abnormal T cell populations showing one or more antigen aberrancies in 93 of patients In 5 MF patients we noted multiple persistent phenotypically abnormal T cell populations consistent with clonal heterogeneity We present the first report on the stability of such abnormal immunophenotypes in the neoplastic T cells of SS MF over disease course Despite varying treatments immunophenotypic aberrancies noted were maintained over the course of disease in 95 of cases excluding common variations in the level of CD7 expression These findings support the hypothesis that these abnormal T cell populations represent the neoplastic clone and provide strong support for the use of flow cytometry in routine monitoring of treatment response Tumor associated variation in one or several pan T cell antigens is a typical feature of neoplastic lymphocytes in many T cell malignances and has been termed antigen loss or deletion 7 Using immunohistochemistry on a large bank of T cell lymphomas we have previously noted a frequency of such antigen deletion of 18 for CD2 26 for CD3 30 for CD5 and 68 for CD7 8 Flow cytometric analysis can allow a more sensitive assessment of subtle variations in the levels of surface marker expression than immunohistochemistry 9 In non neoplastic T cell populations we noted relatively narrow range of CD3 CD4 and CD5 expression with majority of cells clustering within one log intensity In contrast the aberrancies noted in expression in T cell tumor often showed 2 3 log fold intensity differences from the normal populations 5 9 10 11 12 Most routinely assessed T cell diagnostic markers e g TCR CD3 CD4 CD8 and CD45 are components of the antigen receptor complex and are dynamically regulated during T cell maturation and activation 13 In a subset of cases analyzed we noted that surface CD3 levels frequently correlated with levels of TCR but that CD3 did not always correlate with variations in the levels of surface CD4 We also found variations in MF SS tumor cells in the expression level of CD45 a phosphatase that regulates TCR activation 14 The finding of frequent variations in the levels of these TCR complex proteins in tumors is intriguing and suggests abnormal regulation or formation of the TCR complex in some tumor cells This could be lead to dysregulated TCR signaling effecting growth regulation In previous studies others and we have noted that MF SS tumor cells frequently lacked CD26 and that this finding was helpful in identifying the tumor cell population 4 15 In this larger longitudinal series we confirm these findings and noted that tumor cells showed a consistent pattern of CD26 loss over the course of disease The stable loss of expression of CD26 a T cell activation marker in MF SS suggests that this activation pathway may be nonfunctional in most MF SS tumors CD26 is an ectoenzyme which delivers a costimulatory signal in T cells its expression is upregulated on T cells in response to mitogenic signals and downregulated through interaction with the insulin like growth factor II receptor 16 The consequence of CD26 loss is unclear CD26 modulates the action of many molecules including the chemotactic activity of some chemokine important for T cell migration to skin 17 18 In contrast we noted that CD7 expression was frequently modulated in tumor cells over the disease course Several previous studies have demonstrated that CD7 loss is not a predictable marker for detection of MF SS cells as its expression is variable in this tumor type 15 19 Although there is data to suggest that CD7 negative T cells may represent a distinct differentiation pathway in normal and neoplastic helper T cells 20 21 the variable expression of CD7 in MF SS that we have observed suggests that this marker may be highly modulated by tumor microenvironment and or treatment Identification of a stable tumor associated immunophenotype in MF SS allows tumor cell quantification to assess response to therapy Cluster analysis of abnormal flow cytometric immunophenotype is more reliable and easier to compare over time than morphologic analysis and can detect PB involvement in a small number of cases without easily identifiable Sezary cells 12 Routine flow cytometric profiling is also not as technically demanding as molecular monitoring 22 23 or electron microscopy Such a separation of tumor from normal T cells is also important in assessing the effects of therapies on normal leukocytes In conclusion we found that the absence of CD26 and other aberrant surface expression of T cell associated markers allowed identification of a discrete quantifiable population in nearly all MF SS patients with PB tumor cells Immunophenotypic aberrancies are maintained consistently over the course of disease and can be used to monitor tumor response to therapy
