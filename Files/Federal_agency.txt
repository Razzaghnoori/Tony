 Federal agency asserts claim to buildings Sunday September 22 2002 By Herb Frazier A congressional agency that funds legal services for low income Americans is battling Charleston lawyers over control of buildings that once housed legal assistance programs in Charleston Georgetown and Conway At stake is prime real estate in the coastal cities including a Charleston building in the heart of upscale commercial development on upper King Street The Washington based Legal Services Corp wants the buildings transferred to the S C Centers for Equal Justice said LSC spokesman Eric Kleiman The LSC was once the funding agency for the Neighborhood Legal Assistance Program Corp in Charleston In January the LSC funding went to the Greenville based equal justice centers In an Aug 21 letter to NLAP board chairman Gerald A Kaynard LSC president John N Erlenborn said If NLAP fails to effectuate these transfers by Aug 31 LSC will take all necessary steps to protect its interest in these properties Kaynard did not return repeated phone calls from The Post and Courier As part of its funding agreement the LSC requires property purchased with government funds be returned to the nonprofit corporation if a local agency loses its grant Kleiman said In August the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that requirement in a lawsuit LSC filed in a property dispute with a legal services program in Big Stone Gap Va Kleiman said We will continue to work with NLAP to work out an orderly transfer of the property We hope this can be resolved amicably Last year NLAP lost its federal grant with a nationwide consolidation of legal aid programs In January the federal agency awarded a 4 4 million grant to the Centers for Equal Justice which has a Charleston area office and sites in 11 other South Carolina cities With a budget of 329 million LSC provides civil legal assistance to low income people in every county in America Kleiman said NLAP was created in 1968 A decade later the agency used a 50 000 LSC grant to buy a building at 438 King St in Charleston and 33 000 to buy a building at 201 King St in Georgetown according to Erlenborn s letter to Kaynard In 1980 NLAP used 63 000 in LSC funds to buy property at 607 Main St in Conway the letter said On Nov 14 2001 NLAP transferred title of the King Street building in Charleston to the Charleston County Bar Association according to county property records The local bar paid 5 for the building which sits between a redeveloped office building and an antique shop The local bar said it would maintain the building for legal services to indigent residents of Charleston County and coastal South Carolina the records said The King Street building appears to be vacant Notices at the entrance direct visitors to the equal justice center on West Montague Avenue in North Charleston E Douglas Pratt Thomas president of the local bar was not available for comment Charleston County has not appraised the King Street property because it is tax exempt But Randall Goldman managing partner of Patrick Properties which owns buildings from 440 to 456 King St said he estimates 438 King St would sell for between 700 000 and 900 000 That building which was purchased solely with federal legal aid dollars should be used to provide legal services for poor people in South Carolina Kleiman said LSC wants the title to go to the equal justice center in Charleston or we want 100 percent of the proceeds from the sale of the building to stay in Charleston We are not contemplating taking that money out of South Carolina he said Kleiman said if the neighborhood legal program in Charleston had honored their obligation this would not be an issue
