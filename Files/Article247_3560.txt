 How To Out Travel Your Travel Guide My trip to Chicago began fantastically thanks On Sunday morning I jumped out of bed early and headed to the Maxwell Street Market the city s famous once a week open air bazaar In recent years the city s Mexican population has boomed and the market now hosts a veritable food fair of Mexican delicacies Squeezed amid the booths hawking used car fenders lacy underwear and 15 bootleg copies of Microsoft Windows 98 are makeshift restaurants constructed for the day out of tarps and folding chairs I wandered for two hours sampling a ceviche like fish salad spiked with lime cilantro and hot sauce tamales coated in a green mole sauce that tasted differently with every second it lingered on my tongue and for dessert golden empanadas filled with creamy rice pudding Nothing I ate cost more than 3 I want to go back next Sunday so I can try the cold shrimp soup the goat tacos and the Bavarian cream flavored churros But I didn t find out about the market s delights from any of my Chicago guidebooks Its charms are no secret in the past few years the market has been written up in the New York Times the Washington Post the Los Angeles Times the Chicago Tribune and Saveur magazine but Fodor s which boasts of its coverage of off and on the beaten path sites and Access the cover of which claims to make the world your neighborhood don t mention the market even once Insight Guide describes its past incarnations as a center for Eastern European peddlers in the 1880s a Southern style farmer s market in the 1930s and a place to watch busking blues musicians in the 1940s and 50s but says it s now just a place to buy fake Rolex watches My Compass Guide dismisses the current market a sanitized successor to the old And Lonely Planet with its orthodox adherence to alternative travel has some good historical scraps a block of the old market once seceded from the United States and established an anarchist country but barely mentions any reasons to go now Oddly Frommer s did Maxwell Street Market more justice than the others mentioning the food vendors if not their offerings Even better it lists the market s Web site The other books contain a smattering of travel sites but Frommer s is alone in listing Web addresses for every restaurant hotel and attraction that has one This is an easy and obvious solution to one of the biggest weaknesses of guidebooks which is that they re out of date from the moment they re printed Yesterday for example you could have theoretically logged on to the Statue of Liberty s Web site to find the correct departure time for the ferry However this was pretty much Frommer s only virtue The first page of the book unironically quotes a Travel Leisure review calling the book the Walter Cronkite of guidebooks with all that implies Clearly this is not a guidebook for jetsetters adventure travelers or anyone else who might consider Cronkite a less than ideal tour guide As you say Frommer s is very much our father s Oldsmobile But even older and tamer travelers deserve better than Frommer s The book breezes through the architecture of the Loop Chicago s spectacular downtown in four pages Most buildings are dismissed in two or three sentences Dates and architects for some buildings are listed but others are mysteriously omitted In contrast the Insight Guide gives Loop architecture 19 pages Fodor s 14 Frommer s devotes an average of 10 times more copy to hotel d cor than to the design of Chicago s great buildings For example the nine sentence review of the Hampton Inn notes that its interior takes inspiration from the Prairie architectural style and the two story woodsy lobby with slipcovered furniture and a few Chicago architectural artifacts feels like a friend s great room Guest rooms are residential and warm with framed collages of vintage Chicago postcards on the walls Meanwhile the Rookery Building and its famous Frank Lloyd Wright lobby get one line I also found a historical error Frommer s says that Chicago s first recorded settlement was established in 1781 Not to quibble over two years but Frommer s could have checked the Chicago Public Library s timeline or the other guidebooks which list the correct date as 1779 What fun it was to write that last paragraph Did I detect a similar note of triumph in your voice when you caught the guidebooks flubbing the Statue of Liberty schedules Maybe this is the answer to your excellent question about why we buy and tote around guides we know are flawed outdated and out of style My trips often become contests between myself and my guidebooks Can I do them one better finding more inside information local color novel tastes and great prices than the experts When I saw the paltry descriptions of the Maxwell Street market I felt a small rush I had out traveled the travel experts Or at least I ve out traveled my fellow tourists You re right about how quick these books are to ridicule other voyagers Rather than showing real concern for the impact of camera toting hordes or knee jerk irreverence I think the books are dispensing garden variety flattery making you feel superior to the next guy on the museum ticket line Traveling has become subtly competitive with all of us vying for maximum independence authenticity and adventure Buy me boast the books and you won t be the Ugliest American But there s only so much exoticism to be had especially in well trodden cities like Chicago and New York In fact hipster travel magazines like Time Out and Wallpaper have recently been taking a camp approach to oft visited locales telling their readers to embrace their tourist status to take Circle Line cruises in New York and ride to the top of the Eiffel Tower in Paris Could this be the backlash to the never ending search for novelty and virgin territory I m not sure where the backlash would hit in Chicago but I ll keep my eyes open for fashion models wearing Hawaiian shirts and white patent leather shoes Thanks for the thumbnail sketches I ll try to cover more books tomorrow In the meantime if you had to take one guidebook to New York which would it be And which one have you already chucked into the Hudson
