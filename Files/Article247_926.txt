 Trekkin As Trekkies will tell you the even numbered Star Trek pictures have been more or less OK the odd ones leaden bummers Star Trek Insurrection the ninth feature finally lifts the odd number curse Not that it s as stellar as Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan 1982 or even Star Trek VI The Undiscovered Country 1991 It s just pleasant Directed in plain style by Jonathan Frakes who also appears as the Enterprise s second in command Riker this is probably the closest the movies have come to a TV episode one of the ones in which the Enterprise crew beams down to an idyllic agrarian planet where people knead dough and dress like Stevie Nicks and where the Captain falls in love with a headstrong woman and has impassioned debates about the Prime Directive before the phasers and the photon torpedos come out and things blow up real good The agrarians are the Ba ku who thanks to metaphasic radiation live more or less forever which means their youth have thirty year apprenticeships and the planet s needlepoint is of a high order The bad guys the Son a led by Ruf afo F Murray Abraham are ugly bleeders with the kind of puffy muslin skin you see on third degree burn victims their favorite pastime is having their dermal layers stretched and their skulls reupholstered The Plug Uglies want to harvest the metaphasic radiation particles in the rings around the Beauties planet Nuff said There are two classes of Star Trek scripts the Brannon Braga kind which feature spatial temporal gimmicks and Generation X banter and the Michael Piller kind which focus on interspecies political coups and earthbound ground bound ethical deliberations This is one of the latter and things do get pokey But when Patrick Stewart deliberates people listen His stalwart Captain Jean Luc Picard is the perfect mascot for the 23 rd century in which actors no longer sport ridiculous rugs Stewart seems to have evolved beyond hair The only real lapse is a strangely subdued Klingon Worf Michael Dorn has become a regular on the unwatchable Star Trek Deep Space Nine which means that he has to be just passing by whenever one of these Star Trek The Next Generation features starts up It s worth getting him back on board though because no one can utter a line like I have an odd craving for the blood of a live kolar beast with Dorn s mixture of virility and befuddlement Insurrection boasts the only space battle in film history in which the antagonists sing Gilbert and Sullivan while firing on each other which is reason enough to go warp factor 9 to movie number 10 The only pressing question How can they get Picard together with Seven of Nine David Edelstein Click here to read David Edelstein s review of Shakespeare in Love and Little Voices
