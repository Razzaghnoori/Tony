              so you uh exercise on a regular basis   i dont Vinny im a a CPA and this time of year im dang busy but uh i do do a lot of exercise in the spring and summer and in the fall     uhhuh what kind of exercise do you do   well i dont i dont go to a health club and work out and things of that nature but i i run a lot   umhum   i usually try to get uh oh about three mornings   umhum   three mornings a week where i run two two miles a day   oh thats not bad umhum   yeah how about yourself   well i uh i like to run but uh i have problems with my back hurting so uh i run i if i run its usually short durations and i only do it when i cant you know get out of the house um   umhum umhum   there you know to go because i usually work out in a health club and uh i try to work out like every other day and sometimes when its like a really nice day outside i dont feel like going inside to work out then i go ahead and run for short duration   yes umhum umhum uh do you uh pump iron or what kind of uh   yeah i use i like to do uh free weights   umhum umhum   because uh i found certain parts of my body developed better than other parts of my body so uh instead of they you know they have like different circuits and they tell you to work every single muscle in your body and uh i hate working a muscle that you know just wont develop   umhum umhum   so uh ive ive gotten uh ive adapted to uh a routine and i like to work my arms and my chest and my stomach and everything else just seems to stay the same no matter what i do to it   hum   so those are what i like to work out the most and you know i get a pretty decent workout with my legs um just you know on occasion running but or you know just running around what i do everyday so   uh what i ive never been around weights much is how hows a dead weight help you versus the machine type   well sometimes what happens is sometimes uh now different machines i guess uh work different ways but uh the way i look at it if sometimes the machine like you know one hand can put more porce can put more force than the other one   umhum   so sometimes you end up working out one hand more than the other or one leg more than the other because the machine averages the weights out   oh yeah uhhuh   because youre pulling like the same set of weights out now they they have different machines that will uh   right uhhuh   um   equalize that or   right they have what they have like a uh weight weight for one side and a weight for the other side and thats you know better than uh than like a universal set usually has like one set of weights that you know you do for both of them   right umhum   um but even then uh i id like to think the free weights simulate a live a real world situation better   umhum   you know like uh just like a friend of mine used to tell me he goes uh if you work out with free weights you know and a car falls on you think the free weights going to give you better uh       better idea of whats going to happen rather than if you work out with uh you know with some kind of machine   yeah uhhuh   but uh the machines the one thing the machines do do that the free weights dont do is they focus on a specific muscle or muscle group   huhuh   which is something i dont think you will get out of the free weights because the free weights just kind of work your whole body i guess or a whole area as opposed to like one spot because if you get like a particular Nautilus machine or something   umhum yes   yeah you can get it like down to you know the very last muscle down there   hum   so it works pretty good   what do you uh do you work your cardiovascular system at all other than the running how do you you know get your   um that   heart rate up for a while   im sorry say that one more time   i was just wondering how you get your heart rate up or does pumping iron do that   oh no usually what i do is when i get to the uh i i usually like run around the track they have a track there   umhum okay   i run around the track uh you know uh maybe like its a tenth of a mile all the way around so i just run real slow you know maybe do a couple of laps just enough to get my heart rate going   umhum   and uh after that then i just go ahead and just get in my routine i do uh i do my um my sit ups first and that also uh that gets my heart rate going too and then i i dont pump iron until maybe like halfway through and then i sit down and start doing the the free weights   umhum   and then i usually run before i leave to kind of relax me a little bit   thats incredible   yeah so it it works out okay i havent uh i the problem is you know i get into it and i work out for three months four months in a row get in great shape and then you know ill have a business conference i usually go overseas twice or three times a year   umhum yes   and to attend these conferences and they kill me  you you travel you eat a lot you um  it messes up you know your uh biological clock you know   huh yeah   and uh it just screws you up completely  and by the time you come back you dont feel like working out you know   huh do do do do your muscles uh do do you lose the tone fast do you lose the strength in them fairly quickly or   well uh i you you dont lose strength i dont think you lose a little bit of tone   uhhuh   um but you get back into it and you know it doesnt take very long to build it back up but uh i dont think you know they say you get flabby if you you know the more you work out and you get all big muscles and stuff and then also when you stop they say you get flabby when you get older you know   umhum umhum   well it may happen but like i said its easy to develop them because if i lose if i lose tone you know by not working out uh over a period of a week or two
