 so what is your favorite TV program well probably my favorite TV program is Murder She Wrote i happen to be a mystery fan and uh programs such as Perry Mason and Ironside and Murder She Wrote and Columbo all of those uh are my my favorite kinds of programs yeah uh um i ve watched Murder She Wrote a couple of times but um i like mysteries and i do like Columbo but there what is opposite Murder She Wrote there s something else that i watch i think it s that family home video show uh huh well the that Famous Home Video is what s opposite it here i don t know up there but um i like that because it it really makes me laugh people send in have you ever watched that where they yeah no well i don t think we get it here oh they send in they do videos of funny things that happen at home you know and then send it in and show it on TV and oh boy i tell you what it s it s hysterical huh uh oh what kinds of things do they uh show oh gosh well uh one that comes to mind is a lady i don t know what the heck she was doing in her dishwasher but she was in her dishwasher her head was in her dishwasher and her hair got caught oh my word and she couldn t get out and her hair it was and she was heavy kind of like me and so what you could see was this big bottom sticking out of her of her dishwasher and her husband was uh huh say he was videotaping this thing you know there she is caught in the dishwasher you know oh it was hysterical and oh my word just real funny things you know people skiing and doing funny things on in the water and you know just really it s it s really a good program i really enjoy that uh huh probably things that that there happen every day and we don t even notice them until someone videotapes them i know it and then some the winner the one that s voted the best wins ten thousand dollars so you know is that right i often think gee i wish i had a video camera because i could sure use ten thousand dollars so but i like things like Evening Shade with Burt Reynolds i really enjoy that and uh um hum yeah i saw that for the first time yesterday in the evening i really like that that s a good show and i like Rosanne now i know not many people probably like Roseanne but uh huh yeah uh i have never seen her show but after hearing her sing the Star Spangled Banner anthem i will never watch her show well she doesn t sing on her show but i i do enjoy seeing that uh huh and uh so i like a lot of comedy stuff i guess you know but then i like the police things too Cops you know we have yeah oh yeah right um hum and i like that you know so i don t know i guess i just like a variety variety of things and every day i just tape Regis and Kathie Lee do you oh yes that s a good program uh huh do you like them i watch them every day i tape them well not this week because it s uh they re on vacation so it s just old tapes but oh okay but every i run my VCR while i m at work i tape that and i watch it every evening when i come home and i don t know what it is about that show that s different about other talk shows well i think that they uh they seem like they are friends with one another and with all of their guests rather than just interviewing yeah and she s so cute and her and Frank and the baby and i don t know i just you know they took it off down here for a while uh oh gosh for about a year year and a half well yeah did they yeah i guess about a year and so i missed her pregnancy and everything you know and when they took it off i have never called a station before or complained or anything when they took it off the air here i called the station and complained i said uh huh you took my favorite program off the air and do you do you think it ll ever be back and they said no we don t think it will be well that was channel eleven and now it s on channel four uh huh so i m really thrilled at you know that they you that they have it here so well great course i have to admit i i love uh when the fall comes i love uh football oh and i watch all the football games Monday night Thursday night and Sunday afternoon my mother does too i m not a big i used to be a football fan i don t know what happened i m just not a football fan anymore well and not everybody is yeah but my mother does not miss a game and you just don t know she lives in California and i do not call her on Sunday in football during football season i just don t do it you know she might call me during a halftime or after the game or something but i just don t call her and now they re starting up with new football yeah but uh i can t get too enthused about it yet it seems to me i have to feel that the fall weather to really do something uh with regard to football it s you think it s seasonal you think it goes with the season yeah i because i always hate to see it end in January i d like to see it go on for a couple of months but football to me uh in real real hot weather it just doesn t uh doesn t click now i enjoy going to baseball games but i don t enjoy watching them on television and i don t enjoy watching basketball on television they re they re both well baseball s so slow yeah and uh basketball seems like all all that you can really see is run and shoot run and shoot run and shoot and um uh because the average person doesn t get to see enough of the entire floor to see a play get uh develop develop and so uh uh i don t usually watch them i ll listen to baseball and i ll listen to uh like the Indianapolis Five Hundred i would not go and face all those crowds for anything in the world but you watch it but uh but uh no i won t watch it i ll listen to it on the radio yeah while i m doing something else but i won t sit still long enough to watch them go round and around and around to me that is very boring oh listen to it yeah yeah but i i don t watch i don t sit and watch for long periods of time anyhow now see in Ohio you really have four seasons don t you yes we certainly do well we kind of do but ours our it its hot here i m in shorts are you and people have their air conditioners on already it has been hot and humid here and so but our summers sometimes start in June and they don t end till like November i mean it s hot so we watch football in the heat here um hum sure right i guess so so i it might not matter Texans are real football minded people um oh with the Dallas Cowboys although they haven t done very well the last couple of years but uh they ll be back up there oh oh well i know i think so i think they did better this last year so yeah they ll they ll climb back up again and that Texas Stadium i ve been there that is a phenomenal place yeah people say they wish they had a roof on it though it doesn t look finished well and i think that s maybe what i like about it in that so many of them are totally enclosed i ve never been in an enclosed one oh i well i have and they re very noisy and uh then of course i ve been up to uh Cleveland Ohio where the Cleveland Browns play and that s just a wide open stadium and that cold wind comes off the lakes and it is miserable oh but um now go down to Cincinnati and they have a nice stadium down there but it s it s all open also yeah yeah so Ohio has how many football teams two well so does Texas two yeah yeah and then of course Indianapolis which is only a hundred miles away from us has the Colts yeah that s right they have the Colts now like so uh they they ve got a lot of sports going on around here yeah i went one time to um okay Minneapolis uh huh to the uh Vikings i went to a Viking Bear game one year oh many years ago now my gosh it s probably been twenty years and that was a real experience because there are some fans there and i guess that s a big game oh yeah oh yeah well i uh i m retired from education i worked thirty four years as a teacher and administrator in the Dayton here this the Dayton school system and uh several of my players uh players several of my former students uh played with Minnesota Vikings and then with the Cleveland Browns oh oh how neat yeah it was it was fun because uh they would call when they were with the Browns they would call and say we left tickets at the gate for you all come on up so we would hop in the car the next morning and drive up and oh we have tickets waiting for us on that s wonderful oh that s what an experience to see your students you know grown up and playing football yeah yeah oh oh sure one of them was grown up and was Chief of Police here oh that must be neat to see what happens to them like that yeah right when you see the ones who are successful and there are many of them around and uh makes me feel good to know i played one small part in their rearing yeah you sure did what grade did you teach or well i i uh when i first started out teaching it was uh at college level and then uh after we moved here to Dayton then i went to the high school level i really enjoyed that more and so then i taught the physical education actually uh with the i was the specialist in water safety and uh so i taught uh the the physical education oh my gosh and swimming um on the high school level and then they just kept pushing me into administration and and i wound up as an assistant principal and then i went down to the central office and was part of a team to to to develop a program to evaluate schools and and to uh try to resolve problems within schools so no wonder you like sports so you were a physical education teacher yes sure i was also a gymnast when i was very small in a Czechoslovakian Turner Society and and yeah and had the opportunity of uh competing nationally and oh that s wonderful they had things that were similar to the Olympics uh the Czechoslovakian Turner Society did so it was it was exciting we competed on the rings and balance beam
