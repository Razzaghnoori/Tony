 Sexual Behavior in the Social Scientist In his fine earlier book Bad Blood James Jones exposed one of American medicine s most shameful episodes the Tuskegee experiment in which doctors enlisted a group of black men with syphilis and without their knowledge or consent withheld treatment so as to observe the natural progress of the disease In this new biography Jones outs Alfred Kinsey He lived with two terrible secrets He was both a homosexual and a masochist Everything else about him seems to follow The answer to why he worked so hard lies in his private life His spring coil vitality was the product not of a naturally energetic constitution or a passion for science or even old fashioned ambition but of stupendous guilt He presented himself as a man of science but actually he was a crypto reformer who spent his every waking hour attempting to change the sexual mores and sex offender laws of the United States Not exactly He also spent 15 years researching gall wasps and was a serious gardener hiker and record collector Others may have had an inkling of his secret agenda but only now can the truth be told It is the following Kinsey believed in the words of one informant that if only he could get the facts to people life would be a lot happier and less guilt ridden And moreover he was a great champion of tolerance and liberality Apparently only a guilt ridden masochistic homosexual could be driven by such suspect and cleverly disguised views Kinsey fooled many The irony of course is that many distinguished scientists who knew his work intimately were not able to see beneath the surface Incredible as it may seem the vice president and senior editor of the premier medical publishing house also failed to question Kinsey s scholarly objectivity Not Jones The perpetrator of all these deceptions may not have been the successor to Darwin as many contemporaries thought but he was arguably the paradigmatic social scientist of his generation a man who more than any other made the study of human sexuality a respectable and legitimate field of inquiry The author of the groundbreaking best sellers Sexual Behavior in the Human Male 1948 and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female 1953 he was the pioneer in finding out what Americans actually do in bed and with whom we do it That Kinsey had intense homoerotic relationships with his graduate students is certain He was into group sex and he masturbated His sexual life unquestionably extended beyond the missionary position within monogamous marriage but then as his and much subsequent research showed so does that of most Americans More than likely he had orgasms derived from homosexual contact But he also had a long loving and complex sexual relationship with his wife Clara and found stimulation in heterosexual pornography Whether he was a homosexual readers can decide for themselves Jones relentlessly hostile readings of the evidence however make this difficult When a graduate student on a field trip writes about Kinsey s prick nibblin tent Jones suggests that it is not hard to suspect that oral sex was going on under canvas tops because Berland was a man who usually meant what he said Berland also said that the retiring president of Indiana University had shriveled balls and worried lest he himself be castrated for biting a coed s tit Kinsey s assignment of 0 to the exclusively heterosexual and 6 to the exclusively homosexual in his famous scale leads Jones to comment H ow interesting that he should assign this heterosexuality no value One can only wonder what snide comment he would have made if Kinsey had flipped the values The evidence for Kinsey s masochism mostly the reports of anonymous sources is much more difficult to assess Consider Jones pi ce de r sistance On one particular evening in response to his inner demons and more specifically to the Rockefeller Foundation s rejection of a grant application Kinsey allegedly hanged himself by the hand and balls from an overhead pipe long enough for this self appointed Messiah of the sexually despised to experience much pain and suffering precisely as he had intended Forget the mocking tone it pervades the book Any reformer is invariably described as a chronic or habitual do gooder Forget too the absence of even the semblance of evidence for Kinsey s inner state here as elsewhere Kinsey must have felt ambivalence about gardening because it threatened his fragile sense of masculinity A footnote reveals that the one anonymous source for this episode of self torture who is actually cited was apparently not an actual witness and that it can at best be dated between 1951 and 1955 In the note Jones also suggests that a massive pelvic infection which Kinsey suffered in the fall of 1954 may pinpoint the most likely time and of course corroborate the incident But back in the main text he says Kinsey had an infection in his pelvic region probably glomerular nephritis a different and more probable diagnosis which would make the public cover story that a strep throat caused the problem far likelier Readers can decide for themselves if they care They may not Suppose Kinsey were a card carrying homosexual masochist it would seem to have little bearing either on his commitment to tolerance or on his scientific practice Even if his private life were relevant once again Jones unrelieved disdain for his subject obscures any possible connections Kinsey never did anything for innocent reasons Even when he tried to write well he was craft ing his prose with the care of a man for whom words are weapons He can t win On one page he is charged with listening to music analytically in keeping with his general penchant to dominate and on the next with barely keeping from having an erection listening to the songs of Hugo Wolf Whatever the problems with Kinsey s data they had nothing to do with his sexuality He manifestly did not as Jones claims place a meaty thumb upon the scales so that he was virtually guaranteed that he would find what he was looking for Again and again Jones himself reports that Kinsey was surprised at this or that result If indeed following common wisdom he really did disparage the sexual capacity of women the volume on the sexual response of the human female nonetheless contained all sorts of things he was not looking for Twenty years before Masters and Johnson for example he discovered that contrary to the then dominant view the great majority of women experienced not vaginal but clitoral orgasm Of course Kinsey s statistics were and are open to criticism His is not a random sample and it s not clear exactly what population it represents That said a blue ribbon committee of the American Statistical Association concluded that the interviews themselves were remarkably probing and that under the circumstances a random sample was impossible Most of us would respond to the phone call or knock on the door from a total stranger announcing that we had been randomly selected to tell them when we started to masturbate or how often we had been unfaithful to our partners with a polite no thank you not tonight Jones of course claims that the committee of statisticians was manipulated into supporting Kinsey and that his efforts to improve the quality of his statistical work were merely cosmetic The remarkable fact is that his numbers have proven to be so robust and that the archive he assembled of sexual history and sundry other material remains unrivaled Finally Kinsey s insistence that there was no such thing as a homosexual a subspecies of humankind but only an infinite shading of variation a continuum of practices seems to have had more to do with his training as an entomologist than with the nature of his own desires He inherited from his graduate school mentors a resolute anti essentialism This is a man who before he collected 18 000 sexual histories spent 15 years collecting 300 000 gall wasps in order to argue as he would again later against the ontological reality of established taxonomic categories A self righteous tone suffuses this biography The author clearly feels he has exposed the dirty secrets that inspired his protagonist s crypto agenda of reform In fact there is nothing crypto about his agenda writing about sex for a lay audience in the 1940s and 1950s was an openly revolutionary act It was still illegal under various 19 th century Comstock laws to disseminate information about birth control in many states Kinsey like every other social scientist since the Enlightenment was simply obeying the central tenet of his discipline that the scientific study of society is possible that the results of such study are a better basis for policy than say the Mosaic interdiction against homosexuality Moreover the fact that Kinsey had a sexual life however nonstandard it was would not render him incapable of objectivity in writing about sex Value free social science does not demand that its practitioners have no values It means that they gather and interpret their material fairly and argue about its interpretations rationally By these criteria Kinsey fares well That he exaggerated the power of biology failed to deal with love and perhaps overextended the protective umbrella of tolerance is beyond doubt But overinterpretation or even misinterpretation are not the same as bias It is distressing that in this time of AIDS it could still be said that Kinsey s passionate interest in human sexuality could only be the product of perversion The book s cynicism is even more distressing symptomatic as it is of a larger cynicism that seems to have gripped our public culture We seem to believe that all human action is motivated not by the desire to know or improve the lot of humankind but only by the basest motives of greed power and self aggrandizement Kinsey was of another age How characteristically American wrote Lionel Trilling of Sexual Behavior in the Human Male in its impulse toward acceptance and liberation the broad and generous desire for others not to be harshly judged
