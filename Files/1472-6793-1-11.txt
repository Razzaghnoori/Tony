 Background Low intestinal calcium absorption efficiency in humans is common and contributes to negative calcium balance and bone loss 1 Recent epidemiological evidence suggests that low fractional calcium absorption is a significant risk factor for future osteoporotic hip fracture 2 The primary homeostatic mechanism for altering calcium absorption in response to low dietary calcium intake and increased calcium requirements during growth is an increase in plasma 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D the active hormonal form of vitamin D produced in the kidney 3 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D is a seco steroid that acts on gene transcription through a nuclear steroid receptor protein and also may have nongenomic actions mediated by a putative plasma membrane vitamin D receptor 4 Changes in vitamin D status primarily alter the rate of Ca absorption in the proximal small intestine During transcellular calcium transport across the absorptive enterocyte calcium must pass across an apical brush border membrane then transverse the interior of the cell and exit against an electrochemical gradient across the basolateral membrane Changes in the rate of vectorial Ca transport in the intestine however must be accomplished without a major disruption in the free intracellular Ca concentration which is used as an important intracellular signal in the enterocyte 5 as in other cells It has been known for over 30 years that vitamin D status influences the level of calbindin D a cytosolic calcium binding protein 6 believed to be the rate limiting step in calcium absorption 7 by acting as an intracellular calcium ferry or chaperone Calcium extrusion at the basolateral membrane is an active process involving a Ca ATPase that may also be affected by vitamin D status 8 However although it has been known for more than 20 years that the rate of Ca transport across the intestinal brush border membrane can be increased by 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D 9 the identity of the calcium transport protein involved in Ca influx has not been ascertained Recently two novel closely related epithelial calcium channels CaT1 also known as ECaC2 and ECaC1 also known as CaT2 have been cloned from rat 10 and rabbit 11 respectively and shown to mediate calcium influx when expressed in Xenopus oocytes CaT1 and ECaC1 are found in several tissues including 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D responsive epithelia in the intestine and kidney These epithelial calcium channel genes are products of evolutionary local gene duplication found on chromosome 7 and represent a new family of Ca selective ion channels involved in active Ca re absorption 12 Furthermore it has been suggested that the control of the number of active channels at the cell surface is critical for regulation of active calcium transport and that the epithelial calcium channel could confer the rate limiting step in transcellular calcium transport 13 Peptide hormones and other cell surface acting signal molecules trigger increases in the concentration of calcium ions inside the cell by release of calcium from stores within the cell or activation of Ca ion channels in the plasma membrane allowing calcium to enter from outside the cell One of the most common mechanisms that regulate entry of calcium is by capacitative or store operated calcium entry 14 The epithelial Ca release activated channel I CRAC is a highly calcium selective plasma membrane ion channel that is activated on lowering of either intracellular calcium concentration or intracellular calcium stores The CaT1 channel has been recently expressed in mammalian CHO cells and patch clamp studies have shown it to have the characteristics of I CRAC 15 Nearly ubiquitous store operated calcium entry is essential in a wide variety of cellular processes including muscle contraction protein secretion metabolism cell differentiation cell division and apoptosis 14 Intestinal calcium absorption is increased after feeding a low calcium diet or under conditions of increased calcium needs such as during growth via a parathyroid hormone PTH vitamin D mediated process 3 A lowering of serum calcium levels stimulates the secretion of PTH that then activates the renal conversion of inactive 25 hydroxyvitamin D to the active hormonal metabolite 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D At the intestine 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D acting through a nuclear receptor stimulates transcription of vitamin D mediated genes including calbindin D involved in calcium transport thereby acting as the primary hormonal regulator of active intestinal calcium transport 3 It is thus likely that any putative key molecular player in calcium absorption such as CaT1 or ECaC1 should be a prime target for hormonal regulation by 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D However to date neither CaT1 nor ECaC1 expression has been shown to be related to serum 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D or vitamin D status 10 16 We have developed 17 18 19 20 21 22 a unique human intestinal cell culture model of vitamin D mediated transepithelial Ca transport using Caco 2 cells a colon adenocarcinoma cell line This cell line spontaneously differentiates in culture and expresses biochemical and morphological characteristics of well differentiated small intestine like enterocytes 17 23 We have previously shown that Caco 2 cells possess a classical nuclear vitamin D receptor 18 that directly mediates vitamin D dependent gene expression 22 and exhibits a high degree of specificity for various vitamin D metabolites and analogs 20 21 Most importantly in response to short term 24 h 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D treatment Caco 2 cells increase transepithelial calcium transport 17 and calbindin D 9K expression 19 a cytosolic calcium binding protein Kinetic analysis of Ca transport across Caco 2 monolayers grown on permeable filter supports indicated that 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D treatment increased the V max of Ca transport 17 which would be consistent with a vitamin D dependent increase in the number of calcium transporters In the current paper we have used the Caco 2 cell culture model to demonstrate that CaT1 mRNA is preferentially expressed in the human enterocyte compared to ECaC1 and for the first time demonstrate that 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D treatment can cause a rapid and marked increase in CaT1 mRNA expression in the enterocyte These observations suggest a likely important role for this calcium transporter in vitamin D dependent calcium absorption Results and Discussion CaT1 is expressed in Caco 2 cells We initially addressed the question of whether Caco 2 cells express ECaC1 or the closely related CaT1 gene This is important because it has been suggested that because of the high degree of sequence similarity 97 between the CaT1 and ECaC1 genes care should be taken in interpreting data obtained by hybridization PCR or other methodologies based on nucleotide sequences 24 First the PCR product derived from the putative ECaC1 or CaT1 gene was purified and sequenced Based on new sequence information GenBank accession number AF304464 ECaC1 and AF365927 CaT1 25 the nucleotides determined following the sequencing of our PCR product from Caco 2 cells was an identical match for CaT1 rather than ECaC1 data not shown Second the sequences of the coding region of the CaT1 and ECaC1 genes GenBank AF365927 and AF304464 indicate that an additional identification step based on restriction fragment length polymorphism RFLP analysis could also be used to confirm the identity of the CaT1 mRNA in Caco 2 cells As described in the Method section a 259 bp PCR product was generated with a second set of PCR primers that would specifically encompass a differential Bgl1 restriction enzyme cut site present in CaT1 but not ECaC1 Prior to electrophoresis on a 2 agarose gel the amplified PCR product was either left untreated or treated with Bgl1 or BssHII restriction enzymes There is no predicted BssHII cut site in our amplified region of either CaT1 or ECaC1 based on the recently published sequence of these two genes GenBank AF365927 and AF304464 Thus BssHII should serve as negative control for the restriction enzyme digestion step In contrast the location of the single BglI cut site in CaT1 should result in the generation of two smaller bands 180 bp and 80 bp if the amplified PCR product was CaT1 Since ECaC1 does not have a predicted BglI site in the amplified PCR product no smaller bands should result if ECaC1 was being amplified in the PCR reaction As shown in Figure 1 we found that there were two smaller bands of the predicted size and no larger 259 bp band remaining after Bgl1 digestion confirming the identity of CaT1 as the product being amplified in Caco 2 cell In addition BssHII restriction enzyme digestion did not result in smaller bands consistent with a likely specific action of Bgl1 digestion of CaT1 under the digestion conditions used In addition further attempts at PCR amplification of Caco 2 cell RNA with other PCR primers designed to specifically amplify ECaC1 did not result in an amplified product under our conditions data not shown Thus based on this collective information we conclude that CaT1 but not ECaC1 is expressed in Caco 2 cells It needs to be pointed out however that since Caco 2 cells are not derived from normal human intestinal tissue it is possible that ECaC1 could be expressed in the human intestine However our observation in Caco 2 cells is consistent with the recent report by Barley and colleagues 16 indicating a high expression level of CaT1 ECaC2 in human intestine based on Northern blotting and similar findings by Peng et al 25 using quantitative real time PCR for CaT1 who also noted the apparent absence of ECaC1 CaT2 in human intestinal tissue CaT1 mRNA is regulated by 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D Having established the identity of CaT1 in Caco 2 cells we then studied the effect of 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D treatment on CaT1 mRNA expression If CaT1 is an important regulator of intestinal calcium absorption it is likely that it would be regulated by 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D As shown in Figure 2 treatment of cells for 24 h with 10 7mol L 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D caused a 10 fold increase p 0 001 ANOVA n 10 studies in CaT1 mRNA expression To our knowledge this is the first demonstration in either experimental animals or human tissue that intestinal CaT1 expression is up regulated by 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D This finding may provide an important molecular key to understand the mechanism of vitamin D mediated intestinal calcium absorption Moreover given the potentially central role of this epithelial calcium channel as an important modulator of cellular calcium influx in a variety of cell types 15 it will be of interest to investigate whether the vitamin D effect on CaT1 expression extends beyond the enterocyte Vitamin D status is known to influence a wide range of physiological systems including cells involved in the immune system endocrine function prostate skin and muscle Vitamin D effects on CaT1 expression and cellular calcium influx could thereby theoretically modulate intracellular calcium and cell signaling in a variety of different tissues providing insight into understanding the physiological effects of vitamin D throughout the body Peng and colleagues 26 have reported that the steroid hormone androgen influences CaT1 mRNA expression in LNCaP prostate cells We have not yet evaluated the effects of androgens on CaT1 expression in Caco 2 cells However we have found S Taparia unpublished studies that all steroid hormones do not share this effect on CaT1 expression because 17 estradiol 10 7mol L for 24 h had no effect on CaT1 mRNA expression in Caco 2 cells In any case the demonstrated effect of 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D on CaT1 mRNA shown here in Caco 2 cells is consistent with the idea that the active metabolite of vitamin D could increase the number of CaT1 calcium transporters in the plasma membrane and could therefore be responsible for the higher rates of calcium influx seen across the brush border membrane in vitamin D replete animals 9 27 thereby playing a key gatekeeper role in increasing the efficiency of intestinal calcium absorption and maintaining calcium homeostasis 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D causes a rapid and marked up regulation of CaT1 expression In another series of studies we addressed the temporal and dose response effect of 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D on CaT1 mRNA expression in Caco 2 cells As shown in Figure 3 the response of CaT1 mRNA to 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D is rapid n 6 studies Treatment with 10 7mol L 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D increased 2 fold CaT1 mRNA by 2 h the earliest time point investigated and clearly elevated CaT1 expression by 5 fold at 4 h with progressively higher expression up to 14 fold at the later time points The relationship between the dose of 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D treatment and CaT1 mRNA response was investigated in a third set n 3 studies of experiments at 10 9 10 8 and 10 7mol L 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D for 24 h In these studies there was a significant increase in CaT1 mRNA levels at the lowest dose 10 9mol L of 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D studied Figure 4 while a slightly higher level of CaT1 mRNA expression was observed at 10 8mol L 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D no further effect on CaT1 mRNA was seen with another 10 fold increase in 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D concentration The rapid time course of induction and sensitivity of CaT1 mRNA response to 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D treatment supports the idea that CaT1 could play a role as a gatekeeper of intestinal calcium absorption We have previously reported that it takes from 12 16 h following 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D treatment of Caco 2 cells to first appreciate an increase in saturable transcellular calcium transport 19 This temporal response is similar to the 8 16 h observed for the achievement of maximal rates of intestinal calcium absorption in vivo following 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D treatment of vitamin D deficient chickens 28 Future studies of the time course of CaT1 protein expression and localization of this protein to the brush border will be necessary to confirm this point but must await the development of a suitable CaT1 antibody CaT1 induction precedes the increase in calbindin D 9kmRNA expression It has been argued 7 that the cytosolic vitamin D dependent calcium binding protein calbindin D 9K is the likely rate limiting step in vitamin D induced intestinal calcium absorption However despite a considerable amount of associative evidence 7 there has long been some controversy on this issue 29 30 31 because of apparent discrepancies in the temporal pattern of calbindin D9k induction compared to calcium absorption following 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D treatment in experimental animals Thus in the current study to evaluate a possible gatekeeper role for CaT1 in vitamin D mediated calcium transport we compared the time course of 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D induction of calbindin D9k mRNA and CaT1 mRNA in Caco 2 cells In Caco 2 cells the mRNA for both calbindin D and CaT1 can be detected by PCR in the absence of vitamin D treatment The concentration of 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D in the basal cell culture medium is approximately 10 12mol L As illustrated in Figure 5 the time course of vitamin D dependent mRNA induction of the two genes clearly differs with CaT1 expression responding much earlier than calbindin D9k There is no evident induction of calbindin D mRNA by 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D in Caco 2 cells up to 8 h post treatment In these experiments calbindin D mRNA was 3 fold greater than control by 24 h In contrast CaT1 mRNA was clearly increased 5 fold by 4 h post 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D treatment in the same cells These observations will need to be expanded in the future to include measurement of the relevant proteins However such association studies will not completely settle the question of the relative importance of either of these vitamin D induced genes in the calcium transport response to 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D Those questions will be likely answered more directly in the future by individually altering the expression of these calcium transport genes in transfected cell lines or in transgenic animal models Given what is already known about the characteristics of the epithelial calcium channels and calbindin D it is a plausible hypothesis that CaT1 and calbindin D could work in tandem to maintain high rates of calcium absorption Studies in human duodenal biopsy specimens have found a significant correlation between CaT1 mRNA and calbindin D mRNA expression 16 Thus as a working hypothesis we propose that during times of dietary calcium stress or during periods of high calcium demand CaT1 expression in the enterocyte is increased by a vitamin D dependent mechanism This regulatory genomic response of the enterocyte would result in an increase in the brush border membrane content of CaT1 calcium influx channels that could function as a gatekeeper mechanism to augment the rate of calcium entry across the apical membrane 9 However given that there is a Ca dependent negative feedback mechanism to limit calcium entry through the channel by maintaining the channel in the closed position 14 15 there must be a way to remove calcium from the vicinity of the cytosolic face of the channel to optimize and sustain calcium influx rates The coordinated vitamin D dependent induction of the cytosolic calcium binding protein calbindin D could serve this function when the need for transcellular calcium flux is high by acting directly or indirectly as a molecular sponge and selectively removing calcium ions from the CaT1 channel and or to buffer increases in intracellular calcium thereby preventing premature inactivation of this I CRAC channel 15 Calbindin D could also play its traditionally conceived role as a calcium chaperone protein to facilitate the transfer of calcium through the cytosol 32 and perhaps delivery of Ca to the basolateral ATP dependent calcium pump for extrusion out of the enterocyte 33 Conclusions These observations are the first to demonstrate regulation of CaT1 expression by 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D in the human enterocyte and are consistent with a new model of intestinal calcium absorption wherein vitamin D mediated changes in brush border membrane CaT1 levels could be the primary gatekeeper regulating homeostatic modulation of intestinal calcium absorption efficiency Materials and Methods Conditions of cell culture Caco

primers described above subjected to electrophoresis on a 1 low melting point agarose gel and purified for sequence verification The DNA sequencing facility at Tufts University sequenced the PCR product to identify whether the amplified PCR product from Caco 2 cells was either CaT1 or the closely related ECaC1 sequence Because of the high nucleotide similarity of CaT1 and ECaC1 97 an additional identification step based on restriction fragment length polymorphism RFLP analysis was also conducted to confirm the identity of CaT1 in Caco 2 cells PCR products were generated using the

product with a specific restriction site that makes it possible to clearly distinguish between CaT1 and ECaC1 using the restriction enzymes Bgl1 New England Biolabs In this PCR amplified product there is no predicted Bgl1 restriction enzyme site in the corresponding ECaC1 sequence In contrast the presence of this Bgl1 cut site in the CaT1 sequence will result in two smaller bands 180 and 80 bp after digestion with the endonuclease The endonuclease digested and undigested PCR samples were electrophoresed on a 2 agarose gel and the bands were visualized with ethidium bromide staining The size
