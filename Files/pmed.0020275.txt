                            Dementia remains an incurable condition and its increasing prevalence is a deeply        worrying aspect of the graying of the population An important question for researchers        is to establish whether dementia incidence prevalence and national history vary from one        location to another Incidence studies are particularly valuable for less biased comparison        of disease occurrence as well as being essential for policy makers Many biases can        however be introduced in such studies Dropout and mortality are particular reasons for        concern        Most of the numerous studies of dementia incidence have been restricted to single sites        Authors have frequently attempted to assess whether rates in a given study are similar to        those obtained elsewhere However variations between studies in the methodology employed        make such comparisons unreliable Where withincountry variations in incidence have been        noted as has happened in the US they have often been ascribed to methodological        differences but one cannot be certain whether this is the case        Risk factors for other chronic disorders common in old age notably cardiovascular        disease and cancers do vary in their prevalence between and within countries In the UK        for example the incidence of stroke is known to vary considerably across the country A        high proportion of dementia patients are thought to have a vascular component to their        dementia and it has been assumed that dementia incidence could be reduced if vascular risk        were better controlled One way to test this hypothesis is to compare sites with known        variation in vascular risk to assess whether there is also variation in the incidence of        dementia        The Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study MRC CFAS is a        multisite populationbased study in the UK of individuals aged  years and over living        in the community including institutions Diverse sites have been chosen with varying        exposures of potential importance in dementia A twophase twowave design has been        employed with the waves two years apart A standard set of instruments for the diagnosis        of dementia is used throughout CFAS now publishes incidence estimates from five sites        using likelihoodbased methods to compare the first two waves of interviews        Predictably incidence rates of dementia for both sexes were found to rise with age        from  per  person years at age  years to  per  person years at age         years and above The authors estimate that around  new cases of dementia occur in        England and Wales each year However there was no convincing evidence of variation across        sites and the incidence rates do not reflect the variations in the prevalence of possible        risk factors in these sites We therefore cannot assume that action to reduce vascular risk        will have a significant impact on dementia incidence        Another issue addressed by the study is previous suggestions in the literature that        dementia incidence rates might be lower in the oldest age groups The limited number of        respondents in these age groups in previous studies made it impossible to test this        hypothesis The CFAS however found no evidence of any such tailing off in incidence        which also has implications for policy and planning        The CFAS is important because it provides the first multisite comparison of incidence        rates in ethnically homogeneous populations within a country and within Europe using        identical methodology across sites The methodological approach developed for the study        will also be of value for researchers undertaking other studies of dementia incidence and        in other chronic disease studies involving a twophase selection process
