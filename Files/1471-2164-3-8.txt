 Introduction Homologous DNA recombination is a fundamental process in the biochemistry of DNA repair and replication which contributes to the generation of the genetic diversity critical for natural selection An important step in the recombination process is the pairing of homologous double stranded DNAs followed by the exchange of DNA strands between the paired molecules Experimental studies have shown that members of the archetypal RecA family of recombinases are central to this reaction in all extant forms of life 1 2 Studies in Escherichia coli have shown that although RecA is the principle protein involved in pairing and strand exchange unrelated proteins that have a much more restrictive phyletic distribution can also promote similar reactions in a RecA dependent or RecA independent manner 3 These alternative or additional mediators of homologous recombination include the well characterized prophage RecT phage Red and phage P22 ERF proteins 4 5 Similarly in yeast and vertebrates the RAD52 protein is involved in the pairing and strand exchange reaction and can promote recombination in a RAD51 the eukaryotic RecA homolog dependent or independent manner 6 The RecT protein works in conjunction with the RecE nuclease 7 and was initially described in genetic studies on the complemention of mutations in the RecBCD pathway of DNA repair 8 9 10 Biochemically RecT has been shown to bind single stranded ss DNA 3 overhang regions generated by the RecE nuclease and promote strand exchange between homologous DNA partners by assisting the pairing of complementary single stranded regions 4 10 The reaction catalyzed by the RecT RecE system is similar to that described for the phage exonuclease exo Red and the single strand annealing protein Red The similarity between these two systems is further extended by the observation that the RecT E system can complement mutations in the exo Red system 10 12 In eukaryotes RAD52 protein has been shown to exhibit properties similar to those of RecT and Red proteins it binds ssDNA and promotes strand exchange via the pairing of complementary single strands 6 13 In vitro studies on quaternary structures have shown that the single strand annealing proteins SSAPs RecT Red ERF and RAD52 form similar helical super structures 14 15 16 17 This has led to the proposal that RecT Red ERF and the eukaryotic RAD52 function in an analogous fashion and even are structural homologs 14 However no sequence or secondary structural similarities have been noticed between different SSAPs and current understanding of their evolutionary history and phyletic range remains poor Here we describe the results of an in depth sequence analysis of these proteins and delineate their evolutionary relationships and phyletic horizon in available genomes We show that in spite of the functional similarities and the similar quaternary structures there are three distinct superfamilies of SSAPs namely the RecT Red RAD52 and ERF that appear to be evolutionarily unrelated to each other These superfamilies show a wide distribution in viral and cellular genomes but appear to have originally evolved in large DNA bacteriophages Through an analysis of the contextual information provided by the predicted operons in which the SSAPs occur we predict several previously undetected functional connections of these proteins which might shed new light on the corresponding DNA repair recombination pathways Results RecT and Red are evolutionarily related and define a widespread family of DNA recombination proteins Several lines of evidence including genetic analyses and similarities in biochemistry and quaternary structures suggest that the E coli RecT and phage Red proteins are functionally equivalent as mediators of single strand exchange in DNA recombination 10 12 However no sequence similarity has been detected between these proteins leaving their actual evolutionary relationships unresolved In order to gain a better understanding of their functions and origins we undertook a detailed sequence analysis of these two proteins using iterative sequence profile searches with the PSI BLAST program with a inclusion threshold of 01 iterated until convergence Such searches with Red proteins from different lambdoid bacteriophages as queries retrieved not only other obvious Red homologs but also the RecT protein family For example searches initiated with the Red homolog PF161 protein Genbank gi 9836834 amino acids 1 to 188 from Borrelia hermsii 18 detected the E coli RecT protein in the 5 thiteration with significant expectation e values 3 10 3 Subsequent iterations retrieved several more RecT related proteins from diverse sources Further transitive searches with the proteins detected in the above searches resulted in the identification of more divergent homologs such as a protein termed the enterohemolysin associated protein EHAP1 from E coli 19 and its orthologs in Salmonella Fig 1 An examination of the pairwise alignments generated by these searches showed that all these proteins shared a characteristic set of residues including two highly conserved aromatic residues at the N and C termini respectively and two consecutive acidic residues near the C terminus These observations strongly suggested that RecT and Red along with several other proteins could be unified into a single protein superfamily with a core conserved domain of approximately 200 amino acid residues A multiple alignment of all members of the RecT Red superfamily was generated using the T_coffee program followed by adjustments based on the PSI BLAST search results This alignment was used to predict their secondary structure using the JPRED and PHD methods these predictions pointed to an domain with a core of five strands and five helices Fig 1 Some of the strongest conservation is concentrated in the long helices and the pattern includes some charged or polar residues suggesting that they are probably exposed and participate in the protein protein and protein DNA interactions that are typical of this superfamily helices 2 3 4 in Fig 1 The conserved regularly spaced hydrophobic residues in the RecT Red superfamily are predicted to be buried allowing these domains to assume a globular structure Experimental studies have shown that the strand transfer reaction mediated by RecT and its binding to dsDNA are sensitive to Mg 2concentrations and it was proposed that the levels of free Mg 2could regulate RecT activity 4 Similarly Red has been shown to promote single strand annealing in a Mg 2 dependent manner 20 In this context the conservation of the two C terminal acidic residues in the majority of members of this superfamily suggests that these might be involved in the coordination of Mg 2and implies that the metal ion dependent conformational switching is likely to be a generic feature of this family Phylogenetic analyses of the RecT Red superfamily using the least squares and maximum likelihood methods distinguished three distinct groups namely the RecT like the Red like and the EHAP1 like families Fig 2 Previously the RecT proteins have been known from very few bacteria and Red has only been detected in and closely related phages However we showed that the Red family is widespread in bacteria such as Borrelia hermsii Xylella Ureaplasma Listeria Streptococcus pyogenes Mesorhizobium loti The RecT family is predominantly seen in the low GC Gram positive bacteria such as Bacillus Streptococcus Lactococcus and Listeria and their phages Fig 2 E coli and Legionella pneumophila are the only two proteobacteria that possess this protein suggesting that they might have acquired RecT via a relatively recent horizontal transfer from Gram positive bacteria The sporadic distribution of the RecT and Red family proteins in bacterial genomes and their presence in phages suggest that these proteins ultimately are of phage origin and have been co opted by the bacterial DNA recombination repair systems Consistent with this practically all the bacterial members of these families appear to belong to prophages or their remnants as they are mostly in the neighborhood of what appear to be clearly phage derived genes The EHAP1 like family is extremely divergent and represented thus far only in E coli and the closely related Salmonella Practically all members of the RecT Red superfamily are single domain proteins showing extended similarity to each other throughout their globular regions The only exceptions are the E coli EHAP1 and the PF161 protein encoded in the Borrelia hermsii circular plasmid which are fused to C terminal fragments of the ERF protein see below ERF defines a superfamily of SSAPs that are evolutionarily distinct from the RecT Red super family The ERF protein of phage P22 is involved in the circularization of the linear dsDNA phage genome upon entry into the host cell 21 22 23 Experimental studies have shown that mutations in ERF are complemented by Red and that in vitro ERF adopts quaternary structures analogous to those of Red and RecT 14 17 24 25 However in the comprehensive analysis of the RecT Red superfamily no statistically significant similarity could be detected between these proteins and the ERF proteins To explore the evolutionary affinities of the ERF domains we carried out a sequence profile analysis as described above for the RecT case using transitive PSI BLAST analysis As a result of these searches homologs of ERF encoded in several bacterial and phage genomes from diverse taxa were identified The alignments generated in these searches consistently pointed to a region of approximately 150 amino acids that is conserved in all these proteins with a characteristic motif of the form GuXXoYhp YXhXXhh where G is glycine Y tyrosine u is a tiny residue h hydrophobic p is a polar residue o is an alcohol residue is a basic residue and X is any residue Fig 3 This suggested that ERF was the prototype of a family of conserved bacterial domains Secondary structure prediction based on the multiple alignment of the ERF domain suggests a globular fold with five helices and three or four strands Fig 3 The above mentioned motif that is typical of this family is associated with helix 4 of this domain given the presence of conserved basic residues it may be critical for DNA binding and strand transfer activity of the ERF like proteins Additionally in the loop between helices 4 and 5 of the ERF domain there is a universally conserved acidic motif of the form DXD Analogous to the RecT superfamily this acidic dyad might coordinate a divalent cation and undergo a conformational change dependent on metal binding However the average size of the core domains the patterns of conserved residues and the predicted secondary structures of the RecT Red and ERF domains show no correspondence to each other implying that there is no direct evolutionary link between these protein groups ERF homologs are encoded by the genomes of several temperate phages of Gram positive bacteria and proteobacteria additionally we detected members of this superfamily in Listeria and in all the circular plasmids and one linear plasmid of Borrelia burgdorferi Fig 4 Thus like the RecT Red superfamily the ERF family is likely to have emerged in the temperate phages and was disseminated to the Borrelia circular plasmids and some bacterial genomes via prophages Detection of bacterial homologs of RAD52 and identification of an aberrant HhH domain in these proteins The baker s yeast protein RAD52 and its paralog RAD59 define a small family of proteins thus far represented in fungi vertebrates and the early branching ameboid eukaryote Entamoeba histolytica Rad52 functions in conjunction with the RecA ortholog the RAD51 recombinase in double strand break repair and meiotic recombination 6 RAD52 binds ssDNA during recombination and also shows a quaternary organization similar to those of RecT Red and ERF 16 26 However RAD52 like proteins showed no detectable sequence similarity with either the ERF or the RecT Red like proteins Sequence searches initiated with the conserved globular region of the eukaryotic RAD52 proteins readily detected their homologs from other eukaryotes and at convergence also retrieved from the database certain bacterial proteins such as DR0423 from Deinococcus and CAC1936 from Clostridium respectively with border like statistical significance e 05 These bacterial proteins form a small family that is additionally represented in Salmonella paratyphi A the temperate bacteriophage u136 of Lactococcus lactis ORF252 encoded protein and a Shiga toxin converting phage from E coli Iterative profile searches initiated with CAC1936 from Clostridium acetobutylicum and its S paratyphi A ortholog correspondingly retrieved S cerevisiae RAD52 and its eukaryotic homologs with borderline e values at convergence 0 043 The alignment between these bacterial proteins and the eukaryotic Rad52 homologs was co linear throughout the entire length of their shared globular region and the Gibbs sampling procedure detected two motifs of greater than 20 residues with a probability of chance occurrence in these proteins less than 10 18 Fig 5 In addition to the similar conservation pattern separate secondary structure predictions for both the eukaryotic RAD52 family and their potential bacterial homologs showed a complete concordance of the predicted structural elements between RAD52 and the bacterial proteins strongly suggesting that they all belong to a single homologous superfamily hereinafter the RAD52 superfamily The secondary structure predictions showed that the Rad52 superfamily proteins adopt a structure with interspersed helices and strands Fig 5 Additionally fold predictions using 3DPSSM E value 0085 corresponding to a 90 confidence in the prediction and the hybrid fold method Z score 19 5 predicted the presence of a potential Helix hairpin Helix HhH fold in members of the RAD52 superfamily The HhH domain is a small nucleic acid binding module comprised of two helices joined by a central loop hairpin which functions as the DNA binding moiety of numerous repair and recombination proteins 27 28 Two HhH modules are predicted in the core conserved domain of the RAD52 family the first one bounded by the predicted helices 2 and 3 and the second one bounded by helices 5 and 6 Fig 5 Although these predicted HhH modules are very divergent in sequence from the typical versions the hairpin in both HhH modules of the RAD52 family proteins is bounded by small residues typically glycine this conforms to the signature motif characteristic of the classical HhH modules 28 29 However in the case of the RAD52 superfamily the predicted HhH modules appear to have been welded into a large globular superstructure that maintained its evolutionary distinctness over time The conservation pattern and predicted structural elements of the RAD52 superfamily are distinct from those predicted for the ERF and RecT Red superfamilies Fig 1 3 5 supporting the lack of a direct evolutionary relationship between these proteins The RAD52 superfamily shows a sporadic phyletic distribution and even in the crown group eukaryotes might have been secondarily lost in certain lineages such as plants nematodes and insects The sporadic distribution of this family among phylogenetically distant bacteria along with its presence in several prophages suggests that like the RecT Red and ERF superfamilies at least the bacterial RAD52 proteins might be of predominantly phage origin The core of the eukaryotic recombination system appears to have been inherited from the system present in the common ancestor shared with the archaea 29 However RAD52 is thus far absent in all archaeal genomes and is restricted to a single orthologous group in the eukaryotes 29 Thus it appears plausible that eukaryotic RAD52 was ultimately derived through lateral transfer either from a bacterial genome or directly from a viral source at a point at least predating the divergence of the crown group eukaryotes and Entamoeba Contextual information from gene neighborhoods provides details regarding functional interactions of the SSAPs with DNA recombination pathways The clustering of functionally related genes in prokaryotic genomes into co transcribed and co regulated units operons often allows functional assignments through the principle of guilt by association 30 31 32 Generally genes whose products physically interact to form a complex or are involved in successive steps in a biochemical pathway form operons that are conserved over large evolutionary distances 30 On previous occasions we have used gene neighborhoods or operons to predict novel DNA repair complexes and their components 33 Accordingly a similar approach was applied to the three families of SSAPs RecT Red ERF Rad52 to shed light on their functional links Notably the genes encoding the three evolutionarily distinct SSAPs co occurred with similar sets of DNA repair recombination related proteins Figs 2 4 In at least one case each of them was found adjacent to the gene for the single strand binding protein SSB an OB fold protein that binds ssDNA Figs 2 4 This association ties in with the function of the SSAPs in single strand annealing suggesting that they closely interact with SSB It has been suggested in the case of RecT that it may compete with SSB for binding single strand overhangs and thereby make them available for the annealing process 3 Similar interactions between other SSAPs and SSB that probably coats the ssDNA generated by nucleases appear likely Genes for SSAPs from all the 3 distinct superfamilies may also occur adjacent to or in the vicinity of genes encoding nucleases or Holliday junction resolvases HJRs Genes for RecT Red superfamily proteins are associated with genes encoding a type exonuclease LE of the type II restriction enzyme fold RecE which also might be a divergent member of this fold and a nuclease of the Endonuclease VII EndoVII fold 7 34 Fig 2 The ERF superfamily genes are associated with a RusA superfamily nuclease HJR and EndoVII fold nucleases Fig 4 34 Furthermore the Borrelia plasmids that encode ERF also almost always additionally encode a type exonuclease even if it is not the adjacent gene In a single instance in the Gram positive bacterium Ruminococcus albus the gene encoding a RAD52 superfamily protein occurs adjacent to a gene for a type exonuclease These nucleases probably contribute to the repair process in which SSAPs are involved by providing the initial break in the dsDNA and or in digesting the nicked target to generate ssDNA The RecT and Red family proteins often co occur with the SbcC gene that encodes an ABC ATPase with a large coiled coil segment These proteins are known to cooperate with SbcD nuclease of the calcineurin like phosphoesterase superfamily and to degrade dsDNA in the 3 5 direction generating ssDNA 35 36 It seems likely that RecT Red proteins at least in certain cases function in conjunction with the SbcCD pathway by utilizing the single stranded regions generated by the SbcCD nuclease Additionally several genes whose functions are less clear tend to co occur with the genes coding for the SSAPs These include DNA methyltransferases and the primosomal protein DnaD from low GC Gram positive bacteria 37 that co occur with both ERF and RecT superfamily members Figs 2 4 The poorly characterized phage or prophage specific genes that are frequently observed in these neighborhoods include ORF15 Streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage 7201 ORF86 ORF100a Staphylococcus aureus temperate phage SLT and ORF364 bacteriophage 31 1 Figs 2 4 Secondary structure predictions indicate a high helical content for these proteins It is likely that these helical proteins are phage innovations that could function as adaptors in the recombination pathway either as accessory protein protein interacting domains or as DNA binding domains Evidence for convergent operon evolution and in situ non orthologous displacement of genes in operons encoding SSAPs A superposition of the gene neighborhood information upon the phylogenetic trees for the SSAP superfamilies provides insights into the evolutionary processes that led to the emergence of the operons that include the SSAP genes As discussed above the RecT Red superfamily clearly splits into three distinct families Fig 2 The phylogenetic tree shows that SbcC co occurs with the SSAP once within Red family and once within the RecT family An examination of the tree and the respective gene neighborhoods suggests that independent juxtaposition of SbcC with Red like and RecT like genes on two separate occasions is the most parsimonious explanation The alternative explanation namely that the gene coding for the common ancestor of the Red and RecT already co occurred with the sbcC gene is far less likely because it would require over 10 independent losses of this apparently functionally advantageous organization in different bacterial and bacteriophage lineages Likewise the observation that in one or more cases genes encoding each of the SSAPs co occur in the same predicted operon with SSB or a type exonuclease suggests that similar operon structures may also emerge independently in evolution Thus the same or analogous operon organizations may emerge convergently on multiple occasions probably due to the selective pressure arising from the strong interactions between the SSAPs and their functional partners such as SbcC SSB and LE The distribution of the gene neighborhoods in which a member of the RecT superfamily occurs next to the RecE on the phylogenetic tree of the RecT Red superfamily indicates that the RecE RecT combination was probably the ancestral state for at least the RecT and EHAP1 families Fig 2 This implies that on at least two occasions the gene for endonuclease displaced the functionally analogous recE gene and became the adjacent gene to RecT Fig 2 That this displacement might have occurred by in situ insertion of a non orthologous gene is suggested by the detection on three separate occasions of unusual remnants of pre existing genes The RecT Red superfamily members namely EHAP1 from the enterobacteria and PF161 from Borrelia hermsii contain a small C terminal fragment of the core conserved domain of the ERF superfamily which is located C terminal of their bona fide RecT Red domains These fragments of the ERF protein are closely related to other ERF domains from related organisms and are unlikely to fold into the native conformation characteristic of the full length ERF domain For example the ERF fragment fused to the EHAP1 RecT Red domain is closely related to the P22 phage ERF domain This suggests that in each of these cases a RecT superfamily gene was inserted in frame into a pre existing ERF gene leaving behind only a non functional fragment of it Fig 2 In a very similar case the bacterial RAD52 like protein from a Shiga toxin encoding temperate phage is fused to an extreme C terminal fragment that is nearly identical to the C terminal most portion of the P22 ERF protein In this case it appears that the pre existing ERF gene was displaced through the insertion of a bacterial RAD52 like gene Interestingly and in the same vein the RecT proteins from Bacillus species contain a short C terminal acidic module that is missing in other RecT proteins but is highly similar to the C terminal region of SSBs particularly those from Gram positive bacteria data not shown This suggests that at some stage in their evolution the Bacillus recT gene protein has recombined with the gene coding for SSB which might even have resulted in a functional replacement of an SSB with an SSAP Thus it appears likely that functionally equivalent genes may displace their analogs in operons via insertion into the same position Conclusions We show that functionally similar SSAPs belong to at least three evolutionarily distinct superfamilies We unify the Red and RecT proteins and their homologs which have not been reported as being related at the sequence level into a single superfamily supporting the notion that these proteins share a similar mechanism of action The second superfamily typified by the ERF proteins is predominantly found in bacteriophages and is also present on all circular plasmids from Borrelia suggesting a role in the recombination of these plasmids The third superfamily typified by the yeast RAD52 protein and previously detected only in eukaryotes was shown to include bacterial and phage homologs and to contain a modified HhH domain By comparing the gene neighborhoods of the SSAPs we show that the predicted operons that include the SSAP genes evolve according to the LEGO principle In these operons the SSAP genes are linked to the genes for various DNAses and DNA repair related proteins such as SSB and SbcC which implies functional connections between the encoded proteins Evidence is presented of convergent emergence of similar SSAP encoding operons in different lineages and of in situ non orthologous displacement of functionally similar genes in these operons Materials and Methods Sequence searches of the non redundant NR and the unfinished genomes databases were done using the gapped BLAST and PSI BLAST programs 38 Iterative PSI BLAST searches used for in depth
