 i think i was one okay um first thing i thought of was was just the men that put the flyers on the door and i m a Christian and i think i feel sorry for people that have to do that you know what i mean i always pray for the guys but when i m sitting on my couch and it s and a man just walks up and puts his hand on my doorknob uh huh it s kind of frightening like whoa and i ve i ve kind of gotten used to it but it seems kind of bizarre to me to get used to some stranger just coming up from the side because you can t see them approaching your house you know they just uh huh yeah because they re just sort of coming from the side or whatever yeah exactly and when i m sitting here on the sofa cross stitching and all of a sudden somebody a man s got their hand on my door knob it s like uh like oh no and so i don t i don t like that and i guess the only way to prevent it would be just to pass a city ordinance to prevent that or uh huh you know so i think there s other ways to advertise other than a flyer on your door yeah plus uh you know look at the you know the besides the pollution the the aspect of invasion of privacy there s a big pollution aspect too i find i throw out a lot of those flyers and i have no interest in uh huh whatever they are i i do i find and and they go alone with that just the things you get in the mail right uh huh i you know my my name being sold if i if i give money to the World Wild Wildlife Federation you know it s a it s a i feel it s an invasion of privacy to receive so many pieces of junk mail because they sell my address uh huh right right i do too even the credit card things and like we have a Visa and we ve got we get ten applications probably a month uh huh yeah that s i agree yeah and it for other Visas and it s like wait a minute we have a commitment with the company we re with if i want a Visa from your company i ll call you yeah i ll call you that s right and they all say that they re the best Visa but you know i definitely have the one that i ve yeah yeah you know very rarely do you receive one that has a real low interest rate they re always more expensive and they uh you know if you stay if you stay with a good one for the while you get a good credit rating and you get a good um a good credit line so you don t like to i don t like to bother with it yeah right it shows stability but um now i also thought uh i i get calls i m a housewife so i m home a lot in the day um uh huh and i i get probably four calls probably four a day probably three day a norm but seems like it seems like it s more than that of phone calls and and it i ve gotten to where i ve really had to say okay wait a minute this you know it s okay to be nice and sometimes you know i feel like God says talk to this person or something but most of the time i just have gotten where i can say i m not interested thank you and i just hang you know and i hang up real nicely but yeah huh um i know a few months ago i i would feel that i had to explain to them that i m on the other line or i m in the middle and it s i ve just come to a realization that i don t have to explain to this stranger what i m doing it and give excuses that s it s okay just to say i m not interested and go ahead and hang up but i i don t know i don t think most people are secure enough to probably answer um hum that s right like that and therefore i feel it s an invasion of privacy because i thought all these people share you know what they re doing even though it s none of the business yeah that s right it takes uh uh huh and i did it for a long time and and i just i feel like that was one i thought of that right off yeah they ask you a lot of they ask you a lot of personal questions and they yep and you know they and they just keep talking to you too i i i find that a big pain yeah i think yeah right they don t want to let you go they don t believe you if you re on another line long distance and they just want to keep going and going and stuff so uh huh yeah i think do you find that as a woman that you probably see more things of invasions of privacy than uh a man would um yeah i probably do i feel like i don t know i m a Christian i feel like women are more usually deceived you i feel like i don t think that s necessarily a bad thing because God gave us husbands and fathers to help look out for us but i know that during the day yeah the when the cults come by they come by during the day and it says in the Bible that be weary of the people coming door to door trying to proselytize the silly women lay captive with gossip and stuff and i see that they don t come home when my husband s here they don t come to my house normally when my husband s here they come when i m here alone and i notice that and it s almost like uh huh there s a a subconscious understanding i think it s spiritual that you can rationally explain the subconscious understanding that you know there s there s a more gullibility here when there s not a huh a man present i don t think i m less than a man because of that i but i see that and God s really shown me that and i don t talk to them i don t try and witness to them don t try and convert them i just say you can you can either you can come back when my husband s here uh huh yeah if you d like to but we re Christians good bye and i shut the door and that s it and i m not ugly to them you know what i mean yeah what you know what s really funny um is that i get calls you know mostly telephone sales people that i just you know that want to start beating my ear you know uh huh right and um and then they start asking you know well is your wife there and then i m thinking well how did they know i was married you know and i ll say i ll say no she s not because actually my wife and i live apart right now because i m in graduate school and um right so i only get to see her on Thursday through Monday and it s one of those things where they ll say oh your wife s not there and i ll say i ll say no oh well when is she going to be there and i m like well she s never going to be there yes she s never going to be here so you know yeah are you kidding oh man they do that really oh yeah uh huh and and they ll keep going until they get that out of you when your wife is going to be here because they want us to be here together because i guess uh it s it s see i she can talk you into that most a lot of women yeah maybe she would talk me in yeah maybe they ll a lot of women most women control the budgets and they control the money and they control the husband i mean most of the time that s how it works so so therefore i guess that they their they see that um yeah uh huh yeah they they do what do you think i just just threw out stuff tonight that uh i walked out of a grocery store and a fellow said you know for a dollar you can win this five hundred dollars worth of groceries so they feel like i can talk her into and normally when you see these things it s normally um uh a church you know that s doing a raffle or it s some type of boy scouts or it s some type of group or whatever and i automatically you just think oh it s a raffle must be for the kids uh huh you know so you pull out your dollar and you fill out this coupon and uh huh and then when you look at it as you walking away you see that it s for some sales pitch of some kind where they re going to you know and i find that a big invasion of privacy i just i m from then on in it s like oh this makes me angry you know now you have to question everybody on what they re doing now you sure this goes to such and such organization uh huh and you sure you re with multiple dystrophy muscular dystrophy or whatever i find that a big invasion of privacy too yeah uh huh because they they sort of pull that over on you you know like um like this is a charitable organization but actually it s not it s a come on so that they can get your name and phone number uh huh so because you always put your phone number down so they can call and tell you that you won huh but actually they started calling me telling me that i could you know buy a soft water softener and they called me for um what else other than water softener the same place called me for yeah oh great something else in my kitchen it was all kitchen stuff they put me on and they all called me you know and each one asked me when my wife was going to be here that s funny uh huh oh they re i know it s funny how you can look back as a Christian you can see how these things apply and they re true and in even even in people that aren t even Christians there s just a pattern uh huh that you can see in things like that i ve noticed that about the cults that they work our neighborhood in the day and they work them good and i consider that i kind of consider that an invasion of privacy but not so much as i do the other uh huh you know what i mean because but i do in to a degree there s also not a day to day occurrence it s not that often that they come by but i ve notice it s kind of gone down before when we first moved here it was pretty often but i ve noticed that though they really work in the day and you very rarely see them in the evening because the men are home and so well i think also you know in the the if men are home during the day they re they re um they might be unemployed men who might be more apt to um right you know be at the end of their rope you know and be looking for uh uh a salvation in the sense or looking for a uh saving grace you know i right looking for something yeah kind of depressed or something looking for something yeah they re searching for something yeah and also and also you know the woman at home during the day if if the housewife is at home um yeah i didn t think of that but yeah that s good she may be bored at the time so she ll spend a little bit more time to listen i think you know because she may have finished her work the kids may be taking a nap they may uh they may be playing some place you know or uh huh yeah right and and there s nobody but there s no husband there to come in and say wait a minute yeah you know i really think this is good and that well i don t know i think we need that but i know i need it um hum but um the only thing i would have thought of is my husband just said this he said public bathrooms he he said what public bathroom well he was teasing but he was just being smart because because you know you don t want to go in the public you know that s an invasion of privacy oh that s true that s true what can we do to solve that we can make the architects for all the buildings make private stalls for everyone i thought that was funny but uh huh what you know the the terrible thing is i don t know if you ve watched the news lately i i guess we just had something up here here i m in Baltimore Maryland uh huh so um i get you know we i saw some news out of like New Hampshire and a big thing in the courts right now is um they don t have enough stalls in women s bathrooms as they do men s bathrooms that s funny so that men you know because men design these things men can go in and use the urinal or use the toilet but their lines are always you know they go through much faster but but the women have to wait in long lines that are uncomfortable and and if they really have to go it s a very difficult problem to be you have to stand in line for an hour and uh and then the whole yeah i did hear that on the news
