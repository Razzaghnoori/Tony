        okay well i i       i guess if i was having a dinner party i depending on the number of people i might cook a like a brisket or a roast or a maybe a chicken dish   umhum   and um i guess i usually plan probably a lettuce salad and a a potato dish and we usually serve fresh fruit and uh then make a dessert   oh that sounds good   so that makes   um were not uh real wealthy at the moment last time i had people over for dinner we had lasagna and i used my mothers recipe i really like it its got um you cook the noodles and make and brown hamburger and put tomato sauce in with it and im not sure she even puts must be some Italian spices in there i cant remember but um for the cheese part you mix uh sour cream and cream cheese and cottage cheese   well that sounds good   and uh layer all that and its good and then then uh uh tossed salad and   that sounds good   and um  oh my goodness Diane get down from there  and uh lets see what else did i  serve with that corn yeah i made French bread with that one too i have a recipe thats  pretty good for that   bread do you have bread to go with it gosh   so   oh well lasagnas always wonderful for large crowds   yeah   ive heard you know ive heard a lot of people say uh it short cut on the cooking for lasagna they theyve told me that they go to Sams and buy a great big pan of lasagna   ive heard that Sams has a really good lasagna   so   in in fact i think i had it at a  at a party once it was good yeah   did you well i i know people that have have served it and they say gosh if you have company coming   easy   where you dont want to be always in the kitchen its easy and she said its they said its good so that thats always sounds good to me um i feel like i feel like im in the kitchen cooking a lot   yeah yeah   i cook  guess i cook a seems seems like i cook a lot of dinners so uh not always for company just for just for family   oh i know oh yeah   so feels like im often in the kitchen   not my favorite place but   but a time consuming place to be   a necessity   yeah right right so what   lets see what else do we like to have for trying to think what else i like to serve my mother likes to serve taco grandes   no i dont know what that is no i dont know what that is   have you ever had that you take a flour tortilla and you fry it like a taco shell and you uh for all the inside parts you brown hamburger and put some um   okay right   tomato sauce in it and and i like to just add Picante sauce to get the  Mexican flavor so you dont have to mess with spices and stuff  and then um   right   lets see and then and you heat up refried beans and you cut up tomatoes and lettuce and grated cheese and what you do to make it you take the shell and you spread the beans on first then you put the meat then you put the grated cheese and then you put um see whats next  then and i i usually put the cut up tomatoes next and then the um   right   lettuce and you can put uh like guacamole and  Katy im on the phone well get a towel or go change im on the phone um oh a little sour cream is good and and chopped olives   right right do you like to make your own guacamole   uh yeah   yeah weve we dont make it very often i guess but uh   no no i dont very often usually when we get avocados my kids just like to eat them plain so it yeah i just cut slices off and i like an avocado sandwich too   oh do they gosh oh gosh oh thats good thats good or its always good on top of something in the sandwich   yeah yeah   oh well we made i made guacamole that i would take to a pool party across the street the other day and and everyone there said they never made guacamole salad   what you want  uh where do they get it   so well i dont know i guess they dont have it at home   i cant imagine it would stay fresh long enough to i guess they just buy it at a restaurant when they eat it at a restaurant maybe   they must they just said they never had it at home so i i was concerned that i oh taking this you know taking this as a dip i thought gosh you know sometimes when we have it at home it it turns dark on the top so quickly so i just   yeah it helps if you it helps if you leave the pit in it   oh does that help   yeah if you leave the pit in the bowl with the thing especially while youre waiting before you serve it   okay well   thats supposed to help keep the um keep it from turning brown so quick   well ill have to remember that well i just i that day i just took extra lemon and just squeezed across the top and it really stayed longer than i ever thought it would so i thought maybe that was the trick   oh oh thats good that probably helps too   yeah yeah so oh well i guess we bought  a lot of weve been buying turkey lately instead of beef so even though you know the ground turkey its   do you want it oh yeah we have too   the meat is softer and i everybody seems to like it  so   do you want scrambled     weve most sometimes it seems to be cheaper too so we often buy the we buy the   yeah yeah if you get it on sale   yeah yeah so we bought that or we bought the the fillets and then the chicken or turkey nuggets and i dont think anybody in my house knows the difference unless you tell them so or in   yeah yeah i dont think mine know either in fact weve been getting lunch meat thats turkey too it costs less than the other and i dont know theres supposed to be something more healthy about it  poultry instead of the beef and   yeah yeah less cholesterol less cholesterol yeah right right well i guess thats probably all we need to do for today   pork yeah yeah i i cant think of any other specific things i like to serve um   i always like dessert   one sa lad that we always like my sisterinlaw always brings to family dinners is a i dont know what you call it uh you mix um cottage cheese and a package of JELLO and a thing of uh like CoolWhip   right right thats always good probably probably the only family recipe that we   thats good and quick and easy   we make and its really for special occasions is cheese cake and we take a  recipe from my grandmother and um   uhhuh   its probably fairly typical  cream cheese and egg and sugar in the insides but the
