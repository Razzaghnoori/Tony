 NATO continued to bomb Yugoslavia Scorecard Significant damage to the Serbs air defenses and command centers but not to Serb ground forces which are escalating their assaults on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo As of Friday morning NATO had lost no pilots Stress points 1 President Clinton told the Serbian people their leaders are to blame for dragging them into a disastrous war but so far the Serbs are rallying behind their leaders and blaming NATO 2 Congress and the American public are cautiously supporting the bombing but not the use of U S ground troops 3 Italy and Greece suggested resuming peace talks with the Serbs but U S officials say the allied coalition is holding firm 4 Russia and China are protesting loudly but aren t matching their harsh words with deeds The naive anti bombing spin NATO s bombs will never get the Serbs to accept NATO s peace plan The pro bombing spin NATO will soon attack the Serbs tanks and troops directly crippling their ability to slaughter the Kosovars The sophisticated anti bombing spin That s when the Serbs will start shooting down the allies planes For the overseas press reaction to the Kosovo airstrikes see and 3 26 99 Britain s highest court issued a new ruling on the fate of Chilean Gen Augusto Pinochet Spain is seeking his extradition from Britain on charges of murder torture kidnapping and conspiracy Pinochet wants to return to Chile where he is immune from prosecution The court ruled that 1 Pinochet can be extradited but 2 only for crimes that are illegal in both Britain and Chile Since Britain didn t sign the global treaty on crimes against humanity until 1988 this means Pinochet s alleged pre 1988 crimes nearly all the charges against him can t be used as a basis for extraditing him Both sides are happy Pinochet s supporters now expect him to escape extradition while human rights activists hail the ruling as a sign that dictators who have committed more recent crimes can be extradited 3 26 99 The forewoman of

important than Yugoslavia The optimistic spin As long as we re holding the purse strings and Primakov is hard up for cash he ll be back The in between spin Canceling the visit offered both sides a graceful way to avoid a face to face fight over Kosovo 3 24 99 Dr Jack Kevorkian is botching his murder trial The prosecution s case relies on a 60 Minutes video that shows Kevorkian giving a lethal injection to a terminally ill man after obtaining the man s consent Kevorkian acting as his own attorney is arguing that it was a mercy killing The judge has tried in vain to explain to Kevorkian that mercy killing is not a valid defense against a murder charge under Michigan law The spins on Kevorkian s courtroom performance in order of ascending irony 1 He s nuts 2 He doesn t understand the

balloon trip Their 20 day odyssey achieved aviation s most elusive goal beating more famous balloonists such as Steve Fossett and Richard Branson Their prize is 1 million half the cost of their balloon While applauding co pilot Brian Jones for overachieving the media concluded in retrospect that the pilot Bertrand Piccard had been destined for greatness since his grandfather was the first man to reach the stratosphere in a balloon in 1931 and his father had attained the oceans lowest depth 35 000 feet The spins 1 The trip was a triumph of human ingenuity skill and endurance 2 It was a triumph of meteorological communications and auto piloting technology which babysat the crew 3 It was a triumph of lucky weather For more on the species see David Plotz s 1998 piece 3 22 99 Duke
