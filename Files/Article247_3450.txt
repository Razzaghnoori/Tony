 The Day Ganja Defeated Wiener Schnitzel Dear Chris I want to close this quite enjoyable week with a plea for clemency Let s forgive Miller on two points One is his valuation of rock s lesser known collaborators Glenn Matlock John Cale etc At this point these come mostly as correctives to what s been drummed into our heads by countless bios and Time Life specials Flowers in the Dustbin is idiosyncratic enough that it s hard to imagine someone taking it as a definitive text on rock history believing that Lou Reed was a Warhol puppet or that Johnny Rotten s rheumy dynamism was simply a product of the Situationists And yes the latter perspective does owe more than a little to Savage s England s Dreaming This must have been said before but if someone named Jon Savage wasn t born to write about the Sex Pistols I don t know who was I ve also come to appreciate the subtlety of Miller s critique a bit more over the past few days While doing his best to expose the men behind the curtain Ertegun Warhol McLaren Miller rarely falls into the pat stance of so many social crit rock writers who unable to trust their ears rely upon unspoken formulations like Commercial Sucks and judge all music accordingly Miller actually tries to address the nuances that make a music succeed or fail which is pretty uncommon in his milieu He recognizes that even prefab target marketed music can have life changing effects on people As far as the reggae chapter I m not sure how much slack to cut him Is the inclusion of reggae a worthy redress of a common rock historical oversight or is it a cursory attempt to include still another music that discerning white college educated guys tend to have in their record collections I think you re right that Miller includes Jamaica as befits his mode of intellectual genealogy mostly to represent rock s effect on the world and vice versa The chapter even ends by imagining musicians in Kingston S o Paulo and Capetown as rock and roll rebels in Third World disguise But that s pretty parlous ground to dash over in eight pages Miller obviously enjoys the moment of The Harder They Come knocking The Sound of Music out of Jamaica s No 1 slot implying it was a triumph of rock n roll attitude over goody goody moralism Of course it s also a triumph of Jimmy Cliff over Julie Andrews ganja over Wiener schnitzel and isn t this a bit more important local art over cultural imperialism Moralism is certainly alive in today s rock mostly around subjects like the death penalty and Tibet but it seems quite ably offset by crass irony silly provocation emotional retardation of most pop culture If we re going to compare the moralism of this multimillion dollar culture industry with that at say Oscar Night I know which one I prefer The Carter administration What a time to first hear All Tomorrow s Parties Energy crisis Iran hostages Village People I think I first heard it during Reagan s second term Crack AIDS Huey Lewis How differently did Miller you and I hear it Obviously popular music needs some context in which to be understood But more and more of these disengaged bits of audio expressionism are floating around us daring us to make sense of them To listen intelligently which I believe is still possible you have to draw parallels be alert to links and exchanges respond both musically and socially Which to answer one of the first questions you asked me is one reason why it s hard to write well about rock But maybe we re all being too sloppy with this term rock Maybe Miller s actually right to end his chronology at 1977 a year that most of my favorite trends in this er cultural form began Did all of the music personalities and ideas that first captivated me the Sex Pistols Grandmaster Flash Public Enemy do nothing but recycle Miller s paradigms That would sure make things easy for us content providers but I don t think so Still maybe all this newer music born of new technologies multiculti babble youth media feedback loops falls under some other rubric we have yet to define The really trenchant analyses often come years later Maybe the etymological evolution from rock n roll to rock to whatever else we decide to call this intense edgy corrupt joyful form of musical expression is long overdue I m accepting suggestions Yours Chris
