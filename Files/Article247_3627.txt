 The 80s The Decade That Wouldn t End Of course I know you know that designs on plates with chocolate syrup are very late 80s And the fact as you note that they haven t gone away supports another of my theories that the 80s themselves haven t gone away either Just as 1960 63 was the end of the 50s and 1970 73 was the end of the 60s we are now a record breaking 17 years into the present decade culturally speaking These may be the end of the 80s we re now living through but I would argue that the 90s as a culturally distinct decade the Internet aside does not exist Cornish game hens drizzled chocolate syrup friends sleeping with friends husbands food plus adultery I am honored to be the vessel for such a thrilling outburst of classic Ephronism So How come this leitmotif informs your fiction and now your public e mails but not your movies except the one based on your novel On the other hand I guess You ve Got Mail involved quasi adultery and it did have the great Hanks scooping up the caviar scene And Mixed Nuts had a food title I like Mark Green I ve donated money to Mark Green Even though I guess he s a notch or two to my left I d vote for him happily against Hillary or Rudy for practically any office because he has a sense of humor and seems like a vital mentally healthy person of strong character So don t make me out to be some kind of right winger just because I voted for Giuliani and never much liked Bill Clinton and don t live on the Upper West Side Back to hurricane readiness before I sign off for the day Civil defense Yet again I m seeing all news through some 40s 50s early 60s prism Maybe I should have a doctor check this out Anyhow I have an impolitic question Have any of the big disasters we ve been serially warned about for the last 20 years multiple hurricanes one or two comets mobs of starving children post welfare reform etc actually occurred in New York The media boy cries wolf an awful lot OK maybe I m a conservative after all And indeed I m afraid I do think most cops in New York ticketing the double parked car of a courteous black man carrying cats would speak exactly the way my cop spoke to me on Court Street in Brooklyn In fact it was his stern ridiculous policemanese Step away from the vehicle that surprised me since I m you know white and middle aged and wear glasses I too like Bill Bradley and expect to vote for him in the primary A friend of mine who s a theater director recently told me that I should tell another friend of mine who s a speechwriter for Bradley that he the director would like to help coach the candidate in big audience performing skills Which I think would be a good idea And which I also think is a very rich premise for a comedy sketch But my problem with politics these days which I suppose can come across as conservatism and may well be in the old fashioned sense is that politics don t and really can t matter all that much in this country right now There are rough large consensuses on all the big issues economics social welfare civil rights women s rights war and peace even abortion And they will continue as long as the economy chugs along like this and we stay out of wars any longer than a mini series Sure there s a biggish scary lunatic right the Gary Bauerite creationist anti gay regiments but they re not going to be running the country or amending the Constitution anytime soon In fact Pat Buchanan is right about the virtual indistinguishability of the Democrats and Republicans I sympathize with both Buchanan and Warren Beatty viscerally if not ideologically I really think national politics kind of needs to be blown up and rebuilt For the couple of weeks seven years ago before he revealed himself to be a horrible crazy gnome Ross Perot seemed to me like a great idea And if next November the candidates are George Bush Al Gore and Jesse Ventura it isn t inconceivable that I would pull the lever for Ventura And I certainly wouldn t be very upset if Bush won even if he can t name a single book he s ever read One final theory of mine In presidential elections the candidate who wins is the one who seems 1 most convincingly like a sportsman and 2 happiest I think the only clear exception to the rule from FDR Hoover through Clinton Dole is 1968 but that one was very close and it was 1968 when all bets were off Have a safe trip to Los Angeles
