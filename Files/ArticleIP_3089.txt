 Girlie Men Everybody knows that Paris is the realm of fashion fashion is the realm of artifice and both are the realm of women This year as always Paris fashion has meant fabulous looking girls slinking along in foot high hair or plastered flat hair with grim or giddy hats and stark painted faces sporting fitted tops transparent tops cutout tops tight skirts slit to here full skirts trailing to there floppy pants or skinny pants trimmings that glitter or flutter colors that dazzle or puzzle curled feathers and dyed fur boiled wool and frosted leather crushed velvet shot silk frayed hemp and distressed plastic Such displays are to be expected in Paris as part of the traditional French insistence that Eve has the right to cut and shape her fig leaf edge it with spangled lace and lacquer it black If you want Adam s fig leaf in its natural material go to London Or so legend has it British understatement set the universal standard for male elegance in 1800 and it s holding its own two centuries later When Beau Brummell said If you noticed me I wasn t well dressed he put an end to purple feathers and crimson velvet for men all over the Western world and that was that right down to all the Similar Sober Suits at summit meetings But men apparently are getting tired of being inconspicuous With no loss of beauty and status men s suits are just as becoming as they ever were perfect male tailoring has lost some of its virile edge No wonder since the strongest theme in modern women s fashion has been the creative theft of the male wardrobe with all its components translated into terms of conspicuous seduction How can men s fashion respond to this Paris has the answer Just take it back and take it further Paris today and Milan and New York always hoping to outdo Paris is offering men s fashion shows of unexpected glamour color and sexuality founding a new theater that could someday rival its feminine equivalent applying Eve s method to Adam In the this year s fall collections designers for men were using the same trousers and shorts shirts and sweaters coats and jackets that women had already rescued from British decorum and boldly distorted for themselves The menswear shows deployed a similar suggestiveness a form fitting shape a brazen inventiveness of texture and hue a daring sweep of cuff collar and coattail all totally forbidden by Saville Row but gloriously worked up for women during the last 30 years by the likes of Yves Saint Laurent Here there s a fur scarf or some extra drapery added to the neck of a man s suit there there s a man s raincoat in metallic fabric that moves in a million glittering folds There s a man s svelte blazer tailored in a red flowered ivory brocade There are also references to 17 th century pirates Arabian Nights sultans Regency bucks fin de si cle dandies and depraved noblemen of the ancien r gime I t s exhilarating to see this stuff back on men and not just in the movies The models look magnificent especially the ones working for Vivienne Westwood and Jean Paul Gaultier who have joyfully reveled in creating extreme artifice for both sexes Gaultier s male models wear full makeup and pencil mustaches with their finery and they smolder with conviction The ones from Masaki Matsushima even smolder in silvery 18 th century wigs and one Moschino model wore a blue Louis XV wig with a blue denim ensemble his face a charming study in irony Yohji Yamamoto uses tragic faced models some bald middle aged and not so slim on whom his quasi Middle Eastern robes coats and headgear look nearly noble Many comely youths on the other hand look much like Shelley s portrait with flowing locks and tender throats exposed above their soft suede suits The whole display vividly depicts what men have envied for so long For generations they had to look tough modest honest and restrained under plain suits or plain sportswear Masculinity was allowed no erotic range in dress the phallic necktie licensed to reflect light and glow with color was famously men s only hope Every expressive shape or shiny streak in a coat and suit bore the dread suggestion of effeminacy connoting both a lack of integrity and an unbridled vanity felt to be unavoidable in women but criminal even thuggish in men And so the free play of fantasy died out of men s clothes Revived fantasy has tended in one direction only which means that lately there s been more than enough black leather harsh metal and shaved hair Maybe now that sexual ambiguity is recognized as a potent force we can begin to see men in gold embroidery and sweeping folds of silk Long habits die hard though Most men s fashion shows still concentrate on exquisite variations of the formal and sporty classics with plenty of subtle colors beautiful cravats and very discreet historical references Male models still can t carry off the gaudy stuff They lurch uncomfortably along the catwalk imprisoned in a tradition of artlessness Skirts show no sign of appearing on the man in the street although Gaultier has been promoting them for years His most recent catwalk version was a sari wrapped around the waist under a jacket falling to the instep and swinging with the wearer s manly stride Very nice but not likely to catch on until men finally remember the comfortable tunics of the very distant past Men have already recovered the masculine long hair jewelry and purses of medieval times Skirts may appear some day that s a prediction but probably with a military flavor the kind built into the Scottish kilt or the battle dress of Roman soldiers Meanwhile lovers of spectacle will have to content themselves with drag which gives intermittent delight to its watchers and wearers even if so far it hasn t made an appearance at summit meetings
