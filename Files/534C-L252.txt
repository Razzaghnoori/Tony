 July 20 1990 Name Address City ST Zip Dear Mr and Mrs Name I am writing to thank you for your past gifts to the IUPUI University Libraries and to ask you to renew that support Let me give you an example of why your support is important Last week an IUPUI student using indexing and abstracting tools in the library found references to articles which dealt precisely with the subject she had chosen for her term paper Imagine her dismay when she discovered that the library did not own most of the journals Many of the articles could be borrowed on inter library loan but there was no guarantee that they would be here in time for her to complete the paper Unfortunately this is an all too common scenario It is one the Libraries are trying very hard to eliminate but the rapidly increasing price of materials makes the task difficult That s why your past generosity to the IUPUI Libraries has been so appreciated Your continued involvement is vital Groundbreaking for the new library will be this summer But this wonderful new building with its 21st Century computer resources will need the continued involvement of many friends like you people who understand that a library is more than bricks mortar and good architecture As you know a library is a living resource where the cultural history the scientific discovery and the philosophical dialogue of a planet is gathered for active exploration and study For the IUPUI University Libraries to have collections access and services which meet your expectations requires friends and partners both inside the University and throughout the community state and nation With your assistance the Libraries will be able to provide more journals more computerized databases for locating vital information and more equipment for rapid access to the computerized catalog and indexes I ask you to join me in renewing your pledge of support to the University Libraries at IUPUI and to consider increasing that contribution At whatever level you may contribute your gift will make a difference to all the present and future users of the libraries and will foster continued excellence at IUPUI Sincerely Howard G Schaller Professor Emeritus IU School of Business Former Dean of the Faculties IUPUI P S The IUPUI University Libraries belong to you and every Indiana citizen You can make sure they do their job when you make your gift to help them provide the very best in collections and services HGS cm
