 Judge Dread There are two kinds of law wrote Thomas Paine in 1805 Legislative law is the law of the land enacted by our own legislators chosen by the people for that purpose Lawyers law is a mass of opinions and decisions which courts and lawyers have instituted themselves Paine liked the first kind of law better So does Antonin Scalia As the most intellectually consistent and stylistically gifted member of the Supreme Court Scalia has never hidden his enthusiasm for the American tradition of mistrusting courts and lawyers The basics of his judicial philosophy are now usefully collated in this volume which consists of an essay by the associate justice followed first by responses from Gordon Wood Laurence Tribe Mary Ann Glendon and Ronald Dworkin and then by a reply from Scalia According to Scalia the problem begins in law school where tomorrow s judges digest a steady diet of fusty 19 th century English appellate decisions and taste for the first time the joys of reasoning by analogy and precedent A few of these students befriend their senators or find some other way to become federal judges by that time they have internalized what Scalia calls the common law attitude and they become a dangerous lot Faced with an ambiguous statute or regulation these judges reared on the common law too often treat the enacted text as just one more precedent to circumvent In other words they hijack the democratic process Scalia offers two antidotes to this epidemic of judicial lawmaking textualism and originalism Textualism is just what it sounds like As Scalia puts it The text is the law and it is the text that must be observed The only democratically binding feature of a statute is its literal language because that language alone has been ratified by both houses of Congress and the president in accordance with the Constitution Originalism as Scalia defines it is a species of textualism particularly relevant to constitutional interpretation Its adherents tether their interpretations to plain meanings as they were understood when the text was first penned Originalists believe as Scalia puts it that a constitution s whole purpose is to prevent change to embed certain rights in such a manner that future generations cannot take them away None of this is new to anyone who has paid attention to Scalia s opinions and other writings over the past decade Yet in A Matter of Interpretation his reprise of the traditional jeremiad against judicial usurpation concludes with a twist The specter raised by common law judging Scalia says is not the unelected judge determined to impose the values of an elite few upon the masses but that old Tocquevillian villain the tyranny of the majority Scalia s argument goes like this As judges persist in bending the law the majority of the moment will begin to insist ever more stridently on judges of its particular ideological stripe Once on the bench these judicial politicians emboldened by their anything goes common law attitudes will set about encoding the popular will into law to the detriment of unpopular minorities As law Professor Mary Ann Glendon points out in her response this is an odd coda especially given the majoritarian premises of Scalia s philosophy Glendon shares Scalia s distrust of undisciplined judges but hers is the more traditional anxiety rooted in a fear of elites At the end of the book Scalia defending his prediction that judges will carry democracy too far contends that the individual rights favored by judges tend to be the same ones championed by popular majorities Here is Scalia s list women s rights racial minority rights homosexual rights abortion rights and rights against political favoritism Scalia s notion of what constitutes a popular cause does seem questionable racial minority and gay rights are not nearly as universally supported as Scalia seems to think they are His nightmare scenario is also far fetched Life tenured judges are dubious vehicles for implementing a popular will that changes from moment to moment Besides judges can t be relied on Supreme Court justices for instance are famous for disappointing their appointers Scalia s prescriptions have long drawn fire from legal academics Some of their criticisms are repeated here by legal academics Laurence Tribe and Ronald Dworkin Scalia s originalism is too glib because it doesn t distinguish between what the Constitution says and what its framers expected it to do too malleable because it merely substitutes the guesswork of historians for the musings of moral philosophers too value laden because it imputes an anti evolutionary purpose to the Constitution And so on Yet Scalia is refreshingly right in several particulars He justifiably laments the virtual disregard of statutory interpretation in law school curricula where the hoary common law case study method still predominates despite the fact that most law nowadays takes the form of statutes and regulations Scalia also rightly rejects the use of legislative history committee reports and floor debates as a guide to divining lawmakers intent Committee reports are worthless not only because they lack a democratic pedigree but because they are infinitely pliable Scalia quotes Judge Harold Leventhal s quip that using legislative history is like looking over the heads at a cocktail party until you spot your friends And Scalia is right to object to the caricature of the textualist originalist judge as wooden and unimaginative nontextualists after all can be plenty wooden and unimaginative themselves Admitted nontextualists incidentally are becoming harder and harder to find Scalia s plain language approach has certainly become more popular among his bench mates The simplest proof of this is the remarkable increase in citations to dictionaries in Supreme Court opinions A recent study found that dictionary definitions were 14 times more likely to appear in the court s decisions five years after Scalia s swearing in than they were five years before it The originalists of course like to dust off old dictionaries Dr Johnson s 1785 edition for the Bill of Rights for instance This lexicographical trend won t cure the textualists reputation for stiltedness reading some of these opinions is like listening to the high school valedictorian who inevitably begins I didn t know what to say today so I looked up the word commencement Even devotees of the Living Constitution like Tribe now declare their fidelity to text It s surprising that Tribe s essay doesn t discuss his textualist argument for the unconstitutionality of Colorado s Amendment 2 which forbade cities to enact anti discrimination ordinances based on sexual orientation Citing almost no cases Tribe told the Supreme Court that the Colorado initiative violated the letter of the Equal Protection Clause because it denied gays alone the protection of the anti discrimination laws Not an airtight argument all anti discrimination laws pick and choose among protected classes but a cleverly textualist one and one that seems to have helped convince a majority of the court to strike down the amendment despite a lack of helpful precedent Scalia offered a different textualist reading of the Equal Protection Clause grounding his arch dissent firmly in majoritarianism The Court has mistaken a Kulturkampf for a fit of spite So how often are judges actually as willful as Scalia claims they are It still sometimes happens Last spring the 9 th U S Circuit Court of Appeals found in the Due Process Clause a constitutional right to physician assisted suicide by relying on Plato Montaigne Thomas More and the Roper poll Its decision which Tribe defended before the court earlier this month is almost certain to be reversed probably on textualist grounds Most of the current textual infidelity though occurs because the doctrine of stare decisis which dictates adherence to precedent forces today s judges to live with adventurous Supreme Court decisions from earlier in the century Not surprisingly Scalia is no big fan of stare decisis In his dissents he often calls upon the court to scour away layers of encrusted precedent in order to get at the original meaning of the underlying text How judges interpret statutes and constitutions is according to Scalia a question utterly central to the existence of democratic government That s hard to dispute Yet as Wood a historian of early America shows in his essay it s also a question we ve been asking since the colonial era fitting the answer to the needs of the moment The revolution of 1776 for instance was fueled in part by the colonists resentment of the overweening powers of royal judges As early as the 1780s however the pendulum had swung back and many Americans looked to the courts to check the excesses of their legislators To Scalia however the idea that judicial power responds to the demands of the time merely proves that there have always been willful judges who bend the law to their wishes Seen from a historian s perspective Scalia s view of the debate over the judiciary does look a bit Manichaean But it would be a mistake to dismiss him for that reason Scalia s arguments have shaped the debate in our time he has gone a long way toward changing how judges interpret the letter of the law Not all the way he has not yet succeeded in building a durable majority on the court Does this mean that unpopular individual rights are in peril More likely it simply goes to show as do the exchanges in this stimulating book that there is more than one way to read a text
