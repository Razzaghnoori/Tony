                what do you think   um i dont know uh regarding um should the judge  do the sentencing or not i think the judge should have some in influence but i dont think the judge should i think thats too much power in the control of one person   i agree i really agree with that   it uh it just doesnt seem to make sense that if the trial is by a jury of your peers that the sentencing should be somewhat along that i you know i guess the judge should give the parameters   right right right   and then the jury should work kind of within there and if they feel exceptional one way or the other do you know what i mean   right right yes i do i i have been thinking about this youre about the tenth person they tried to call for this  so ive had lots of time to think but yes i do because um   oh is that right   otherwise why have a jury thats the point right yeah   right it seems to granted youre found guilty or innocent by a a group of peers of your peers but then the punishment you know can be very very severe depending on the the judges personal uh predilection to that   right right i think that you get a much fairer deal with a jury than you do with a judge and thats thats been my experience and and i really think that i think that judges are very prejudice   right yeah i i would i   to just their own idea and they wanna get it over with   right i mean theyre human theyre gonna have their their pet peeves and theyre gonna have the things that they really care about or dont care about   uhhuh right   um so let a group of people have you know try to try to make make you know use that uh make that decision   yeah i would feel much more confident if that were me so   unfortunately though it does string out the uh process but you know   well it does but i think its because people are trying to be conscientious where a judge its their job and you they just wanna speed it along and get it done and i dont think they stop and think about that individual as much as a group of people would   yeah right see i i also think theres a problem with the plea bargaining system in our in our country in that you can uh plead to even though youre guilty as sin   yeah yes yes yes   excuse me you plead to a lesser crime   yes yes   i think that that in of itself is a sin   i think that were having a lot of problems um with just everything and the whole the whole system is bugging me it really is our jails are over crowded with people like Leona Helmsley whos seventy two years old and with a blank check in front of her   yeah yeah   i dont think should go to jail i think the punishment should fit the crime i think that the jail should be filled with real criminals that are dangerous and i dont think they should get out on parole in three years   right   i think they should stay there they did it they stay   yeah i well i   and people with traffic tickets and that theres another way to handle that i think     yeah um although ill tell you the there is something about that woman uh her crime was is what they quote call a white collar crime as opposed to a blue collar crime such as crime stealing   so   uh well  but she stole   well yes but if you look at it in relation to the amount i mean its one million dollars which to you and i sound exorbitant   its a lot of money   but compared to the six hundred million that they paid in five years thats like one dollar when we owe six hundred   that they the six the six hundred million that they what now   so they paid taxes six hundred million in taxes over that five year period   oh i see what youre saying   yeah so if you look at it they dont say that  very much in the newspaper   yeah well no but they also diverted uh millions uh to their own personal assets that were hotel monies   well possibly you know i dont know but if theyre willing to correct it i i dont i dont see that she belongs in jail the same as somebody who goes out and kills and walks away i mean i there are worse things that people are getting off with you know that kind of thing   oh see yeah yeah i have to i agree with that there are worse things that people have been getting off with but i dont think that that we then should have Leona get off i think that they should be hit even harder see im an advocate of the death penalty myself   yeah   now i dont know of a lot of people that are well there are and there arent and i just happen to feel that if somebody does the crime   well yeah   i mean if they murder somebody they take someones life   get them out of society   i just dont feel like i have to pay my tax dollars to have them in jail i yeah i just its a tough line   yeah i know i agree with you agree and   but i dont think the way were executing the the capital punishment is is a deterrent although i think capital punishment is a deterrent   i do too   if its done right and that means that this is the way it is no ifs no ands no buts a certain   yeah it has to be a consistent thing   right a certain number of appeals and then thats it dont stretch it out for years get it over with and get it done   yeah umhum
