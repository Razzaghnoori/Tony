 Idiot Box Docudramatic Tension Those longing in this suddenly post Lewinsky era for more real life melodrama to watch on television have good news This third week of sweeps brings plenty of docudramas one starring Lauren Bacall and jazzed up documentaries to slake our thirst for TV enhanced reality Even the regular fictional series are borrowing the day s headlines or real life characters to goose ratings a practice as old as Shakespeare TV s version of truth or something resembling it is stranger than fiction and often more entertaining as well The medium s blend of fact and fiction is part of its very design the tube creates a living room world that sometimes seems as real as our own It s the perfect environment for biopics infotainment or fictional cover ups This Friday Feb 19 conspiracy with tips of the hat to Ken Starr and The X Files rules the airwaves Homicide NBC 10 p m wraps up a two part cross over episode that began on Law and Order Wednesday The two teams of crime stoppers plumb a murky murder mystery connected somehow to a lesbian sex scandal and the White House There s even a nefarious independent prosecutor who abuses both key witnesses and our heroic prosecutors Unfortunately the story line is as convoluted as an X Files alien episode and both NBC crime shows lack the energy and the charismatic lead actors of their glory days Still it s good to see the Homicide crew finally spending more time solving crimes than pursuing their boring office romances Dark doings continue on Chris Carter s Millennium on Friday Fox 9 p m Frank Black well played by Lance Henriksen the grim ex FBI agent who can enter the minds of murderers learns more about the past of the mysterious influential Millennium Group and J Edgar Hoover s role Oddly enough the group hasn t run into the X Files all powerful Syndicate yet No one s bothered with the generally mirthless Saturday Night Live in the last five years or so Tonight s NBC 11 30 p m may be an episode to at least glance at Bill Murray fresh off his rave reviews in Rushmore hosts while the wonderful Lucinda Williams the unconventionally emotional and compelling country rock singer songwriter is the musical guest Sunday is docudrama heaven In Too Rich The Secret Life of Doris Duke CBS Sunday and Tuesday 9 p m Lauren Bacall gives a bitchy grande dame performance as the world s richest woman There s something perversely reassuring about a great beauty who had it all and still ended up a drug addled wretch manipulated by a Machiavellian butler Richard Chamberlain Bacall s performance has echoes of her Tony Award winning Margo Channing role all patrician bite and bluster Told in flashbacks the film drags a bit when the younger version of Duke played by Lindsay Frost is on screen but jumps to life every time the formidable Bacall speaks her mind On Monday compare Bacall with the real thing in a documentary called Doris Duke The Lonely Heiress on A E 8 p m The big mystery of her death Did the butler do it Enough seaminess For moral uplift check out Sunday s Passing Glory TNT 8 p m It s a stirring true tale of an all black Catholic basketball team that faces off with the best white team in the segregated New Orleans of the 1960s The film stars Rip Torn and Emmy winner Andre Braugher riveting as a priest leading his players in a drive to integrate school athletics Although supposedly based on real events it also feels phony at times Is there a federal law that says all basketball flicks must end with one shot that determines everything On Monday a series of genuine documentaries square off against reality inspired programs ABC gives us And the Beat Goes On The Sonny and Cher Story 9 p m This hagiography produced by Sonny Bono s widow includes the mandatory scene of the downtrodden composer working out his masterpieces Here it s Bono a bland Jay Underwood dressed in a fur vest plucking out I Got You Babe Renee Faia does a Cher impersonation as good as any drag queen s but her sullen pouting and his whining make it seem like a long SCTV skit featuring Andrea Martin See the real Sonny Bono on VH 1 s Behind the Music episode at 11 p m True artistry is displayed in Bravo s portrait of Little Jimmy Scott the troubled singer with the angelic voice of a jazz diva 10 p m His fans include Ray Charles and Lou Reed and you re likely to become one too Genuine immigration abuses are the backdrop for the schlocky murder mystery Border Line Monday NBC 9 p m which marks the return to television of Sherry Stringfield formerly of ER But the single mom in peril subplot is so trite it s a wonder she can stay awake never mind the viewer A better bet for drama is Meltdown at Three Mile Island PBS 9 p m a tense documentary narrative on the 1979 nuclear accident Two other docs are worth your attention this week The Learning Channel s gritty Inside the White House Press Corps Monday 9 p m and RFK vs LBJ which offers fake footage of look alike actors over real audio tape of the leaders scheming Tuesday 9 p m It s competing with a comic take on politics Spin City ABC 9 p m featuring guest star Christopher Lloyd as yet another wacky mentor to Michael J Fox This time around Lloyd believes he s the Messiah At the Grammys on Wednesday CBS 8 p m expect Lauryn Hill to be treated like the musical Messiah with her 10 nominations The host is Rosie O Donnell a symbol of the blandness that usually afflicts the awards All the best Thursday series Frasier and ER have sweeps driven episodes but perhaps the most powerful program that night is the movie This Boy s Life TNT 8 p m with Robert De Niro as an abusive stepdad tyrannizing Leonardo DiCaprio It s based of course on a true story Art Levine
