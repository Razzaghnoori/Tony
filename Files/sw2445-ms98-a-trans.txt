 i don t know um do you do a lot of camping well my husband and i haven t done a whole lot of camping we but we bought a van last year and we were hoping to to do some camping in the van yeah um we did go camping in Arkansas not Arkansas Oklahoma uh last year in we camped in a tent and uh there were two other couples with us and there was uh state park oh so yeah um up here some of the state parks are really nice and some of them aren t some of them are pretty rough and it was really nice really um yeah they they just have like outhouses they don t have like a shower room or anything yeah but some of them are really nice they have showers and full bathrooms um um but i don t know i i ve been camping a couple times but i m not a real avid camper uh a lot of people i know are but um i don t i don t know that i i don t like really camping in the rough i like the the the little niceties like having electricity available and running water and showers and things like that yeah in fact we went we went once to a lean to and it um i mean there wasn t any electricity on the camp site but it was all right but we only spent two nights there i wouldn t want to spend more than two nights i wouldn t want to go for like a week but um yeah that would that would be much two nights is good um especially there was a little store close by so it was pretty nice yeah the campsite that we went to was an area that it s right on a big lake and there s a lot of boating out there and we we went up there uh to hopefully be able to get on the water a little bit but it was still uh it was still too cold oh really oh yeah it it was pretty early in the year um yeah up here you got to wait till August August till the water warms up well it s not that bad but it s still pretty chilly yeah um i don t know i was i have a tent and i slept out in it in the backyard and stuff but the thing thing about camping that bothers me is you ve got to pack everything and another thing is the thing seems to get it s dirty you know so you can t keep the dirt out of the tent and yeah i don t know we have a seven year old it s pretty funny like stay out yeah we we have a we have a dog and that s just about as bad as a kid yeah boy he he doesn t go in and out of the tent a hundred times um hum and use it as a play uh they they like to play in them yeah i don t know how you can really keep uh the inside of a tent clean other other than you know taking your shoes off right before you walk in or something yeah i don t know and and sweeping it out everyday it s really hard to to keep the sand and dirt out of it yeah well what what we were doing we were just going to say we re just going to sleep in the tent and hang out at night so you know no going in and out and or what he wants to do we had brought his friend along was play in the tent it was like no this is not working you can t do that you get tent all dirty plus you get it all wet because we were at a beach site too did um hum um did you have another a big tent like uh um for like a looks like a sitting area type you know like a two room type tent no no but you know i was just thinking of getting one those for the yard because they they are really nice and um up here we have uh we have quite a few mosquitoes at nighttime yeah yeah we don t really have a problem with that um in these areas um and even even when in Oklahoma when we camped i really didn t notice a problem with bugs and i noticed that i know that i said that s i ve i ve lived back east before um and yeah they re terrible they re really terrible uh but there is this one campsite that it that some of them are known that there is one that s out in this big lake and it s it s it s mosquitoes are terrible and then this uh there s this other one that s more up in the mountains but it surrounds a man made reservoir and there s no bugs that s the whole thing that everyone told me oh i m i was going to go to Little Little River State Park they go oh that place is great there s no bugs but oh okay because uh we were having a big a really big problem up here in certain areas we were really affected that bad hum but really bad it um almost destroyed the the tourism in one town because of the mosquitoes they re so bad yeah that was it s a really nice area i ve been there before and it s really i i couldn t imagine get living just sixty miles north of them but they were plagued they were plagued with them with mosquitoes and you can go out outside in the daytime all right but the minute the sun went down that s when it seems like the minute the sun sets the mosquitoes come out hum i mean just the very second it s really strange they uh they must uh work on that you know the the it gets cooler when the sun sets and then they all come out well have you ever have you ever taken any of those um what do they call this citronella lights have you ever used those oh oh yeah yeah i never really noticed how effective they were but um because that wasn t really i i bought them and i didn t really get to use them like oh there s mosquitoes let s turn them we just sort of lit them um hum and um we weren t bothered that much by mosquitoes so we didn t really contribute it to that but um i think in an area that s really thick with mosquitoes i can t see all this little uh smoke buckets i call them how they work but they they re suppose to work really well yeah oh i m in my paperwork here that s what i do when i wait for a phone call i get in my paperwork hum oh to find my most important parts but i don t know i don t know if i m going to go go i wish was an avid camper and i could really talk about like gardening or something i can talk about that a lot but um um hum i do want to go again we just moved to a new house into a house so i don t see camping maybe in the backyard but i don t see going on a camping trip probably till next summer yeah i d i d like to go camping cross country um i just got married less than two years ago so we don t have any any children yet um so it s easy for you to go and yeah so it s easy to pick up and go and so we have a van and we can just throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back of it um oh God so it s it s not really i guess camping the way people most people picture camping in the tent but i don t know but that sounds like my kind my kind of camping it really does yeah okay um well um that that is the best way to do it is to have a a nice vehicle where you can have everything in it plus your tent yeah or or get my brother has a real nice pop up yep and he just he just tows it behind his truck um and he he s got three kids so his kids ll sleep in the truck in the in the back of the bed um and they sleep in the pop up well those they re kind of nice but they re also um flimsy when you really look at them but then when you get inside they re really nice you know yeah everything s really nice but then when you look underneath it it s just got these little wheels and this just this uh little axle it s like oh my and then a big windstorm it would pick you up yeah he did have a problem uh when he went camping last year in uh Beavers Bend Oklahoma Oklahoma Oklahoma Oklahoma um a storm a storm came in and it started raining really heavy and they were all everybody was trying to flee the campsite and everybody was getting stuck in the mud oh jeez yeah what do you what do you do when you get a i mean like a really violent storm like a tornado just stay in your truck and the i i mean i wouldn t stay in the um well theirs was so bad and they were so close to the water that the water was coming up and they had to get out of there oh so did were they successful yeah they yeah they were but it took them a little while but yeah they they decided that that was enough camping for the weekend yeah so did they get stuck no they ended up getting out they ended up helping several other people though that were that were stuck yeah huh wow so they evacuated it yeah yeah they the whole the whole campsite was evacuated i mean some i think some people that had fairly sturdy um wow vehicles or whatever if they had like a Winnebago or something and they were farther in away from the water i think they stayed yeah but everybody that was real close to the water ended up it was either that or their truck was going to go floating downstream i know i i always i like to like to get right on the water yeah where the campsite it s so it well like i don t know we have lean to s up here i really like them like they say they re kind of yeah it s kind of more dirty than anything you know just just they have them right at the campsites yeah they re they re lean to s they re um yeah they re pretty nice they re they re uh wow it s like a little house except the whole face is open and the one time that we went we got one it was overlooking the water but it was a big embankment i wanted to get one right on the water that was then when we had uh an electrical storm too and it was really it was neat sitting there watching it i mean it was raining when we called in home everybody said oh we were worried about you in that storm
