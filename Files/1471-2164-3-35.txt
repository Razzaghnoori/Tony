                    Background        Microarrays are tools for functional genomics research        that are manufactured by depositing spots of DNA onto a        glass or nylon substrate      The spots DNA are often        obtained from many different clones in a cDNA library each        of which may contain a stretch of polyA originating from        the mRNA in the pool from which the library was derived        Because first strand cDNA probes that are hybridized to        such microarrays usually consist of polyTcontaining        molecules which are produced by the reverse transcription        of some tissues polyA RNA mixture there is the        potential for promiscuous polyApolyT crosshybridization        between the first strand cDNA probes and the microarray DNA        spots In fact when microarrays were first being        developed investigators described situations in which        their microarray hybridization data were dominated by this        artifactual polyA effect or its converse when polyA        tails are in the labeled probe      To reduce the        polyA effect it is therefore common practice to add        unlabeled polyA to the hybridization mixture to bind to the        polyT segments of the hybridization probe thus competing        with the polyA segments in the microarray spots        Despite the use of unlabeled polyA as a blocking agent        when microarray hybridization results obtained using probes        derived from mRNA from two different sources are nearly the        same one cannot be certain that the similarity of the        results is due to the similarity of the different mRNA        source material rather than to incomplete blockage of the        polyA effect in both of the hybridizations We were faced        with this issue in connection with the similarity of        microarray results that we obtained in a comparison between        skeletal muscle mRNA from two related strains of rats As a        result we undertook a search for the presence of the polyA        effect in which we made a spotbyspot comparison of a        microarray that was hybridized with an oligodT probe        versus the same microarray hybridized using a first strand        cDNA probe produced from skeletal muscle mRNA Our        expectation was that if the polyA effect was present there        would be a strong spottospot correlation between the        signals generated with these two probes We were surprised        to find that there appear to be prominent artifacts related        to promiscuous polyApolyT hybridization         only with very strongly expressed        genes  which might be due to the formation of        hybridization heteropolymers at the corresponding        microarray spots                    Results                  Hybridization to the microarray          Fig shows backgroundsubtracted images of a          microarray that has been hybridized with first strand          cDNA derived from skeletal muscle mRNA Also shown in          Fig are the backgroundsubtracted images of the array          after hybridization with endlabeled oligodT performed          in order to measure accessible PolyA in the spots                          Search for artifacts from the PolyA effect          As shown in the scatterplot provided in Fig  there          is only a weak correlation between the hybridization          signals of spots with first strand cDNA from rat muscle          versus hybridization of the spots with oligodT Among          the  microarray spots having muscle geneexpression          signals in the range that could be detected as defined          in the Methods section the Pearson correlation between          the muscle signals and the signals obtained using the          oligodT probe is only  and the correlation is even          weaker  when the correlation calculation is          restricted to microarray spots having a muscle signal          greater than the median value of  phosphorimager          units We therefore conclude that a polyA effect is not          readily apparent in these data presumably because we had          added unlabeled polyA to the hybridization mixture as a          blocking agent          Spots at random locations throughout the array did not          bind significantly to the oligodT probe almost all of          which correspond to spots at which there was also no          binding of muscle cDNA Such spots do not appear to          represent defects in the manufacturing of the array          filter at which no DNA was deposited because at the end          of the experiment we looked for DNA in those spots          directly by staining them with the fluorescent nucleic          acid dye acridine orange followed by imaging of the          spots with a fluorimager Spots that gave no signal with          the oligodT probe nevertheless had a corresponding          fluorescence signal except for the deliberately vacant          positions in the right hand side of each of the          microarray matrices shown in Fig  Furthermore there          was one spot at which binding to the oligodT probe was          undetectable but at which there was nevertheless a very          strong binding to the muscle probe That spot field d          column  row  in Fig and position  in Fig           corresponds to the enteric smooth muscle form of gamma          actin Accession number T which according to          GenBanks annotation for that accession number is a          possible reversed clone because polyT or polyA in its          complementary strand was not found within it                          Observation of outlier microarray spots          Although there is generally little correlation between          the hybridization values obtained with oligodT and          muscle cDNA this may not be true for spots that show the          greatest binding to oligodT For the spots showing          oligodT hybridization values greater than           phosphorimager units the corresponding value of the          muscle cDNA hybridization is always  or more          phosphorimager units This result was obtained for the          same eight microarray spots when microarray          hybridizations were performed using muscle mRNA from both          fafa and FaFa Zucker rats In contrast spots with          oligodT hybridization values less than the threshold          value of  exhibit corresponding values for the          muscle probe hybridization that may be anywhere between          zero and the upper range of values          The finding is not likely to be a chance happenstance          for the following reason If the null hypothesis is that          the muscleprobe hybridization values for spots with          polyA values   have the same statistical          distribution as spots with polyA values   then          the probability that all eight of them have values          greater than the median is    and the          probability that all eight of them have a value greater          than  is less than  which is less than            because only  of the  detectable spots have          values greater than  Thus we reject the null          hypothesis and conclude that the statistical distribution          of muscleprobe values among spots having polyA values          greater than the threshold of  is significantly          different than that for the remainder of the spots          The question then arises as to whether there is          anything unusual about the clones used to generate the          DNA for those eight outlier microarray spots that           a priori would have allowed us to          flag them as potential concerns As now described          distinguishing features of the clones might be that           they have unusually short inserts or  they may contain          an unusually large fraction of bases that might be          expected to bind to oligodT namely the bases that lie          within a sequence run of AAAAAA                           Relation between clone sequence and oligodT probe          hybridization signal          A search of GenBank reveals that only partial          sequences are available for the clones corresponding to          the eight outlier spots One of the clones has a partial          sequence containing a polyA stretch consisting of           bases Accession H  and H   GCN          general control of aminoacid synthesis like   spot          e in Fig  point  in Fig  Five of          the others have stretches of A or T between  and           bases which are not unusual Accession R  and          R   Superoxide dismutase   spot c in          Fig  point  in Fig  AA

stretches of A no          longer than  bases Accession AA  and AA            DEADH AspGluAlaAspHis box peptide   spot          f in Fig and point  in Fig  and          N  and N   granulocytemacrophage          colony stimulating factor receptor   spot f in          Fig  point  in Fig  However N          contains an Arich stretch of  base pairs with  A          bases and AA contains more than one stretch of A          bases Because stable hybridization duplexes have been          reported with oligonucleotides as short as  bases              and because such stable duplexes may be formed even if          there are basepair mismatches     it is conceivable          that the oligodT probe could have hybridized to the          Arich regions in the  or  ends of the DNA in each          the outlier spots          The oligodT probe could also have hybridized to the          unknown sequences between the  and  ends of these          clone inserts so we sought their complete sequences For          purposes of comparison we also sought the complete          sequences of all clone inserts for which the muscle cDNA          gave a hybridization signal in the range exhibited by the          outlier clones  phosphorimager units We          sought the full sequences by using the clustering tool          IMAGEne available at the IMAGE Consortium web page          httpimagellnlgov This tool attempts to match the           and  partial sequences of a clone insert with the          sequences of all other IMAGE clone inserts as well as          with all RefSeq reference sequences     If matches          are found the entire clone insert sequence may then be          constructed by piecing together overlapping matches of          the contiguous sequences Among the  clones for which          the muscle cDNA gave a hybridization signal in the range          exhibited by the outlier clones  phosphorimager          units it was possible to construct the entire insert          sequence of  clones see Additional File  Three of          these clones are among the outlier group for which the          polyA signal is greater than  phosphorimager          units          Additional File                     Complete DNA sequences of  clone          inserts  This file contains complete DNA sequences          of  clone inserts The clones correspond to microarray          spots for which the muscle cDNA probe signal is greater          than  phosphorimager units The sequences were          constructed using the clustering tool IMAGEne at the

hybridizing to the oligodT          probe the strength of the corresponding signal from          hybridizing to the muscle cDNA probe and the sequence          length          Click here for file          We then noted two features of the sequence data that          may explain in part the large signals that the outlier          microarray spots exhibited when hybridized to the          oligodT probe The first feature is that the          hybridization signal is generally inversely proportional          to sequence length and two of the outlier clones have          unusually short lengths As seen in Fig  the two          outlier clones having insert lengths of less than           base pairs give the strongest hybridization signals          Because each microarray spot has the same total amount of          DNA  ng the microarray spots associated with these          clones must have an unusually large number of short          densely deposited target molecules and should therefore          produce a proportionately large signal The third outlier          spot had an oligodT hybridization signal only barely          larger than the threshold of  phosphorimager units          and has a somewhat longer insert length  base pairs          The second noteworthy feature of the sequence data is          that outlier spots may contain an unusually large          fraction of bases that might be expected to bind to          oligodT namely the bases that lie within a sequence          run of seven or more As AAAAAAA As seen in Fig  for          two of the outlier clones the fraction of such bases          have relatively high values of  and  The third          outlier spot has an oligodT hybridization signal only          barely larger than threshold of  phosphorimager          units and has a more typical fraction of                             Discussion        When microarrays were first being developed        investigators described situations in which their        microarray hybridization data were dominated by the polyA        effect in which polyTcontaining molecules which are        produced by the reverse transcription of a polyA RNA        mixture bind promiscuously to the polyA stretches of the        DNA in microarray spots As illustrated by Nguyen et al            when this artifact is pronounced the amount of        hybridization at a particular microarray spot is an        indication of the accessible polyA content of the DNA at        the spot rather than of the amount of the particular        nucleic acid species in the hybridization solution that one        intends to hybridize genespecifically to that spot Thus        when the polyA effect is pronounced the hybridization of        the reverse transcription product made from         any polyA RNA mixture will be        essentially the same namely the hybridization that would        be obtained with an oligodT probe alone This is because        the binding of polyTcontaining molecules in the        hybridization solution to the polyA stretches in the        microarray spots dominates the hybridization results        overwhelming the signal produced by genespecific        hybridization            To reduce the polyA effect it has become common        practice to add unlabeled polyA to the hybridization        mixture to bind to the polyT segments of the hybridization        probe thus competing with the polyA segments in the        microarray spots Despite the use of this blocking        procedure when microarray hybridization results obtained        using probes derived from mRNA from two different sources        are nearly the same one cannot be certain that the        similarity of the results is due to the similarity of the        different mRNA sources rather than to incomplete blockage        of the polyA effect in both of the hybridizations We were        faced with this issue when we obtained nearly identical        microarray hybridizations using skeletal muscle mRNA from        lean FaFa versus obese fafa Zucker rats at an age of         weeks the age at which phenotypic differences between        fafa and FaFa are thought to begin Among the more than         genes on the microarray only one was possibly        expressed differentially the sarcomeric isoform of the        mitochondrial creatine kinase gene sMtCK which appeared        to have higher expression in the lean muscle We therefore        conducted the experiment with the results shown in Figs        and  in order to see whether we would obtain the same        hybridization results using only endlabeled oligodT as a        probe thereby providing evidence whether the polyA effect        caused the two muscle cDNA hybridizations to produce        similar results        Our main results are the scatterplot showing microarray        hybridization signals using a probe derived from muscle        mRNA versus the signals using only an oligodT probe        Fig  The scatterplot exhibits only a weak correlation        between these two hybridization results for the vast        majority of microarray spots Furthermore we did not see a        simple additive effect which might have been identified as        follows Let the signal obtained at spot number         i from hybridization with the probe        derived from muscle mRNA be denoted as H         i  It may be represented as the sum of        a background signal B         i due to hybridization solely to the        polyA segment in the spot plus the genespecific        hybridization H         i  ie H         i  B         i  H         i  If we knew the background polyA        hybridization B         i  for example by inferring its value        from hybridization with the oligodT probe we could        subtract the polyA background to obtain a corrected        genespecific hybridization signal ie H         i   H         i  B         i  However looking along the vertical        axis of the scatterplot we were surprised to see that        there are many spots at which H         i is nearly zero indicating that B         i must also be nearly zero even when        there is a significant polyA signal        The unexpected exception to this observation occurs when        the polyA signal is greater than a threshold of about         phosphorimager units As seen in Fig  for those eight        microarray spots the value of the background polyA        hybridization B         i appears to be much larger than the        median value of H         i among all spots ie if the polyA        signal is greater than  then the value of H         i will always be greater than         phosphorimager units Furthermore as described in the        Results section the statistical distribution of H         i among spots having polyA values        greater than the threshold of  is significantly        different than that for the remainder of the spots        Regarding the question of whether there is anything        unusual about the clones used to generate the DNA for those        eight outlier microarray spots we found that        distinguishing features of the clones might be that         they have unusually short inserts of less than  base        pairs and  they may contain an unusually large fraction        of bases that might be expected to bind to oligodT        namely the bases that lie within a sequence run of polyA        Investigators might therefore use these as criteria for the        potential existence of a polyA effect artifact and        manufacturers of microarrays may use these criteria in        deciding which clones not to use        However apart from using empirical observations like        those shown in Figs and  we have no suggestion for how        to predict the magnitude of the oligodT hybridization        signal from the known sequences According to Southern and        colleagues     the factor that determines the magnitude        of oligonucleotide hybridization signals is not the        stability of the duplexes that may be formed through        hybridization but rather the rate of forward reaction        which is determined by the rate of hybrid nucleation Their        work indicates that the availability of nucleation sites in        the immobilized target molecule will be determined by        secondary structure which is not predictable in any        obvious way from the primary DNA sequences Ongoing        research into this problem interprets hybridization data        not only in terms of WatsonCrick base pairing but also in        terms of base stacking interactions loops bridges and        dangling ends  and in the case of DNA immobilized on nylon        membranes  in terms of diffusion of solvents into and out        of membrane pores multiple interactions within pores and        details of the way in which the DNA is attached to its        membrane support            Finally consider why there is a threshold oligodT        probe signal above which hybridization by an mRNAderived        probe invariably produces a signal much larger than the        median among the remainder of the microarray spots We        suspect that the most important reason for the existence of        a threshold signal is related to the formation of        hybridization networks at these spots which are also known        as hyperpolymers     If the polyT tail of a        reversetranscribed probe molecule binds promiscuously to        the polyA in one of these spots the remainder of the        anchored probe molecule may hybridize to another labeled or        unlabeled probe molecule in the hybridization solution        which in turn may hybridize to yet another probe molecule        in the solution etc forming a network of hybridized        probe molecules If a threshold density of accessible polyA        in the microarray spots DNA is needed in order to form a        stable anchor for such a network this would provide a        mechanistic explanation for our observation                    Conclusions        The PolyA effect may be more subtle than simply a        hybridization signal that is proportional to the PolyA        content of each microarray spot It may instead be present        only in spots that hybridize oligodT greater than some        threshold level The strong signal generated at these        outlier spots by cDNA probes might be due to the        formation of hybridization heteropolymers                    Methods                  Housing

       were housed in the Animal Resource Center of the          University of Texas at Austin under standard laboratory          conditions All procedures were approved by the          University of Texas at Austin Animal Use Committee                          Tissue samples          Rats were quickly anesthetized by intravenous          injection of sodium pentobarbital  mgkg Red

      Research Genetics POLYAGF and  gml cot DNA BRL           as blocking agents Stripping the filter in          order to reprobe it was done by placing the filter in a          boiling  SDS solution as recommended by the          manufacturer The stripped filter was used to expose a          phosphorimager plate which was then scanned The          resulting image had   remaining from the image          that was obtained before stripping We obtained nearly          identical microarray hybridizations using cDNA prepared          from skeletal muscle mRNA from lean FaFa versus obese          fafa Zucker rats at an age of  weeks the age at          which phenotypic differences between fafa and FaFa are          thought to begin Only one gene was possibly expressed          differentially the sarcomeric isoform of the          mitochondrial creatine kinase gene sMtCK which appeared          to have higher expression in the lean muscle We          confirmed the sMtCK result with a Northern blot but did          not do so for any of the other genes which may be          considered a limitation of our experiment                          Quantifying the hybridization results          Radioactivity in hybridized filters was imaged using a          phosphorimager Model  SI Molecular Dynamics The          resulting image files were then processed using custom          software as shown in Fig  Each of the membranes          sixteen   spot arrays was extracted from the          original image file along with a border of pixels          corresponding to one spot width A background value was          then estimated for each pixel in each of these images as          follows If a pixel was situated in the region between or          adjacent to DNA spots and if the spatial derivative of          the image at that pixel indicated that it was not part of          the overlap region between two intense spots that pixel          was defined to be a background pixel If a pixel was          situated within the region corresponding to a spot of          DNA or if it was situated in the region between two          overlapping intense spots the background value for that          pixel was set equal to the value of the nearest          background pixel as defined above A          backgroundsubtracted image of the radioactivity was then          obtained by subtracting the background value for each          pixel from the original image          The intensity of spots in an image is a function of          how long the phosphorimager plate was exposed as well as          factors such as the efficiency of probe labeling          Therefore in order to be able to compare          backgroundsubtracted images of the same    spot          array for successive hybridizations normalization was          performed as follows The image for one of the          hybridizations was selected to be the reference and          corresponding pixels in the other image were normalized          by substituting them into a quadratic polynomial          normalization function of the pixel value the          coefficients of which were estimated by singular value          decomposition SVD     This quadratic model allows          for some compensation in the event that the response of          the phosphorimager changes between measurements We found          that the fitted second order coefficients were always          very close to zero and the constant offset coefficients          were also very close to zero Thus normalization of          backgroundsubtracted images of the same array for          different hybridizations was accomplished essentially by          multiplying all pixels in the nonreference image by a          constant scalefactor the value of which had been          estimated by SVD Note that the phosphorimager data have          units related to the voltage of its phototube which are          not related in any obvious way to nucleic acid          concentrations or amounts Some investigators rescale the          data such that the average signal per microarray spot          equals  but we did not do so          The distance between spots on the array is only           mm and as a consequence many of the adjacent intense          spots overlap one another When integrated intensity          within a specified region about the center of the spot is          used to represent the magnitude of hybridization it is          then useful to model the image as the sum of superimposed          twodimensional spot functions This was done using          twodimensional gaussian functions to represent the          spots as shown in Fig  with the location amplitude          and standard deviation coefficients all estimated          automatically from the backgroundsubtracted image in two          dimensions using the LevenbergMarquardt method              The similarity between backgroundsubtracted and fitted          spot images Fig bvs c indicates that much of the          spread of the intense spots appears to be gaussian which          might be attributed to the gaussian shape of the laser          beam that scans the phosphorplate When the spot          intensity was close to the noisy background level this          model cannot be used to fit the data due to near          singularity of the matrix equations that had to be solved          to perform the fitting In that case the method that we          used to estimate the intensity of each spot was to sum          the nine adjacent pixels in the center of each spot of          the backgroundsubtracted image The correlation between          the values so obtained and the corresponding value of the          integrated spot intensity from successful gaussian curve          fitting was           A histogram was constructed from the logarithm of the          values of all the spot values As observed in              the histogram for our muscle data was bimodal consisting          of a gaussianlike distribution of lowintensity spots          overlapping an adjacent distribution of moderate and          highintensity spots The transition between these two          distributions occurred within a clearly recognizable          range of values  to  phosphorimager units We          therefore followed the conservative practice recommended          in    by considering all spot values less than a          value of  to define undetectable hybridizations          According to this criterion  of the spots were          detectable                          Search for promiscuous hybridization to polyA          segments          To investigate the polyA effect as a potential          artifact we performed the following experiment using          essentially the approach described in     OligodT           mer mixture Research Genetics cat  POLYTGF          was end labeled with T kinase Life Technologies           and  PATP ICN  The array          filter was then hybridized with this probe in Hybrisol I          Oncor S for  hours at C then washed twice at          room temperature for two minutes in X SSC and  SDS          It was then used to expose a phosphorplate for  hours          which was scanned using a phosphorimager Model  SI          Molecular Dynamics to identify the array spots having          long stretches of polydA Quantifying of the spot          intensities was performed as indicated above                          Staining of the microarray filter with a          fluorescent nucleic acid indicator          After all hybridizations of the microarray filter had          been performed we stained the filter with a fluorescent          dye that is specific for nucleic acids We did so in          order to determine whether the absence of hybridization          signals for some microarray spots was due to the absence          of any DNA there which would indicate a defect in the          manufacturing of the microarray at those spots The          filter was stained with  gml acridine orange Sigma          A for  minutes at room temperature rinsed in          distilled water then imaged with a fluorimager          Molecular Dynamics The dye was excited by the  nm          argon laser line of the fluorimager and emission was          detected with a narrowband filter centered at  nm                            Authors contributions        SJP participated in the conception design and        coordination of the study conducted the animal        hybridization and
