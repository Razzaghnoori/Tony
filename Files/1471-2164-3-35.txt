 Background Microarrays are tools for functional genomics research that are manufactured by depositing spots of DNA onto a glass or nylon substrate 1 2 The spots DNA are often obtained from many different clones in a cDNA library each of which may contain a stretch of polyA originating from the mRNA in the pool from which the library was derived Because first strand cDNA probes that are hybridized to such microarrays usually consist of poly T containing molecules which are produced by the reverse transcription of some tissue s poly A RNA mixture there is the potential for promiscuous polyA polyT cross hybridization between the first strand cDNA probes and the microarray DNA spots In fact when microarrays were first being developed investigators described situations in which their microarray hybridization data were dominated by this artifactual polyA effect or its converse when polyA tails are in the labeled probe 3 4 To reduce the polyA effect it is therefore common practice to add unlabeled polyA to the hybridization mixture to bind to the polyT segments of the hybridization probe thus competing with the polyA segments in the microarray spots Despite the use of unlabeled polyA as a blocking agent when microarray hybridization results obtained using probes derived from mRNA from two different sources are nearly the same one cannot be certain that the similarity of the results is due to the similarity of the different mRNA source material rather than to incomplete blockage of the polyA effect in both of the hybridizations We were faced with this issue in connection with the similarity of microarray results that we obtained in a comparison between skeletal muscle mRNA from two related strains of rats As a result we undertook a search for the presence of the polyA effect in which we made a spot by spot comparison of a microarray that was hybridized with an oligo dT probe versus the same microarray hybridized using a first strand cDNA probe produced from skeletal muscle mRNA Our expectation was that if the polyA effect was present there would be a strong spot to spot correlation between the signals generated with these two probes We were surprised to find that there appear to be prominent artifacts related to promiscuous polyA polyT hybridization only with very strongly expressed genes which might be due to the formation of hybridization heteropolymers at the corresponding microarray spots Results Hybridization to the microarray Fig 1shows background subtracted images of a microarray that has been hybridized with first strand cDNA derived from skeletal muscle mRNA Also shown in Fig 1are the background subtracted images of the array after hybridization with end labeled oligo dT performed in order to measure accessible PolyA in the spots Search for artifacts from the PolyA effect As shown in the scatterplot provided in Fig 2 there is only a weak correlation between the hybridization signals of spots with first strand cDNA from rat muscle versus hybridization of the spots with oligo dT Among the 567 microarray spots having muscle gene expression signals in the range that could be detected as defined in the Methods section the Pearson correlation between the muscle signals and the signals obtained using the oligo dT probe is only 0 46 and the correlation is even weaker 0 37 when the correlation calculation is restricted to microarray spots having a muscle signal greater than the median value of 7682 phosphorimager units We therefore conclude that a polyA effect is not readily apparent in these data presumably because we had added unlabeled polyA to the hybridization mixture as a blocking agent Spots at random locations throughout the array did not bind significantly to the oligo dT probe almost all of which correspond to spots at which there was also no binding of muscle cDNA Such spots do not appear to represent defects in the manufacturing of the array filter at which no DNA was deposited because at the end of the experiment we looked for DNA in those spots directly by staining them with the fluorescent nucleic acid dye acridine orange followed by imaging of the spots with a fluorimager Spots that gave no signal with the oligo dT probe nevertheless had a corresponding fluorescence signal except for the deliberately vacant positions in the right hand side of each of the microarray matrices shown in Fig 1 Furthermore there was one spot at which binding to the oligo dT probe was undetectable but at which there was nevertheless a very strong binding to the muscle probe That spot field 1d column 11 row 21 in Fig 1and position 14511 0 in Fig 2 corresponds to the enteric smooth muscle form of gamma actin Accession number T60048 which according to GenBank s annotation for that accession number is a possible reversed clone because polyT or polyA in its complementary strand was not found within it Observation of outlier microarray spots Although there is generally little correlation between the hybridization values obtained with oligo dT and muscle cDNA this may not be true for spots that show the greatest binding to oligo dT For the spots showing oligo dT hybridization values greater than 12000 phosphorimager units the corresponding value of the muscle cDNA hybridization is always 24000 or more phosphorimager units This result was obtained for the same eight microarray spots when microarray hybridizations were performed using muscle mRNA from both fa fa and Fa Fa Zucker rats In contrast spots with oligo dT hybridization values less than the threshold value of 12000 exhibit corresponding values for the muscle probe hybridization that may be anywhere between zero and the upper range of values The finding is not likely to be a chance happenstance for the following reason If the null hypothesis is that the muscle probe hybridization values for spots with polyA values 12000 have the same statistical distribution as spots with polyA values 12000 then the probability that all eight of them have values greater than the median is 1 2 8 0 0039 and the probability that all eight of them have a value greater than 24000 is less than 52 567 8which is less than 10 8 because only 52 of the 567 detectable spots have values greater than 24000 Thus we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the statistical distribution of muscle probe values among spots having polyA values greater than the threshold of 12000 is significantly different than that for the remainder of the spots The question then arises as to whether there is anything unusual about the clones used to generate the DNA for those eight outlier microarray spots that a priori would have allowed us to flag them as potential concerns As now described distinguishing features of the clones might be that 1 they have unusually short inserts or 2 they may contain an unusually large fraction of bases that might be expected to bind to oligo dT namely the bases that lie within a sequence run of AAAAAA Relation between clone sequence and oligo dT probe hybridization signal A search of GenBank reveals that only partial sequences are available for the clones corresponding to the eight outlier spots One of the clones has a partial sequence containing a polyA stretch consisting of 41 bases Accession H94857 3 and H94912 5 GCN5 general control of amino acid synthesis 5 like 1 spot 1e6 28 in Fig 1 point 33211 15102 in Fig 2 Five of the others have stretches of A or T between 15 and 26 bases which are not unusual Accession R52548 3 and R52604 5

Fig 2 and H93118 3 and H93246 5 EST spot 1c12 26 in Fig 1 point 42177 15785 in Fig 2 The other two clones contain stretches of A no longer than 6 bases Accession AA456352 5 and AA454703 3 DEAD H Asp

15760 in Fig 2 However N92646 contains an A rich stretch of 30 base pairs with 23 A bases and AA454703 contains more than one stretch of 6 A bases Because stable hybridization duplexes have been reported with oligonucleotides as short as 7 bases 5 and because such stable duplexes may be formed even if there are base pair mismatches 6 it is conceivable that the oligo dT probe could have hybridized to the A rich regions in the 3 or 5 ends of the DNA in each the outlier spots The oligo dT probe could also have hybridized to the unknown sequences between the 3 and 5 ends of these clone inserts so we sought their complete sequences For purposes of comparison we also sought the complete sequences of all clone inserts for which the muscle cDNA gave a hybridization signal in the range exhibited by the outlier clones 24000 phosphorimager units We sought the full sequences by using the clustering tool IMAGEne available at the IMAGE Consortium web page http image llnl gov This tool attempts to match the 5 and 3 partial sequences of a clone insert with the sequences of all other IMAGE clone inserts as well as with all RefSeq reference sequences 7 If matches are found the entire clone insert sequence may then be constructed by piecing together overlapping matches of the contiguous sequences Among the 52 clones for which the muscle cDNA gave a hybridization signal in the range exhibited by the outlier clones 24000 phosphorimager units it was possible to construct the entire insert sequence of 18 clones see Additional File 1 Three of these clones are among the outlier group for which the polyA signal is greater than 12000 phosphorimager units Additional File 1 Complete DNA sequences of 18 clone inserts This file contains complete DNA sequences of 18 clone inserts The clones correspond to microarray spots for which the muscle cDNA probe signal is greater than 24000 phosphorimager units The sequences were constructed using the clustering tool IMAGEne at the IMAGE Consortium web site http image llnl gov For each sequence we also provide the IMAGE clone ID Genbank accession numbers for the 5 and 3 partial sequences the RefSeq or IMAGE Consortium cluster ID that is used to join the 5 and 3 partial sequences the microarray location of the corresponding spot the strength of the corresponding signal from hybridizing to the oligo dT probe the strength of the corresponding signal from hybridizing to the muscle cDNA probe and the sequence length Click here for file We then noted two features of the sequence data that may explain in part the large signals that the outlier microarray spots exhibited when hybridized to the oligo dT probe The first feature is that the hybridization signal is generally inversely proportional to sequence length and two of the outlier clones have unusually short lengths As seen in Fig 3 the two outlier clones having insert lengths of less than 400 base pairs give the strongest hybridization signals Because each microarray spot has the same total amount of DNA 5 ng the microarray spots associated with these clones must have an unusually large number of short densely deposited target molecules and should therefore produce a proportionately large signal The third outlier spot had an oligo dT hybridization signal only barely larger than the threshold of 12000 phosphorimager units and has a somewhat longer insert length 622 base pairs The second noteworthy feature of the sequence data is that outlier spots may contain an unusually large fraction of bases that might be expected to bind to oligo dT namely the bases that lie within a sequence run of seven or more As AAAAAAA As seen in Fig 4 for two of the outlier clones the fraction of such bases have relatively high values of 0 028 and 0 040 The third outlier spot has an oligo dT hybridization signal only barely larger than threshold of 12000 phosphorimager units and has a more typical fraction of 0 020 Discussion When microarrays were first being developed investigators described situations in which their microarray hybridization data were dominated by the polyA effect in which poly T containing molecules which are produced by the reverse transcription of a poly A RNA mixture bind promiscuously to the poly A stretches of the DNA in microarray spots As illustrated by Nguyen et al 4 when this artifact is pronounced the amount of hybridization at a particular microarray spot is an indication of the accessible polyA content of the DNA at the spot rather than of the amount of the particular nucleic acid species in the hybridization solution that one intends to hybridize gene specifically to that spot Thus when the polyA effect is pronounced the hybridization of the reverse transcription product made from any poly A RNA mixture will be essentially the same namely the hybridization that would be obtained with an oligo dT probe alone This is because the binding of poly T containing molecules in the hybridization solution to the polyA stretches in the microarray spots dominates the hybridization results overwhelming the signal produced by gene specific hybridization 4 To reduce the polyA effect it has become common practice to add unlabeled polyA to the hybridization mixture to bind to the polyT segments of the hybridization probe thus competing with the polyA segments in the microarray spots Despite the use of this blocking procedure when microarray hybridization results obtained using probes derived from mRNA from two different sources are nearly the same one cannot be certain that the similarity of the results is due to the similarity of the different mRNA sources rather than to incomplete blockage of the polyA effect in both of the hybridizations We were faced with this issue when we obtained nearly identical microarray hybridizations using skeletal muscle mRNA from lean Fa Fa versus obese fa fa Zucker rats at an age of 6 weeks the age at which phenotypic differences between fa fa and Fa Fa are thought to begin Among the more than 5000 genes on the microarray only one was possibly expressed differentially the sarcomeric isoform of the mitochondrial creatine kinase gene sMtCK which appeared to have higher expression in the lean muscle We therefore conducted the experiment with the results shown in Figs 1and 2 in order to see whether we would obtain the same hybridization results using only end labeled oligo dT as a probe thereby providing evidence whether the polyA effect caused the two muscle cDNA hybridizations to produce similar results Our main results are the scatterplot showing microarray hybridization signals using a probe derived from muscle mRNA versus the signals using only an oligo dT probe Fig 2 The scatterplot exhibits only a weak correlation between these two hybridization results for the vast majority of microarray spots Furthermore we did not see a simple additive effect which might have been identified as follows Let the signal obtained at spot number i from hybridization with the probe derived from muscle mRNA be denoted as H i It may be represented as the sum of a background signal B i due to hybridization solely to the polyA segment in the spot plus the gene specific hybridization H i i e H i B i H i If we knew the background polyA hybridization B i for example by inferring its value from hybridization with the oligo dT probe we could subtract the polyA background to obtain a corrected gene specific hybridization signal i e H i H i B i However looking along the vertical axis of the scatterplot we were surprised to see that there are many spots at which H i is nearly zero indicating that B i must also be nearly zero even when there is a significant polyA signal The unexpected exception to this observation occurs when the polyA signal is greater than a threshold of about 12000 phosphorimager units As seen in Fig 2 for those eight microarray spots the value of the background polyA hybridization B i appears to be much larger than the median value of H i among all spots i e if the polyA signal is greater than 12000 then the value of H i will always be greater than 24000 phosphorimager units Furthermore as described in the Results section the statistical distribution of H i among spots having polyA values greater than the threshold of 12000 is significantly different than that for the remainder of the spots Regarding the question of whether there is anything unusual about the clones used to generate the DNA for those eight outlier microarray spots we found that distinguishing features of the clones might be that 1 they have unusually short inserts of less than 400 base pairs and 2 they may contain an unusually large fraction of bases that might be expected to bind to oligo dT namely the bases that lie within a sequence run of polyA Investigators might therefore use these as criteria for the potential existence of a polyA effect artifact and manufacturers of microarrays may use these criteria in deciding which clones not to use However apart from using empirical observations like those shown in Figs 3and 4 we have no suggestion for how to predict the magnitude of the oligo dT hybridization signal from the known sequences According to Southern and colleagues 8 the factor that determines the magnitude of oligonucleotide hybridization signals is not the stability of the duplexes that may be formed through hybridization but rather the rate of forward reaction which is determined by the rate of hybrid nucleation Their work indicates that the availability of nucleation sites in the immobilized target molecule will be determined by secondary structure which is not predictable in any obvious way from the primary DNA sequences Ongoing research into this problem interprets hybridization data not only in terms of Watson Crick base pairing but also in terms of base stacking interactions loops bridges and dangling ends and in the case of DNA immobilized on nylon membranes in terms of diffusion of solvents into and out of membrane pores multiple interactions within pores and details of the way in which the DNA is attached to its membrane support 8 Finally consider why there is a threshold oligo dT probe signal above which hybridization by an mRNA derived probe invariably produces a signal much larger than the median among the remainder of the microarray spots We suspect that the most important reason for the existence of a threshold signal is related to the formation of hybridization networks at these spots which are also known as hyperpolymers 9 If the polyT tail of a reverse transcribed probe molecule binds promiscuously to the polyA in one of these spots the remainder of the anchored probe molecule may hybridize to another labeled or unlabeled probe molecule in the hybridization solution which in turn may hybridize to yet another probe molecule in the solution etc forming a network of hybridized probe molecules If a threshold density of accessible polyA in the microarray spot s DNA is needed in order to form a stable anchor for such a network this would provide a mechanistic explanation for our observation Conclusions The PolyA effect may be more subtle than simply a hybridization signal that is proportional to the PolyA content of each microarray spot It may instead be present only in spots that hybridize oligo dT greater than some threshold level The strong signal generated at these outlier spots by cDNA probes might be due to the formation of hybridization heteropolymers Methods Housing and care of animals Female lean Fa Fa and obese fa fa Zucker rats 5 wk of age were purchased from the Animal Model CORE Facility of the University of California at Davis They were housed in the Animal Resource Center of the University of Texas at Austin under standard laboratory conditions All procedures were approved by the University of Texas at Austin Animal Use Committee Tissue samples Rats were quickly anesthetized by intravenous injection of sodium pentobarbital 50 mg kg Red quadriceps muscles from one leg of each animal were removed and freeze clamped as rapidly as possible with tongs that had been cooled in liquid N 2 Samples were stored at 70 C for later use Extraction of total and messenger RNA Tissue samples were homogenized in an acid phenol reagent with the volume of the tissue not exceeding 10 percent of the volume of the reagent used Total RNA was then obtained from the homogenate by the procedure recommended by the reagent s supplier TRI reagent Sigma T9424 This was followed by selection of poly A mRNA from the total RNA by hybridizing the RNA with oligo dT magnetic microparticles then isolating the mRNA magnetically mRNA Isolation Kit Miltenyi Biotec 751 02 The spectrophotometric 260 280 ratios for mRNA from the obese and lean tissues were 1 95 and 1 99 respectively which were sufficiently close to 2 0 that an additional round of oligo dT selection was not performed Preparation of first strand cDNA Complementary DNA was made using 200 ng of purified oligo dT primed mRNA and SuperScript II RNase H reverse transcriptase BRL Life Technologies 18064 014 The cDNA was made radioactive by incorporation of 33P dCTP ICN 58201 using the procedure described at http www resgen com gf200pro html except that 33 mM of dATP dTTP and dGTP Pharmacia 27 2035 01 and 1 U l of a ribonuclease inhibitor Ambion 2690 were added Unincorporated nucleotides were separated from the labeled cDNA using a push column Stratagene 400701 Hybridization to array membrane A high density DNA array membrane was used to measure the level of expression of each of 5 184 genes Research Genetics GENEFILTER GF200 Lot 980611 21 Hybridization of the membrane with radioactive cDNA was performed by the procedures described at http www resgen com gf200pro html except that the last room temperature wash was performed in 2X SSC The hybridization solution included 0 5 g ml poly dA Research Genetics POLYA GF and 0 5 g ml cot1 DNA BRL 15279 011 as blocking agents Stripping the filter in order to reprobe it was done by placing the filter in a boiling 1 SDS solution as recommended by the manufacturer The stripped filter was used to expose a phosphorimager plate which was then scanned The resulting image had 0 005 remaining from the image that was obtained before stripping We obtained nearly identical microarray hybridizations using cDNA prepared from skeletal muscle mRNA from lean Fa Fa versus obese fa fa Zucker rats at an age of 6 weeks the age at which phenotypic differences between fa fa and Fa Fa are thought to begin Only one gene was possibly expressed differentially the sarcomeric isoform of the mitochondrial creatine kinase gene sMtCK which appeared to have higher expression in the lean muscle We confirmed the sMtCK result with a Northern blot but did not do so for any of the other genes which may be considered a limitation of our experiment Quantifying the hybridization results Radioactivity in hybridized filters was imaged using a phosphorimager Model 445 SI Molecular Dynamics The resulting image files were then processed using custom software as shown in Fig 5 Each of the membrane s sixteen 12 30 spot arrays was extracted from the original image file along with a border of pixels corresponding to one spot width A background value was then estimated for each pixel in each of these images as follows If a pixel was situated in the region between or adjacent to DNA spots and if the spatial derivative of the image at that pixel indicated that it was not part of the overlap region between two intense spots that pixel was defined to be a background pixel If a pixel was situated within the region corresponding to a spot of DNA or if it was situated in the region between two overlapping intense spots the background value for that pixel was set equal to the value of the nearest background pixel as defined above A background subtracted image of the radioactivity was then obtained by subtracting the background value for each pixel from the original image The intensity of spots in an image is a function of how long the phosphorimager plate was exposed as well as factors such as the efficiency of probe labeling Therefore in order to be able to compare background subtracted images of the same 12 30 spot array for successive hybridizations normalization was performed as follows The image for one of the hybridizations was selected to be the reference and corresponding pixels in the other image were normalized by substituting them into a quadratic polynomial normalization function of the pixel value the coefficients of which were estimated by singular value decomposition SVD 10 This quadratic model allows for some compensation in the event that the response of the phosphorimager changes between measurements We found that the fitted second order coefficients were always very close to zero and the constant offset coefficients were also very close to zero Thus normalization of background subtracted images of the same array for different hybridizations was accomplished essentially by multiplying all pixels in the non reference image by a constant scale factor the value of which had been estimated by SVD Note that the phosphorimager data have units related to the voltage of its phototube which are not related in any obvious way to nucleic acid concentrations or amounts Some investigators rescale the data such that the average signal per microarray spot equals 1 but we did not do so The distance between spots on the array is only 0 75 mm and as a consequence many of the adjacent intense spots overlap one another When integrated intensity within a specified region about the center of the spot is used to represent the magnitude of hybridization it is then useful to model the image as the sum of superimposed two dimensional spot functions This was done using two dimensional gaussian functions to represent the spots as shown in Fig 5 with the location amplitude and standard deviation coefficients all estimated automatically from the background subtracted image in two dimensions using the Levenberg Marquardt method 10 The similarity between background subtracted and fitted spot images Fig 5bvs 5c indicates that much of the spread of the intense spots appears to be gaussian which might be attributed to the gaussian shape of the laser beam that scans the phosphorplate When the spot intensity was close to the noisy background level this model cannot be used to fit the data due to near singularity of the matrix equations that had to be solved to perform the fitting In that case the method that we used to estimate the intensity of each spot was to sum the nine adjacent pixels in the center of each spot of the background subtracted image The correlation between the values so obtained and the corresponding value of the integrated spot intensity from successful gaussian curve fitting was 0 99 A histogram was constructed from the logarithm of the values of all the spot values As observed in 11 the histogram for our muscle data was bimodal consisting of a gaussian like distribution of low intensity spots overlapping an adjacent distribution of moderate and high intensity spots The transition between these two distributions occurred within a clearly recognizable range of values 1550 to 1800 phosphorimager units We therefore followed the conservative practice recommended in 11 by considering all spot values less than a value of 1800 to define undetectable hybridizations According to this criterion 567 of the spots were detectable Search for promiscuous hybridization to polyA segments To investigate the polyA effect as a potential artifact we performed the following experiment using essentially the approach described in 4 Oligo dT 10 20 mer mixture Research Genetics cat POLYT GF was end labeled with T4 kinase Life Technologies 10476 018 and 33P ATP ICN 58000 The array filter was then hybridized with this probe in Hybrisol I Oncor S4040 for 10 hours at 42 C then washed twice at room temperature for two minutes in 6X SSC and 0 1 SDS It was then used to expose a phosphorplate for 12 hours which was scanned using a phosphorimager Model 445 SI Molecular Dynamics to identify the array spots having long stretches of poly dA Quantifying of the spot intensities was performed as indicated above Staining of the microarray filter with a fluorescent nucleic acid indicator After all hybridizations of the microarray filter had been performed we stained the filter with a fluorescent dye that is specific for nucleic acids We did so in order to determine whether the absence of hybridization signals for some microarray spots was due to the absence of any DNA there which would indicate a defect in the manufacturing of the microarray at those spots The filter was stained with 1 g ml acridine orange Sigma A6014 for 10 minutes at room temperature rinsed in distilled water then imaged with a fluorimager Molecular Dynamics The dye was excited by the 488 nm argon laser line of the fluorimager and emission was detected with a narrowband filter centered at 530 nm
