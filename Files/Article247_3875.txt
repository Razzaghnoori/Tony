Capital Gang Susan Page and Tucker Carlson CNN s Late Edition and George Stephanopoulos ABC s This Week The first woman president will like Golda Meir and Margaret Thatcher make no mention of gender argues Capital Gang s Kate O Beirne On Fox the panelists agree that most of Dole s supporters went to Bush and note that nationally Bush leads his challengers by 60 points But Bill Kristol This Week

have stayed in the race had she not been handcuffed by the 1 000 per head contribution limit imposed by the quarter century old campaign finance laws Some pundits think Dole may get the vice

House Speaker Dennis Hastert and Whip Tom Delay make the talk show rounds to support their party s budget strategy a 1 4 percent across the board spending cut to avoid using the Social Security surplus to balance the budget Many pundits such as Carlson Novak and Hunt think Clinton as usual has the upper hand while some such as Page think the GOP s across the board cut will win over the public A bitter sounding Novak says the real dirty little secret is that the non Social Security surplus has been spent for this year and there is no tax cut and the Republicans should be ashamed of themselves Appearing on NBC s Meet the Press Donald Trump announces he will join the Reform Party Monday and says there is a very great possibility that I will run for the party nomination for

a pre emptive strike on North Korean nuclear facilities and declares nuclear proliferation his highest priority He wants a substantial tax cut in line with the top Republican numbers and says he s opposed to NAFTA Would he support gay marriage and gays in the military His instinct is yes he says but since he s spent most of his life in Manhattan he d want to listen to Americans in the heartland and to military advisers to get their views He claims that his life has been a very very open book both his personal life which is always under media scrutiny and his financial life the casino and real estate industries are heavily regulated The pundits mostly snicker and scoff Steve Roberts calls Trump a celebrity airhead without ideas Also on Meet the Press Ken Starr concludes that in retrospect a separate independent counsel should have been appointed to look into Flytrap The broad scope of his investigation saved the taxpayers the cost of another prosecutor Starr notes but it hurt public confidence in his impartiality He also thinks that it was a mistake for him to continue practicing law while serving as independent counsel he speculates that had he not allowed himself to practice privately from the start he might not have been able to accept his appointment as independent counsel Pensive Poppy Fox conducts a charming interview with a reflective avuncular former President George Bush He expresses regret that as president he couldn t communicate his sense of humor his empathy and his religious faith as well as his predecessor President Reagan He thinks there is no place for a third party in American politics when asked whether Ross Perot sunk his re election campaign he says Yeah yeah Am I bitter about it Not anymore I didn t like it chuckling He claims no animosity toward Pat Buchanan you can t help but like the guy and threatens to sue Fortunate Son author J H Hatfield for his slanderous charge that Bush bribed a judge to expunge his son s putative

what the stuff is Interviewer and former Bush Administration employee Tony Snow praises him for his superhuman humility Last Word From Fox s interview with former President Bush I had led a very sheltered life and my closest friend upon joining the Navy was my mother I think we lost 9 pilots out of 15 original pilots in our squadron So it was traumatic And then I saw right in front of my eyes on the deck of the carrier a chief petty officer sliced into three parts by a propeller blade Boy it woke me up in a hurry In our family we have two sons in public life Both of them can interact with people better than I did I felt empathy in my heart as president but I didn t do it as well outreach showing compassion and concern as well as our sons did
