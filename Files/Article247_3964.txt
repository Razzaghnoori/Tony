 The Petting Party The top issues are the foreign policy pop quiz given to George W Bush by a television journalist and the ridiculousness of Naomi Wolf advising Al Gore A close second is the Justice Department s victory in the first round of the Microsoft anti trust trial Interviewed briefly on ABC s This Week Bush says that voters will choose their president based on judgment vision and philosophy rather than on factual knowledge The interview appears to be excerpted from a longer interview for another ABC program though Sam Donaldson fails to make this clear On CNN s Late Edition Wolf Blitzer tells Pat Buchanan At least I didn t ask you who the president of Croatia is Buchanan snaps Franjo Tudjman before Blitzer can finish the sentence Buchanan admits that Bush was entrapped but reminds viewers that W does not have his father s curiosity about world affairs Except for Eleanor Clift PBS s McLaughlin Group most pundits think the Bush interview was in the words of William Safire NBC s Meet the Press Bob Novak CNN s Capital Gang and Margaret Carlson Capital Gang gotcha journalism Also most admit to being as clueless as Bush This Week s George F Will claims that he like Bush knew only one name Michael Barone McLaughlin cracks that the interview tells you that the guy who just won all the money on Jeopardy should be president Several pundits such as Tucker Carlson Late Edition Tony Blankley McLaughlin and George Stephanopoulos This Week note that a more sophisticated candidate would have refused to answer the questions or else launched into a deeper discussion of foreign policy themes Mark Shields PBS s NewsHour with Jim Lehrer says the Bush camp is pleased that their candidate kept his cool under fire and Carlson says that anyway Bush s main selling point is temperament Brit Hume Fox News Sunday says that Gore s response to the Bush flap Gore announced he could have answered all the questions with no problem amounts to waving your hand in class and almost makes you worry about Gore Appearing on This Week Wolf downplays the importance of her advice to Gore and defends her right to earn what male campaign advisors make Barone notes that advice on gender issues is common in campaigns Carlson warns that Wolf s advocacy of heavy petting and onanism will not help Gore s popularity though it might spice up his campaign Novak thinks Gore is on the cusp of becoming ridiculous but Mark Shields Capital Gang and Al Hunt Capital Gang say Gore looks more relaxed on the campaign trail than ever For a Frame Game on Naomi Wolf click here for an

Orrin Hatch R Utah says the decision demands major changes in corporate policy at Microsoft and that it s not beyond the ken to see a breakup of the company Several commentators such as Diane Feinstein D Calif Late Edition Alan Murray PBS s Washington Week in Review and Juan Williams Fox predict that any punitive action will come after the market has already broken up Microsoft s monopoly anyway Hume argues that the monopoly label is a big leap from the evidence Novak says that Microsoft s strategy is to drag out its appeal until a Republican wins the White House and presumably drops the lawsuit Fox illustrates its commentary on the Microsoft findings with a duel scene from Monty Python and the Holy Grail in which one knight says I move for no man then gets his limbs chopped off and then claims it s just a flesh wound For Moneybox s take on the judge s findings click here Hall of Mirrors Asked whether the Naomi Wolf flap will hurt Gore Susan Page Late Edition says Voters don t care if Gore hires Naomi Wolf but I do think it reinforces an emerging perception for Al Gore which is that he doesn t know who he is Steve Roberts Late Edition and Brit Hume Fox give similarly reasoned comments on the Bush pop quiz ie it doesn t really matter but it reinforces the perception that it matters and therefore it matters For a Frame Game on the media s circular priorities click here And Now a Word From Our Sponsor This was a political attack on success The one thing the liberals can t stand is a successful corporation Klein doesn t know anything about antitrust he s a liberal politician So I think the idea of penalizing a great corporation with the use of a 19th century statute is a suicide on this country This is relief for the losing companies the losers not for the consumers Novak Capital Gang Last Word I am not a fashion consultant I do think it s a little sexist that that s been blown into something it isn t I took a cut in pay to work for Al Gore at 15 000 a month I took another cut in pay to work for him at 5 000 a month at a time where we re all tightening our belts Naomi Wolf on This Week My jacket is alpha male brown William Safire Meet the Press Actually I m a delta male Mississippi delta that is Trent Lott R Miss on Fox
