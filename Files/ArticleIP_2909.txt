 Better Late Than Ever I look like a dog Edgar Degas remarked of a pastel self portrait made when he was in his early 60s a century ago Hunched forward in a coarse painter s smock he peers forlornly at us his tired and damaged eyes rimmed with vermilion What appears at first glance to be a genie rising from his soft brown cap turns out on closer inspection to be the sinuous arm and towel in white chalk of one of Degas own bathers a pastel within a pastel For Degas who had forsworn self portraiture for 30 years this double image has the weight of allegory The aging and celibate artist has purchased a score of creative years at the price of physical collapse The portrait captures a fraught moment in Degas career when he had lost interest in the witty chronicle of modern life he d pursued with such brilliance for 20 years the parade of shopgirls and laundresses and jockeys and prostitutes that had made him famous The last of the impressionist exhibitions in which Degas had played so central a role was held in 1886 afterward he found himself increasingly isolated as well I am quickly sliding downhill he confided to an acquaintance at the time rolling I know not where wrapped up in lots of bad pastels as if in so much packing paper It turned out to be a long hill Degas lived until 1917 when blind brittle and beleaguered he died at 82 The surprising premise of the current exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago is that much of Degas most challenging and inventive work dates from the 1890s and the first years of this century Printed in bold letters at the entrance of the show is a startling claim by Degas fellow painter Auguste Renoir If Degas had died at 50 he would have been remembered as an excellent painter no more it is after his 50 th year that his work broadened out and that he really becomes Degas While the first part of Renoir s assertion is preposterous as anyone can see who peruses the dozen or so early works culled from the Art Institute s own spectacular collection of over 90 pieces by Degas that serve as an appetizer for the exhibition the show makes a convincing case for the vitality of Degas late work Holed up in his squalid attic studio in Montmartre models complained of the dust but Degas believed that sweeping just moved the dust around Degas narrowed his subject matter to a few recurrent motifs women bathing having their hair combed and dancing while at the same time experimenting with a remarkable range of techniques and media photography tracing paper lurid color combinations Many of his forays beyond impressionism as the curators point out anticipate some of the titans of 20 th century art Amorbid undertow pervades the early rooms of the exhibition apparent in the blank gaze for instance of H l ne Rouart in Her Father s Study c 1893 98 one of Degas last and finest portraits Draped over an empty chair the subject s expressive hands could be playing the piano or summoning up the ghost of her recently deceased father whose stacks of papers and Egyptian funerary art hem her in A frieze of four dancers c 1893 98 with gray white bodies their faces daubed with green and orange look like they ve just stepped out of a grave or a badly colorized film And indeed there s something almost cinematic in the similar poses of the dancers as they adjust their shoes like Eadweard Muybridge s freeze frames of bodies in motion with which Degas was familiar Those green and orange faces presage Degas growing interest in bright color in his later work Always curious about technological innovation Degas may have been excited by the new colors made available by the chemical industry at century s end Alternatively the bold hues might have resulted from Degas wretched eyesight those oranges may not have looked so bright to him which forced him to wear tinted glasses and keep his brown walled studio reproduced in the Art Institute s brown walls in a spectral gloom In any case little that has come before prepares the viewer for the visual shock of the outsized Combing the Hair c 1892 96 The gestures of the two women an attendant combing the long coil of her mistress s hair have a ritualized simplicity A single brushstroke enlarges the reclining woman s stomach indicating her pregnancy The whole composition is rendered in pulsating shades of red It seems fitting that this remarkable painting was owned for a time by Henri Matisse who experimented with similar monochromatic harmonies Those amniotic reds recur in the wrenched body of the nude figure in After the Bath Woman Drying Herself c 1894 96 Degas based the composition so suggestive of pain and isolation on one of his own photographs a medium in which he d begun to experiment around 1895 Degas was drawn to other methods besides photography for recycling his images using tracing paper to multiply a drawing then overlaying the copies with different colors to produce a range of emotional variants A particularly bizarre transformation occurred when he made a charcoal copy of one of his women having her hair combed He rotated the image 90 degrees overlaid it with vigorous layers of pastel and produced a perfectly convincing landscape Steep Coast c 1890 92 The woman s cascading hair becomes a cliff plummeting to the ocean below while her breasts and upraised knees are hills The riddling result judging from the Ah s and Oh yeah s of the crowd is as satisfying as the hidden pictures from a Highlights magazine in the dentist s office What the picture means a dubious equation of woman and nature the virgin land is a further enigma In focusing the show almost entirely on technique the organizers of Degas Beyond Impressionism have followed the lead of Degas himself who steadily eliminated from his work any reference to contemporary life preferring an artificial world of studio props and pliable models There is something artificial even about this heart of mine he wrote in 1886 The dancers have sewn it into a pink satin bag a slightly faded satin like their ballet slippers One is lulled into thinking that these contorted bathers are mere exercises in the handling of pastel and not the work of in the poet Paul Val ry s words a supremely cruel authority on female contours and poses A firestorm of feminist controversy already surrounds some of these works one side contends that these are refreshingly de idealized nudes the other side responds that the unusual poses and aggressive use of pastel are further degradations of women but you wouldn t know it from the placid audio tour or from the printed exhibition guide that replaces the usual wall panels More surprisingly there is not a single mention of the most important public event for Degas during the 1890s the Dreyfus affair when Degas didn t just look like a dog but behaved like one cutting off Jewish friends of long standing and adamantly insisting along with Paul C zanne and Renoir on the guilt of the Jewish army officer falsely accused of treason One must turn to the informative catalog by guest curator Richard Kendall to learn something of this unsavory episode in Degas life a further lesson that avant garde art and retrograde politics often coexist Degas very retreat from contemporary life owes something to his disgust with French society as he found it Next year the Art Institute will try for an impressionist hat trick as they add a Renoir show to the successes of last year s Monet extravaganza and this year s subtler and more demanding Degas As boating parties replace ballerinas on the T shirts and umbrellas for sale along Michigan Avenue the exhibition organizers shouldn t shy away from social context and controversy They can afford to risk a bit more grit in the
