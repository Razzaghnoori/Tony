 A Brief HistorY The early history of Nepal is a mixture of fact and myth religious lore is associated with virtually every landmark and event Actually so intertwined are legend and history that it is often impossible to determine where fact leaves off and legend begins The prime example of this commingling of fact and fiction involves the origin of the Kathmandu Valley Legend holds that the Kathmandu Valley was once a vast lake upon which floated a giant lotus flower from which emanated the light of Swayambhu the primordial Buddha When the Tibetan god Manjushri came to view this light he was unable to get close enough for a good look so he took his great sword and slashed through the mountains surrounding the valley to release the waters of the lake That is the myth The fact according to geologists is that the Kathmandu Valley was indeed once a lake though the valley s waters now drain through the narrow cleft of Chobar Gorge which was most likely created by a large earthquake One side effect of Manjushri s draining of the lake was that the snake gods called Nagas which lived in water were left with no place to live So once again Manjushri interceded and created a pond for them to live in This pond still exists today not far from Chobar Gorge However elsewhere around Kathmandu there are other stagnant ponds from which rise statues of Nagas these ponds too are dedicated to the snake gods Unity and Fragmentation The Licchavi dynasty of high caste Hindu origin ruled in the Kathmandu Valley from about a d 330 to 700 King Manadeva I a d 462 505 shook off the domination of the India Gupta emperors and extended his kingdom from the Kosi River in the east to the Gandaki River in the west and from the Terai to the Himalayan passes A great king of this line Amsuvarna 609 621 married his daughter Bhrikuti to the ruler of Tibet Srongtsen Gampo In 640 Bhrikuti and her Chinese co wife converted Srongtsen Gampo to Buddhism Bhrikuti is venerated as the Green Tara and the Chinese wife as the White Tara Their images are prominent in Nepalese Buddhist art Commercial and cultural links with Tibet and through Tibet with China were strengthened at this time More reliable records come with the next major dynasty the Malla who were established in about 1200 by the strongman Ari Malla The Malla came to Nepal in the first of several waves of Hindu fugitives from the 11th century Muslim invasion of northern India Many of the refugees were nobles of the Chetri warrior caste from Rajasthan forging new feudal states in Nepal they were responsible for reinforcing Hinduism at the expense of Buddhism The Kathmandu Valley itself was raided in 1336 by the Muslim Sultan of Bengal In seven days he destroyed both Hindu and Buddhist temples and statues including Swayambhunath and Pashupatinath These great shrines were later rebuilt and expanded into their present magnificence The Malla period saw completion of Nepal s most important palaces temples and works of art But Nepal and the Mallas became fragmented upon the death in 1482 of King Yaksha Malla who divided his lands amongst his heirs For the next three centuries Nepal had three city states side by side in the valley Kantipur now known as Kathmandu Lalitpur now known as Patan and Bhaktapur also sometimes called Bhadgaon along with their hinterlands Unification Modern Nepalese history really begins with the arrival of a dynamic leader bent on unifying the country Prithvi Narayan Shah The Great was born in 1723 in the ninth generation of a line of Hindu princes of Gorkha a hill town whose lands adjoined those of Kathmandu to the east Like the Malla the Shah princes had fled to Nepal from Rajasthan rather than convert to Islam Prithvi Narayan Shah captured Kathmandu and Patan in 1768 and Bhaktapur a year later Before his death in 1775 he had brought under one rule all the territory from the Mahakali River in the west to Sikkim and Darjeeling in the east During the reign of his son under a regent the borders were pushed further north and west provoking reactions from the Tibetans and Chinese as well as the British East India Company the power to the south The British invaded Nepal from India in 1814 but were repulsed by the king s soldiers from Gorkha thus earning all subsequent Nepali fighting men the name Gurkhas see page 61 The British were more successful on a second attempt in 1816 forcing Nepal to give up Sikkim Darjeeling and some territory to the far west The peace treaty signed at Segauli established Nepal s borders pretty much as they are today It also allowed a British representative to set up in Kathmandu the first Western envoy to the country and for the next century the only one Rise of the Ranas In 1846 during the course of an unsavory palace intrigue involving an unsolved murder meddling by the queen and the massacre of some 100 high ranking court figures who had been lured to a palace courtyard the instigator of these events became the power behind the throne He was an ambitious and unscrupulous 29 year old named Jung Bahadur Rana Before long he had exiled the king replaced him with the youthful crown prince and arranged to have himself and his family made hereditary prime ministers The Ranas were the rulers of Nepal for 104 years The Shah kings remained but had only ceremonial power The Ranas kept the country completely insulated from the outside world foreigners weren t allowed in and few Nepalis could go out Calling themselves Maharajahs the prime ministers and their relatives built dozens of palaces in Kathmandu usually in an incongruous neoclassical style The huge white Singha Durbar palace of the prime minister had 1 700 rooms far more than the king s Reconstructed after a fire in 1973 it serves today as the government secretariat and meeting place of parliament The Ranas also made a few modern improvements such as water and power works for the capital a 50 km 29 mile narrow gauge railway in the Terai a hospital and a museum There were not many driveable roads however so the Ranas new Rolls Royces were brought to Kathmandu in pieces either on frames carried by big teams of porters or on the ropeway a lift that carried freight from Hetauda in the Terai over the Mahabharat range Outside the valley Nepal slumbered on for all intents and purposes still in the Middle Ages Modern Times When India became independent in 1947 pressure for change mounted within Nepal In 1950 King Tribhuvan pretended he was going on a shooting picnic and managed to escape to India An uprising spread against the Ranas and Prime Minister Mohan Shumshere Rana resigned in 1951 King Tribhuvan returned a first constitution for the monarchy was installed and some foreigners were allowed into Nepal Two years later Mount Everest was conquered King Mahendra acceded to the throne on the death of his father Tribhuvan in 1955 After an experiment with elections and parliamentary democracy King Mahendra abolished the constitution in 1962 and instituted the system of panchayat democracy Road building and airport construction progressed during his reign After King Birendra became sovereign in 1972 tenth in the line of Shah rulers since King Prithvi the Great a referendum in which all Nepalis over 21 were eligible to vote confirmed the popular preference for the panchayat system over a return to multi party democracy However there was still some unrest regarding the issue The king deferred to demands expressed in student demonstrations by making the majority of the legislature directly elected with the council of ministers responsible to the parliament as well as to the king In 1990 in the wake of the Soviet Union s collapse Nepalis once again took to the streets to demand an end to the panchayat system After sometimes bloody protests and under pressure from India s Congress party King Birendra finally conceded to allow political parties and the kingdom s first truly democratic elections were held in 1991 Three years later the Communist party won a plurality of seats in parliament However without a majority the communists were forced to form a coalition government and in fact elections since 1994 have repeatedly ended in coalition governments being formed These governments have proved highly ineffectual in running the country and by the late 1990s there was growing discontent with the entire democratic process There was also a growing Maoist uprising taking place in the central hills of the kingdom In recent years the government and foreign donors have made great efforts to develop Nepal s rather sparse natural resources A number of hydro electric dams have been built or are being built roads are being extended schools and health posts are multiplying Progress however is offset by steep increases in the population At the same time almost total dependency on firewood for fuel has deforested the heavily populated middle mountain ranges and led to erosion landslides and loss of soil for agriculture Without trees to absorb the moisture monsoon rains run off rapidly swelling the rivers and causing severe floods downstream in India and Bangladesh Tourism is now the most important source of foreign exchange in Nepal It has grown from a few thousand adventurous souls 40 years ago to more than 300 000 visitors a year and it provides income for Nepalis in mountain villages as well as for those in urban hotels and construction jobs The influx of foreigners has added to pressures on the Himalayan environment but it hasn t spoiled the friendliness of Nepalis surely among the most welcoming people on earth Religions of Nepal With 90 of the population professing to be Hindus Nepal claims to be the only officially Hindu nation on earth While this is essentially true Hinduism in the Kathmandu Valley and other parts of the Middle Hills is inextricably interwoven with Nepal s unique form of pantheistic Buddhism In the higher elevations of the Himalayas among the people of Tibetan origin Buddhism is the dominant religion Overlay both of these religions with a strong dose of animism and you have a thoroughly inscrutable religious milieu in which Hindus and Buddhists worship at the same temples and rocks trees and waterfalls take on mystical importance However whether Hindu or Buddhist the people of Nepal live their religion on a daily basis and can be seen worshipping at shrines and temples throughout the day and night Saturdays the Nepali weekend many people head off to a temple for the day In Nepal both Hindu and Buddhist temples may take the pagoda form but all the Indian style stone shikara tower temples are Hindu and all the white dome like stupas are Buddhist The small trail side shrines in the high mountains called chortens are also Buddhist and often surrounded by stones carved with the Om mani padme hum incantation Hail jewel in the flower of the lotus Small stupas found around Buddhist and Hindu temples and known as chaityas are erected to hold relics or in memory of individuals Hinduism Rather than a formal church Hinduism is a guide to a virtuous life and a structure for social relationships It originated nearly 4 000 years ago with Aryan peoples who migrated to India from the vicinity of present day Iran These peoples revered the forces of nature personified by innumerable gods and goddesses whose activities and moral guidelines are chronicled in prayers hymns and poetic sacred epics of great antiquity At the heart of Hinduism is belief in a life essence and a common soul atman which all living things share and in reincarnation the soul s rebirth after death in another form What the next form will be depends on the sum of a person s actions in his previous life his karma Following rituals such as taking purifying baths making offerings to the gods and honoring them in festivals will lead to reincarnation in a higher form The highest form is liberation from the nuisance of repeated rebirth in this imperfect world Most Hindu temples in Nepal are dedicated to the great gods Vishnu and Shiva or their consorts and offspring Over the doorway of each of these temples is a semicircular panel called a torana with images of the resident god this will help you identify who s who Vishnu is the preserver of life Shiva is the destroyer whose destruction makes new beginnings possible The third member of the Hindu trinity is Brahma whose only task was to create the world All this would be simple enough but for the fact that the gods have appeared on earth in different incarnations or avatars with different names forms and natures Some even assimilate Buddhist and primitive non Hindu local deities If you are confused join the club so are the experts Vishnu for example can be Narayan floating on the primeval ocean or lying on a bed of snakes He is also Rama the model prince and star of the Ramayana epic and Krishna a lusty hero who is the central figure of the Bhagavad Gita a section of the Mahabharata epic As Rama he usually carries a bow and arrows As Krishna he is usually depicted with a blue face an after effect of swallowing a poison that threatened the world and is often represented playing a flute or sporting with the milkmaids he seduced As himself Vishnu is shown with four arms holding a lotus a club a conch shell and a disk often seated on a snake symbolizing eternity Vishnu may appear in art as a fish a tortoise a boar a man lion or a dwarf the first five of his nine avatars The ninth according to some Hindus was the Buddha His tenth incarnation to rescue the world from evil by destroying it and beginning a new cycle is due about 540 000 years from now Shiva as Pashupati is the lord of the animals and the guardian of Nepal He has 1 008 names in Sanskrit literature As Mahadev he is lord of reproduction represented by the lingam a phallus symbol often appearing in his temples as a stump of stone rising from the female symbol a disk called the yoni Shiva is also lord of learning and dance As bloodthirsty Bhairav fanged and festooned with skulls he destroys at will But he also destroys ignorance and misfortunes the reason he is the symbol of Royal Nepal Airlines A statue of Nandi the bull and a trident sign mark the temples of Shiva The wives of these gods also have numerous names and attributes Lakshmi Vishnu s wife was created from ocean foam like Venus and is goddess of good fortune and beauty Shiva s wife is Parvati also called Annapurna in Nepal She too has various aspects As Kali she is horrible to look at with a long tongue and staring eyes and is kept satisfied by the blood of sacrificed animals As Durga she is fierce riding a tiger and brandishing a sword Parvati also has more benevolent aspects such as Taleju patron deity of the Nepali royal family and Devi Shiva and Parvati are the parents of the elephant headed Ganesh easily the most popular of the family because he is capable of assuring the success of any venture Two other often represented deities are Hanuman the monkey god and helper of Rama and Garuda the winged birdman who carries Vishnu He regularly appears kneeling before temples to his master his palms joined together in the traditional namaste gesture of greeting and homage Most Nepalis begin the day by making an offering to a god or goddess whose favor they seek This act called puja may consist of placing a small dish of oil grains of rice or flower petals at an altar in the home at a temple or a tree stone or other place sacred to the spirits A priest or respected family member may place a tika a dot of red paste on a worshipper s forehead the spot where the beam of enlightenment is thought to emanate from Buddhism Siddhartha Gautama was born a prince in the line of Sakya kings in the sixth century b c near present day Lumbini As a young man he was sheltered from the harsh realities of life until one day he saw a sick man then an aged blind man and finally a body being carried to burial Profoundly shaken he left his wife and small son and became a wandering beggar searching for the meaning of existence But the life of an ascetic and the wisdom of Hindu teachers did not satisfy his quest Finally seated in meditation beneath a pipal tree at Bodh Gaya in India the Four Noble Truths were revealed to him He became the Buddha the Enlightened One and embarked on travels to spread his beliefs Buddha never claimed to be divine and in fact emphasized that all men could by their own efforts follow his path to enlightenment and the blissful state of nirvana release from the cycle of repeated births and deaths His Four Noble Truths are all life is suffering suffering is caused by desires desires can be suppressed and the way to become free of desires is to follow eight right principles the Eightfold Path These are right views right intentions right speech right conduct right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right contemplation After the Buddha s death at the age of 80 Buddhism eventually split into two main lines those who strictly followed his teachings the Theravada or Hinayana school of Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia and those who allowed new interpretations the Mahayana Buddhists of China Japan Korea Tibet India and Nepal The Mahayana allowed worship of the Buddha and recognized other holy figures as well These include a number of other Buddhas to be approached for favor through meditation and saint like Bodhisattvas who achieved enlightenment but remained active to help humankind find the right path In Nepal Bodhisattavas often seem to blend with Hindu gods and resemble them The Bodhisattvas Lokeswara Manjushri and Machendra are especially popular with both religions in the Kathmandu Valley Buddhism in Tibet and Nepal is influenced by elements of Tantrism techniques to speed up enlightenment These include learning physical and mental control through yoga exercises and also prayer and meditation rituals such as repeating certain phrases or mantras and concentrating on geometric designs called mandalas Prayer wheels which hold a scroll covered with prayers and flags multiply the power of prayer by adding to devotion the energy of movement Tantrism is also the source of the male and female symbols of the thunderbolt vajra also called dorje and the bell ghanta usually present in Buddhist ceremonies and of the system of lamas or high priests who are held to be reincarnations of holy men
