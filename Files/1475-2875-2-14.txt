 Background Mefloquine is a prophylactic antimalarial drug that is also used for malaria chemotherapy Adverse central nervous system CNS events have been associated with its use 1 2 Severe CNS events requiring hospitalization occur in 1 10 000 and 1 200 1200 patients taking mefloquine for chemoprophylaxis or treatment respectively 1 2 Milder CNS events e g dizziness headache and insomnia are a more frequent occurrence being experienced by up to 25 of patients receiving chemoprophylactic doses and 90 of those receiving therapeutic doses 1 2 Higher blood levels of mefloquine are reached under therapeutic regimens 2 1 23 M compared with those for prophylaxis 3 8 M 3 4 The relative incidence of adverse effects is therefore probably dose related although the concomitant effect of malaria during treatment cannot be dismissed It is likely then that the adverse neurological events associated with mefloquine have a biochemical basis To date no satisfactory biochemical explanation of the neurotoxicity of mefloquine has been proposed However two lines of evidence suggest that the endoplasmic reticulum might be a neuronal target of mefloquine Go and others 5 6 showed that mefloquine affects calcium flux into and out of isolated mammalian microsomes obtained from skeletal muscle and neuronal tissue These observations suggest that mefloquine might disrupt ER calcium homeostasis but are difficult to interpret since the experiments were not conducted in an intact cell system In an unrelated study we investigated the effects of mefloquine on global transcription in rat neuroblastoma NG108 cells using microarrays 7 Mefloquine caused a striking upregulation of growth arrest and development protein 153 GADD153 a transcription factor selectively modulated under conditions of ER stress 8 Taken together these observations suggest that mefloquine might perturb the function of the ER via a disruption of calcium homeostasis Most ER active agents e g thapsigargin and ryanodine deplete the ER calcium pool either by i inhibiting the ER calcium pump and thereby preventing the replenishment of the ER calcium pool or ii triggering ER ryanodine or inositol 1 4 5 trisphosphate IP 3 activated calcium release channels 9 These phenomena can be visualized by fluorescence microscopy as a transient increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentrations for example see 10 Nominally calcium free media are used so that the effect can be distinguished from calcium influx mediated via plasma membrane channels If the test agent can be shown to antagonize the release of calcium by a known ER agonist it can then be concluded that the ER calcium pool is a target of the compound ER function is critical if protein synthesis and folding is to successfully occur in eukaryotic cells 11 12 ER stress induced by cellular events as diverse as disrupted calcium homeostasis elevated levels of reactive oxygen species and viral infection leads to accumulation of dysfunctional ER chaperones and misfolded proteins 11 Cells respond by one or both of two conserved stress response pathways The first the ER overload response triggers the activation of the transcription factor NFkB and the subsequent upregulation of inflammatory proteins 13 The second the unfolded protein response UPR induces three divergent cellular events i the activation of transcription factor ATF6 leading to the upregulation of ER chaperones such as protein disulfide isomerase ii upregulation of the pro apoptotic transcription factor GADD153 and iii suppression of protein synthesis via phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 eIF2 by pancreatic eIF2 kinase PEK PERK 11 12 Upregulation of the ER chaperones GADD153 and PERK in response to a toxic insult would constitute direct evidence of an ER stress response In the present study using laser scanning confocal microscopy we show that the ER calcium pool is a target of mefloquine in rat neurons as under calcium free conditions the drug induces elevations in intracellular calcium concentrations and antagonizes the pharmacological effect of thapsigargin a known inhibitor of the ER calcium pump Further we show that in the presence of extra neuronal calcium mefloquine induces a sustained elevation of cytoplasmic calcium levels via an unknown mechanism The disruption of calcium homeostasis by mefloquine appears to be related in terms of dose effect and kinetics of action to the acute neurotoxicity of the drug In a microarray study we also show that mefloquine induces the transcription of key ER stress response genes Collectively the data suggest that mefloquine may inhibit neuronal ER function and disrupt neuronal calcium homeostasis at physiologically relevant concentrations in vitro Methods Materials Racemic erythro mefloquine was obtained from the WRAIR chemical inventory system The calcium sensitive dye Fluo3 was purchased from Molecular Probes Eugene OR Reagents used in cell culture and neurotoxicity neuroprotection assays were obtained from Sigma St Louis MO Biosource International Rockville MD and GIBCO Life Technologies Grand Island NY Preparation of primary neuronal cell cultures Primary neuronal cultures of feotal rat forebrains were prepared as described previously 14 Briefly the forebrains of feotal rat pups embryonic day 15 were isolated and the cells were dispersed by repeated mechanical trituration in neuronal culture medium NCM Ham s F 12 Basal Medium Eagle 1 1 supplemented with dextrose 0 6 g l glutamine 0 35 and Pen Strep 1 Following centrifugation 900 g 5 min and re suspension in fresh NCM the cells were counted and plated onto poly L lysine coated 48 well plates at a density of 0 5 10 6cells well For imaging experiments the neurons were transferred to 4 chamber cover glass slides that had been previously coated with poly L lysine followed by collagen Each chamber contained 1 10 6cells For the array studies the neurons 20 10 6neurons per flask were transferred to 75 cm 2flasks To suppress glial growth cultures were treated with cytosine D arabinofuranoside 10 5M after 3 days in vitro All cultures were maintained in an incubator 5 CO 2 37 C for at least 6 days and no more than 10 days prior to use Confocal microscopy The approach utilized for confocal microscopy experiments is similar to that employed in an earlier study 14 Neurons on chamber slides were treated with 5 M Fluo 3 AM for 1 h After 1 h in an incubator the cells were rinsed with fresh Mg 2 free Locke s solution NaCl 154 mM KCl 5 6 mM NaHCO 3 3 6 mM CaCl 2 2 3 mM glucose 5 6 mM HEPES 5 mM pH 7 4 and returned to the incubator for an additional 15 minutes prior to initiating the imaging experiments Changes in neuronal calcium homeostasis were monitored using a Bio Rad Radiance 2000 confocal imaging system Changes in cytoplasmic calcium were recorded as fluctuations in the emitted fluorescence of Fluo 3 complexed calcium at 530 nm excitation was 488 nm Sequential image scans of fields containing 5 25 neurons were used to construct temporal profiles of the effects of the different agonists Typically scans were made at 10 or 15 s intervals To compare the fluorescence levels in different neurons which were often in slightly different focal planes on different days the fluorescence readings at each time point were normalized to the first one taken for each neuron Effects of mefloquine on ER calcium homeostasis In the first series of experiments mefloquine s effects on mobilization of ER calcium stores were investigated The neurons chamber slides were rinsed twice with fresh low calcium Locke s buffer NaCl 154 mM KCl 5 6 mM NaHCO 3 3 6 mM CaCl 2 0 92 mM glucose 5 6 mM HEPES 5 mM EGTA 1 mM pH 7 4 and immersed in the same solution 240 l per chamber Neurons were scanned at 10 s intervals Mefloquine final concentration of 80 M or DMSO 0 2 thapsigargin 1 M glutamate 1 M and CaCl 2 1 6 mM were added after scans 3 33 63 and 67 respectively All drugs were prepared in calcium free Locke s solution containing no EGTA Data analysis was conducted only for neurons in which an increase in cytoplasmic calcium was observed after the addition of calcium chloride Effects of lower mefloquine doses on ER calcium homeostasis In a second series of experiments the effects of lower mefloquine doses on ER calcium homeostasis were investigated The neurons chamber slides were rinsed twice with fresh low calcium Locke s buffer containing DMSO NaCl 154 mM KCl 5 6 mM NaHCO 3 3 6 mM CaCl 2 0 92 mM glucose 5 6 mM HEPES 5 mM EGTA 1 mM DMSO 0 625 pH 7 4 and immersed in the same solution 240 l per chamber Neurons were scanned at 10 s intervals Mefloquine 2 10 30 60 80 or 200 M thapsigargin 1 M glutamate 1 M and CaCl 2 1 6 mM final concentration were added sequentially as outlined earlier except that for the lowest mefloquine dose experiment 2 and 10 M mefloquine were added to the same well after scans 3 and 18 respectively Selection of neurons for data analysis was conducted as described above For each mefloquine concentration in each experiment the maximum increase in the cytoplasmic calcium concentration relative to the baseline was determined at least four replicate experiments were conducted for each mefloquine concentration For example the maximum relative increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration induced by mefloquine at 80 M in one of the experiments was 2 95 as illustrated in Figure 1 Concentration response effects were then expressed as a percentage change in terms of the mean relative increase in cytoplasmic calcium observed at the highest mefloquine concentration The highest mefloquine concentration used was 200 M since this was the lowest concentration tested that induced almost 100 loss of viability after five minutes exposure Figure 3 Effect of mefloquine on cytoplasmic calcium homeostasis and its antagonisation by thapsigargin The effect of mefloquine on whole cell calcium homeostasis was also investigated The neurons chamber slides were rinsed twice with fresh Locke s buffer containing physiological levels of calcium NaCl 154 mM KCl 5 6 mM NaHCO 3 3 6 mM CaCl 2 2 3 mM glucose 5 6 mM HEPES 5 mM pH 7 4 and immersed in the same solution 240 l per chamber Neurons were scanned at 15 s intervals Mefloquine 80 M thapsigargin 4 M or DMSO 0 4 were added after scan 13 and DMSO 0 2 or mefloquine 80 M after scan 28 Detection of transcriptional changes in key ER stress response genes using microarrays Neurons 75 cm 2culture flasks were treated with 0 2 DMSO controls 2 10 or 80 M mefloquine in Locke s buffer containing calcium for five minutes This treatment time was chosen because the depletion of the ER calcium store by mefloquine occurs within this time period After 5 min the media were replaced with MEM containing 0 02 DMSO for the control 10 and 80 M mefloquine treatment groups or 2 M mefloquine for a further 24 h Therefore neurons were exposed to the lowest mefloquine concentration for 24 h A recovery period of 24 h is required following an insult with an ER agonist to induce a maximal ER stress response 8 After 24 h total RNA was extracted from the flasks using RNA STAT 60 as previously described 7 The experiment was repeated five times on independent occasions Detailed procedures for preparation of cDNA and fluorescently labeled cRNA hybridization staining and scanning of gene chips and assay monitoring are outlined in earlier literature 15 The platform chosen for global expression profile was the Rat Genome U34 Array Affymetrix Santa Clara California which contains probes for a total of 8799 expressed sequence tag EST clusters and genes including controls RNA 10 g extracted from each individual flask was hybridized to a single gene chip i e a total of 20 chips were used Affymetrix analysis software version 5 was used to generate average difference AD values for each gene for each treatment Affymetrix Santa Clara California AD values represent the difference in mean fluorescence between positive and mismatch probe cells for each gene and are hereafter referred to as expression values The Affymetrix website http www affymetrix comwas searched using the terms PEK PERK GADD153 and the gene names for ER chaperones previously identified as being upregulated during an ER stress response 12 and where they were represented by probe sets on the U34 arrays corresponding accession numbers were identified The expression values for these accession numbers were imported directly into Parteck Pro 2000 No additional data normalization or scaling methods were employed as these procedures were performed previously by the Affymetrix software One way ANOVAs were performed to compare the mean expression levels of each of the genes amongst the different treatment groups A significant change in mean expression level was assumed to have occurred where ANOVA P values were 0 05 A less conservative significance threshold was considered appropriate since the total number of hypotheses i e tests of significance conducted was small For a particular treatment group a gene was considered to have differentially modulated expression where the fold change in expression exceeded 1 3 Fold changes FC in expression were defined as mean mefloquine expression level mean DMSO expression level Where a gene was represented by more than one probe set data is presented only for those probe sets for which the ANOVA P value was 0 05 Viability measurements Neuronal viability was assessed using the colorimetric MTT assay as described previously 14 All experiments were conducted in Mg 2 free Locke s solution unless otherwise indicated Neurons were exposed to graded concentrations of mefloquine for 5 or 20 min and 24 h After treatment mefloquine dilutions were removed and replaced with MEM Gibco The neurons were incubated for a further 24 h The next day MTT was added to each well such that the final concentration of the dye was 150 g ml Plates were then returned to the incubator for 1 h at which time unincorporated MTT was removed and the plates were allowed to air dry The purple formazan product indicative of viable cells was then dissolved by adding 250 l acidified isopropanol 95 isopropanol 5 2N HCl and 200 l aliquots were collected The absorbance of these aliquots was measured on an ELISA plate reader at 540 nm The effects of mefloquine were compared to appropriate DMSO controls The acute toxicity of the low calcium Locke s solution was also investigated Neurons were exposed to the buffer at 2 5 minute intervals over a 15 min time period Effects of the various treatments were compared to appropriate controls Locke s solution with and without calcium and or 1 mM EGTA for 15 minutes Viability was assessed as above except that the neurons were not incubated overnight in MEM prior to performing the MTT assay Neuroprotective effect of thapsigargin The effect of mefloquine 10 or 80 M for 5 min before and after pretreatment with thapsigargin 4 M for 5 min on the viability of rat neurons was assessed as described above The degree of neuroprotection afforded by thapsigargin was basically the extent to which the drug reversed the decline in absorbance viability induced by mefloquine and was calculated as previously described 14 Statistical analyses data analysis and presentation For the confocal experiments the data are presented as mean normalized Fluo 3 fluorescence the standard error of the mean SEM and are representative of at least three replicate experiments Toxicity and neuroprotection data are presented as mean viability or raw A 540 values SEM and represent the results of at least three experiments in every case Samples sizes are outlined in the table or figure legends For the toxicity experiments the significance of multiple treatments was assessed using one way ANOVA and Dunnett s t test For the neuroprotection experiment the data were analyzed using a two way ANOVA with a P value 0 05 for the interaction between mefloquine and thapsigargin taken to represent an antagonistic effect of the two compounds Statistical procedures for the analysis of microarray data are discussed above Fifty percent inhibitory or effective concentrations and 95 confidence intervals IC 50 or ED 50 for the effects of mefloquine on neuronal viability and calcium homeostasis were calculated using Prism software Results Effects of 80 M mefloquine on ER calcium homeostasis As can be seen from examination of the first peak in Figure 1 mefloquine caused a transient increase in intracellular calcium levels whereas DMSO did not Mefloquine also antagonized the subsequent transient elevation of cytoplasmic calcium induced by the addition of thapsigargin as can be seen from examination of the second series of peaks in Figure 1 A subsequent addition of glutamate failed to elicit a calcium response whereas addition of calcium chloride to the medium did The antagonisation by mefloquine of the ER calcium release induced by thapsigargin a specific inhibitor of the ER calcium pump suggests that mefloquine mobilizes ER calcium stores Glutamate induces the activation of plasma membrane influx channels therefore its failure to illicit a calcium response shows that the external media contained low levels of free calcium Therefore the elevation of intracellular calcium cannot be attributed to influx from an external source The subsequent ability of the neurons to elicit a response after restoration of normal levels of extracellular calcium shows that the neurons selected for the confocal microscopy experiments remained viable for the duration of these experiments Low calcium Locke s buffer does not substantially reduce neuronal viability The neurotoxicity of the low calcium Locke s buffer was investigated over time As can be seen from Figure 2 substitution of normal Locke s buffer for one containing no added calcium results in a loss of neuronal viability 27 reduction Welch s test P 0 005 n 8 This solution was not used for the mefloquine studies because control experiments showed that glutamate elicited a calcium response in neurons exposed to this buffer data not shown presumably because the rinsing procedure did not remove all residual free calcium We utilized a low calcium 920 M Locke s buffer supplemented with EGTA 1 mM for the confocal microscopy experiments As can be seen from Figure 2 exposure to this buffer for 10 minutes was required to reduce the viability of the neurons below that induced by treatment of neurons with Locke s containing no added calcium one way ANOVA and Dunnett s test P 0 05 n 44 All mefloquine calcium response experiments were conducted within this time frame and care was taken to analyze data only from neurons that were shown to be viable at the termination of the experiment as indicated by the CaCl 2 induced calcium response Effect of lower mefloquine concentrations on ER calcium homeostasis and relationship to time dependent neurotoxicity We next investigated the effects of lower mefloquine doses on neuronal ER calcium homeostasis i e in low calcium Locke s buffer At concentrations of at least 30 M mefloquine induced a transient increase in cytosolic calcium levels Table 1 one way ANOVA Dunnett s t test P 0 05 n 29 The effect was dose related with an ED 50 of 66 M 95 confidence interval 33 130 M The IC 50 of mefloquine s effect on neuronal viability after 5 min exposure was 62 19 204 M and the dose response curves of the two effects are super imposable Figure 3 These data suggest that the two effects may be related The IC 50 s of mefloquine s effect on neuronal viability were 23 18 28 and 19 11 32 M for exposure times 20 min and 24 h respectively The concentration effect curves are super imposable Also at a concentration of 50 M mefloquine exhibited a greater neurotoxic effect after 20 min or 24 h exposure as compared to a 5 minute exposure one way ANOVA and Dunnett s t test P 0 0001 n 12 Therefore it appears that most of mefloquine s neurotoxic effects occur within 20 min of exposure but cannot be accounted for solely by the disruptive effect of mefloquine on ER calcium homeostasis Consequently we investigated the effect of mefloquine on neuronal calcium homeostasis in calcium containing media Effect of mefloquine on whole cell calcium homeostasis The effects of mefloquine on neuronal calcium homeostasis in calcium containing medium were investigated As shown in Figure 4 mefloquine 80 M caused an immediate and sustained rise in cytoplasmic calcium levels In some experiments this sustained elevation of cytoplasmic calcium was preceded by a transient rise as observed in low calcium Locke s as in Figure 1 The sustained elevation of cytoplasmic calcium can only be due to entry from an external source as it was not observed in the low calcium medium Thapsigargin antagonizes the disruptive effect of mefloquine on calcium homeostasis and protects neurons from cellular injury Pre treatment with thapsigargin 4 M antagonised both the initial rise in intracellular calcium attributable to the effect of mefloquine on the ER calcium store and the subsequent sustained influx of external calcium Figure 4 We next investigated the possibility that thapsigargin pretreatment might have a protective effect on neurons exposed to mefloquine Rat neurons were pretreated with either thapsigargin 4 M or DMSO 0 4 for 5 min prior to the addition of DMSO 0 2 or mefloquine 10 or 80 M for 5 min The drugs were then removed and incubated in calcium containing MEM medium for 24 h prior to viability assessment using the MTT assay As can be seen in Figure 5 pretreatment with thapsigargin reduced the decline in viability absorbance induced by mefloquine by 60 There was a significant interaction between thapsigargin and mefloquine indicating that the drugs behave antagonistically two way ANOVA P 0 0001 n 48 Mefloquine upregulates the transcription of important ER stress response genes The Rat Genome U34 array was found to contain probe sets representing the ER chaperones glucose regulated protein GRP 78 protein disulfide isomerase GRP94 calreticulin and endoplasmic reticulum protein 29 EPR29 GADD153 and PERK Mefloquine 80 M upregulated the transcription of four of five ER resident chaperones GRP78 PDI GRP94 and calreticulin GADD153 and PERK one way ANOVA P 0 05 n 20 FC 1 3 Table 2 Mefloquine induced no transcriptional changes at 2 M 24 h or 10 M 5 min Relative transcriptional changes at each concentration for GRP78 GADD153 and PERK are shown in Figure 6 Mefloquine induced no significant change in the levels of tubulin mRNA Table 2 Figure 6 tubulin was called present by Affymetrix software in all 20 samples mean P 0 00106 and the mean control DMSO AD SEM value was 444 88 Discussion There are relatively few studies that have attempted to address the possibility that a biochemical explanation may lie behind the neurotoxicity of mefloquine However previous literature suggested that mefloquine might disrupt ER calcium homeostasis Firstly Go and others 5 6 showed that mefloquine alters calcium flux into and out of isolated mammalian microsomes obtained from skeletal muscle and neuronal tissue Secondly mefloquine has been shown to cause a striking upregulation of GADD153 a transcription factor selectively modulated under conditions of ER stress 8 However the depletion of the ER calcium pool on the one hand and a consequent induction of an ER stress response have not been shown to occur simultaneously in intact primary neurons In the present study utilizing confocal microscopy and Affymetrix arrays we have shown that at least one component of the neurotoxicity of mefloquine can be attributed to an effect on the ER calcium store and that the drug activates a UPR similar to that induced by agents known to disrupt ER function We employed confocal microscopy as a tool to investigate the effects of mefloquine on calcium homeostasis This approach has an advantage over that employed by Go et al 6 in that calcium homeostasis can be assessed in real time in live intact neurons Our data show that in nominally calcium free medium mefloquine induces a transitory elevation of cytoplasmic calcium levels and antagonizes a similar effect induced by thapsigargin The most reasonable interpretation of these data is that mefloquine mobilizes a thapsigargin sensitive calcium pool and since thapsigargin is known to mobilize the ER calcium pool that this is also the case for mefloquine The ER calcium pool can be mobilized in two ways Firstly an inhibitory effect of an ER active agent e g thapsigargin on the ER Ca 2 ATPase results in a decrease in the rate of calcium influx across the ER membrane As a consequence of a passive leak of calcium ions across the ER membrane into the cytoplasm the store becomes depleted and a transient elevation in the cytoplasmic calcium concentration occurs Alternatively some ER active agents e g ryanodine deplete the calcium store by activating calcium release channels Either of these effects could account for our observations Compromised ER function induced by numerous stressors including depletion of ER calcium stores may lead to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER 11 These events may trigger the UPR in which the transcription of genes encoding ER resident chaperones is upregulated The ability of mefloquine to upregulate the transcription of PDI GRP78 GRP94 and calreticulin is consistent with this hypothesis Triggering of the UPR also results in the suppression of global protein synthesis as PERK is activated and phosphorylates EIK2 which can only interact with the appropriate ribosomal binding sites in an unphosphorylated state 11 12 While the upregulated transcription of PERK is not required for its activation it s over expression can lead to the enhanced phosphorylation and therefore inactivity of EIK2 16 Therefore its up regulation by mefloquine supports the hypothesis that the drug triggers an UPR The third component to the UPR cascade is an induction of the ER transcription factor GADD153 11 12 an effect also observed after mefloquine treatment Thus it appears that mefloquine induces an UPR similar to that induced by agents e g thapsigargin known to cause ER stress 8 The effects of mefloquine on ER calcium homeostasis have been examined previously 5 6 In experiments with isolated rabbit skeletal muscle microsomes mefloquine was found to inhibit the uptake of calcium with an IC 50 of approximately 43 M 6 This effect was exacerbated by treatment with thapsigargin a specific inhibitor of the ER calcium pump 6 Further the rate of ATP hydrolysis by the ER Ca 2 ATPase was reduced in the presence of mefloquine Ki of 53 M These authors concluded that the ER calcium pump might be a target of mefloquine As discussed above our own data are also consistent with such a mechanism The observation by Go et al 6 that the effects of mefloquine and thapsigargin on microsomal calcium uptake are synergistic might seem at first to contradict ours However it should be pointed out that in our study we treated neurons with these two agents sequentially so that in effect one of the agents was acting on a depleted ER calcium pool Under the conditions employed in our study it is not surprising that mefloquine antagonized the effect of thapsigargin Li et al 5 also found that mefloquine inhibited calcium uptake into isolated microsomes from dog brain neurons presumably via the same mechanism although the drug was much less potent IC 50 of 272 M than we are reporting it to be We observed an approximately four fold more potent effect of mefloquine on ER calcium homeostasis in rat neurons IC 50 of 66 M It would be tempting to speculate that because mefloquine s effects on rat neuronal ER calcium homeostasis were more potent than that for dog brain microsomes there might exist a species difference in sensitivity to the drug However this would be premature since the two studies have employed markedly different experimental systems to observe similar phenomena Li et al also observed that mefloquine inhibited IP 3 induced calcium release from isolated dog brain microsomes 5 Our results do not preclude such a role for mefloquine in neuronal cells although it would not have been possible to observe such an effect in the present study since we investigated only the spontaneous action of mefloquine on ER calcium homeostasis Mefloquine s disruption of ER calcium homeostasis may contribute to the acute neurotoxicity of the drug since the concentration response for these effects are superimposable over the same time frame 5 minutes However the toxicity of the drug is somewhat time dependent since the magnitude of its effect is greater after twenty minutes exposure as compared to five minutes We also investigated mefloquine s effects in calcium containing medium and found that the drug induces a sustained secondary rise in cytoplasmic calcium originating from an external source Thapsigargin blocked both the initial and secondary rises in cytoplasmic calcium induced by mefloquine and partially reversed the neurotoxicity of the drug These observations are suggestive of two things Firstly the trigger for the sustained elevation in cytoplasmic calcium may occur at the level of the ER and secondly this effect may also contribute substantially to the neurotoxicity of mefloquine However the molecular basis for these two events is unclear It is possible that mefloquine induces store mediated capacitative calcium entry see reference 17 However it is unclear why thapsigargin which also depletes the ER calcium store would not produce a similar effect Our laboratory is currently investigating the possibility that known inhibitors of store mediated calcium entry e g non hydrolysable GTP analogs and SKF96365 might also block the effects of mefloquine Mefloquine use has been associated with two broad classes of neurological disorders i central and peripheral nervous system disorders including headache dizziness vertigo and seizures and ii psychiatric events including insomnia anxiety affective and major disorders 2 It is well known and has been accepted for some time that prolonged disruptions in Ca 2 homeostasis can result in impairment of neuronal function and cell death 18 19 Impairment or loss of neurons in specific regions of the brain might be manifested in symptoms reported to have occurred in patients treated with mefloquine For example the vertigo reported by some patients might be attributable to neuronal death in the inferior cerebellum 20 whereas symptoms of fear anxiety might arise as a consequence of the death of neurons in the amygdala 21 Mefloquine induced neurotoxicity in the limbic system might be responsible for reported disturbances in emotion 22 Mefloquine accumulates to plasma concentrations of 3 8 and 2 1 23 M after administration at prophylactic dose and therapeutic dosing respectively 3 4 Therefore only at the time of peak plasma concentrations in a few patients do mefloquine plasma concentrations approach the threshold necessary 10 M to induce any of the effects observed in the present study However in human post mortem cases mefloquine has been found to accumulate in the brain relative to plasma by as much as 30 fold with absolute equivalent concentrations exceeding 50 M Table 3 These observations have been confirmed in rats where the accumulation was found to be 12 5 fold with absolute equivalent concentrations exceeding 90 M Table 3 Thus mefloquine apparently crosses the blood brain barrier and accumulates to sufficient levels to include those concentrations found to disrupt neuronal calcium homeostasis and ER function in vitro The possibility that a disruption of neuronal calcium homeostasis or ER function may be responsible at least in part for the clinical neurotoxicity of mefloquine is worthy of further investigation Conclusion Mefloquine was found to disrupt calcium homeostasis in rat neurons by mobilizing the ER calcium pool and inducing a sustained elevation of cytoplasmic calcium originating from an external source Mefloquine also induced a characteristic ER stress response The effects were observed at physiologically relevant concentrations and may contribute to the acute neurotoxicity of the drug in vitro Competing Interests None declared
