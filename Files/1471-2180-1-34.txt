 Background Over the last decade RNA interference RNAi mediated by short interfering double stranded RNA molecules siRNA or dsRNA has been gradually recognized as a major mechanism of post transcriptional gene silencing PTGS in species as diverse as plants Drosophila and C elegans 1 Recently 21 nucleotide long dsRNA molecules corresponding to specific mRNA sequences when introduced into mammalian cells in culture have been shown to be highly effective in degrading the cognate mRNAs and thus abrogating the expression of the corresponding proteins 2 Although the exact mechanism of PTGS is currently unknown and is an area of intense research the successful use of this phenomenon in cultured mammalian cells has raised the exciting prospect that it can be used as a simple strategy for phenotypic ablation of mammalian gene function ex vivo without the time consuming and expensive construction of transgenic animals So far the genes targeted for siRNA mediated PTGS have been cellular in origin and thus the mRNAs were transcribed in the nucleus by cellular DNA dependent RNA polymerase In contrast the vast majority of RNA genomes are transcribed exclusively in the cytoplasm For example transcription of RNA viral genomes with the exception of retroviral RNA is catalyzed by a virally encoded RNA dependent RNA polymerase RdRP 3 It remains untested whether the siRNA mediated PTGS will work on mRNAs that never went through the nucleus Interestingly because of the potency of siRNA in some organisms it has been proposed that they may be replicated by a cellular RdRP activity although this has been debated 4 Furthermore since dsRNA is known to be a potent inducer of the interferon pathway 5 6 it is important to know whether this also occurs in cells in which antisense dsRNA has been introduced To answer these questions we have used a nonsegmented negative strand RNA NNR virus as a test target for RNA mediated inhibition We reasoned that if successful our studies would additionally contribute a reliable and simple technology for specific gene silencing in cytoplasmic RNA viruses Traditionally structure function analyses of RNA genomes including those of RNA viruses have relied on spontaneous mutants found in natural isolates or chemically mutagenized stocks 7 Mutations in either case are essentially unpredictable and must be mapped by elaborate techniques such as classical complementation analyses or direct sequencing of the genome Since conventional site directed mutagenesis requires a DNA template direct mutational analysis of selected RNA genes is not an option These obstacles have been largely circumvented by the use of cloned viral cDNA that is then altered by standard DNA based site directed mutagenesis procedures 8 9 Originally designed for influenza virus minigenomes 10 such cDNA based reverse genetics strategy has been adopted in a large number of NNR viruses including vesicular stomatitis virus VSV respiratory syncytial virus RSV and measles to name a few 11 12 13 14 Recently extension of this approach has resulted in the cloning of full length viral cDNA capable of producing infectious recombinant virus particles upon transcription Despite its revolutionary effect on RNA viral reverse genetics however the cDNA based strategy is not without limitations First as implied above cloning and recombinant expression of the viral genomic RNA and all the viral proteins in the right proportion constitute a long and arduous task daunting to an average laboratory The problem is particularly acute for NNR viruses which have large RNA genomes 8 9 The 10 15 kb long RNA genomes of these viruses require specific sequences at the 5 and 3 termini for transcription and replication and must be properly encapsidated by the nucleocapsid protein N in order to be recognized by the viral RdRP 15 16 Thus any recombinant technology must be able to faithfully reproduce these features of the genome Moreover the functional viral RdRP as detailed later for RSV is a complex holoenzyme composed of viral as well as cellular proteins 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 Second many NNR viral genomes and proteins are currently expressed from vaccinia based cDNA clones which generally requires superinfection by vaccinia virus 22 23 Unfortunately vaccinia virus itself is a major modulator of cellular signaling including MAP kinase pathways and the actin cytoskeleton 24 25 26 It is therefore virtually impossible to study the interaction between cellular signaling pathways and NNR viruses in cells that are also superinfected by vaccinia virus 24 25 26 Third mutations in the recombinant DNA are permanent and thus the mutational phenotype cannot be switched on at pre determined time points in infection For example if a viral gene product has essential roles both early and late in infection its mutational inactivation will fail to reveal the late function since the mutant virus will never proceed beyond the early stage A member of the Paramyxoviridae family RSV is a major causative agent of childhood respiratory disease and asthma 27 Pediatric RSV disease claims about a million lives annually and no reliable antiviral or vaccine currently exists 27 28 A need to understand the molecular genetics of the virus and the function of the various gene products has thus been appreciated Since our laboratory is interested in deciphering the temporal signaling pathways in host RSV interaction and the role of RSV gene products in the process we have sought potential alternatives to the cDNA based approach that might allow us to study the effect of functional loss of a specific RSV gene product during the course of a standard virus infection in cell culture Using two different RSV gene mRNAs as targets and another NNR virus VSV as well as cellular mRNAs as controls we show that synthetic dsRNA molecules are highly efficient and specific silencers of cytoplasmic RNA viral gene expression We also provide the first direct evidence that the 21 nt long dsRNAs do not activate a general interferon response Our results thus offer a mechanism of specific and direct ablation of RNA based gene expression and a quicker and simpler alternative to cDNA based reverse genetics of RNA viruses Results Ablation of viral gene expression by dsRNA against RSV P mRNA The RNA genome of RSV is about 15 kb long and contains 11 documented protein coding genes 13 Three viral proteins are minimally required to reconstitute the functional transcription complex of NNR viruses 3 the nucleocapsid protein N that wraps the negative strand genome RNA and its full length complement the positive strand antigenome RNA thus converting them into highly nuclease resistant chromatin like templates the large protein L which is the major subunit of the RdRP and the phosphoprotein P which is the smaller subunit of RdRP and an essential transcription factor of L 19 20 21 22 In RSV optimal transcription although not replication additionally requires the transcription antitermination protein M2 1 13 In addition cellular actin and to a lesser extent profilin are also required for viral transcription 17 18 The overall steps of a NNR viral macromolecular synthesis in the infected cell are relevant for this paper and are briefly described here 3 The L protein is believed to encode the basic RNA polymerization function and binds to the viral promoter at the 3 end of the genomic RNA to initiate transcription However the P protein is essential for the RdRP holoenzyme to exit the promoter and to form a closed complex that is capable of sustained elongation 20 The preformed RdRP brought in by the infecting viral nucleocapsids catalyzes the first rounds of transcription known as primary transcription In its transcription mode the viral RdRP starts and stops at the beginning and end respectively of each viral gene and this results in the synthesis of individual gene mRNAs Unlike the full length genomic and antigenomic RNA the mRNAs are 5 capped 3 polyadenylated and do not bind N protein Translation of these mRNAs results in de novo synthesis of viral proteins The availability of large quantities of N protein then allows encapsidation of nascent leader RNA by N This leads to the switching of the RdRP to the replication mode resulting in the synthesis of full length encapsidated anti genomic RNA which is in turn replicated into more genomic RNA 15 Thus the very requirement of N for replication ensures that all full length genomic and antigenomic RNA are wrapped with N protein i e encapsidated 15 The new pool of replicated genomic RNA serves as templates for secondary transcription It should be obvious from the foregoing that the de novo macromolecular synthesis accounts for the major burst of viral protein and RNA in the infected cell Specifically if the de novo synthesis of the essential subunits of viral RdRP such as L or P is inhibited it will abolish the bulk of viral transcription and replication and hence viral translation 3 To test the effectiveness of the anti P dsRNA we transfected the dsRNA into A549 cells and infected the cells with RSV Subsequently the amount of intracellular P protein was directly monitored by immunoblot analysis using anti P antibody Results presented in Fig 1show a nearly 90 reduction of P protein using as little as 10 nM dsRNA Although we have not tested lower amounts of dsRNA for P the severe loss of P protein at 10 nM dsRNA and only a slightly greater loss with higher dsRNA concentrations Fig 1 suggest that it may be possible to cause substantial ablation of P protein at dsRNA concentrations even below 10 nM The phenotypic effect of loss of P was further examined by measuring progeny viral titer overall viral protein synthesis and syncytium formation as described under Materials and Methods Yield of progeny virus in 20 nM dsRNA treated cells was found to be reduced by 10 fold and was reduced by at least 10 4fold at 100 and 300 nM dsRNA data not shown De novo viral protein synthesis was measured by metabolic labeling with S 35 Met Cys followed by immunoprecipitation As shown in Fig 1 all viral proteins detectable in the precipitate were drastically diminished in the dsRNA treated cells as would be expected in the event of a loss of the P protein The inhibition of viral growth was further reflected in the essentially complete loss of cell fusion syncytia in the treated cells Fig 2 In fact the RSV infected anti P dsRNA treated cells were morphologically indistinguishable from control uninfected ones even at 5 days post infection which was the longest time period for which they were observed The presence of equal amounts of actin in all the samples confirmed that the observed inhibition of viral proteins is not due to a general degradation of proteins The specificity of dsRNA activity was further tested by using a dsRNA against cellular lamin A C that was earlier shown to specifically abrogate lamin A C synthesis in a variety of cultured cell lines 2 As shown in Fig 1 lane La the anti lamin dsRNA while abrogating lamin protein data not shown had no effect on RSV protein synthesis Furthermore a mismatched anti P dsRNA in which the lowercase A U base pair see the dsRNA sequences in Materials and Methods was altered to a G C pair also failed to inhibit viral translation data not shown confirming that a perfect match is needed for the dsRNA effect hence its extreme specificity of action Lack of syncytium in RSV infected cells treated with anti F dsRNA Fusion of the infected cells is a hallmark of all Paramyxoviruses including RSV as also in some other viruses such as HIV and the resultant mass of fused cells is referred as a syncytium from which respiratory syncytial virus derives its middle name The fusion protein F is by far the most important viral glycoprotein that is central to the cell fusion activity 29 Since the P and F proteins have such diverse roles in viral life cycle we decided to investigate the effect of dsRNA on F as a second test gene and also to compare and contrast the two respective phenotypes First to test the effectiveness of the anti F dsRNA intracellularly we probed the infected cell monolayer with anti F antibody by indirect immunofluorescence Fig 3 Results clearly demonstrated the abundant synthesis of F protein as cytoplasmic fluorescence in cells that were not treated with dsRNA the nuclei of the same cells could be visualized by staining with DAPI In contrast cells treated with just 3 nM anti F dsRNA showed a substantial loss of F stain At 20 nM dsRNA F protein was undetectable Second immunoblot analysis Fig 4 top panel revealed that anti F dsRNA at concentrations as low as 20 nM produced a severe reduction in F protein levels Again no effect was seen on cellular profilin ruling out a general protein loss The anti F dsRNA also had no effect on P protein levels suggesting that such dsRNAs do not activate a general antiviral response that might abrogate all viral mRNA translation This was further corroborated by the direct measurement of de novo viral protein synthesis by metabolic labeling Fig 4 bottom panel Results showed that the synthesis of F only was affected while all other viral proteins were translated in normal amounts which is in agreement with the notion that F has little or no role in intracellular viral macromolecular synthesis Finally the phenotype of F protein loss was tested by examining syncytia formation and as presented in Fig 2 no syncytia could be discerned in anti F dsRNA treated cells Panel B However a cytopathic effect was still visible which is most likely the result of intracellular replication of the virus This demonstrates an interesting contrast with the anti P dsRNA Panel C which inhibited all viral gene expression and therefore the resultant monolayer exhibited essentially the same appearance as the uninfected one Panel D Direct measurement of intracellular F mRNA by semi quantitative RT PCR showed a nearly 15 fold loss caused by anti F dsRNA Fig 5 top panel Similar RT PCR of viral genomic RNA viral P mRNA or cellular actin mRNA revealed essentially no reduction suggesting that the dsRNA did not activate a general antiviral response and did not directly target genomic RNA Together these results directly demonstrate that the dsRNAs promote ablation of the specific mRNA target which most likely underlies the loss of the respective proteins Anti RSV dsRNAs do not activate an interferon response As mentioned before cytoplasmic dsRNA can trigger a series of signaling reactions that lead to interferon IFN synthesis 5 6 In the interferon response dsRNA molecules activate protein kinase PKR and 2 5 oligonucleotide synthetase One of the effects of PKR is to phosphorylate the subunit of the general translation initiation factor eIF 2 which constitutes a major mechanism for global translation arrest The 2 5 oligonucleotide synthetase activates RNase L that in turn catalyses non specific degradation of mRNA Since NNR viruses co opt the cellular translation machinery the interferon response thus causes severe inhibition of viral translation Interestingly the IFN response requires long dsRNA 5 6 and it has been conjectured that the improved specificity of the 21 nucleotide long dsRNA in cultured mammalian cells is probably due to their inability to activate the IFN response 2 We provide several lines of direct and indirect evidence that the dsRNAs described here did not activate a general IFN response First the inhibitory effect of each dsRNA was gene specific Figs 1 2 4 Second growth of VSV is known to be highly sensitive to IFN however its replication in A549 cells was not affected by any of the dsRNAs described here data not shown Lastly elevated phosphorylation of eIF 2 has been used as a diagnostic marker of IFN response 30 We therefore examined the phosphorylation status of eIF 2 in A549 cells following transfection with these dsRNAs Results Fig 5 bottom panel showed no increase in phosphorylation In positive controls A549 cell treated with calcium mobilizers thapsigargin or A23178 did increase eIF 2 phosphorylation as has been shown earlier 30 These results provide the first direct evidence that the 21 nt long double stranded siRNAs fail to trigger interferon response in mammalian cells and hence can be used as specific antiviral agents Discussion In this communication we establish 21 nucleotide long double stranded interfering RNA as a viable tool to ablate specific cytoplasmic RNAs as exemplified by the mRNAs of a RNA virus The major findings are i The ablation is highly efficient nanomolar concentrations of dsRNA can lead to a 10 20 fold reduction of the corresponding protein The two RSV mRNAs that we have targeted here namely P and F are relatively abundant viral mRNAs In fact they respectively represent the 4 thand 5 thmost abundant viral mRNAs in the infected cell Thus we predict that an even lower concentration of dsRNA perhaps in the sub nanomolar range might be able to destroy NNR viral mRNAs that are rarer such as those of RSV M2 and L proteins This is currently being tested It is to be noted that a chemical is generally considered a promising pharmaceutical if it is effective at sub micromolar concentrations ii The effect is highly specific dsRNA against one viral mRNA did not affect other viral mRNAs or the cellular genes tested here In this regard dsRNA generally surpasses the standard antisense technology based on oligodeoxynucleotides ODNs whose specificity has often been debated Moreover since the most potent antisense ODNs rely on the degradation of target RNA by RNase H 31 which is a predominantly nuclear enzyme this mechanism is not available to RNA viruses that are strictly cytoplasmic iii Lack of interferon response We provide direct experimental evidence that the 21 nt dsRNA does not trigger an IFN response which is an advantage because an IFN response would have caused a general and non specific inhibition of all cap dependent translation 5 iv Regulation any time Although we have not tested this specifically one can in principle transfect the virus infected cell with dsRNA at any time point during infection This will allow ablation of a specific protein at different times in infection and allow one to determine if the same mutation may have early and late phenotypes In addition this will allow mutational analysis of essential genes genetic deletion of which may result in a nonviable virus In this regard the dsRNA technique is akin to a temperature shift experiment using a temperature sensitive mutant virus however as implied earlier conditional lethal mutations are not available for the vast majority of viral genes v Ease of use The dsRNA approach is relatively simple to design and its application in cell culture only requires the standard transfection technology that already exists vi Multiple targets It is also possible to deplete multiple cellular or viral gene mRNAs in any combination either simultaneously or in a temporal order and thus ask questions about the interaction between the phenotypes vii Normal infection environment As we have contended a major benefit of this approach in viral reverse genetics is that one can start with standard wild type virus or even a relatively uncharacterized field isolate with no requirements of recombinant expression and thus the cellular milieu is only minimally perturbed if at all Lastly the lack of effect of the anti F dsRNA on viral genome replication deserves special attention As described earlier in the beginning of the Results section intracellular NNR viral replication generates both negative and positive strand full length genomic RNA each of which should find complementarity to the appropriate strand of the anti F dsRNA In general genome length RNAs of both positive and negative sense could therefore be potential targets for RNA interference resulting in severe inhibition of replication We speculate that the genomic and antigenomic RNA of NNR viruses escape the onslaught of dsRNA because they are tightly wrapped with the nucleocapsid protein N which makes them inaccessible to the dsRNA and or the RNAi silencing complex RISC As mentioned before the N encapsidated genome length RNAs are indeed extremely resistant to nucleases to the extent that formation of such nuclease resistant RNA products is in fact considered a defining criterion for viral replication in vitro and in vivo 32 While the resistance of the viral genomic RNA to dsRNA has important ramifications for antiviral therapy it is also clear that the dsRNA approach cannot be used against cis acting NNR viral genomic sequences such as the intergenic regions for which the cDNA based approach will continue to be the method of choice 16 It is obvious that a creative combination of the two techniques will lead to exciting possibilities in the reverse genetics of RNA viruses and in the antiviral regimen Conclusions Properly designed synthetic 21 nucleotide long double stranded RNA dsRNA molecules can effectively and specifically abrogate translation of target RNAs without activating a general interferon response When applied against mRNAs of cytoplasmic RNA viruses the dsRNAs caused degradation of the specific viral mRNA and resultant ablation of the specific viral protein The technique is quick simple and can be used against wild type RNA viruses in standard tissue culture at any point in the infection cycle Post transcriptional gene silencing by such dsRNA molecules should facilitate the reverse genetics and functional genomics of RNA genomes Materials and methods Double
