 TO Our Campus Colleagues FROM The IUPUI Campus Campaign Steering Committee Names DATE February 5 1994 SUBJECT Partners in Progress Assuring the Future In 1993 IUPUI staff and faculty came together as a community of partners supporting programs and issues we believe in Scholarships were enhanced or established The new library received a significant vote of pride and partnership with contributions coming from all areas of the campus Many offices were able to create special staff development funds and other enhancements as a result of the campaign Through the efforts of about 300 volunteers nearly 89 000 was raised through the IUPUI Campus Campaign Almost 900 of us made new gifts in support of the things we care about Together with those who were already donors there are over 1 350 staff and faculty supporting the work of IUPUI with their gifts Your efforts on behalf of IUPUI are resulting in changes some dramatic others more subtle This year IUPUI is celebrating 25 years in partnership Yet our roots go much deeper The School of Physical Education is oldest at 114 The School of Law celebrates a century and Medicine is 90 Every department and program that make up this community called IUPUI has a treasured and valued history The IUPUI Campus Campaign celebrates our partnership and helps us as individual members of that partnership to assure the future With this letter we are asking you to take the opportunity of the Campus Campaign to consider how you can help IUPUI be what you want it to be A group of your colleagues recently volunteered to help set the priorities for this campaign They surveyed members of the staff and faculty councils administrators and others and learned that we at IUPUI have a number of vital concerns One is staff and faculty development Resources for this purpose are limited or non existent And yet we all recognize the need to invest in professional growth and development Students are another area of interest what would we do without them and some of us are them The IUPUI Staff Council scholarship awarded for the first time last summer is the direct result of the Campus Campaign And scholarship funds are in limited supply here at IUPUI especially for the part time returning student Additionally the need for students to have a gathering place a Student Center is perceived by most to be critical The new Library remains on the list it is at the heart of the academic community and will require increased and ongoing support for acquisitions and other needs The campus Shape the Future Fund is designed to address unexpected opportunities It will provide the flexibility IUPUI needs that state appropriations cannot In many ways the name describes what this campus campaign is all about We have the chance to shape the future of IUPUI by what we choose to do here And finally though perhaps of most importance to you through the Campus Campaign you can continue to make your gift to any IUPUI program that matters to you Your commitment will count When you are contacted by your Campus Campaign volunteer we hope you ll choose to become one of the many partners in the community of IUPUI
