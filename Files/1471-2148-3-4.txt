 Background Runx genes encode the sequence specific DNA binding subunit of a heterodimeric transcription factor the defining feature of which is the Runt domain a highly conserved 128 amino acid sequence involved in DNA binding heterodimerization nucleotide binding and nuclear localization 1 2 The Runt domain is named after the first member of the family to be discovered the regulatory gene runt from Drosophila melanogaster Runx genes have also been discovered and functionally characterized in mammals sea urchins and nematodes and in general are involved in the transcriptional control of developmental processes 3 4 In humans mutations in each of the three Runx genes are associated with disease caused by defective control of cell proliferation and or differentiation 4 5 Most studies of Runx gene function and regulation have been carried out in mammals and in D melanogaster each of which has multiple Runx genes It is not currently known how the Runx gene family evolved nor is it known how many Runx genes the first animal possessed Answering these questions will facilitate identification of primitive general and derived specialized aspects of Runx gene structure function and regulation Results and discussion The collection of Runx gene sequences from phylogenetically diverse model organisms Sequence similarity searches of public databases using the BLAST program 6 were used to collect a set of currently available Runx gene sequences listed in Supplemental Table 1 from phylogenetically diverse species with complete or nearly complete genome sequences Previously undescribed Runx genes collected in our BLAST searches include two genes from the puffer fish Takifugu rubripes genome a single gene from the sea squirt Cionia intestinalis genome three genes from the mosquito Anopheles gambiae genome and two new Runx genes from the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster genome Also collected in the set for comparison were the previously described Runx genes from D melanogaster runt and lozenge 7 Caenorhabditis elegans run 8 sea urchin SpRunt 9 10 T rubripes TrRunx2 11 and mouse Runx1 Runx2 and Runx3 the three human RUNX genes which have been extensively characterized previously are highly similar to their mouse orthologues 12 13 and hence were not included in the collected set The collected set of sequences thus contains representatives of several major bilaterian phyla within both deuterostomes Chordata and Echinodermata and protostomes Nematoda and Arthropoda Runx sequences from lophotrochozoans and from basal non bilaterian metazoans e g Cnidaria and Porifera are not found in the database and it is not yet known whether non bilaterian Runx genes exist Extensive BLAST and PSI BLAST searches of the public databases failed to recover any sequences with significant similarity to the Runt domain from non metazoan organisms with completed or nearly completed genomes suggesting that Runx genes may be a metazoan invention The closest amino acid sequence similarity of any part of the Runt domain to sequences outside of metazoa is found in the motif GRSGRGKSF 2 see Fig 2 which matches the nucleotide binding P loop sequence in various bacterial and archaeal ATP binding proteins with diverse functions This Runx sequence is functionally involved in minor groove interactions and DNA bending by the Runt domain 14 An important difference between it and bona fide P loops is that the latter are invariably followed by an helix whereas the structure of the Runt domain is all beta see below Thus although the Runx P loop like motif is capable of binding ATP 2 it is unclear whether this local sequence similarity is indicative of homology to the prokaryotic P loop Supplemental Table 1 The collection of Runx genes used in this study This table indicates the sources of Runx gene sequences from selected species and additional references that were used in the analysis The C intestinalis Runx gene CiRunt was derived from a contig assembled using shot gun sequence segments queried from NCBI s trace archive The accession number given can be used as a seed for querying the database start the retrieval of necessary sequence Vector NTI ContigXpress was used to assemble the sequence Verification of CiRunt was performed by comparing the gDNA to cDNA available on line at the Nori Satoh Laboratory web page Only the first cDNA sequence accession number is given and can be used as a seed to extract the remaining sequences There was 2 coverage of the cDNA A special note needs to be made about the sequence upstream from the start of the Runt domain The sequence from the start of the runt gene to the start of the Runt domain is theoretical No cDNA could be found to verify this segment The T rubripes Runx genes were derived from scaffolds available on line at the MRC HGMP RC site M musculus Runx2 and D rerio runtb were used to identify T rubripes Runx2 and Runx3 respectively T rubripes Runx2 was verified by a published report 11 D rerio runta was used to identify T rubripes Runx1 The sea urchin gene SpRunt has not yet been completely sequenced and sequence is currently available only for the SpRunt 1 cDNA 9 and for the termini of the exons and introns 10 ND not determined Click here for file Runx gene copy number Two of the invertebrates in our collection with completely sequenced genomes the protostome C elegans and the deuterostome C intestinalis each were found to contain a single Runx gene Screens of genomic libraries using the Runt domain sequence as probe indicate that the same is also apparently true of the sea urchin S purpuratus 10 although final verification of this awaits the completion of the sea urchin genome In contrast the model organisms in which most functional studies of Runx genes have been performed i e D melanogaster and mouse each contain multiple Runx genes Both of the vertebrate species surveyed mouse and T rubripes were each found to contain three Runx genes as was the mosquito A gambiae whereas D melanogaster contains four The simplest explanation of such a gene distribution is that possession of a single Runx gene is the primitive condition for bilaterians i e that the multiplicity of Runx genes in the vertebrate and arthropod lineages resulted from independent gene duplications within those respective lineages The results of a phylogenetic analysis of Runt domain sequences are consistent with this hypothesis see below Since fruit flies and mice each contain multiple Runx genes it is probable that each of those genes has acquired specialized e g region or tissue specific functions that were derived subsequent to the duplications and hence peculiar to the taxonomic group to which each of those model organisms belong Experimental studies of invertebrates that contain only a single Runx gene sea urchin tunicate and nematode are therefore likely to highlight primitive general functions of this family of transcription factors in the control of cell fate proliferation and differentiation during metazoan development Exon and intron positions among Runx genes The gross structural features of the collected Runx genes including positions of exons and introns excepting those upstream of the proximal promoter of the vertebrate Runx genes see below are depicted schematically in Figure 1 see also Supplemental Table 2and Supplemental Figure 1 To locate exon intron positions in previously uncharacterised genes or predicted genes that have not yet been associated with cDNAs we performed spliced alignment maintaining maximum similarity between homologues as described in Methods As can be seen in Figure 1 all of the Runx genes contain a central highly conserved exon which encodes the C terminal third of the Runt domain black box in Fig 1 The N terminal end of this exon is bounded by an intron whose position is absolutely conserved among all Runx genes except DmRunt and AgRunt which have apparently lost the intron while the C terminal end is bounded by an intron that is conserved among all deuterostome species in our collection and shifted but a few nucleotides downstream in the insect genes and upstream in the C elegans gene The existence and locations of all of the other introns are variable but some of them are characteristic of specific clades Supplemental Table 2 Sequence length of Runx genes from selected species This table indicates the total and intron length in nucleotides of the sequences of each of the collected Runx genes from the proximal promoters Exon lengths bold numbers are given in amino acids Note that the nucleotide lengths of the S purpuratus gene and introns are approximate based on the lengths estimated for PCR products by gel electrophoresis as these have not yet been completely sequenced Click here for file Supplemental Figure 1 Comparison of relative exon intron positions and splice sites among Runx genes Details of exon intron structure of genes analysed in this study Exons are represented as boxes and the number in the box indicates the number of amino acids The central bold boxes represent the C terminus of the Runt domain which are contained in a single compact exon in all of the genes except for DmRunt and AgRunt which lack the intron that borders the N terminal end of this exon that is found in all of the other genes The nucleotide sequences of the splice site termini are indicated the junctions between exon and intron are represented by two dots while the intervening intron sequence is indicated by a dash The lengths of the introns in nucleotide number are indicated in parentheses For the vertebrate Runx genes only exons downstream of the proximal promoters are shown The gene and intron lengths for the sea urchin gene SpRunt are approximate and based on PCR products obtained from a BAC clone 10 that has not yet been completely sequenced Click here for file All of the chordate Runx genes including CiRunt contain an intron within the N terminal half of the Runt domain the position of which is invariant with respect to nucleotide sequence This intron is missing in the other Runx genes including the sea urchin representative SpRunt and is therefore likely to be a chordate specific feature of Runx genes that arose prior to the Runx gene duplications in the vertebrate lineage Upstream of the Runt domain TrRunx1 is predicted to have two short introns that are not found in its mouse orthologue MmRunx1 or in any of the other chordate Runx genes The mammalian Runx genes have longer introns than their counterparts in Takifugu as might be expected based on relative genome sizes With the exception of DmRunt all of the Drosophila Runx genes contain one DmLozenge and DmRunxB or two DmRunxA introns separating exons N terminal to the Runt domain but all of these have different positions and were thus likely to have been incorporated subsequent to the divergence of these genes The position of the first intron in DmLozenge is conserved in one of the mosquito genes AgLozenge indicating that these two genes are orthologues which is confirmed by a phylogenetic analysis of sequences see below CeRun contains an intron within the N terminal half of the Runt domain that is not found in any other Runx gene and contains the largest number of exons of any of the genes in our collection In general the structure of the C elegans gene is the most divergent of all of the Runx genes A variable number of exons are found 3 of the Runt domain among different species and these reveal group specific patterns Except for the lozenge orthologues which contain two such exons all of the insect genes for which complete sequences are available contain only a single exon downstream of the Runt domain The same is apparently true for the single sea urchin gene although this is provisionally based on the fragmentary evidence of a single small BAC clone 10 suggesting that a single exon downstream of the Runt domain may be the primitive condition for bilaterians In vertebrates from the proximal promoter the Runx3 orthologues each contain 2 exons downstream of the Runt domain while the Runx2 orthologues contain 4 and the Runx1 orthologues contain 3 CiRunt contains 5 exons downstream of the Runt domain while CeRun contains 4 In vertebrates at least the multiplicity of downstream exons is reflected in a large variety of alternatively spliced transcripts that give rise to multiple protein isoforms that differ in the C terminal sequences appended to the Runt domain 12 13 It is important to note that the C terminal exon of all Runx genes identified to date encodes the amino acid sequence VWRPY or the functionally equivalent IWRPF in the case of C elegans which acts as a recruitment motif for the co repressor Groucho TLE 3 This motif is at the C terminus within the 3 most exon of all of the genes possibly with the exception of CiRunt where the open reading frame apparently continues beyond the VWRPY in the genome sequence and was used in our analysis to identify the C terminal exons of previously uncharacterised Runx genes Runt domain sequences across phylogeny The amino acid sequences of the Runt domains of all each of the collected genes together with two previously described sequences from the spider Cupiennius salei 15 a sequence from the crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus and one from the nematode Meloidogyne hapla were aligned using Clustal W 16 as shown in Figure 2 Functionally the Runt domain is required both for DNA binding and for interaction with its heterodimeric partner the beta subunit which serves to allosterically enhance the DNA binding of the Runt domain 1 14 Superposition of the alignment and the known crystal structure of mouse Runx1 14 17 reveals that residues that make either direct or indirect contact with DNA are invariant marked by asterisks in Fig 2 Sequence motifs that interact with the beta subunit are also highly conserved The alignment of Runt domain amino acid sequences was used to construct unrooted trees by several complementary approaches neighbour joining maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony described in Methods We also employed Bayesian inference of phylogeny 18 This analysis was performed using 137 aligned amino acids with no gaps Fig 2 and included all of the sequences shown in Figure 2except for the incomplete sequences from a spider C salei run 2 and from the root knot nematode M hapla The consensus topology produced by each method was largely consistent with accepted phylogenies for all nodes with significant bootstrap values Fig 3 the main observations derived from each method are summarized in Table 1 The consensus of phylogenetic approaches strongly indicates the monophyly of the deuterostome Runx genes in the collection with the expected relationships echinoderms urochordates vertebrates The trees also suggest that the gene duplications that produced the three vertebrate Runx genes occurred early in the chordate lineage leading to vertebrates but subsequent to its divergence from urochordates All of the trees place Runx1 basal to Runx3 and Runx2 Fig 3and Table 1 arguing against an earlier proposal for the basal position of Runx3 8 13 among the vertebrate genes which was inferred from relative gene size exon intron structure and pattern of expression While the consensus of trees summarized in Table 1is for the most part consistent with the expected monophyly of the protostome genes in our collection nematodes arthropods the branching order is ambiguous Among the insect representatives each of the mosquito genes can be confidently assigned orthologues from Drosophila Fig 3 as was also suggested by intron positions Fig 1 Beyond that low bootstrap values prohibit a confident assessment of evolutionary branching order of the arthropod Runx paralogues and it is not clear whether they are monophyletic although the position of the crayfish gene suggests a deep duplication event within in the insect crustacean clade at least Resolution of the evolutionary relationships among the protostome Runx genes will require a broader sampling of Runx genes from Arthropods as well as from protostomes in general The occurrence of three Runx genes in vertebrates each on a different chromosome is consistent with a scenario of multiple gene duplications or two successive rounds of genome duplications that may have occurred near the base of the vertebrate branch of chordates 19 In contrast the multiple Runx genes in Drosophila are all physically linked to runt on the X chromosome and were almost certainly generated by local gene duplication events for the location of the Drosophila genes see FlyBase Genome Browser http www bdgp org cgi bin annot gbrowse The two newly discovered Drosophila Runx genes both contain a complete open reading frame encoding the Runt domain Fig 2 and conserved exon intron structure Fig 1and Supplemental Fig 1 suggesting that they are probably not pseudogenes This is further supported by our finding that each of the three mosquito Runx genes has an orthologue in Drosophila Figs 1 2 and 3 Alternative promoter usage among vertebrate runx genes All of the vertebrate Runx genes are transcribed from two alternative promoters P1 distal and P2 proximal We found no evidence as would be indicated by cDNA clones or ESTs in the database for alternative promoter usage among any of the invertebrate Runx genes examined suggesting that alternative promoters may have evolved in the chordate lineage leading to vertebrates subsequent to its divergence from urochordates All known invertebrate Runx gene products begin with long 5 UTRs and N terminal amino acid sequences that are more like those of the products from the proximal promoter P2 of the vertebrate genes suggesting that P2 is the primitive promoter Definitive resolution of these issues awaits a more comprehensive database of genomes and expressed sequences in appropriate invertebrate systems Figure 4Adepicts the transcript structures generated by alternative promoter usage and splicing in the vertebrate Runx genes and Figure 4Bshows the N terminal amino acid sequences derived from each promoter It is clear from these data that the usage of alternative promoters evolved prior to the gene duplication events in the vertebrate lineage since all three genes in both mouse and Takifugu utilize alternative promoters that give rise to similar alternative N termini within the respective orthologues Conclusions 1 In the public databases the Runt domain is currently found only in sequences from bilaterians This suggests that it may be a metazoan and possibly a bilaterian invention and that the genomic regulatory networks through which Runx genes control the fate proliferation and differentiation of cells are unique to animals 2 The primitive condition in bilaterians is most likely a single Runx gene represented in the deuterostomes of our collection by the sea urchin S purpuratus and the tunicate C intestinalis and in the protostomes of our collection by C elegans Runx gene duplications appear to have occurred independently in the lineages leading to vertebrates which have at least three Runx genes and insects which have three or four Runx genes suggesting that Runx genes in these latter organisms have probably acquired a number of specialized taxon specific regulatory functions e g segmentation in arthropods 15 bone development in vertebrates 20 etc Thus studies of Runx genes in sea urchins tunicates and nematodes are likely to highlight primitive pan bilaterian regulatory functions of this family of genes in the cell biology of animal development 3 The ancestral bilaterian Runx gene was apparently assembled from three exons and contained two introns one within the sequence that encodes the Runt domain and a second that borders the sequence encoding the C terminal end of the Runt domain 4 The ancestor of all three vertebrate Runx genes utilized two alternative promoters that generate alternative N terminal sequences Methods Collection and assembly of previously uncharacterised runx genes The Ciona intestinalis Runx gene was assembled with sequence files obtained from the Trace Archive database A seed sequence was found in C intestinalis gDNA Ti 119616831 Supplemental Table 1 by a MegaBLAST search using nucleotide sequence encoding exon 3 of SpRunt in the NCBI Trace server site http www ncbi nlm nih gov blast mmtrace html A translation of the seed sequence also showed significant similarity to the Runt domain The seed sequence showing Runx homology was in turn used as the query to obtain overlapping sequence and those obtained replaced the query This repetitive BLAST process was continued such that the seed sequence was extended 25 kb in both the 5 and 3 direction relative to the coding orientation of the seed The intron position assignments were aided by an alignment of the acquired C intestinalis Runx gene with partial cDNA sequences obtained from a TBLASTN search using the S purpuratus SpRunt 1 protein sequence to query the C intestinalis cDNA project site at http ghost zool kyoto u ac jp indexr1 html Introns in those regions of the gene upstream of the Runt domain not found in any cDNA were manually assigned by spliced alignment maintaining maximum homologue similarity Specifically putative introns were located by searching for the termini of open reading frames and then positioned in such a way that the resulting open reading frame had maximum similarity to that of a homologous gene while the intron exon junctions had the expected consensus 5 GT AG 3 sequence A known intron in a similar position in an orthologous gene was considered a validation of correct position assignment Highly conserved sequence blocks or residues such as the Runt domain or the C terminal Groucho binding site VWRPY served as anchoring reference points Multiple overlapping sequences in the C intestinalis contig provided a confidence in the final sequence assembly Close inspection of the sequence alignments showed no variation among high confidence regions of the sequence where high confidence regions means at least 40 50 nucleotides from the end of the read or with few unassigned base calls near the region The complete absence of sequence variation the multiple sequence coverage and the high sequence quality all indicate that no additional Runx genes are present in the C intestinalis genome which was confirmed by inspection of the recently completed genome at http genome jgi psf org ciona4 ciona4 home html Three Runt domain genes in the A gambiae genome and two previously unidentified Runt domain genes in the D melanogaster genome were found by TBLASTN search using the S purpuratus Runt protein sequence as the query The newly identified Drosophila Runx gene sequences CG1379 and CG15455 are present in a single sequence file see Supplemental Table 1 and with opposite coding orientation and were named for this study RunxA CG1379 and RunxB CG15455 No cDNAs specific for the mosquito Runx genes or for the Drosophila RunxA or RunxB genes was found despite an extensive search so putative intron positions were manually located in these genes by spliced alignment as described above Unlike all of the deuterostome genes the positions of introns among the insect genes were not conserved to the nucleotide and were thus assigned with less confidence and should hence be considered provisional Three Runx genes were identified in the recently completed T rubripes genome sequence by a TBLASTN search using the S purpuratus Runt protein sequence as the query sequence at the Fugu BLAST Server of the UK Human Genome Mapping Project Resource Centre http fugu hgmp mrc ac uk blast cDNA sequences from the zebrafish D rerio were used to place the start of the coding region in the distal promoter of TrRunx1 and TrRunx3 and cDNA sequences from the teleost O laptipes were used to place the start of the coding region in the distal promoter of TrRunx2 Supplemental Table 1 The promoter structure of TrRunx2 published by Eggers et al 11 during the course of our study was in agreement with our results In addition to the gene sequences two published partial cDNA sequences from a spider Cupiennius salei and an EST from a nematode Meloidogyne hapla were obtained from the NCBI database and used in the multiple sequence alignment Since the nematode sequence and one of the spider sequences run 2 only contain part of the runt domain these were not used in the phylogenetic analysis Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic tree construction The alignment of the amino acid sequences of all Runt domains used in this study was performed using the modified Clustal W 16 program in the AlignX module of Vector NTI InforMax Inc The trees were calculated using programs from the PHYLIP package Felsenstein J 1993 2002 PHYLIP Phylogeny Inference Package version 3 6a3 Distributed by the author Department of Genetics University of Washington Seattle or by the MrBayes program 18 Specifically 100 bootstrap replicates of the alignment were constructed using the SEQBOOT program and the distances between sequences were computed by the PROTDIST program using the PAM substitution model Neighbour joining trees were built using the NEIGHBOR program and the consensus tree was derived using the CONSENSE program For the maximum likelihood trees the experimental versions of the programs PROML no assumption of molecular clock and PROMLK molecular clock assumed from PHYLIP version 3 6a3 were used with the JTT evolutionary model and with the assumption of constant change rate between sites The maximum parsimony trees were constructed using the PROTPARS program Authors contributions J R performed most of the sequence analysis and drafted early versions

trees and wrote the relevant sections of the manuscript A J R conceived and designed the project assisted with the bioinformatics and developed the protocol for locating introns without cDNA sequence
