 The Dope on Dole The Clinton campaign answers the Dole ads that lambasted the president as soft on drugs with Dole s Real Record which efficiently portrays the Republican as a ghoulish sloganeering anti kid politician Juxtaposed with the opening shot of a teen ager sitting on a curb is Dole in grainy and smeared video footage that obviously has been blown up The colors are off giving him a sickly look and the narration all but mocks his delivery of his neo Nike anti drug slogan Just Don t Do It Next we see a staple of this year s drug ads kids gathered in a school hallway They re smiling but for how long Dole s anti drug slogan aside the narrator informs us he voted to cut the president s school anti drug efforts With that the grim Dole returns in black and white and we re told that he voted against the creation of a drug czar Suddenly the spot pivots with no visual verbal or musical cue from the subject of drugs to other youth related issues The classic structure of response spots is to answer an attack briefly and then shift the debate to stronger ground Dole s Real Record does this with such ease that we hardly notice the transition The narrator tells us that Dole voted against student loans against Clinton s plan to limit tobacco ads aimed at kids and against the vaccines for children program That s the real Bob Dole record one slogans can t hide says the narrator Not only does this layer of varnish paint Dole as anti education and anti middle class but the visuals give him the politically unprized patina of old age Illustrating the charge that Dole and Gingrich voted against vaccines is a soulful child with big staring eyes an image right out of a Walter Keene painting Her gaze reproaches Dole not only for this vote but for all we have seen and heard in the spot When we return to a scolding finger pointing Dole growling Just Don t Do It the slogan carries a new meaning that he just shouldn t have voted against the pro kid legislation and that we just shouldn t vote for him And if not for Dole then for whom The spot closes with a cameo of Clinton that qualifies it for the political ad rate on TV stations The president as always in color is shown with one of the children he allegedly is protecting from Dole s policies Dole s Real Record successfully broadens the issues beyond drugs and asks Which candidate is more caring As the spot unspools its strategy becomes clear When you make a response ad don t do just drugs Robert Shrum
