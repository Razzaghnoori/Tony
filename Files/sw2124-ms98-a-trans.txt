 okay what do you like to cook i like well i like to cook foods i like to eat i like to eat Italian food best and i find that i that s pretty easy to cook because a lot of it s one dish meals type things and they re kind of convenient uh huh um hum that d be good for a dinner party that you know to cook that because you don t have to deal with eight different things coming out at once is that what you usually cook when you have a party right um i usually have parties that are smaller groups i don t have i ve never had a real big dinner party except at traditional holidays like Thanksgiving and such uh huh and so um yeah uh yeah i guess i usually do i like to cook um heavy sauces and um really that sounds good noodles and pasta and such ooh fattening yeah actually how about you what do you like to to cook um we it s funny that um we re talking about this we just had a dinner party and we had um our senior pastor and his wife came over um hum and i catered to their diet is the only thing though so it wasn t something i really wanted to make i really wanted to make red beans and rice and with Anduille oh yeah you you know sausage because i m from New Orleans originally and um i was gonna make that red beans and rice with the those Cajun sausage and French bread with garlic butter and stuff um hum and um a salad and then for desert i wanted i would i really wanted to make um just brownies or French doughnuts would have been good but it s real hard to make them they don t really come out like they do in New Orleans up here i don t know why oh i don t know if it s me or the water or the recipe i have but humidity or something um that s what i want that s what i like to make is just real neat stuff like that but um hum kind of like the Italians it s really good but instead i catered to their diet so i made baked chicken in the crock pot and um it was good and everything it had all the vegetables in it but it seemed kind of boring compared uh huh it kind of kind of down played compared to what you d like huh do you find yourself um right with all the um cholesterol and and high fiber changing the way that you that you entertain i find it changing the way that i eat but not the way i entertain because i guess i guess i feel like um if they re on a diet like that i m gonna you know honor that but if it s just another couple came over um couple weeks later and i made what did i make that night i made a roast and i made um um hum oh i can t believe this my husband broke the coffee pot i just bought yesterday oh no i can t believe that anyway but um after when Ricky and Carrie came over we made um a pot roast with rice and gravy and salad and the whole bit and normally i don t eat we don t eat like that during the week because of the you know the calories and the fat in it but um hum uh huh you know when we re having guests we just kind of feel like just do it and i made blueberry cobbler and we had extra crust with it i mean it was so fattening but i don t think we gained any weight from it so yeah oh that sounds good well every once in a while i i think i feel the same way when i m entertaining i don t take that thing into consideration unless it s really really like a lot of women will turn down dessert if it s too rich simply because they don t want the extra calories so i think dessert is the only thing that i kind of down play sometimes um hum right i made a apple pan downy when the pastor and his wife came over and she didn t eat it oh yeah but i did bake apples so that it would be not brownies you know i figured there was less calories in apple pan downy than in fudge brownies um hum yeah yeah yeah so um i got a good brownie recipe oh that s good but uh anyway so i guess that s about what i do when i entertain uh huh so do you have anything else you want to say about it or um nothing comes to mind right off so i guess not okay well it was nice talking to you okay bye okay you too bye bye
