 Pretty Woman Lame Movie Movies Runaway Bride Paramount Pictures Director Garry Marshall scored the first time he paired Julia Roberts and Richard Gere in 1990 s Pretty Woman but he flounders on this outing Critics complain about the trite story line Roberts plays a young woman who has a habit of leaving her grooms waiting at the altar and the lack of chemistry between the stars Maureen Dowd notes in the New York Times that Runaway Bride marks the flatlining of the traditional romantic comedy and the birth of a new genre the unsympathetic heroine comedy see also My Best Friend s Wedding and

reviewers Ratcheting up the weirdness is the fact it was written and directed by a pair of non conjoined identical twins Some find it spellbinding with a solemn eroticism that sometimes recalls The Elephant Man Joe Morgenstern the Wall Street Journal Others say the slapped on eeriness peels away to reveal little more than simplistic dramatic ploys and that it is neither weighty nor as weird as

Editor Tina Brown s new magazine Time devotes more than a page Newsweek just less than one each featuring a photo of Brown and the cover of the first issue The early response is surprisingly kind Conventional wisdom has held that everyone was waiting to knock Brown off her cloud but there are notably few scathing condemnations or laudatory pieces about the magazine in the news today Instead reports focus on the phenomenon of Brown s buzz machine and the celeb studded party she threw Monday night which Madonna described as so much fun I loved it in the New York Post As for the prospects

juvenile garage rockers gets solid reviews for its third album These bad ass ladies roll out rude Ace Frehley inspired guitar hooks at a feverish rate capturing the rebellious mischievous and
