 Who s the Airhead Here Dear Dinesh Well let s not worry too much about our happy state of agreement I m sure we ll find something to argue about probably beginning today It will not surprise you I m sure that I have never been a great admirer of Ronald Reagan although it may surprise you that I feel as you do that he is one of the most important presidents of the 20 th century and that he displayed a certain genius for leadership that whatever his other limitations helped make his presidency enormously successful and influential Morris seems to sense that and at times to concede it but he is so preoccupied with Reagan s unremarkable personal opaqueness that he doesn t really convey the power of his personality adequately or fairly And I think you are right that his own self conscious displays of erudition which include his very mediocre poetry lead him to evaluations of Reagan that are both condescending and politically naive I confess that I have only today worked my way through the last chapters of Morris book and what strikes me is that it actually gets worse as it moves farther away from its unconventional literary techniques The autobiographical elements are less intrusive in the chapters on the governorship and the presidency but Morris limitations as a historian and biographer are much more glaringly on display as you also note You and I will undoubtedly be alarmed by different examples of these weaknesses But let me give several illustrations of a kind of historical simplemindedness that is in many ways as bad as or worse than the simplemindedness he sometimes attributes to Reagan Here for example is Morris riff on the extraordinarily complicated 60 year history of the modern American welfare state Under the 1935 Social Security Act a family on welfare was re classified as self supporting the moment Pop was hired Wives thus abandoned when husbands left home to preserve welfare benefits found it profitable to go on having babies by whomever in order to notch up the family income This problem remained contained he says until the 60s when the New Deal idea of benefits as emergency help to be applied for reluctantly and granted responsibly became the Great Society concept of entitlements I ve left out only a few sentences of this passage and have not I think altered its meaning in doing so It is hard to know where to begin to critique this monumentally ignorant description of the welfare system There is no evidence that ADC in the 30s or long after caused husbands and fathers to abandon their wives and no evidence at all to support the insulting statement that women went on having babies by whomever in order to increase their very meager welfare payments Even in the 60s and beyond there is very little evidence to support the argument that AFDC is responsible for illegitimate births The Great Society did nothing to change the definition of entitlements under Social Security although it did of course add new ones Medicare and Medicaid Morris footnotes cite only a few stray magazine articles a book on Nixon s welfare reform efforts that makes none of the claims that Morris does and significantly Charles Murray s Losing Ground The last chapters of the book are filled with these casual simplistic and uninformed observations about American public policy Morris claims for example that the New Deal launched a 50 year effort to force the distribution of wealth downward In fact there was virtually no downward distribution of wealth during the New Deal or in the 50 years after World War II and only a modest downward distribution during World War II caused not by taxation but by economic growth and rising wages Nor did any president advocate or attempt to produce downward distribution of wealth even Democrats Kennedy and Johnson included explicitly rejected that as a social goal Even more astonishing is his flippant dismissal of Reagan s economic program a dismissal visible in the very scant attention he gives it in this 700 page book and in his remarks at several points about how bored he was to hear Reagan talk about it I don t think much of Reagan s economic policies although I concede that some good things flowed from them but whatever one thinks of them they do mark an extraordinarily important moment in American history Morris can t be bothered with them When Reagan returns to his tax program in an interview Morris tells us that my heart sank and I mentally deducted 10 minutes from the time remaining In fact it seems there were many things about Reagan s life and career that Morris considered too boring to attend to There is almost nothing in this book about Reagan s campaigns and an astonishing passage on Page 645 perhaps explains why Morris describes sitting in the Oval Office interviewing Reagan in January 1989 Whether this is the 48 year old real Morris or the 75 year old fictional one is not clear He reads him a passage from Lord David Cecil s famous biography of Lord Melbourne a favorite of Anglophiles the world over and asks for Reagan s response The president begins talking about some early presidential campaigning in 1968 and Morris let my Sony do the listening Fortunately I had several photocopied pages of Cecil s biography in my folder and read them with surreptitious enjoyment while Dutch retraced his steps to the 68 Republican convention The great clock ticked on an on I have a similar sensation reading Morris book More tomorrow Alan
