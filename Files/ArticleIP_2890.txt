 Machiavellian We ve become used to rock stars leaving curiously apt or ironic song titles just before they die When Elvis expired in 1977 his current single was which ended with those three low notes Way on DOOOWN That s Elvis Way on down And I guess one way or another he is said a disc jockey on that sad day Well at least 6 feet But two months after the death of 2Pac Shakur the ironies of his passing are looking not so much accidental as suspiciously well orchestrated Just a few days after the murder of their biggest selling artist Death Row Records couriered his last video I Ain t Mad At Cha to MTV coyly suggesting the network might like to rush it into high rotation Filmed a few weeks earlier the video shows by amazing coincidence 2Pac dying in a drive by shooting in a car not dissimilar to that of Suge Knight the Death Row gangsta impresario in whose passenger seat 2Pac met his fate Since then his fans have argued that as with that other binarily monikered wordsmith Mark Twain rumors of 2Pac s death have been greatly exaggerated The gangsta rapper they claim faked his own death The boy is still in the hood not the shroud But just as commentators bemoan the way contemporary pop has degenerated into sampling remixes and cover versions so 2Pac s death seems to be merely a cunningly sampled remixed cover version medley of previous celebrity deaths There s the question of physical evidence No autopsy was conducted and the body was cremated the next day so how do we know he s really dead eh This is the Jim Morrison strategy The only two people who saw Morrison s body were Mrs Morrison and the doctor who signed the death certificate and since both these witnesses died soon after how can we ever be sure Then there s the Paul McCartney approach Just as McCartney started rumors of his death by appearing on the Abbey Road cover without shoes and on Sergeant Pepper wearing an armband marked OPD alleged to mean Officially Pronounced Dead so did 2Pac on his new album slyly adopt the name Makaveli like Machiavelli who according to 2Pac s rapping confrere Chuck D faked his own death to fool his enemies and pose on the cover in a crucifixion pose suggesting he intended a resurrection There are several flaws with these theories This may be disheartening for 2Pac fans to contemplate but while Jesus did return it wasn t for long Also Chuck D seems to be the only Machiavelli scholar who has heard anything about that wily courtier dodging death Possibly he s confusing him with that other wily courtier Rasputin the man behind the czarist throne who was poisoned drowned etc but managed to keep coming back See Boney M s seminal 1979 disco hit which runs Ra ra rasputEEN lover of the Russian queen And while it s pleasant to think of 2Pac sitting around pondering whether to stay or depart this world To pack or not to pack that is the question the best evidence against the faked death theory is the album itself credited to Makaveli and cumbersomely entitled The Don Killuminati The 7 Day Theory It indicates frankly that Pac Mak didn t have that much imagination The only reference you ll find on the album to Mak s previous identity is in the small print on the liner notes Exit 2Pac ENTER MAKAVELI But alas the first stage of that maneuver is easier to accomplish than the second Pop stars periodically reinvent themselves but even Ricky Nelson s radical decision to drop the y and relaunch himself as Rick Nelson was accompanied by a switch to gloomier more adult material by Dylan and Tim Hardin From 2Pac to Makaveli on the other hand is merely a matter of nomenclature Mantovani would at least have been different From the opening track it s clear the guy has nothing to say in his new identity beyond the same old clapped out self justification begins with a mock news bulletin announcing the name change and gloating that the Notorious B I G and several other corny sounding muthafuckerz from the East Coast will want to assassinate him It s hard to figure out the East West rap wars In the 1950s Nat King Cole declared playfully that Mr Cole Won t Rock n Roll In the 1970s many rockers despised disco But the rap wars are a civil war occurring within the genre The only real precedent is the 1940s competition of the crooners in 1944 Frank Sinatra depicted his competition by parodying Sunday Monday or Always as Dick Todd Dick Haymes and Como These mock rivalries were contrived to attract publicity and promote sales surely that s true of the rap wars too Why else would Suge and his record company allow Mak the Knife to bore on ad nauseam throughout his album about all those East Coast muthafuckerz In what may be the ultimate postmodern self referential auto commentary in contemporary popular culture Mak begins with a radio phone in in which the host is discussing 2Pac s previous record on which the rapper taunted the Notorious B I G who he believed had a part in his 1994 shooting with a reference to Mrs B I G I fucked your bitch you fat mutherfucka If only all these rivalries could be resolved with the grace of George Harrison who after losing Patti Boyd to Eric Clapton recorded a version of Bye Bye Love amending the line I hope she s happy I sure am blue to I hope she s happy ol Clapper too But with this album musical comparisons are irrelevant The most melodically interesting track is the exhibitionist provocation of a love letter to his gun and it soon dawns on you that that s only because he s swiped the tune from Stevie Wonder s Otherwise most of the creative energy seems to have gone not into the music but into the dialogue and sound effects that precede and increasingly disrupt the songs Those who bemoan the decline of radio drama should listen to all the screeching tires and gunfire and marvel Those who hail 2Pac as a poet should realize that on this album the lyrics are the merest afterthought by this stage he was more gangsta than rapper The only interesting musical effect is the funereal bell tolling throughout Ask not for whom the bell tolls it tolls for Tu Yes he s dead And if his death seems exquisitely well timed let s tactfully put that down to shrewd career management on the part of Suge and Death Row A few years ago I was driving around New York with Paul Simon for a BBC TV film when the car went over a pothole and the radio jumped from some tasteful doo wop on WCBS FM to a rap station This said Simon sadly is the perfect soundtrack for an age of instant gratification Maybe Death Row is the first record company to understand as manufacturers of automobiles and home entertainment centers do the need for built in obsolescence Happy is the gangsta rapper who lives to celebrate 50 years in show business
