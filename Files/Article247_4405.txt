 Slap Happy You know I ve never been able to figure out what it is about Evil Clowns that makes them so darn funny but the mere mention of an Evil Clown makes me giggle like Bill Clinton watching a nudie flick Like Rudy Giuliani cutting off homeless benefits Like Slobodan Milosevic singing opera at a ah you get the point So I salute you my friend for bringing up Evil Clowns Makes me want to eat at Jack in the Box Speaking of Evil Clowns I ve been reading a bit about yesterday s debate between Gore and Bradley and the exchange that s gotten all the play is the one where Bradley challenged Gore to march into Clinton s office and make the president sign an executive order to end racial profiling by law enforcement Gore snapped back saying that Clinton doesn t need a lecture from Bill Bradley Is it just me or do these guys come up with rejoinders that the average third grader would be ashamed to use My prediction Before it s all over Gore and Bradley abandon the electoral process and have a slap fight to see who gets the nomination and that could mean big bucks for the Democratic National Committee Think about it Bush has a huge war chest and what better way to fill the DNC s coffers than to air a slap fight between a former senator and the vice president of the United States on pay per view With the right promotion this could be the biggest thing since Prince s Rave Un2 the New Year millennium special OK bad example I could air home movies and draw a bigger pay per view audience Wanna get in on the ground floor with me
