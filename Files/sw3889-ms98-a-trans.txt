                 okay well have you had to return anything lately   well yes i did i returned  a number of things yesterday at uh JC Penney but   uh oh   but it wasnt um it was clothing   uhhuh   and um the blouse was uh supposed to be a size six but the shoulder drooped over my shoulder and it wasnt you know the style of the blouse it just i think it was sized wrong but you know it was a nice blouse but and um i took some uh lingerie back that wasnt well i the size that i usually buy did not fit in their in their brand it was too small   um   uh but as far as large items go like appliances or things like that no   yeah we havent had to take anything back although i wonder you know if they sometimes i think things are made to not last as long as they used to you know so you have to buy them more often  uh and my phone is making a weird noise um im trying to think we have we just moved into our house about two years ago and  we had to buy um   uhhuh   refrigerator and washer and dryer and all that and so far we havent had any   um umhum   any major problems havent had although i keep hearing noises this morning that make me wonder if our washer is about to to uh you know   well uh i would like to comment on my washer um um my washer if it gets out of balance it makes a horrible noise   oh uhhuh   and you have to make sure that your clothes are balanced but um it was doing it quite frequently and so i had a repairman come out and look at it and he said well you need this and so done to this machine and i said oh really and i he says let me show you and i said i said oh yeah i see that it really needs something bad you know but it didnt uh have an affect on the performance of the machine   huh   what what it was the um it was a cap after your um after the body of the machine was in place it was under that so it wasnt visible   umhum oh   and it was out of sight   umhum   and it was rusting out   hum   although i dont have any rust in my clothes and i said okay how much do you want to uh do this repair work and he told me almost two hundred and fifty dollars and i said hey i can go buy a new one for that price   oh oh   and i said and i said no im not gonna do that i said the performance of the machine is not affected by that part and i said and thats not thats not the cause of the imbalance i said i just have to be more careful how i put my clothes in and um so that was two years ago and my machine is still functioning fine   umhum           so i didnt you know and he wanted thirty five dollars for a service call and i says hey wait a minute they didnt tell me that when i called and i said im not paying it   umhum   i says if they had told me up front i would have paid it but since they did not say maam theres a thirty five dollar service call but they didnt and i says i refuse to pay it and so he he had called his office and told them what i said and i i was released from that service charge   um wow what a mess   so you know they were they to me that was underhanded i wouldnt have minded if they had said okay uh we have that service is thirty five dollars or whatever they they charge maybe its different um   yeah   uh charges for different things i dont know but it seems to me a service call would be kind of universal for anything   umhum right   and then they get into the nitty gritties of charges for whatever youve got wrong with your you write them   oh they could make lots of bucks that way  oh we havent had any   yeah they really could   we havent had to have anything fixed like that although we do my husband orders a lot from Lands End um catalog   yes oh theyre a fantastic company to deal with   yeah yeah weve weve had real good luck with them for the most part but they have changed their sizing somewhat and because i had ordered a womens blouse and i wear about a six but i usually like to order the next size up   oh uhhuh umhum   and i had ordered a um uh one of those little polo shirts um   umhum   and its really pretty small and i hardly ever wear it but so i was trying to decide what size to order this time and i went ahead and ordered the same size and it is like two sizes larger i mean it i love it because it you know now they make things a little bit bigger to where they are not as fitted you know but my husband ordered oh he orders pants dress shirts   oh my
