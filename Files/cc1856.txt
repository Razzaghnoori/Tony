 Introduction The intestinal tract is highly susceptible to hypoperfusion because of its greater level of critical oxygen delivery and countercurrent microcirculation of the villi 1 There is increasing evidence that gastrointestinal hypoperfusion plays an important role in development of systemic inflammatory response and multiple organ failure 1 2 Decreased splanchnic perfusion precedes the appearance of the usual indicators of hypovolemic shock such as hypotension and lactic acidosis 3 4 5 Gastric intramucosal acidosis and hypercapnia are observed during inadequate organ perfusion 6 7 8 and are predictive of poor clinical outcome 9 10 11 Therefore early detection of gastrointestinal hypoperfusion and effective treatment may improve clinical outcome Because gastric intubation is done in most critically ill patients gastric tonometry has traditionally been used to evaluate intramucosal pH or partial carbon dioxide tension P CO 2 indirectly during the management of critically ill patients 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 However gastric tonometers have some limitations For example air and saline tonometers may require 10 90 min for equilibration 16 17 18 19 Reliable gastric tonome try requires suppression of gastric acid 20 whereas gastric feedings can influence its outcome 21 22 23 Therefore several other sites including esophagus have been used for tonometric measurements 8 24 25 26 27 Studies have demonstrated that an increase in veno arterial P CO 2 gradient could be a reliable marker of tissue hypoperfusion 28 29 30 31 32 Knichwitz and coworkers 25 demonstrated that continuous intramucosal P CO 2 measurement allows early detection of regional intestinal ischemia before the onset of changes in global hemodynamic or metabolic variables Furthermore measurement of tissue P CO 2 in several organs has been shown to correlate with gastrointestinal perfusion 8 26 27 33 Sato and coworkers 8 studied the relationship between gastric wall P CO 2 and esophageal P CO 2 Pe CO 2 before during and after reversal of hemorrhagic shock in five spontaneously breathing rats using an ion sensitive field effect transistor They found a high correlation r 0 9 between the gastric wall P CO 2 and Pe CO 2 during hemorrhagic hypotension induced reduction in splanchnic blood flow The use of tissue P CO 2 and arterial P CO 2 Pa CO 2 difference is a better marker of ischemia than is either gastric intra mucosal pH or intramucosal P CO 2 34 because the gap is not influenced by alveolar ventilation 35 Therefore in the present study we measured intraluminal Pe CO 2 using a rapidly responsive fiberoptic sensor 25 35 36 The arterial blood gases were periodically measured for determination of the Pe CO 2 Pa CO 2 gap Our hypothesis is that the Pe CO 2 Pa CO 2 gap could be significantly increased during graded hemorrhagic hypotension and will return to baseline shortly after resuscitation Materials and method Surgical procedures The experimental protocol for the present study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Miami Children s Hospital Ten young albino Sprague Dawley rats 250 350 g were initially anesthetized with 60 mg kg pentobarbital intraperitoneally In a supine position a tracheostomy was performed and an endotracheal tube 3 5 cm of a polyethylene tube 2 4 mm diameter was advanced to a position approximately 1 cm above the carina Subsequently a femoral vein and a femoral artery were exposed and cannulated Each rat then was placed over an electric heating blanket Rectal temperature TH 5 Physitemp Thermalert Clifton NJ USA with a rat size thermal probe mean arterial blood pressure MABP and heart rate HR 2001A Datascope Corp Paramus NJ USA were continuously monitored Normothermia 38 0 5 C was established while anesthesia pentobarbital 15 mg kg per hour and fluid balance saline 5 ml kg per hour were strictly maintained Medfusion pump 2010 Medex Duluth CA USA Rats breathed room air spontaneously during the experiments Esophageal capnometry The esophagus was intubated orally with a 22 gauge 1 5 inch long catheter A fiberoptic carbon dioxide sensor Paratrend7 Diametrics Medical Inc Roseville MN USA was introduced through the oral catheter up to 8 10 cm from the incisor teeth into lower third of the esophagus at 2 3 cm above the gastroesophageal junction The fiberoptic sensor consisted of two optical fibers for the measurement of P CO 2 and pH a miniature Clark electrode for determination of partial oxygen tension and a thermocouple for measuring temperature The sensor was automatically calibrated with precision gases under microprocessor control as per the manufacturer s recommendations before insertion into the esophagus Baseline measurements Within 30 60 min after the insertion of the sensor baseline values for Pe CO 2 core temperature HR and MABP were recorded The rats then were heparinized with 200 U kg per hour heparin and an arterial blood sample was taken for baseline time0 gas analysis ABL 30 Blood Gas Analyzer Radiometer Copenhagen Denmark hemoglobin and arterial oxygen saturation OSM3 Hemoxymeter Radiometer Measurements of Pa CO 2 and Pe CO 2 as well as partial arterial oxygen tension were corrected for each animal s body temperature Values for bicarbonate and base excess were automatically calculated by the blood gas analyzer s program Hemorrhagic hypotension Three out of the 10 rats were used to test the limits of hemodynamic stability during hemorrhagic hypotension in this model Gradual bleeding up to 15 ml kg in these three rats led to a 30 40 reduction in MABP Additional bleeding up to 25 ml kg was tolerated as long as the MABP did not drop below 30 mmHg Lower blood pressures caused by removal of 25 ml kg blood created a deteriorating and irreversible systemic hypotension accompanied by severe tachycardia Therefore in the actual experiments n 7 we considered 15 ml kg bleeding over a 30 min period as mild hemorrhagic hypotension Removal of 20 25 ml kg blood while maintaining a MABP equal to or higher than 35 mmHg was considered severe hemorrhagic hypotension The blood was collected in a heparinized 400 U tube and incubated at 38 C Thirty minutes after mild hemorrhagic hypotension all the baseline variables were again measured This procedure was repeated after removal of another 5 10 ml kg blood for generation of severe but reversible hemorrhage All variables were recorded during severe hemorrhagic hypotension and then the shed blood was reinfused over 20 30 min All variables were measured again at 30 and 60 min following termination of blood reinfusion At the end of the experiment the animals were killed with intravenous pentobarbital and the exact position of the esophageal probe was verified Statistical analysis Statistical evaluation was performed in the seven rats that completed mild and severe hemorrhage with resuscitation All variables are presented as mean SD The data were computed by repeated measures of analysis of variance followed by Dunnett multiple comparisons test using the baseline values as controls A linear regression analysis was also performed to evaluate association between Pe CO 2 Pa CO 2 gap and the base deficit P 0 05 was considered statistically significant Results Hemodynamic and gas exchange variables Mild and severe homorrhagic hypotension created average reductions of 33 and 53 in MABP respectively Reinfusion of the blood restored MABP to the normal range Blood hemoglobin concentration followed a pattern similar to that of blood pressure Table 1 The HR was significantly increased following severe hemorrhage 29 After blood reinfusion the HR remained significantly higher than its prehemorrhagic baseline value Table 1 The partial arterial oxygen tension was increased significantly during both mild and severe hemorrhagic hypotension apparently caused by hyperventilation The latter also reduced the Pa CO 2 significantly Fig 1 Arterial saturation following blood reinfusion was not significantly different from baseline Blood bicarbonate concentrations decreased significantly following hemorrhage but recovery was not complete at 60 min after blood reinfusion Table 1 Esophageal arterial partial carbon dioxide tension gap and base deficit The Pe CO 2 PaP CO 2 was significantly increased after mild and severe hemorrhage and returned to baseline values following blood reinfusion Fig 1 The base deficit became slightly more negative after mild hemorrhage but was significantly reduced after severe hemorrhage 5 5 mmol l and 14 4 mmol l respectively The base deficit remained significantly high after blood reinfusion 7 2 mmol l after 60 min After blood reinfusion unlike base deficit the Pa CO 2 rapidly normalized Table 1 A significant correlation was found between base deficit and Pe CO 2 Pa CO 2 gap during hemorrhagic hypotension Fig 2 r 2 0 39 P 0 002 At the same time there was also a significant correlation between base deficit and Pe CO 2 Fig 3 r 2 0 24 P 0 022 Discussion Gastric tonometry versus esophageal and sublingual capnometry Traditionally stomach has been used as the organ to measure intramucosal pH or P CO 2 in both animal and human studies 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 The low pH of stomach may interfere with tonometry and therefore gastric acid suppression may be needed for reliable measurements 20 Other limiting factors in gastric tonometry are related to feeding 22 23 and the large lumen of the stomach requiring longer time for intralu minal contents to equilibrate with intramucosal P CO 2 Moreover in the presence of low gastric pH secretion of bicarbonate leads to intraluminal production of carbon dioxide 39 The above factors may prevent rapid detection of changes in intramucosal P CO 2 Therefore several other sites have been used for tonometry In animals ileum has been used to assess splanchnic perfusion 25 36 a clinically impractical procedure Studies have demonstrated that sublingual capnometry a relatively noninvasive procedure correlates with gastric tonometry 26 40 41 42 Practically it may be difficult to lodge the sensor securely under the tongue in uncooperative patients thereby preventing equilibration with tissue P CO 2 27 Esophageal intubation which is commonly used in critically ill patients can be utilized to secure placement of the esophageal sensor Similar to the gastric environment bicarbonate is secreted in the esophagus and may enter the esophagus from salivary secretions However a relative alkaline pH in the esophagus in the absence of acid reflux may not lead to generation of a significant amount of carbon dioxide Currently available tonometers have equilibration periods ranging between 10 and 90 min 16 17 18 19 and are therefore not efficient for rapid detection of changes in tissue perfusion on a continuous basis Fiberoptic sensors that are used in clinical medicine for automatic and continuous measurements of blood gases 43 44 have a rapid response time 45 Experimental evaluation of a fiberoptic P CO 2 sensor similar to that used in the present study has shown a high degree of precision in detecting short term changes in intramucosal P CO 2 35 Capnometry and end points of resuscitation An interesting observation in the present study was the delayed recovery of base deficit after resuscitation Table 1 whereas Pe CO 2 Pa CO 2 and the gap between them were actually recovered Fig 1 Porter and Ivatury 46 demonstrated that the use of base deficit lactate and or gastric intramucosal pH are appropriate end points of resuscitation for trauma patients They also recommended that one or all of the above markers of tissue perfusion be corrected to normal range within 24 hours after injury Povoas and coworkers 42 reported persistently elevated blood lactate level after reinfusion of blood when all other parameters of tissue perfusion such as sublingual P CO 2 gastric P CO 2 and veno arterial P CO 2 gradient were normalized In the present study the delay in normalization of the base deficit in the face of a rapid normalization of the Pe CO 2 Pa CO 2 gap may suggest that the Pe CO 2 Pa CO 2 gap can serve as an early indicator for resuscitation end point rather than base deficit Physiologically it takes time for liver and kidneys to correct metabolic acidosis following tissue dysoxia It is therefore anticipated that there will be a lag phase between restoration of blood volume and return of base deficit to normal Studies indicate that Pe CO 2 Pa CO 2 gap can continue to increase or remain abnormally high after resuscitation 25 47 48 In those experiments 47 48 severe hemorrhage 45 47 ml kg versus 30 ml kg might have contributed to ischemia reperfusion injury leading to persistent mucosal hypoperfusion and elevated tissue P CO 2 Pa CO 2 gap In the presence of ischemia reperfusion mucosal injury the Pe CO 2 Pa CO 2 gap may not return to normal even after restoration of circulatory volume In such instances base deficit or other global parameters of tissue perfusion may be a better index for the end point of resuscitation Conclusion The data presented here demonstrate that Pe CO 2 Pa CO 2 gap increases during hemorrhagic hypotension and reverses after resuscitation without complete recovery of base deficit We suggest that esophageal capnometry could be used as an alternative to gastric tonometry for assessing splanchnic hypoperfusion Competing interests None declared Key messages Esophageal capnometry could be used as an alternative for gastric tonometry
