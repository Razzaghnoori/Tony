        about how many calls have you made on this system   uh ive originated only a a few   oh okay yeah   but ive received quite a few   i uh i only started doing it after uh i started getting calls and said oh heck thats right im supposed to make a few calls so i started about month ago and i this is getting close to twenty here which i think is about all   uhhuh   uh our little gift book goes up to but i dont really know   oh yeah   ive got about twelve tickets in the mail do you have youve  a few   yeah ive been getting mine   okay uh medical go ahead im im medical thats mine   uh you pushed the record button were supposed to be discussing the subject   yeah i im benefits go ahead you first   yeah uh well ill tell you ive been around for quite a few years and worked for a lot of different companies and uh its hard to beat any of the benefits that or salaries either   umhum   that we get from TI im quite pleased with it course theres a few things that uh i think i could do better if i was sitting up in the CEOs seat but um   oh yeah   i think Jerrys doing a pretty good job as it goes   the one its kind of like uh automobile insurance the ones uh that i think are the highest and important to me uh i hope i never have to use them really per se although ive used medical a little bit uh   uhhuh   that well that one certainly is high i i worry that its weakening rather than strengthening so i like to reverse that trend and say id like to get those to strengthen you know be better and better       then salary salary salary continuance ive never used that one i hope i never will but thats kind of like an insurance thing i sure like that one   well ah yes   thats like automobile insurance you never want to get in an accident but it you like to have it there   umhum well uh like i say i worked for several different companies and theres nothing to compare with uh TI here   umhum   now i really got caught up back in eighty five i got caught up in the oil layoff uh i wasnt with GSI but i was connected with uh uh oil uh exploration   right with TI or somebody else   no with TI   uhhuh   but i say i wasnt connected with GSI   oh right yeah   and i got caught up in a layoff now   umhum   uh course you get six months uh unemployment from the state   yeah   but what TI did for us is is uh i ive never heard of it before they fixed us up with an office with uh telephones access to long distance uh computers a secretary to take messages for us or type uh letters for us   right   uh they had out of town newspapers and then the company   and outside consultants didnt they have an outside consultant too   i beg your pardon   did they have an outside consultant like a   uh yes they they did have uh seminars every once in a while   the employee yeah   uh cause that was not uh restricted just to just us   right   but the most important thing was that uh they had made up the difference between uh unemployment pay and seventy five percent of my net pay and they then TI paid me that   oh really   so uh i was able to uh not just exist i mean i i lived just as comfortably as i did before i was laid off   yeah they seem to be doing doing a good job of that im in facilities and and our organization built builds those facilities over in Park Central now   uhhuh   and i guess theyve been using them for six months now and ive known several engineers that got laid off and they said its like getting a PhD almost they the much they learn over there you know after theyve been laid off uh one engineer said it was really an education he he just learned like you he said he learned a tremendous amount that he never would have able to pick up on his own he was very thankful for that too   well this was not a learning thing by any means it was just a uh uh an assistance trying to find another job   to have an office yeah yeah well he said he learned so much and how he thought he thought he had a PhD in how to get a job after he was through the whole process for for several months he did eventually get a job   oh uhhuh well course i went through this uh what about five years ago they may have improved it considerably   yeah apparently its very sophisticated and i guess it may be one of the best uh that anyones doing   well thats one of those little uh uh little extras that you dont see in the uh the the the handbook you know   right youre absolutely right thats a good one   it   what do you think about pensions anything on that or   well now i have uh uh im getting close to retirement   yeah   and of course ive been looking into it but uh since im only a yellow badger i wont be getting a whole heck of a lot from TI as far as retirement is concerned   umhum right what do you think of a pension that goes from one company to the other like an account like a K account i ive been thinking about that for years uh   ive never heard of such a thing   i know thats what im saying that that pensions you see just like you were youre saying youve only got uh so many years say you work for two three companies if you take your pension with you after youre vested   umhum   and then just add the money together like you do with a K account you know   uh yeah   uh its your account period it doesnt matter where you go or anything thats your account to roll over   i that that sounds like a hell of an idea i didnt know there was such a thing   no no there isnt i im saying thats the question what do you think could be better and im saying that pensions say in the year two thousand or more when social security goes away which it probably will i think they ought to have a pension at least that youd never lose you work for a company seven years   yes by all means well what would be the difference between that and social security   uh well social securitys going to go to way i think and you can or you can invest your own money you have no control over your social security and its not paid for by the current like when say we retire after the year two thousand social securitys paid for by the twenty five year olds you know they may rebel and you wont have any social security where if your money was in your account i mean you can never lose it its there you dont have to depend on anybody to be putting that money in for you you know   yeah yeah   thats just a thought i mean i   uhhuh no i i like the idea course thats thats some something like an IRA   if they say which yeah yeah and instead of having a a socialized pension it just would be really money that you and your company maybe you had to put some money in it too i dont really know   uhhuh   but i i can see where theyd need to do something on that because the statistics are you dont work for a company twenty years through no fault of your own you know you work for five six seven and you you a lot of people i know guys   yeah that thats what ive done i ive bounced around about every ten years i change   yeah i have too but not not quite that often but uh yeah ive only got uh ive got fourteen now here at TI and i hope to make twenty five but say if something happened to me i mean you know they lay me off uh you have a pension but then youd have to try to get a pension in another one it would be nice if they could get them together   umhum   i do worry about medical though again knock wood that uh i havent used it i guess you im sorry you really do use it throughout the year because you get your teeth fixed and all that i mean i but im not im talking about major items i havent used it for anything major   uhhuh   im glad its there though   well knock wood i havent used mine anything for anything major just doctor visits and well i i have the uh the Homa i use Homa   yeah   and i like that uh a lot better than Aetna   i have the regular i again i just i havent i cant complain about it because i havent used it and every time i needed it it it  its uh you know   uhhuh   fallen right in line for the the minor things i guess im the one just supporting most of the others   well doesnt it work you dont see uh uh anything until you spend the minimum dont you have to spend the minimum of two three hundred   uh yeah yeah i think its two seventy five for a family but the dental is right away if you exams uh   yeah well now i have the same dental you have   okay yeah the medical you have to have a deductible   uhhuh now see i dont have a deductible   yeah right   i pay a straight five dollars for anything a doctor visit or drugs   well drugs are okay now im on that uh plan where i take blood pressure medicine if you take an allergy medicine so anything you need a prescription for for more than six months you get it for used to be six bucks they just raised it to twelve   oh that one i havent heard about   yeah thats a typical thats a typical one thats in there the forms are right in personnel   uhhuh   fact you may be able to take care of take advantage of that its through Baxter Labs uh   yeah i have high blood pressure problems myself   well maybe you still can do that do you do you buy your pills one at a time   every thirty days at a time   well turn turn in your forms go right to personnel i dont know whether you have to about an HMO i dont think so you turn you get your doctor to give you a more than six months prescription and uh theyre twelve dollars again they just were six they just raised them to twelve this year twelve dollars for a three months supply   hum   or whatever whatever the the amount is uh i dont want to say three months but   uhhuh   its a lot cheaper allergy medicines really uh expensive and that blood pressure medicine is fairly expensive i take two go right to personnel they got the forms in personnel and maybe i maybe ive told you go something you didnt know about in benefits there   um yeah yeah i just might do that   i do it yeah i you know its a very common thing its through Baxter Labs tell yeah   well thanks thanks for the tip Jim i i shall look into it   yeah what else im sure were getting close to our five minutes whatever here   yeah uh lets see we discussed uh uh medical and dental   what other benefits   uh retirement   yeah the salary continuation i think thats a great one but again a hope i never use that one that means youre really sick if you have to use that one   uhhuh what about vacation   im satisfied with the vacation i dont know what else you know you nice to say you get another week   uh   and when im well i only got fourteen years so ill get another week when i hit fifteen   uh yeah thats right   so thats thats fair i mean its reasonable if four weeks is a lot i think i know some people who have twenty five years and thirty and they want more but uh you know   umhum   uh   well im uh im here ive got just eleven years and i dont think ill ever see a a silver badge i wont i wont be around that long   umhum well the way things go i think im going to have to work till im seventy five whether i quit and uh uh or when i retire get a parttime job
