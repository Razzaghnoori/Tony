 all right oh okay are you on an exercise program now or yeah i exercise pretty regularly uh huh i lift weights quite a bit uh huh um i run occasionally let s see what else do i do play golf some and i work out on a a hanging bag i m brown belt in karate so i keep up with that a little bit uh huh oh yeah how about you um the only exercise program i m doing right now is walking um hum i ve got a nine month old and i m four months pregnant with my second and so at the time walking seems to be the best it s something i can do with her plus um doesn t tax me too physically um hum um hum i have enjoyed aerobics in the past and i enjoy that because i like the group association you know like exercising with other people yeah and um and that s my favorite way to exercise well that s neat but yeah i do walk some too my wife s about five months along so she s been walking quite a bit so that that is a good exercise for that oh yeah it s it s it s nice to do it together too i guess um hum because my husband and i used to walk together but our schedules don t coincide as well as they used to and so we very seldom get together to walk but when you when you work out do you pretty much do it on your own schedule or do you go to groups or i i i do it on my own schedule um hum we used to try and belong to clubs or the Y stuff like that but it so difficult to go on a regular basis to drive to drive the distance you have to go and um hum save the fees we ve decided we just save the fees and and buy some of our own equipment so and then you can do it whenever you want i guess yeah yeah i ve got a weight bench and we got my wife an exercise bike and i use that sometimes too um hum so it s a little more convenient but you re i guess you re not as dedicated if you don t drive over do it i guess it depends on the person depends on how motivated you are um hum because my husband used to work out three days a week with uh at the Texas Instruments gym uh huh and then i would just go on Saturdays but since the first of the year neither one of us have been going yeah so you know like you said we ve been paying these fees and not going so it s kind of a a waste of money if you don t take advantage of it yeah i i think you really have to be disciplined yeah i uh i i try to work out at at least a couple of times a week and i i think you really have to at least twice a week just to maintain the shape that you re in yeah oh with the walking i think they they said you need to walk at least twelve miles a week for it to be aerobically beneficial um hum and we i have two friends that we walk they have babies that are about the same age as as mine and we ve been walking every morning at going when it was cold we d go to the mall it s because you can t take the babies out very easily yeah so uh so we when we go we have about do about fifteen miles a week but the last little while for one the reason or another we haven t been real consistent so it s a little harder when you depending on other people to do it with you um hum because you have to meet their schedules as well but true but i enjoy doing it more when i ve got other people with me than and i usually do it because i want to because i know it s good for me not because you know i don t i don t feel obligated to do it and i enjoy it um hum if i if i feel too obligated to do it i i start to rebel and i won t be as consistent with it yeah i understand did you exercise between your first child and your second i uh i exercised pretty well up until i found or until i was pregnant and i started having pains so i ve calmed down everything except i was working out doing aerobic exercises as well as the um walking um hum yeah and i had to stop the aerobics because it was just kind of painful but the the TI rec center has an aerobics program for for um prenatal and postnatal aerobic type thing hm and i was going to wait until um about my sixth month and then start doing that i did that with the second baby and um i went to my exercise class exercise class one day and then she was delivered the next day gosh so it it would seem to be real beneficial um hum yeah maybe it maybe it speeded up the process and all that well i think it made parts of it a lot easier i i is this your first that you re having uh huh oh okay well then i don t know how much you ve been through it but um i think parts of it made a lot easier and i ve talked to a lot of ladies that exercise with one pregnancy and didn t with the other and they said that they d exercise the one that had exercised was three or four times easier and really and we ve i had having both of them natural the first one was natural and going natural the second and and it was it s rough but it s not as as bad as i thought it would be um hum and i think the exercise helped well that s good so do you work with TI no i don t my my wife has been working with them oh okay well then she could go if she was interested um hum i think that s what the class that meets on Saturday mornings so she could find out if she wanted to go it s kind of fun because with the first pregnancy all the other ladies except one were on their first pregnancy and they would talk about exercise and just general things related to the birthing process and so for it s so it s educational as well as it exercise exercise beneficial so yeah at least its something that you enjoy and i know a lot of people that talk about exercise and say well i don t want to exercise it s too much work but there a lot of different things you can do that that are enjoyable that you don t have to you kn ow strain yourself or sweat that s right be real sore afterwards yeah and sometimes that s if you get a little soreness you feel like well i ve done a good job because i got worked myself to that point but i guess you don t want to overdue but well have we reached our limit i m not sure how long we ve been talking but yeah i think i think we ve talked about six minutes or so so okay well it s been good talking to you it s been good talking to you as well okay i hope your baby goes well comes out well bye bye thanks yours yours too bye bye
