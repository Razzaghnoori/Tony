 The Castoffs of the Rich and Famous Dear Todd Thanks so much for the compliments Although since I was only one of many people involved with the Letterman show God only knows whose jokes you were repeating Well I guess this it Our last e mail Which makes me a little sad but I guess my sadness will be offset by the celebration being thrown by our hate mail buddies And their feelings matter too To someone Even if not to me or you I was holding off buying your Gary Coleman gift after reading in USA Today that Drew Barrymore s estranged mother Jaid also has a Web site on which she is auctioning off several collections of Drew s baby clothes including an undershirt decorated with baby chicks OK yes this seems like a shockingly lowbrow sociopathically self serving egomaniacal betrayal and perversion of the mother daughter bond until after you hear how touchingly Jaid explains it Drew is such a special amazing magical person she says that I decided to put some of her things up on the Web site to allow people to be a part of her life And you know if there is a better way to become a part of the life of a complete stranger than to own their baby clothing it can only be to own their spatula So I think I have made my gift decision Todd go buy yourself some eggs and sit by the mailbox Better cooking is on it s way This has been a lot of fun Thanks Coming in two weeks Tucker Carlson and Evan Smith go out to Breakfast on George W Bush
