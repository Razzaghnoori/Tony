          so how do we fix the national budget   okay damned if i know um i dont uh i suspect uh lets see  i suspect we should do what everyone says we should do we should cut spending and maybe even raise taxes but Lord knows you shouldnt one shouldnt say that   well   i i i suspect we should probably have an independent auditing agency go in and look at how the government spends money and work from there   that would probably be good   because i because i dont think theyre very good at it   but something that the government hasnt been looking at is the source of the problem   um   the true source of the problem is A that we do spend too much   yes   but also B that we dont take in enough   yeah well why why why why do you say that actually   uh too few Americans are working   hum   if more Americans were working and meaningful good paying labor   yes   and paying taxes   rather than using taxed   and the tax structure was fair between the lowest and the highest income Americans then we would have more money there to play with   oh thats interesting yeah thats probably true i mean well we also wed be spending less because all the money that that normally goes to support those people arent working its back in the system   right   so youre right thats a real neat idea well what but i mean what can you know at at some point what can you do to sort of raise revenue i mean to raise jobs i wonder   well i hesitate to say we ought to spend ourselves to affluence but in fact in some cases thats what we ought to do   oh okay so start when   not Reaganomics thank you     but that is not gonna work uh   uh what i was thinking more along the lines of is start going to space   hum and that way just create more jobs   well   or whatever   at some point there there will be enough jobs for most of the able ablebodied Americans   hum umhum well thats a neat idea   we also need to uh assure that theres some work in the private sector   yeah thats what thats what you you think space would do that much for that or   i think it would do something for it i think we would fill up new technologies but i think we should also   hum   do something rather radical   like what   legalize marijuana   oh you think you think that would uh have a major effect well that would put a lot of criminals out of business for a while anyway   what   that that might have a um a good effect on on on crime anyway   yes uh okay i think it would take some of that money out of the hands of criminals i think it would put reduce the amount of carry on drug use where people advance from one drug to another   thats probably true   i think that i think most importantly it would give the federal government something new that they could tax   and probably a lot of   and probably a lot of and really receive some revenues from   yeah but thats potentially you know   uh if you look at prohibition historically its repeal helped the federal government a lot in tax revenues   umhum um no id never thought about that   then i think once we put money back into the coffers in the coffers of the federal government   umhum   and get the federal government to where theres money there again we should reduce the amount of money and this would have to come rather quickly and would have to come come originally also where were not paying in some cases we do pay more for welfare recipients to live then they can earn       in the true minimum wage environment   thats true we do often times they are paid more yeah   and you cant deny people the right to supply their families better through whatever means   right   thats just sensible on their part   thats just what on their part im sorry i missed that   its just sensible on their parts to go after the   oh   the the greater amount of income   umhum   so if you lower the amount they make and raise the amount of true minimum wage jobs not those that are affected by the federal minimum wage then more people will get off welfare   that that maybe true thats very true   you know give them a true incentive to want to work   right   and then dont start letting more outsiders in for a few years until we figure exactly where were at with unemployment   right thats uh   reduce immigration   umhum   or eliminate it entirely for a few years unti l we get our own house in order   yeah and maybe even reduce along along the same lines maybe reduce imports as well i think      oh absolutely absolutely   i mean we dont need to buy other peoples stuff right now   thats right when were in a wor ld of hurt       well i dont im not going to say that we ought to reduce reduce them through legal means i think we ought to just tax them severely   right well that thats what happened in other country though and other places they tax us quite heavily i mean they tax American imports quite heavily so we could do the same thing i mean just and you know they may get   it seems only fair   right it does seem only fair i mean why not   and i think really if we got all those that are ablebodied into the work force reduced the amount going out for those purposes created new jobs for that work force there would be plenty of money   i i think so   and then at that point   yes   quit spending on space force it all into the into the private sector   oh really oh really i love the switch well at that point you might we it it it wouldnt be a problem anymore possibly you know we would be   thats right   we would be able to keep it wherever we wanted to in space or the ocean research whatever we wanted to do but i think that would be   uh uh space was just a convenient place for me to go because   right   that would put a lot of a lot of Millspec and NASA work operates to the same demanding specifications that would put a bunch of defense workers back to work   umhum right is compared to defense well thats a good idea well i well the other thing and the other thing i i i think we seriously need to do is um like i say have someone go in and look and you know and find out where it is were paying ten thousand dollars per toilet seat or something   you know what causes that   greed i suspect   uh no your your your buying large trunk uh the government specification   umhum   sheets of paper for building a pair of BVD underwear for the federal government   yes   is twenty two foot tall   really   if it was all on nine by elevens stacked one on top of another   for making the government issue under wear   for making government issue underwear   Jesus   to just understand those legal requirements and operate within the government guidelines costs the company   umhum   a huge amount of money   well its potentially a fault of the government than i mean that could be thing like that should be i mean   yes a huge amount of it is not the fault of the contractor   right well thats a i had never heard that before   uh a huge amount of what you hear on about the seventy five dollar hammers   right   and the nine hundred dollar toilet seats doesnt come from people in the industry it comes from senators that dont know anything about it   hum   uh my job is government tooling specialist   oh okay so you know about some of these things yeah
