 Doing Coke at the Office Office produced by the Leo Burnett Co Inc of Chicago for the Coca Cola Co Office opens in a very proper high ceilinged office space Its rows of well ordered desks far from the power and privilege of a private office evoke the worst fears about the dehumanizing places where corporate careers begin Then we hear the whoosh of a cap turning on a bottle of Diet Coke The guy opening the soda dressed in a white shirt and tie at least you can take your jacket off at your desk has broken not only the silence but also the rules Heads turn at other desks as big band music strikes up and the Diet Coke drinker spins away in his desk chair Suddenly decked out in a snazzy blue suit he starts dancing acrobatically Astaire style and singing the soda s theme Sinatra style just for the feel of it updates the long running just for the taste of it theme of previous Diet Coke campaigns The lighting changes too making the office space look like the inside of a nightclub Diet Coke takes you off the beaten career track the spot suggests It liberates the young rebel who s doing what he has to do to get ahead but who still doesn t take it all too seriously We ve seen these visuals before It s Steve Martin in Pennies From Heaven Our guy is being transported to a different astral plane And the vehicle is Diet Coke He dances off the walls and over to the desks of two women who smile up at him they ve caught the mood This is the kind of guy who gets the girls We know that for sure as he turns toward one of them strokes her chin and hands her the bottle The narrator tells us that everyone is singing to the sound of Diet Coke and invites us to win CDs and trips to the Grammies by checking the bottom of the bottle cap The fine print about a one in nine chance acknowledges regulations about truth in advertising Even a rebel has to conform to some rules After the bottle cap flips off revealing YOU WIN we cut to the latest in audio gear and to one of the office women dressed up for a night on the town She dances and dips with our guy as he sings My place or yours On his knees he offers a rose to yet another woman and the spot cuts back to normal The lighting is fluorescent bright as the bald boss looks out of his private office door This is who our guy wants to become but is desperately afraid of becoming The boss has heard something but the office looks as bland as usual Was it just the whoosh of the cap turning that disturbed the silence of this cathedral of commerce Or was it all a dream As the boss closes his door the on screen chyron reads Diet Coke Uncapped Just for the sound of it Uncapped is a direct reference to MTV s popular Unplugged series in which electrified rockers strip down to acoustic to reach the essence of their music Getting uncapped with Diet Coke presumably allows office workers a similar shot at authenticity And the chance of winning a trip to the Grammies is more than a prize It signifies that Diet Coke is a with it product that evokes the inner music of youth of being yourself wherever you are Lest anyone miss this point when the bald boss shuts his door our guy off screen sings One more time Diet Coke may be a low calorie drink but its makers have never marketed it as a beverage for the overweight You re supposed to drink Diet Coke because you like it not because you have to drink it You re a rebel who refuses to leave your youth behind You drank Diet Coke before you got to the office and while the bald guy can order you around he can t take your soda away from you Robert Shrum
