 Hamburger Hyper As food scares go it wasn t even especially sickening Fewer than 20 people fell ill and not one died Yet the Hudson Foods E coli outbreak in Colorado was all over the nation s headlines The danger is not that the public has been needlessly alarmed but rather that the U S Department of Agriculture and the media have focused attention on the wrong threats A wake up call for American consumers is how one activist described the event The only thing is such outbreaks are not rare events In fact they are relatively common and have been happening at least a few times a year for more than a decade the further back Centers for Disease Control and Prevention records go the spottier they get Only last Friday more than 400 000 pounds of beef were recalled from stores in Virginia and on Monday the Associated Press reported another outbreak at an Iowa high school Nor was the Colorado E coli incident of unusual proportions There have been 37 bigger ones in the last 15 years So why the big national spaz over a small example of a relatively common occurrence Well the USDA said this was a big deal because 1 Hudson was reworking past days meat into current production and 2 Hudson s record keeping was so sloppy that the contamination couldn t be traced back to the real source one of half a dozen slaughterhouses But neither of those claims is the whole truth Yes Hudson was adding rework to its new production but the USDA knew and approved of the practice Rework is even part of the prototype state of the art food safety program that USDA approved plants must put into effect by early next year And yes problems with paperwork made it difficult to trace the contaminated meat to its source But that was not because the paperwork was shoddy Rather it was because the reworked old meat was being added into new product throughout the day instead of to a single easily traceable lot at the beginning of the day The USDA knew of that practice too and two USDA inspectors supervised its implementation at the plant every day But even if everything the USDA argued was strictly true it didn t need to recall 25 million pounds 75 days production Industry experts and the CDC agree it takes a certain level of contamination to pose a threat Even if a whole day s production were contaminated and a small amount of leftover contaminated beef reworked into ensuing production within days the E coli which is very slow growing in a nonconducive environment such as chilled beef would be so diluted that it wouldn t pose a threat to anyone Even leaving wide margins for safety at most the USDA should have recalled between 8 million and 10 million pounds of beef Hudson however is not innocent in all this The hamburgers that caused the Colorado outbreak were practically designed to prevent E coli from cooking When prepared as Hudson recommended the size and the shape of the burgers was such that the outside would have had to be burned if the center was to be cooked But whatever the USDA and Hudson might have done to contribute to the national ruckus was topped by the media coverage Can This Meat Kill You screamed Newsweek s ridiculous Sept 1 cover The text within was no less hysterical E Coli affects as many as 20 000 people in the United States each year Newsweek reported The CDC s latest numbers place the totals at one tenth that though it is true that they may be somewhat underreported In fact you are a hundred times more likely to die of a newly contracted infection when you spend a night in a hospital than you are when you eat a hamburger But just because the USDA flew off the handle and the press blew the story doesn t mean there s no story here E coli outbreaks are increasing and their sources are growing more and more diverse ranging from swimming pools to salads But all the smoke blowing around meat processors is obscuring the real problem A serious effort to curb E coli would focus on the cattle rather than on the processing of their meat Each of their four stomachs is a breeding ground for the virulent E coli bacteria which is estimated to infect between 2 percent and 4 percent of U S livestock In fact ground beef isn t the fastest growing source of E coli Runoff from cattle pastures goes into lakes where swimmers get infected Cattle manure is used to fertilize fields and the produce infects those who eat it Cattle however enjoy the powerful protection in Washington D C of the nation s ranchers who gave millions in the last election cycle And the ranchers are mighty resistant to any changes that could cost them money Still some changes could be made quite easily Industry consultant R A LaBudde argues that testing and exclusion of infected cattle is one possibility we already do it for a number of cattle borne infections like brucellosis Cattle could also be kept off feed for 12 or more hours before they are slaughtered This would make their E coli bearing digestive system less likely to rupture thus making contamination less likely The problem with this idea is that it violates the 1978 Humane Slaughter Law Cattle need their last meal after all Technology may soon provide some solutions In August Mike Doyle of the University of Georgia applied for a patent on some nonvirulent strains of E coli that wipe out the nasty version when fed to cattle The USDA argues however that what is needed is more enforcement power and to that end it is advancing a bill designed to expand its authority The bill is irrelevant though No company has refused to recall meat that the USDA said needed recalling And considering that Hudson a 100 million a year company was dismembered in the wake of its cooperation with the USDA any new powers would pale compared with what the department has already If the USDA is interested in taking a hard look at the meat industry maybe it should look for inspiration to the battle between the Food and Drug Administration and the tobacco companies It is common practice to add fat back into hamburger to reach the high levels that consumers demand just like cigarette makers add nicotine It is a good bet that more people died last year from the extra fat they consumed in their Burger King burgers than will ever die from E coli
