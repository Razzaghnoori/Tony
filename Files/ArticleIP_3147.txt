 The New Jewish Novel If you believe demography American Jewish life is disappearing Fifty two percent of American Jews marry non Jews If you believe your own eyes you ll conclude the opposite Stroll down the Upper West Side of Manhattan on a Saturday morning The former world headquarters of secular Judaism Jewish humanism even flat out radicalism will be filled with Orthodox families wandering to and from shul the women in wigs and long dresses the children otherworldly in clothes bare of sports insignia Or go to a good bookstore and check out the work of a group of young novelists busily turning the conventional Jewish identity crisis on its head For these writers let s call them the philo traditionalists the modern world that lured the Philip Roths and Saul Bellows and Norman Mailers away from their childhood enclaves doesn t glisten with its old come hither In the three decades since the heyday of the Jewish American novel secularity has grown tarnished It is now seen as leading to self absorbed self destruction rather than to individual fulfillment What the new generation embraces is the past a godly past hedged in by community and ritual that will one day perhaps or so they dream be restored Take a lapsed Hasid such as Pearl Abraham In her autobiographical first novel The Romance Reader she told the familiar to Roth or Chaim Potok readers tale of being forced out of her sect by her own intellectual and sexual curiosity But in her second novel Giving Up America which comes out this month she all but rejects that rejection The narrator is an unhappy ad copy writer whose callow husband has fallen for a would be Miss America contestant She must return to her family to reimmerse herself in the eternal Hasidic truths before she can make something like peace with her life America the country Europe s rabbis condemned as the trayfe medina the unholy land the faithless land is now producing a literature of faith But hasn t there always been a literature of Jewish faith What about Bernard Malamud with his discombobulated folk Jews and Isaac Bashevis Singer with his tortured Polish intellectuals and Lithuanian rabbinical courts The difference has everything to do with the passage of time The philo traditionalists the best of them anyway are bringing life and imagination to a kind of writing all but given up for moribund and besides they re producing a literature of American faith No longer is religious practice or a sense of Jewish continuity the prerogative of displaced Europeans gazing with horror upon the vacuousness of their assimilated children Cynthia Ozick the American born doyenne of contemporary observant Jewish writers used to make her heroes and heroines refugees from the Nazis struggling to fortify their shredded piety against the American profanity But even she has gone native In a brilliant novel published last year The Puttermesser Papers her eponymous heroine Ruth Puttermesser becomes mayor of New York City and embraces a Whitmanesque vision of urban harmony Jews and Christians and everyone together before being undone by a rapacious golem Then there are the children themselves who are much less vacuous than predicted and insist that they too can have a connection to the past The brutally funny Steve Stern Lazar Malkin Enters Heaven Harry Kaplan s Adventures Underground A Plague of Dreamers does this by inventing a shtetl that out Singers Singer in its weirdness and filth and then putting it in pre World War II Memphis Tenn Thane Rosenbaum in Elijah Visible grants his characters who are the children of Holocaust survivors the right to suffer their own highly American litany of post Holocaust disorders Oddly enough it was Singer who wrote the prototext of American post assimilationism Shadows on the Hudson which was only published posthumously earlier this year though it was written in the 50s and set even earlier It is a stunning heartbreaking novel the darkest and most modern of his works largely because it is the most bitter about modernity Its anti hero Hertz Grein an erudite European refugee and serial deserter of women turns his back on a secular life gone hideously awry and migrates to Israel joining the most extreme sect of ultra Orthodox he can find This is a New World sort of move even if made by a refugee and in Israel not America European Jewish migr s whether cultured cosmopolitans or members of the pious bourgeoisie don t suddenly convert to fundamentalism that s a specialty of godless Americans Now there s Allegra Goodman whose enthusiastically reviewed first novel Kaaterskill Falls appears poised to become the crossover Jewish novel of the year The book takes place over three summers in the late 1970s in and around a mitnaged rationalist anti mystical non Hasidic ultra Orthodox sect the Kirschners who followed their rabbi from Frankfurt to Washington Heights just before World War II and have taken to summering in a hamlet in the Eastern Catskills Don t mistake this for the Western Catskills the Borscht Belt The Eastern Catskills is a not particularly Jewish and now largely forgotten resort region that was once the height of chic the Hamptons of the 19 th century as well as home to the Hudson River School of painters The novel s title alludes to a famous painting by Thomas Cole that hangs in a nearby museum In short the grandeur of the past Jewish American is the theme here The older generation including the rabbi possesses the old European graces They re erudite and sophisticated and carry their rituals off with comparable ease Ease that is compared with the next generation which is Goodman s real focus The American born Kirschners are more rigid less worldly than their parents Even the rabbi frets about them They are good people he tells his son But they are very simple They are afraid of the Mind and to read They don t read Schiller and the Shakespeare How can I say it to you They keep the one thing the religious alive It is the most important but they have lost the other They have forgotten the poetry There is not one of them who is what we used to call an Educated Man Goodman has two advantages over her characters With an advanced degree in literature she has read Schiller and Shakespeare and she is writing 20 years later when American Judaism has grown less awkward about itself In fact the success of her novel lies in its casualness the way it makes the extremes of religious practice seem cozily normal Neither Potok nor Abraham can immerse the reader in the minutiae of Hasidic life the way Goodman does in the particulars of separatist German ultra Orthodoxy Another refreshing feature of Goodman s storytelling is that unlike other members of fundamentalist sects one might find in novels her characters don t chafe at their restrictions or not too much At the beginning of the novel the heroine Elizabeth Shulman feels so at home in her Jewish skin that God and the scriptures worship and ritual are all simple practical things for her Indeed she s one of the few deeply observant characters you re likely to encounter who does not romanticize religion The sacred is not mysterious to her Rather she romanticizes the secular Poetry universities and paintings fill her with awe It s typical of Goodman s blend of the sublime and the haimish homey that when Elizabeth experiences an epiphany while looking at Cole s picture it is the revelation of a most unambitious ambition She wants to open a kosher grocery store In an ultra Orthodox setting of course that s not a simple step It requires for example permission from the rabbi and renting from an anti Semitic landlord By the end of the book Shulman has bumped up against the edges of her life but she doesn t yearn to escape it exactly She has merely learned that her leaders are capable of stupid mistakes in their dealings with her She has no intention of leaving first because her doubt is not enough to sever her from her husband and children and second because that s not the kind of story it is The novel has its flaws Goodman s explanations of Jewish ritual sometimes veer from the helpful to the condescendingly overexplicit as if she were writing for young adults Shulman aside you could find one line descriptions of Goodman s main characters in any half dozen American Jewish novels the rabbi with two sons one brilliant and prodigal one duller but more loyal the Holocaust survivor numbed by his past the daughters tempted by the twin heresies of feminism and Zionism Israel is viewed as a nation of faithless sinners by these ultra Orthodox Jews the assimilationist Jew who comes to a bad end But Goodman makes them believable at least despite bits of soggy sentimentality she makes you care The exception is the cast of non Jewish locals who are almost all soap operaish white trash And whatever one s quibbles Goodman should be credited with doing what Singer and Malamud and even Ozick were never really able to do making the most rigorous form of Judaism seem plausible as an American life
