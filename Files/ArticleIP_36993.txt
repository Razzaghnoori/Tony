 Martha Stewart Here is a partial list of objects that Martha Stewart has gilded on recent TV shows pomegranates pumpkins cookies chocolate truffles wrapping paper oak leaves acorns and no kidding okra The only thing Martha has not gilded is the lily But wait till it s back in season Martha has proved that alchemy is not impossible Brush enough gold paint on enough flora and eventually you ll make real gold Tuesday s initial public offering for Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Omnimedia has there ever been a more perfect name killed on Wall Street rising from 18 to 52 before settling at 36 She arrived at the stock exchange that morning toting a tray of brioches She left that evening holding 1 2 billion in stock not dough Investors bought a brilliant company Omnimedia a Web site mail order operation two TV shows two magazines Kmart partnership and 27 books netted 24 million last year from the gospel of Martha Kmart sold more than 750 million worth of Martha branded products in 1998 Her 1997 decision to divorce Time Warner and go solo a split that cost her more than 50 million has never looked better What was missing from Martha s IPO was the sniping and mockery that has dogged all of her ventures Traditionally Martha has been battered by three criticisms First she is simply ludicrous You could not imagine better comic material than her ideas of living the midnight omelet dinner for 1 000 the fruit baskets the size of a Chevy the advice in this month s magazine to make your own envelopes out of wood veneer folding them with a bone knife Parodies barely exaggerate when they imagine Martha turning water into wine a lovely Merlot or manufacturing condoms from her own lamb A second and more thoughtful batch of critics has charged her with encouraging class division promoting soulless domestic conformism and undermining working women by making them feel domestically inadequate The final criticism has been personal As her unauthorized biography Just Desserts contends Martha is an icy horrible person who abused her now ex husband ignores her daughter belittles her mother sues her gardener for pennies plagiarizes recipes from better cooks and humiliates her staff Her fabled Remembering columns are a hash of bunkum and hyperbole The persona she cultivates the warm welcoming hostess with a close knit family is a fraud These criticisms have subsided partly because of America s culture of financial idolatry Anyone who s worth a billion on paper is worth sucking up to Martha is benefiting from parody fatigue as well She has been a figure of fun since Entertaining was published in 1982 so all the jokes are old And the vitality of the economy is inoculating her Fripperies that seemed obscene during the early 90s recession are quite modest by the standards of 1999 But the critical silence may also represent a long overdue recognition that Martha is as she would say a Good Thing In a Tuesday TV interview she called herself a teacher We are offering information high quality well researched how to information That is a fair description What she does is not silly at all or at least no more silly than most advice magazines Her magazines and TV shows retain just enough nonsense to make them irksome sew your own pashmina from home raised llamas and the like but she supplies valuable instruction about the mundane tasks of life Martha Stewart Living may be the most useful magazine this side of Consumer Reports This month s issue for example offers excellent advice about making spicy popcorn snacks cleaning ovens and storing rugs and china among other subjects Her weekly CBS morning segment packs more helpful cooking information into six minutes than most cooking shows do in an hour It is not false consciousness that makes tens of millions of people follow Martha every month It is her good advice But the great achievement of Martha s domestic gospel is not practical but moral She has a puritanical sensibility She believes in the uplifting power of work She instructs you so that you will know how to create objects yourself grow plants yourself learn home repair yourself cook food yourself Doing something well is good and liberating and fulfilling It strengthens friendships and families When I saw her making waffles the other day it made me want to make waffles this Sunday If I make waffles on Sunday I will invite the downstairs neighbors up to eat them and that is undoubtedly a Good Thing Martha practices materialism but not consumerism She believes rightly that it makes you wiser and happier to cook your own applesauce than to buy it Well you may say it s easy for her to make homemade applesauce That s her job But she did it when it wasn t her job too Even if most viewers rarely practice anything Martha preaches she calls such slackers Martha Dreamers as opposed to Martha Doers she is still a worthy goad Her DIY credo makes Martha democratically snobbish She hews to a country house sensibility but anyone can follow it It doesn t cost much because you do it yourself If a middle class Polish girl like Martha can blossom into an affected Breck girl faux WASP you can too The final and most important reason Martha is escaping criticism is that Martha Stewart the person has been separated from Martha Stewart the brand The principal topic of discussion about the Martha Stewart Living IPO was Martha Stewart s death Analysts speculated what would happen to Omnimedia if Martha were hit by a bus or cab or succumbed to an accident in the potting shed as the New York Observer s Christopher Byron nicely put it There were two answers First the company has bought a 67 million life insurance policy on her Second Martha Stewart the brand can survive without Martha Stewart the person as Ralph Lauren the brand survives without Ralph Lauren selling every shirt Martha does not appear at all in the current issue of Living The zooming stock price is evidence that Wall Street can distinguish Martha from her product We should do the same Critics have savaged her fraudulent persona and monomaniacal perfectionism for a long time There is a subtle sexism in that The female domestic tycoon is obliged to behave better than the guys This is why Oprah s private life is examined more carefully than David Letterman s Fortunately commerce has trumped personality Martha is finally being treated as the CEO of a company called Omnimedia not as a bitchy hausfrau In the age of the divine entrepreneur no one cares how badly you treat your kid We admire perfectionist monomania in Internet tycoons so why not in Martha Politicians get away with advertising bogus family bliss Martha should too On television Martha shows us how to make a romantic dinner for the husband she doesn t have host a party for the kids she doesn t like bake muffins for the neighbors who hate her But those are her tragedies not our business or Wall Street s The muffins are still tasty and that s what matters
