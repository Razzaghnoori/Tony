        Steve yeah how do you keep up on current affairs     well Frank um generally i keep on up oh listening to radio news uh listening to some television news uh the rest of it i guess what everybodys talking about um   uh   i guess if part of me says if its that important ill find out if i dont find out its not that important into the way that it affects my life right now um     uhhuh thats a good way of looking at it   thats i guess thats primarily why um we do go through periods where we uh   uhhuh   do get the local newspaper um you know and for for a city of a hundred and eighty thousand people the newspaper is still very slanted and uh you know you end up and you say well yeah okay and you   slightly liberal to the left or to the right   uh   whatd you say   oh i would say maybe its a little morbid to the right now you know here we kind of talk more liberal and conservative rather than left right but uh its a fairly liberal minded um     i see huh uhhuh   but you know its uh you tend to only get the one side you dont get kind of uh a broad coverage of of the reality of what happened   uhhuh uhhuh well i get my uh news from really from all the sources uh i will say probably radio is uh is a prime source because i like to listen to radio news uh on the hour for world news and then it the station i listen to usually have local news after that and i also watch the TV for for news and i take two newspaper uh the local city newspaper here in Portsmouth and also the state newspaper which is the Manchester Union Leader so uh you know thats thats how i stay informed plus from talking to people as you say if its real important youre going to hear about it from other people besides   right yeah i i guess i would think that you have a bit of an advantage in that you do have a an option for something that is more local and then something that is more statewide   umhum   um here i guess really were dealing with uh the regions being i i hesitate to say sparsely populated but really you know well get to one region thats uh several hundreds miles square and weve only got a few million people involved   right   and uh you know so regional coverage uh is pretty sparse and so we our next step from local tends to be virtually national or international   uhhuh   and and i suppose you might compare it to you dont hear very much North Dakota news   no   um you know so   but you do but you do i i take it   uh we we can at times you know being you know being right on the north edge of North Dakota we   uhhuh   uh we actually uh some of the current events are more an aspect of uh some uh sports interaction between North Dakota and Saskatchewan   uhhuh   and uh its not hardly an current event as such but um Minot does a lot of advertising to uh bring tourist industry down   i see   um so you know we kind of get stuck with uh you get your local news or you get your news thats based nationally and uh so then it has   umhum   anything that intends to be local interest uh is quite localized Toronto Montreal Ottawa Vancouver that kind of thing you know so youre getting uh   umhum well we have a sports interaction with Quebec mainly uh Montreal uh the teams there uh both baseball and with uh with hockey of course and with Quebec and uh Quebec City   umhum   and also uh one of the uh TV TV stations uh from Canada is on the cable system in this area uh from Sherbrook   oh yeah umhum   so uh we we do have some news from from Canada from time to time   yeah its uh yeah and you know i suppose of our television we with our cable system we get uh three Detroit stations and weve got three Saskatchewan stations with   do you have CNN do you have CNN   uh yes we do we also have CNN which   that can be an important source of news international   yes uh yeah i i actually i really enjoy their format and so it is it can be quite informative on an international basis uh   umhum   so um i guess that would probably be my primary source for international news but uh not on a   right   regular prescribed basis tend to uh or i happen to be there and im and uh
