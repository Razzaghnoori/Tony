 Introduction Squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue is a common malignancy treated by surgeons Incidence of tongue cancer in India is second highest in the world Among males the age adjusted incidence rate is as high as 14 100 000 per year in Ahmedabad while among females it is 7 4 100 000 in Mumbai 1 In Trivandrum the incidence of tongue cancer is 5 2 100 000 among males and 2 4 100 000 among females 2 Tongue is a complex anatomical site and its form and function are crucial for efficient swallowing speech and appreciation of taste In past different methods of treatment have been employed but tongue has remained a difficult area to assess and treat The survival in carcinoma of the tongue is poor compared to other subsites in oral cavity The distribution of cervical lymph node metastasis from squamous cell carcinoma at different subsites in the oral cavity has been described before 3 4 5 However there are very few studies from India where the incidence of tongue cancer is high The distribution of metastases suggests skip lesions and peppering 3 5 6 Predicting the lymphatic spread from cancer of the oral tongue can help in choosing the appropriate surgical procedure and may also help in predicting the outcome The purpose of the present study was to assess the pattern of cervical node metastasis from carcinoma of the oral tongue and to evaluate the impact of tumour status on survival Patients and Methods A retrospective analysis of 75 patients undergoing primary surgical resection for squamous cell carcinoma of oral tongue between January 1997 and December 1998 in a single surgical unit was carried out to evaluate the pattern of nodal metastasis and survival The variables like age sex tumour size grade clinical TNM pathological TNM and histopathological levels of involvement were extracted from case records All the patients underwent evaluation under general anaesthesia before the surgery and clinical TNM was modified if indicated The types of surgical procedures performed are detailed in table 1 Adjuvant radiotherapy 45 Gy 15 fraction was given if the primary tumour was greater than 2 cm had close margins or nodal involvement was present or there was extranodal involvement Minimum duration of follow up was two years following surgery Survival analysis was carried by Kaplan Meier method and the curves were compared using log rank test Multivariate analysis was carried out using Cox proportional hazard model Results Age of the patients ranged from 22 to 75 years with a mean age of 52 6 years The male female ratio was 1 5 1 Table 2 All the patients had undergone primary surgical resection At presentation 44 of patients had T 2 tumour followed by T 3 in 20 Table 2 Clinically 34 patients were found to be neck node positive of which 26 34 7 were cN 1 6 8 were cN 2b and 2 2 7 were cN 2c Histologically 33 cases were found to have positive neck nodes of which majority 16 21 3 were pN 2b The T and N stage distribution is detailed in table 2 Cervical lymph node metastasis was present in 47 1 of T 1 tumours 24 13 of T 2 tumours 63 6 of T 3 tumours and 61 1 of T 4 tumours Table 3 Histologically 18 cases were true positive for nodal metastasis while 26 cases were true negative giving a sensitivity of 54 5 and specificity of 61 9 for clinical examination of the neck Table 4 Synchronous discontinuous operations were performed in all cases None of the patients had a positive resection margin however the margin was close 2 5 mm in 11 cases Neck was managed by vein preserving neck dissection in 27 cases 36 and supraomohyoid neck dissection in 22 cases 29 3 Table 1 It was observed that the nodal involvement in ipsilateral level II was highest 63 6 followed by the involvement of level I 51 5 level III 18 2 and level IV 15 2 Table 1 Table 2shows the distribution of nodes at different levels of the neck in varying combination Skip metastasis to level III III and IV occurred in 5 cases On histopathological examination only one patient had bilateral positive nodes These nodes were located at level I bilaterally and the patient had undergone bilateral vein preserving neck dissection Table 1 A total of 59 patients received adjuvant radiotherapy radiotherapy was given to 32 34 patients with N disease or extranodal spread Nine patients with T1N0 disease and 5 patients with T2N0 disease and one patient each with T1N1 and T2N1 disease did not receive adjuvant radiotherapy Over the two year follow up 19 cases failed the failure was nodal in 8 primary in 8 and both primary and nodal in 3 patients The clinical TNM pathological TNM and level of positive node are illustrated in additional table 1 The overall disease free survival DFS was found to be 78 4 at 1 year and 68 4 at 2 years Table 5 fig 1 Patients with T 4 tumours were found to have a significantly poor survival with the disease free survival at the end of 2 years being 36 6 T 1 and T 2 tumours showed better prognosis with disease free survival of 76 2 and 83 5 respectively at the end of 2 years Table 5 figure 2 Histopathological node negative cases had a DFS of 79 at the end of 2 years whereas pathological N 1 pN 1 had survival of 72 7 and pN 2 of 39 5 P 0 03 Table 5 figure 3 No other parameter including use of adjuvant radiotherapy was found to have significant effect on disease free survival On multivariate analysis the tumour size and nodal metastasis were found to be significant independent prognostic factors The hazard ratio for failure was 1 0 for T2 1 7 for T1 1 72 for T3 and 1 84 for T4 tumours Similarly hazard ratio for failure in N0 disease was 1 0 it was 9 9 in N1 14 9 in N2 and 21 2 in N3 disease Sex was also found to be an independent prognostic factor with hazard ratio for males being 1 4 however this difference was statistically not significant Discussion Squamous cell carcinoma arising in oral tongue is curable if assessed and treated appropriately Clinically undetectable nodal metastasis is the commonest cause of treatment failure Incidence of neck metastasis in oral SCC is reported to be 34 to 50 7 8 In our series level II was found to be the most commonly involved site 63 6 and level IV involvement was seen in 15 2 patients Isolated level IV involvement in absence of involvement of one of the higher levels I II or III was not documented in any patient in the present study Further clinically node negative cases never showed level IV involvement Shah et al 1990 4 had documented similar results Hence a supraomohyoid neck dissection is justified when the neck is clinically negative On the contrary Byers et al 1997 3 found 16 of patients with oral cancer to have metastasis in level IV without nodes in level I II or III It was seen that only 35 6 of T 1 and T 2 lesions showed nodal metastasis where as 62 3 of the larger tumours showed metastasis Table 3 Previous studies 9 6 support our finding that tumour size is a predictor of lymph node metastasis though they propose that tumour thickness is a more reliable factor This is further explained by DiTroia 1972 10 who points to difficulty for the tumour emboli to form in small calibre lymphatics of the superficial areas compared with wider lymphatic of deeper tissues However tumour thickness is a radiological or histological parameter which cannot be assessed preoperatively by clinical examination or biopsy In our study sensitivity and specificity of clinical examination was poor suggesting that clinical examination is of limited use in predicting cervical nodal metastasis This is in accord with previous studies 5 6 One option would be to look for a more reliable methods to asses the neck Sajeeda et al 2000 11 documented that ultrasonography is not only useful in detecting neck nodes but is also useful in assessing the nodal characteristic and the degree of vascular invasion Takashima et al 1997 12 demonstrated ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration to have 93 7 diagnostic accuracy Computed tomographic CT scanning too is very useful for the purpose of early detection of neck metastasis 13 Magnetic resonance imaging MRI on the other hand has been found to have little advantage over clinical examination as the soft tissue contrast resolution reported by MRI is inadequate to detect minimal morphological changes in lymph nodes 14 The technique of sentinel node biopsy is gaining popularity Surgery on the primary tumour often modifies lymphatic drainage so sentinel node biopsy is useful when primary tumour and neck are operated at the same time 15 If the treatment decision has to be based on the present sensitivity and specificity of clinical examination then a minimum selective neck dissection should be carried out for all node negative necks where primary is being treated by surgery as primary modality Studies have documented that ipsilateral level I II and III neck dissection is an adequate diagnostic procedure for staging of the clinically node negative neck in early oral tongue cancer 16 17 Its diagnostic role cannot be replaced by preoperative radiological screening and intraoperative frozen section sampling T 1 and T 2 tumours show a similar significantly higher disease free survival compared to T 3 and T 4 tumours even though the number in the present study is small the conclusions can be drawn with conviction from these results as shown in earlier studies on smaller sample size 18 Brown et al 1989 19 too have shown similar results Nodal metastases too significantly correlate with disease free survival as also documented by Woolgar et al 1999 6 Similar results were seen in the present study as well where tumour size nodal status and surgery as primary modality were found to be a significant predictor of disease free survival In the light of the present results showing a poor sensitivity and specificity of clinical examination in predicting nodal metastasis and infrequent involvement of level IV in the absence of involvement of higher levels we suggest that a supraomohyoid neck dissection should be carried out in all patients of the oral tongue cancer with clinically node negative neck to achieve a better disease free survival
