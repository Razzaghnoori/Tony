 Background The neurotrophins play crucial functions in the interaction of muscles with their innervating neurons during development and in the adult vertebrate organism The neurotrophin family includes Nerve Growth Factor NGF Neurotrophin 3 NT 3 Neurotrophin 4 5 NT 4 5 Neurotrophin 6 NT6 and Brain derived Neurotrophic Factor BDNF Three neurotrophins BDNF NT 3 and NT 4 5 are known to contribute to the development maintenance and functioning of the neuromuscular system Each of these three neurotrophins is expressed differentially in muscle during development in the adult and in response to injury NT 3 is the most abundantly expressed of the three neurotrophins during embryonic muscle development followed by NT 4 5 and BDNF 1 2 After birth NT 3 and NT 4 5 are down regulated in muscle whereas BDNF continues to be expressed at low levels 1 BDNF mRNA is expressed in myocytes in the adult muscle 3 Essentially nothing is known about BDNF gene expression in fish muscle We detected BDNF mRNA in the muscle layer of the fin of the 4 days old zebrafish larvae using in situ hybridization 4 but the identity of the expressing cells has not yet been definitvely established The first demonstration that BDNF potentiates neuromuscular transmission was reported by Lohof AM et al 5 BDNF transiently stabilizes silent NM synapses during the period of transition from polyneuronal to mononeuronal innervation of skeletal muscle fibers 6 BDNF and CNTF cooperatively affect efficiency of embryonic xenopus neuromuscular synapses in culture 7 8 BDNF stimulates transmitter release from neuromuscular synapses 9 and enhances the efficiency of transmission at the neuromuscular synapse 10 BDNF together with NT 3 can restore neuregulin levels and a normal distribution of AchR at the neuromuscular junction blocked with curare 11 BDNF in conjunction with fibronectin increases spontaneous synaptic currents in the cultured embryonic xenopus neuromuscular junction 12 BDNF down regulates AchR clustering most likely by binding to TrkB expressed in myocytes 13 BDNF downregulates agrin levels in muscle but increases neuregulin in ventral horn spinal motor neurons at the time when they form neuromuscular synapses 14 BDNF production is activity dependent 11 15 Muscle activity is required to maintain BDNF mRNA levels in rat soleus muscle 16 17 Vigorous exercise increases BDNF mRNA levels above baseline 17 Neuromuscular blockade in culture also decreases BDNF mRNA levels In response to nerve injury BDNF mRNA is slowly but substantially increased in Schwann cells and muscle fibers 18 BDNF expression is also increased in cardiac myocytes following ischemic injury 19 The molecular mechanisms that induce BDNF gene expression in muscle during development maintain basal expression in the adult muscle and dynamically regulate BDNF mRNA in muscle in response to neuromuscular activity and injury are not known To understand the contribution of BDNF gene transcription to this regulation we have begun to examine the structure organization and expression of the zebrafish BDNF gene The mammalian BDNF gene is known to have at least four promoters whose cell specific and developmental activity is differentially regulated 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 The transcripts derived from these promoters have a common organization They all consist of two exons one of the 5 non coding exons followed by the coding exon which is common to all transcripts We previously cloned a zebrafish BDNF transcript that appeared to contain two exons and thus suggested that the zebrafish and mammalian BDNF genes have similar organizations 4 We recently cloned the zebrafish BDNF gene and identified the previously cloned 5 exon in the genomic clone 27 The exon was named exon 1c Sequence analysis confirmed that the position of the intron that separates exon 1c from the common coding exon is identical in fish and man In addition the size of the intron is similar in fish and mouse Exon 1c contains a 39 bp sequence that is 93 identical to a segment in exon III of the rat BDNF gene Transient expression in developing zebrafish embryos of the promoter upstream from exon 1c using an EGFP F reporter revealed expression in a number of cell types including skeletal muscle epithelial cells notochord and vascular cells I here report the cloning structural analysis and transcriptional activity in transiently transfected developing zebrafish embryos of three additional 5 exons and their associated promoters Two of the 5 exons were found in the same transcript This transcript thus contains three exons a novel structure of a BDNF transcript not previously reported These two exons could not be found by homology searches in the mammalian genome but were detected in the pufferfish genome The promoter upstream from the 5 exon of the tripartite transcript was linked to the EGFP F reporter The fusion gene was exclusively expressed in terminally differentiated myocytes of developing zebrafish embryos The 5 flank immediately upstream from the promoter is GC rich and contains multiple Sp1 like sequences as well as several potential Mef 2 binding sites These transcription factors are known to be important for the expression of genes in myocytes Although the endogenous exon and promoter were expressed in embryonic muscle the endogenous exon could not be detected in juvenile fish or adult female muscle by RT PCR Possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed Results The zebrafish BDNF gene has at least four 5 non coding exons The organization of all neurotrophin genes so far examined is similar 28 29 It was therefore expected that the zebrafish BDNF gene would have multiple 5 exons To identify additional 5 exons 5 RACE was employed To maximize the chances of finding all existing exons total RNA extracted from 10 days old larvae was used as the template The relative abundance of BDNF transcripts in total RNA dramatically increases in the first 7 days of development and plateaus by 10 days pf 4 Initially 48 of the 5 RACE clones were screened for inserts by restriction enzyme digest figure 1 To identify 5 RACE clones that contained novel 5 non coding exons the nucleotide sequences of representatives of groups of clones with similar sizes were determined The sequences were compared with the sequences of subclones of the genomic BDNF clone c241 which we had previously identified and partially sequenced 27 Five of the ten sequenced 5 RACE clones contained the already known and previously cloned 5 exon 4 This exon was named exon 1c because it contains a 39 nucleotide segment in which 37 nucleotides are identical with a segment in rat exon III suggesting the two exons are orthologous see table 1 and figure 2a 25 Two clones contained 248 bp inserts The first 53 nucleotides were found close to the 5 end of a 9 kb genomic HindIII fragment of c241 that contains exon 1c close to its centre 27 The next 195 nucleotides were found 905 nucleotides downstream suggesting that they represented an internal exon Classical splice acceptor and donor di nucleotides surround this 195 bp exon see table 2 additional file 2 consistent with an internal position in a BDNF transcript The shorter more 5 exon was named exon 1b and the more 3 exon exon 1b see figure 2 All known BDNF gene 5 exons are directly spliced to the common coding exon generating mature messages that contain two exons a single 5 non coding and the common coding exon Finding an internal exon was thus unexpected and surprising A single clone contained a 441 bp insert The sequence of the insert was not found in the available c241 subclone sequences To determine if it might be a BDNF 5 exon it was compared with all known sequences using BLAST A segment of 29 nucleotides that was identical with a segment in rat exon II was found suggesting the insert was a 5 BDNF gene exon This segment was named highly conserved sequence 2 or HCS2 see table 1 additional file 1 The exon was named exon 1a Additional File 1 Table 1 Highly Conserved Sequences in non coding regions The highly conserved sequences HCS in the non coding regions of the fish rat and human BDNF genes were aligned The stars indicate nucleotides that are identical in all three species Dashes denote gaps that were introduced to maximize alignment Click here for file Additional File 2 Table 2 Exon Intron junctions Exon sequences are shown in blue capital letters and introns in lower case black letters Splice acceptors are maroon and splice donors red Click here for file Exon 1a was located outside the sequenced regions of the genomic clone c241 27 To identify its location in c241 a HindIII restriction digest of c241 was subjected to southern blot hybridization analysis using a probe specific for exon 1a A 5 7 KB HindIII fragment specifically hybridized to the probe This fragment was subcloned into the HindIII site of the EGFP vector by plus minus green cloning A 2 KB region containing exon 1a was sequenced Comparison of the genomic and 5 RACE sequences indicated that the novel 5 portion of the insert was present as a continuous sequence in the genomic clone Moreover a classical splice donor site followed the 5 end table 2 see additional file 2 The insert thus represented a 5 non coding exon of the zebrafish BDNF gene These cloning and sequencing data indicate that at least three distinct transcripts are derived from the zebrafish BDNF gene figure 3 A single 5 RACE clone did not exhibit any homology to the mammalian or zebrafish BDNF genes A BLAST search identified the insert as the 5 end of actin mRNA Organization of the Zebrafish and mammalian BDNF Genes are similar The locations of the exons identified by 5 RACE in the BDNF transcription unit were mapped in three ways First their nucleotide sequences were compared with that of clone CH211 251J8 which carries a 149 KB zebrafish genomic fragment NCBI databank accession AL935207 Exon 1b was found at nucleotides 1050 1101 exon 1b at nucleotides 2006 2200 and exon 1c at nucleotides 6100 6397 figure 2 Exon 1a was not found Second the nucleotide sequences were compared to known BDNF exons by a BLAST search A short segment of identity was found in exon 1a with exon 2 of the mouse human and rat genes suggesting it is orthologous to these exons and thus should lie upstream from exon 1b see table 1 see additional file 1 These analyses placed exon 1a upstream from exons 1b b and c and upstream from the 5 end of clone CH211 251J8 Third to confirm this upstream location and to estimate the distance between exon 1a and 1b long range PCR was done with a sense primer ex1aP3 in exon 1a and an anti sense primer in exon 1b sc1P18 using the genomic clone c241 as a template A PCR product of 3 2 KB was obtained see figure 4 No PCR product was obtained when sense and antisense primers were switched The PCR product would be expected to be 2 4 if the exon 1a and 1b containing HindIII fragments were contiguous The larger size suggested that a 0 8 KB HindIII fragment was present between the two To test this possibility the PCR product was digested with HindIII Three fragments were generated indicating the presence of an interposed fragment Their sizes were consistent with the largest and smallest being derived from the exon 1b and 1a containing HindIII fragments respectively and the middle one being an interposed fragment A HindIII subclone of c241 was found with an insert identical in size with the interposed fragment figure 2 The subclone was named Dex1aDS The insert of Dex1aDS was sequenced and its orientation determined by PCR using either primer ex1aP3 or sc1P18 paired with a primer Dex1aDSP1 located within Dex1aDS The sequencing and PCR data and the nucleotide sequence of clone CH211 251J8 were used to construct a HindIII map of the zebrafish BDNF gene see figure 5 Comparison with pufferfish gene suggests existence of an additional exon The pufferfish BDNF gene is located in the scaffold_551 1 contig Ensembl Fugu rubripes and Danio rerio both belong to the infraclass teleostei The two BDNF genes can therefore be expected to be well conserved The nucleotide sequences of the two genes were searched for identities using Bestfit and Gap from the GCG sequence analysis package These comparisons revealed three regions in the pufferfish gene whose nucleotide sequences were 78 identical with exons 1a b and c of the zebrafish gene The relative positions of these exons to each other and the coding exons were identical in both genes The distances between these exons and their distances to the coding exon were also very similar An additional region of 78 identity was found between exon 1c and the coding exon at nucleotides 9592 9876 of the zebrafish sequence nucleotide numbers of clone CH211 251J8 This region could represent exon 1d and hence might correspond to rat and mouse exon 5 Since this exon has not yet been cloned by 5 RACE its inclusion in figure 3is tentative Collectively the 5 RACE mapping PCR and sequence comparison data suggest that the zebrafish BDNF gene has at least 4 and possibly 5 non coding exons if exon 1 d is included and that at least one transcript has 3 exons see figure 3 Exons 1a and 1c contain highly conserved sequences Nucleotide sequence analysis of the 5 RACE clones so far identified three additional 5 exons namely exons 1a 1 b and 1b A striking structural feature of exon 1a is a 25 nucleotide highly conserved segment HCS2 that is identical to a segment of rat exon II see table 1 additional file 1 and figure 2 The function of HCS2 is unknown This segment is also conserved in the pufferfish genome scaffold_551 scaffold_1408 We previously reported the presence of a 39 bp segment within exon 1c in which 37 bps are identical in man and fish see table 1 additional file 1 The significance of this highly conserved segment HCS1 is unknown In contrast to exons 1a and 1c exons 1b and 1b exhibit only random similarity with the known mammalian exons A region of high similarity was found in the pufferfish gene in a location expected for exon 1b Exon 1b differs from any mammalian counterparts in that it is an internal non coding exon So far internal non coding exons have only been described in other neurotrophin genes at first in the mouse NGF gene 30 31 and subsequently in the NT 3 gene 32 and more recently in the NT 4 5 gene 33 The 5 flank of exon 1b is GC rich and contains multiple Sp1 and Mef2 binding site consensus sequences The flanking regions of exons 1a and 1b were analyzed for potential transcription factor binding sites using the Transfac database and search engine 34 The flank of exon 1b is GC rich and contains multiple potential Sp1 binding sites close to the promoter Two potential Mef2 sites were also found see table 3 additional file 3 The nucleotide sequence is strikingly similar to that of the 5 flank of the FGFR1 gene The FGFR1 gene is expressed in myocytes in their terminal differentiation phase Additional File 3 Table 3 Nucleotide Sequence and Potential Transcription Factor Binding Sites of the 5 Flank of Exon 1b The nucleotide sequence of exon 1b was established by 5 RACE The nucleotide sequence of the 5 flank was obtained from a HindIII subclone of c241 The nucleotide sequence was searched for potential transcription factor binding sites using Transfac 34 The potential binding sites for Sp1 maroon Mef2 aqua AP 1 yellow and SRF green are shown The 5 end of exon 1b is shown in uppercase and boldface letters Key restriction enzyme sites are shown in red The EcoRI site is at the 5 end of clone CH211 251J8 Click here for file The 5 flank of exon 1a in contrast has a more classical TA rich promoter region and is devoid of Sp1 and Mef2 sites see table 4 additional file 4 Additional File 4 Table 4 Nucleotide Sequence and Potential Transcription Factor Binding Sites of the 5 Flank of Exon 1a The nucleotide sequence of exon 1a was established by 5 RACE The nucleotide sequence of the 5 flank was obtained from a HindIII subclone of c241 The nucleotide sequence was searched for potential transcription factor binding sites using Transfac 34 The display was formatted by Transfac and contains active links The 5 end of exon 1a is shown in boldface letters Click here for file Fusion genes containing exon 1b b are specifically expressed in skeletal muscle To confirm that the cloned promoters were functionally competent and to begin to identify regulatory regions within the promoters the cloned promoters were linked to the EGFP F reporter see figure 6 The fusion genes were injected into embryos and expression examined by fluorescent microscopy in live embryos Promoter 1b was linked to the EGFP F reporter using a HindIII BamHI fragment that contained 5 flank exons 1b and b 3 KB of intron 1b and the coding exon splice acceptor site preceded by 250 nucleotides of intron 1c This construct was named AJ For expression studies the vector sequences and all SV40 sequences except the SV40 3 UT and polyA addition site were removed by MluI digestion followed by purification on an agarose gel In two series of injections 350 embryos were injected with AJ The 2 day survival rate was 60 56 of the surviving embryos expressed the reporter 2 days after fertilization Over 90 of the expressing cells were skeletal muscle cells Expression was mostly seen in trunk muscles rarely close to the tail and never in the head figure 4 In a few embryos AJ was also expressed in notochord and vascular cells In a rare embryo expression was seen in neurons and blood cells To further narrow down the sequences that are responsible for expression in myocytes exon 1b was directly linked to the reporter using a PstI site 10 nucleotides downstream from the transcription start site see clone CH211 251J8 In this construct which was named AJ Pst intron 1b exon 1b and most of intron 1c totalling 3 6 KB are eliminated In a series of 250 injections with a survival rate of 55 and an expression rate of 30 AJ Pst was also specifically expressed in myocytes see figure 7 Fusion genes containing exon 1a are transiently expressed in yolk Promoter 1a was linked to the EGFP F reporter in a similar fashion figure 6 The 5 flank extended to 3 5 KB However only 179 bps of intron 1a were used Thus the total composite intron size was 325 bps This construct which was named DOA5 was injected into sets of 150 and 250 embryos The survival rate was 45 and 55 40 of the combined survivors expressed the reporter All had an unusual pattern of expression There was intense labelling of round structures of variable size and labelling intensity by 10 h pf see figure 8 These structures did not conform to any cellular or subcellular shapes They were close to the surface of the embryos Because of limited spatial resolution it was not clear whether they were in the yolk or in cells on the surface of the embryo These structures tended to be present in limited sections of the embryo but generally did not follow a specific pattern However in a few embryos there were more ordered patterns In one embryo there was a line of labelled structures coinciding with the embryonic midline In the same embryo there was an anterior semilunar patch arranged symmetrically about the midline By 20 h pf most of the labelled structures had moved into the embryo in various and seemingly random locations By 2 days pf only a few remained and by 3 days pf no labelled structures or cells were seen in 99 of the embryos A very rare embryo had expression in the notochord or transient expression in several myocytes The same expression was found with a construct in which the exon was directly linked to the reporter at a BglII site This construct has no intron Expression of endogenous exons is tissue specific The fusion genes containing exon 1b and its 5 flank were expressed only in skeletal muscle To determine whether the endogenous exon were also expressed cell specifically total RNA was extracted from the skeletal muscle of an adult female and analyzed for exon 1a using RT PCR To increase specificity and sensitivity two rounds of PCR were done with nested primers Diluting the cDNA template 100 fold prior to amplification with actin primers checked the quality of the cDNA actin mRNA was readily amplified in the first round of PCR indicating the cDNA was of good quality Surprisingly exon 1b could not be detected even after two rounds of PCR see figure 12 The primers were competent as they yielded product when the 5 RACE clone was used as a template Exon 1b could be spliced directly to exon 2 The resulting bipartite transcript would yield a PCR product of 93 bps No PCR products in that size range were seen A set of nested antisense primers that is 300 bps further downstream also gave negative results In contrast to exon 1b exon 1c was detected in muscle RNA after the second round of PCR Total RNA from whole juvenile fish was also analyzed as it should contain all exons that are expressed at this stage of development Both exon 1a and 1c were found The amplifications with exon 1b primers yielded minor amounts of DNA that did not co migrate with the controls It is possible that they represent transcripts in which exon 1b is spliced to exons other than 1b Discussion The data presented in this report show that the overall organization of the BDNF gene is similar in fish and man However fish and human genes differ significantly in the size of the transcription unit the number of exons and the splicing patterns of the exons In contrast the zebrafish and pufferfish BDNF genes are highly similar in all regions that could be compared The pufferfish gene is flanked on the 5 side by a kinesin gene that lies 30 kb upstream from the BDNF coding exon and on the 3 side by a Lin7 gene less than 5 kb downstream from the coding exon The fish transcription unit thus appears to span between 15 and 30 KB In contrast the mouse and human genes are between 60 and 80 KB long at least twice and possibly four times as large The difference in size is due to much larger introns in the mammalian genes A second difference between fish and mammalian genes is the generation of a tripartite transcript from the fish gene Such tripartite transcripts have not yet been described in mouse rat or human A more thorough examination of all human transcripts may eventually uncover tripartite messages in the human A third difference between fish and mammalian genes is the much greater diversity of exons in the human gene even when compared with the mouse However neither in the zebrafish nor the mouse has an exhaustive search for all possible exons been conducted yet We have recently found additional exons in a second round of 5 RACE However they have not yet been sequenced or mapped on the transcription unit The 5 exons of the rat and mouse genes and their associated promoters are expressed in a tissue and cell specific manner 25 The data presented here as well as data presented in a previous report 35 indicate that the zebrafish BDNF gene promoters are also expressed in a tissue specific manner When linked to the EGFP F reporter exon 1b was primarily expressed in skeletal muscle cells Visible expression did not start until the myocytes exhibited striations However there may a significant time lag between onset of transcription of the transfected DNA EGFP F aggregation and insertion into the membrane Both are required for efficient fluorescence Thus the precise onset of transcription of the transgene is uncertain It is also possible that the EGFP F reporter is quite stable and persists beyond a period of transient transcription The exclusive expression of the promoter 1b construct in skeletal muscle differs markedly from the previously reported expression of a promoter 1c construct 27 The previously tested reporter 1c construct was identical to the promoter 1b construct injected here except for the promoter sequences It was expressed in a number of cell types including notochord epithelial and endothelial cells and skeletal muscle The 5 flank of exon 1b was searched with TransFac for potential transcription factor binding sites 34 Potential binding sites for three transcription factors that have been shown to play key roles in muscle gene expression were found Sp 1 Mef2 and SRF 36 Four potential Sp1 and two Mef2 bindings sites were found within 300 bps of the transcription start A potential SRF binding site is also close to the transcription start site Farther upstream two AP 1 sites were found These Sp 1 and Mef2 sites may play a role in muscle expression of the BDNF gene The proximal 5 flank of the FGFR1 gene has a similar clustering of SP 1 Mef2 and SRF sites 36 The FGFR1 gene is expressed in terminally differentiated muscle although at a lower level than in proliferating myoblasts 36 The expression depends on Sp 1 sites in the proximal promoter and the binding of Sp 1 and Sp 3 to these sites The absence of Sp 1 and Sp 3 from fully differentiated myocytes may explain the down regulation in terminally differentiated muscle Unexpectedly RT PCR did not detect exon 1b in total RNA extracted from skeletal muscle of an adult female see figure 9 It is possible that exon 1b is expressed in skeletal myoblasts only transiently during the period of innervation by primary and secondary motor neurons We did not assay RNA from these early stages of development It is also possible that exon 1b is expressed primarily in proliferating myoblasts The expression in skeletal myocytes observed in the reported experiments could represent persistence of the EGFP F reporter protein past the time of downregulation of transcription in myocytes Or our construct could lack a suppressor that turns the endogenous promoter off in terminally differentiated and innervated myocytes It is also possible that our construct is expressed ectopically However the similarity of its 5 flank with that of the FGFR1 gene is striking A more detailed analysis of the time course of expression of the endogenous gene and cellular localization of BDNF transcripts in muscle is needed to address these possibilities In contrast to the situation with exon 1b exon 1c was detected by RT PCR in adult female muscle RNA see figure 9 The RT PCR data do not identify the cells that express exon 1c Muscle contains blood vessels and mixed nerves Endothelial cells are known to express BDNF 37 and so do Schwann cells 38 These cells may contribute to the exon 1c transcripts Is exon 1c expressed in myocytes The RT PCR data strongly suggest so In addition a construct that is driven by the exon 1c promoter is expressed in various types of muscle cells 27 However it is also expressed in a number of non muscle cells Thus its expression is much broader than the exclusive muscle expression of the exon 1b construct When the exon 1c construct was extended in the 5 direction to include exon 1b and its flank expression was still broad data not shown manuscript in preparation The Sp1 and Mef2 elements thus are not capable of suppressing expression in other cell types It should be noted that both the exon 1b and exon 1c expression constructs contained the SV40 IEG 3 UT and polyadenylation signals downstream from the EGFP F reporter rather than BDNF sequences see figure 6 It is becoming clear that their presence affects expression manuscript in preparation However their effect may be quantitative rather than qualitative In any event exon 1c is the only exon that was detected in adult female muscle by RT PCR Exon 1b appears to play a more limited role during development and possibly in muscle injury and regeneration The exon 1a construct was not expressed in any identifiable embryonic or larval cells at the 1 somite stage yet there was intense labelling of yolk platelets The platelets are close to the surface They are congregated preferentially near the midline It is not clear whether the platelets become labelled in the yolk or within cells Their location close to the surface suggests they become labelled in the yolk syncitial layer YSL The YSL begins to form at the 1k cell stage or 3 h after fertilization when transcription of zygotic genes begins By the dome stage the YSL has completely covered the yolk cell and effectively separates the embryo from the yolk cell The peripheral blastomeres of the YSL appear to maintain cytoplasmic bridges with the yolk cell These peripheral blastomeres may continue to take up platelets They must also transcribe the exon 1a construct This possibility is consistent with our previous in situ hybridization analyses which revealed BDNF expression in the peripheral YSL 35 Some of the labeled platelets end up in cells of the embryo and persist up to 2 days of development These platelets must represent the earliest onset of transcription of the injected construct possibly at the onset of zygotic gene transcription It is not clear why this particular construct consistently and strongly labels yolk platelets We routinely get expression of other constructs in the yolk of a small number of embryos presumably when there is unintended injection or leakage into the yolk However in all these embryos there is diffuse labeling of the membrane of the yolk cell rather than labeling of platelets Since they all encode the same reporter and share the same 3 UT the difference must originate from the non coding 5 regions of the construct either the 5 flank or 5 UT Conclusions The zebrafish BDNF gene is much more compact than the mammalian gene and rivals in compactness that of the vertebrate with the smallest known genome the puffer fish The more compact size makes the zebrafish more amenable to comprehensive molecular genetic analysis than the mammalian gene The zebrafish has multiple differentially regulated promoters and 5 exons like its mammalian counterpart Two of the four presently known 5 exons contain conserved segments that are identical in fish and man The promoter containing a segment identical to rat exon II is transiently expressed in the yolk syncitial layer The remaining two exons are novel and generate a tripartite transcript The novel promoter is specifically expressed in myocytes of transfected embryos but the endogenous exon is not expressed in adult female muscle The cloned BDNF gene and knowledge of its organization are invaluable tools for a future genetic analysis of the regulation of BDNF gene expression Methods 5 RACE Amplified cDNA was generated using the Invitrogen GeneRacer kit according to the manufacturer s directions http www invitrogen com The template for cDNA preparation was total RNA extracted from 10 days old larvae using the guanidine thiocyanate method cDNA was generated using random hexamer oligonucleotides The cDNA was amplified
