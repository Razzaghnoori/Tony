found gun makers liable for several deaths and injuries inflicted with illegally obtained weapons The jury concluded that negligent marketing and distribution of handguns by nine companies was a proximate cause of three recent shootings despite the absence of proof that any particular company s product was involved in any of the shootings However the jury awarded damages in only one case Gun

say 1 they found no other problems contrary to previous reports that IOC officials were given meals geishas and other favors 2 they regret that Nagano s bid committee burned its records years ago and

concealed a conflict of interest The Times also reports that Starr s office has challenged the DOJ s authority to look into Starr s files The spins 1 Attorney General Janet Reno should fire Starr

years and siding with Iraq in the Persian Gulf War editorialists lavished excuses on him He feared a Palestinian revolt if he didn t attack Israel in 1967 atoned for the 1967 war by sitting out the 1973 war against Israel and allied himself with Iraq in 1991 because he feared an Iraqi invasion or collateral economic damage from the war against Iraq Commentators politely overlooked the fact that
