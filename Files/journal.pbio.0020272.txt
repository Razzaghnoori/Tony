                            There is an old Chinese curse May you live in interesting times According to those        who know about such things we live in a momentous time the time of the Sixth Mass        Extinction But most of us do not feel at all cursed Because in fact the Sixth is quite        different to the previous Big Fivenoone would notice this one if we were not repeatedly        reminded of it by ecologists Previous mass extinctions were not so bashful so discreet        The fossil record reveals the disappearance of pollen during previous ones replaced by an        abundance of fungus spores telling us of a world of devastated forests rotting away The        earliest sediments after the mass extinction that did away with the dinosaurs are barren of        fossils so it is not just that species were going extinct conditions for life itself were        bad Not only did species diversity drop the abundance of life did as well        But conditions for life itself have never been better than today In the history of the        planet there has never been anything as productive of life as a wheat field in Kansas It        may not have a large diversity of species but that is a different matter In fact one of        the reasons for the ongoing loss of plant diversity from grasslands is the very reason the        wheat field is so productivefertilisation We are pouring nitrogen fertiliser into the        environment and through the wellstudied paradox of enrichment this reduces species        diversity while increasing actual biomass Now there is no question that if current trends        of habitat alteration and climate change continue then we will ultimately lose large        numbers of speciesdiversity will dropbut this does not necessarily translate into a loss        of abundance of life and that is a big difference between now and previous mass        extinctions Looking at specific groups of organisms tells the same story So for example        many island bird species are threatened like the kagu of New Caledonia but British        seabird populations like puffins are booming Worldwide amphibian diversity is        threatened but cane toads are a pest in Australia Introduced species pose a threat to        diversitythe McDonaldisation of natureprecisely because they achieve enormous        abundances        Actually all six mass extinctions may have one very important thing in common from the        point of view of the vast bulk of life on the planet they are probably not mass extinctions        at all By any criterionnumber of individuals or total biomassthe vast majority of life        on earth is invisiblemicrobial So for example at least  of the living biomass on        earth consists of bacteria living deep in the oceans sediments it would take more than an        asteroid impact to disturb them And microbial life is extraordinarily robust microbes can        be found living happily in pressurised water hotter than your boiling kettle in        concentrated acid and in rock and their spores can survive for years in the rigours of        outer space        In talks and lectures the renowned oceanographer and paleontologist Jeremy Jackson        paints a vivid picture of what is currently happening to coastal ecosystems talking about        a wall of slime emanating from populated areas and growing outwards inexorably towards the        open oceans replacing beloved ecologies like coral reef systems What he means is that the        visible life that we find attractive and usefulpretty fish turtles and so onis being        replaced by microbes in splendid profusion It is taken completely for granted that this is        disastrous From a utilitarian point of view indeed it is disastrous since we like eating        fish and turtles and dont like snorkling in slime But from the point of view of life per        se again things have never been better Life is so abundant that in some places all the        oxygen in the water is completely used up These are called dead zones but they are no        more dead than the Dead Sea which is actually teeming with lifejust not fish But        nonetheless we consider what is occurring to be a disaster not just from a utilitarian        point of view but at some deeper level giving us an emotional reaction to the word        slimesomehow it is just plain wrong        But this reflects nothing other than our evolutionary origins Evolution has programmed        us to be positively interested in plants and animals our food and to be repelled by        slimes and oozes teeming with potentially harmful microbes These emotional responses        colour our view of ecology for example in a way that has no parallel in other sciences        physicists do not just study particles that they find pretty No ecologist wants to study        the rich ecosystem that each of us carries around inside our gut because evolution has        programmed our brains to find bottomrelated matters disgusting I think it likely that        naturalists from a different planet silicon entities evolved under very different        circumstances would find tropical forests uninteresting mainly primary producers with        some herbivory and mutualisms and animal guts fascinating with their complex metabolic        networks in which each node is manned by different species with wildly varying means of        energy production        Our guts should be an ecological scientists dream come true ecological theatres that        are replicated billions of times which operate on a fast time scale and are easy to get        to If aliens are ecologists this would explain why they always probe their abductees        Many natural experiments are going on all the time as antibiotics and probiotics are        administered and people find all sorts of different ways voluntary or otherwise to        establish migration links between their gut ecologies Microbiologists are increasingly        interested in our guts from an ecological point of view but unlike ecologists they are        used to faeces from their work in sewage plants        Two thousand years ago the Roman senator Cicero noted the creation of barren desertlike        land in North Africa after the forests were felled for their timber providing the earliest        record of an ecosystem service provided by foreststhe stabilisation of soils Other        services provided by biodiversity readily come to mind like pollination and carrion        cleanup and there may be many more But perhaps the clearest example of an ecosystem        service provided by biodiversity comes from our gut Throughout our history until very        recently we all had worms In rich countries we have quite happily eradicated them from        our inner ecosystems with none of the handwringing we expend on rhinos But it is        increasingly believed that the loss of worms from our internal ecology is responsible for        the upsurge in inflammatory bowel disorders such as Crohns disease and colitis In fact        there are clinical trials underway in the United States testing the efficacy of worms as        treatment for these diseases The mechanism is clear worms trigger one arm of the immune        system which downregulates another inflammatory arm Our immune system has evolved to        expect a certain constellation of species in our gut in that context worms provide an        ecosystem service of balancing the immune system        Our perception of our impact on the planet as equivalent to a mass extinction simply        reflects the evolutionary prism through which we view life Of course we may yet live up        to our own publicity and pull off something apocalyptic like a runaway greenhouse that        sterilises the Earth But it is at least as likely that the microbial world resentful at        being either ignored or exterminated will come up with something to consign us to a        footnote in the history of life when it is ultimately written by the silicon entities The        Spanish flu SARS and HIV have just been early experiments
