 okay uh my favorite show is Masterpiece Theater and it has been for a long time but i feel almost ashamed to say that to anybody now because i ve never met anybody who likes it do you by any chance you do oh yes yes very much well wouldn t you know as a matter of fact i prefer public television uh huh and uh i have particularly enjoy the English comedies yeah and the English mysteries yeah i watch Mystery too um is is that what you re referring to okay yeah that is good i like uh do you read yes vociferously okay well that s the reason why i like both of those programs is because they re kind of based on books and the plots are more yes uh challenging you know than the sitcoms of regular TV well unfortunately for us at least here in the United States we the only access we have to that of course is public television yeah and i i m not a great television watcher in in any respect uh but uh the watching what i do watch is uh usually news and whatever is on public television uh any kind of i also uh am very fond of great performances in in that regard uh huh yeah me too but uh did you stay up late and catch this Red Dwarf oh that was a scream no uh no uh no as a matter of fact uh Turner Broadcasting uh huh has been uh broadcasting all of the James Bond movies really uh huh every night this week so i have concentrated on watching James Bond movies this week huh i used to like him too he was my hero in fact i like Sean Connery to this day well they re showing uh Live and Let Die at this moment and it is the first appearance of Roger Moore as 007 uh huh yeah yeah so it it oh he could never cut it no no that s true i was just thinking that today he well in some of the later movies he looks very effeminate in the early movies whereas uh Sean Connery has maintained the yeah yeah he does i how would you ruddy uh look uh but uh uh huh yeah i liked his accent too oh yes yes and he can even be in movies that are not uh uh sexually oriented and he still comes off great well you know he was uh when was it last year or year before last he was voted the sexiest actor in movies or something yes yeah he had my vote double i mean the man is sixty two years old if i don t care but uh otherwise you know we uh with you know PBS and so forth and i i particularly enjoy i don t know whether you ve whether you had a chance to watch it on PBS but uh uh huh the series uh Yes Minister uh what s that about that was about a the interior minister it was a comedy the interior minister of uh in England with the permanent secretary and bureaucracy and all that oh yes yes uh huh right i like i ve seen it several times it s a scream but i had to go to bed i have to get up and and work the next morning i wish they d put those that s why i say did you stay up late to watch this Red Dwarf it came on after Doctor Who on Saturday nights here at least um hum um hum and it s just of course i don t you know you really it was i don t think they should show it on during prime time but still yeah it was funny yeah i know well i i d i as i said i m not much of a television watcher i read as i said and uh quite a bit i i read about uh huh two or three novels a week yeah in addition to all the technical stuff what do what what do you do what kind of work do you do i m a payroll clerk just an accounting clerk at TI no uh i have a friend who works for TI and uh i work for a a tire service here in i m from Dallas oh i see um hum well the last two people who have called both worked for TI and i just wondered huh yeah yeah it could be TIers uh i think probably are participating more than anybody else but um hum i needed the money this is five bucks here yeah really do you work for TI i guess yeah i i guess we all can no no i work for GTE really how d you hear oh we re not even supposed to be talking about this though are we in Maryland yes well that i guess it it doesn t yeah how did i hear about it well i work you know they re gathering a database for voice processing and that s my field of of work also uh huh so i i know the people at TI who are doing this and i heard about it so i called them and ask if i could could participate and uh huh yeah you know sent in the forms etcetera and uh so forth huh right we could go back to television shows if you well you know speaking of public TV have you caught any of this series on the Bible yes i have i ve heard that it s really against the well i mean that it s coming out with the idea that the Bible s not true well no that s it you could interpret it that way uh uh huh i think what they re trying to say is that there is a great deal of historical truth but the interpretation that actually got into the um the writing of the Bible itself is probably uh after the what uh was it the King James Version when the committee uh huh uh did it wrote wrote the uh the or translation that so much was lost in the translation uh particularly since most of the translations most of the translations were from Greek yeah uh well for example uh in Greek there are seven different words for love right okay so you can have there s one word for love of your brother one word for love of your wife one ler word for you know love uh love of uh your father and that sort of thing so in those translations those types of interpretations uh really made a difference in how one might interpret the Bible now and what it says so that you know it s it you know you can look at it as though they are saying it s not true but there s too much historical uh huh fact involved just from the uh the histories that are that were developed around that time that are available huh to deny that at least you know the majority of it is true so you know you know it depends on how you look at it yeah you can look at it if you know if if you want to say that it s proving that it isn t true then you can you very much look at it that way i guess if you re looking for that you re yeah hey you could well you can interpret that the what the TV show in the same way you can interpret the Bible well uh so but uh uh huh really but uh i as as far as that goes i at we at we at least agree on you know on what we enjoy in that regard but uh yeah that s right i don t know if there s a there is a time limit on this so uh yeah surely we ve made it well it was nice talking to you okay you too bye bye i think so too all right well it s been very pleasant talking to you and have a good evening good night
