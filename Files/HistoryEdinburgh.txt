 A Brief History The city of Edinburgh grew up around the steep ragged cliff of the Castle Rock and its easily defended summit Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of habitation here as long ago as 900 b c Very little however is known about the Rock and its inhabitants in the centuries between its first occupation and the time of the MacAlpin kings A few shadowy details have been left to us by the Romans and by an epic poem from the seventh century Romans and Britons The Romans invaded Scotland in a d 78 84 where they met a fierce group called the Picts whom they drove north They consolidated their gains by building Antonine s Wall across the waist of Scotland between the Firth of Forth and the River Clyde in about a d 150 Roman legions encountered the strongholds of the Castle Rock and Arthur s Seat held by a tribe of ancient Britons known as the Votadini Little is recorded about this group but they were probably the ancestors of the Gododdin whose feats are told in a seventh century Old Welsh manuscript The capital of the Gododdin was Din Eidyn the Fort of Eidyn almost certainly the Castle Rock whose name lives on in the Edin of Edinburgh Din Eidyn fell to the Angles in 638 and became part of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria It was the first of many times that the Fort of Eidyn would change hands between the kingdoms of the north and the south The MacAlpin Kings Four distinct peoples once inhabited the land now known as Scotland the Picts in the north the Britons in the southwest the invading Angles in the southeast and the Scots in the west The Scots were Gaelic speaking immigrants from the north of Ireland Kenneth MacAlpin who ruled as king of Scots at Dunadd acquired the Pictish throne in 843 uniting Scotland north of the River Forth into a single kingdom He moved his capital along with the Stone of Destiny on which Scottish kings were crowned to the sacred Pict site of Scone close to Perth His great great great grandson Malcolm II 1005 1034 defeated the Angles at the Battle of Carham in 1018 and extended Scottish territory as far south as the River Tweed These new lands included the stronghold of Edinburgh Malcolm II s own grandson Malcolm Canmore 1058 1093 often visited Edinburgh with his wife Margaret a Saxon princess They crossed the Forth from Dunfermline at the narrows known to this day as Queensferry Margaret was a deeply pious woman who was subsequently canonized and her youngest son David I 1124 1153 founded a church in her name on the highest point of the Castle Rock St Margaret s Chapel David also founded the Abbey of Holyrood and created several royal burghs towns with special trading privileges including Edinburgh and Canongate the latter was under the jurisdiction of the monks or canons of Holyrood At this time Edinburgh was still a very modest town but David s successor Malcolm IV 1153 1165 made its castle his main residence By the end of the 12th century Edinburgh s castle was used as a royal treasury The town s High Street stretched beneath the castle along the ridge to the east today the Royal Mile past the parish church of St Giles and out to the Netherbow where Edinburgh ended and Canongate began Wars of Independence In 1286 the MacAlpin dynasty ended leaving Scotland without a ruler There were a number of claimants to the throne among them John Balliol Lord of Galloway and Robert de Brus Lord of Annandale The guardians of Scotland were unable to decide who should succeed and asked the English king Edward I to adjudicate Edward seeing this invitation as a chance to assert his claim as overlord of Scotland chose John Balliol whom he judged to be the weaker of the two Edward treated King John as a vassal However when Edward went to war with France in 1294 and summoned John along with other knights the Scottish king decided he had had enough He ignored Edward s summons and instead negotiated a treaty with the French king the beginning of a long association between France and Scotland that became known as the Auld Alliance Edward was furious and his reprisal was swift and bloody In 1296 he led a force of nearly 30 000 men into Scotland and captured the castles of Roxburgh Edinburgh and Stirling The Stone of Destiny and the Scottish crown jewels were stolen and Scotland s Great Seal was broken up Oaths of fealty were demanded from Scottish nobles while English officials were installed to oversee the running of the country Scotland became little more than an English county But the Scots did not take this insult lying down Bands of rebels such as those led by William Wallace began to attack the English garrisons and make raids into English territory When Wallace was captured the Scots looked for a new leader and discovered one in Robert the Bruce grandson of the Robert de Brus rejected by Edward in 1292 He was crowned King of Scots at Scone in 1306 and began his campaign to drive the English out of Scotland Edward I died in 1307 and was succeeded by his ineffectual son Edward II who in 1314 led an army of some 25 000 men to confront Bruce s army at Bannockburn near Stirling Though outnumbered the Scots gained a famous victory and sent the English packing Robert the Bruce continued to harass the English until they were forced to sue for peace A truce was declared and the Treaty of Northampton was negotiated at Edinburgh in 1328 Two of the recurring themes of Scottish history are minors inheriting the throne and divided loyalties Although many Scottish nobles were dedicated to the cause of independence others either bore grudges against the ruling king or held lands in England that they feared to lose These divisions later hardened by religious schism would forever deny Scotland a truly united voice When Robert the Bruce died in 1329 his son and heir David II was only five years old Within a few years the wars with England resumed aggravated by civil war at home as Edward Balliol son of John tried to take the Scottish throne with the help of the English king Edward III The Stewart Dynasty During these stormy years the castle of Edinburgh was occupied several times by English garrisons In 1341 it was taken from the English by William of Douglas The young David II returned from exile in France and made it his principal royal residence building a tower house David s Tower on the site of what is now the Half Moon Battery He died in 1371 and was succeeded by his nephew Robert II David s sister Marjory had married Walter the Steward and their son was the first of the long line of Stewart later spelled Stuart monarchs who would reign over Scotland and subsequently Great Britain until the Glorious Revolution of 1688 The strength and wealth of Scotland increased during the reigns of the first Stewart kings New castles were built and new weapons acquired including the famous gun called Mons Meg Edinburgh emerged as Scotland s main political center and was declared by James III 1460 1488 to be the principal burgh of our kingdom James IV 1488 1513 confirmed Edinburgh s status as the capital of Scotland by constructing a royal palace at Holyrood He cemented a peace treaty with England by marrying Margaret Tudor the daughter of Henry VII the so called Marriage of the Thistle and the Rose but this did not prevent him from making a raid into England in 1513 The attack culminated in the disastrous Battle of Flodden near the River Tweed and the king was killed Fearing invasion the Edinburgh town council built a protective wall the Flodden Wall around the city boundaries Yet again a minor the infant James V succeeded to the throne and Scots nobles were divided as to whether Scotland should draw closer to England or seek help from her old ally France The adult James leaned toward France and in 1537 took a French wife Mary of Guise She bore two sons who both died in infancy but by the time she was about to give birth to their third child her husband lay dying at Falkland Palace On 8 December 1542 a messenger arrived with news that the queen had produced a daughter at the palace of Linlithgow A few days later the king was dead leaving a week old baby girl to inherit the Scottish crown Mary Queen of Scots The baby was Mary Stuart who at the age of nine months was crowned Queen of Scots at the Chapel Royal Stirling When the news reached London Henry VIII saw his chance to subdue Scotland again and negotiated a marriage between the infant Mary and his son Edward The Scots refused and Henry sent an army rampaging through Scotland on a campaign known as the Rough Wooing The English king ordered his general to burn Edinburgh town so there may remain forever a perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon the Scots But more was at stake than simply Scotland s independence there was now a religious schism within Britain In order to divorce Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn Henry VIII had broken with Rome and brought the English church under his own control England was thus now a Protestant country caught between Catholic France and the Scots with their new Catholic queen The Scots themselves were divided many embracing Protestantism in the spirit of the Reformation while others remained staunchly Catholic However fear of the rampaging English army led the Scots again to seek help from their old allies in France and the young queen married the Dauphin Fran ois son of the French king Fran ois II became king of France in 1559 but died soon after In 1561 the 18 year old Mary returned to a Scotland in the grip of the Reformation as Protestant leaders had taken control of the Scottish parliament and abolished the authority of the pope Her Protestant cousin Elizabeth Tudor was on the English throne but Elizabeth the Virgin Queen had no heir Mary was next in line for the English crown and Elizabeth was suspicious of her intentions The six years of Mary s reign were turbulent ones She clashed early on with Edinburgh s famous Protestant reformer John Knox who held sway in St Giles but later adopted an uneasy policy of religious tolerance In 1565 she married her young cousin Henry Lord Darnley much to the chagrin of Elizabeth Darnley was a grandson of Margaret Tudor and thus also had a claim to the English throne On 19 June 1566 in the royal apartments in Edinburgh Castle Mary gave birth to a son Prince James Within a year however Darnley was murdered and Mary immediately immersed herself in controversy by marrying the Earl of Bothwell the chief suspect Mary was forcedto abdicate in 1567 and the infant prince was crowned as James VI Mary sought asylum in England only to be imprisoned by Elizabeth The English queen kept her cousin in captivity for 20 years and finally had her beheaded on a trumped up charge of treason So it was bitterly ironic when Elizabeth died without an heir and James Mary s Catholic son inherited the English throne In 1603 James VI of Scotland was thus crowned James I of England marking the Union of the Crowns Although Scotland was still a separate kingdom the two countries would from that day be ruled by the same monarch The Covenanters Edinburgh s population grew fast between 1500 and 1650 and a maze of tall unsanitary tenements sprouted along the spine of the High Street The castle was extended and in 1582 the Town s College the precursor of the University of Edinburgh was founded James died in 1625 succeeded by his son Charles I who proved an incompetent ruler In 1637 his attempt to force the Scottish Presbyterian Church to accept an English liturgy and the rule of bishops led to civil revolt and rioting The next year a large group of Scottish churchmen and nobles signed the National Covenant a declaration condemning the new liturgy and pledging allegiance to the Presbyterian faith The Covenanters as they were called at first sided with Oliver Cromwell s Parliamentarians in the civil war that had erupted across the border But when the English revolutionaries beheaded Charles I in 1649 the Scots rallied round his son Charles II Cromwell s forces then invaded Scotland crushed the Covenanter army and went on to take Edinburgh Scotland suffered ten years of military rule under Cromwell s Commonwealth Scotland s troubles continued after Charles II s restoration to the throne in 1660 The Covenanters faced severe persecution at the hands of the king s supporters who had decided to follow his father s policy of imposing bishops on the Scots Hundreds of Covenanters were imprisoned and executed In the end England underwent the Glorious Revolution of 1688 when Catholic James II Scotland s James VII was deposed and the Protestant William of Orange 1689 1702 took the British crown Presbyterianism was established as Scotland s official state church and the Covenanters prevailed Act of Union On 1 May 1707 England and Scotland were formally joined together by the Act of Union establishing the Union of Parliaments and the United Kingdom was born Despite the fact that Scotland was allowed to retain its own legal system education system and national Presbyterian Church the move was opposed by the great majority of Scots The supporters of the deposed James VII and his successors exiled in France were known as the Jacobites Several times during the next 40 years they attempted to restore the Stuart dynasty to the British throne though by this time the crown had passed to the German House of Hanover James Edward Stuart known as the Old Pretender traveled up the Firth of Forth in 1708 but was driven back by British ships and bad weather Another campaign was held in 1715 under the Jacobite Earl of Mar but it was the 1745 rising of Prince Charles Edward Stuart the Young Pretender which became the stuff of legend The prince known as Bonnie Prince Charlie the grandson of James VII raised an army of Jacobite highlanders and swept through Scotland They occupied Edinburgh but not the castle and defeated a government army at the Battle of Prestonpans In November of that year he invaded England capturing Carlisle and driving south as far as Derby only 200 km 130 miles short of London Finding his forces outnumbered and overextended here the young prince beat a tactical retreat but the English army hounded him relentlessly The final showdown at Culloden in 1746 saw the Jacobite army slaughtered Prince Charlie fled and was pursued over the Highlands before escaping in a French ship He died in Rome in 1788 disillusioned and drunk The Scottish Enlightenment The Jacobite uprisings found little support in such lowland cities as Edinburgh Here there was a growing sense that the Union was around to stay Within ten years of the Young Pretender s occupation of Holyrood Edinburgh s town council proposed a plan to relieve the chronic overcrowding of the Royal Mile tenements by constructing a New Town on land to the north of the castle In 1767 a design by a young and previously unknown architect James Craig was approved and work began This architectural renaissance in Edinburgh was followed by an intellectual flowering in the sciences philosophy and medicine that revolutionized Western society in the late 18th century and saw the city dubbed the Athens of the North Famous Edinburgh residents of this period later known as the Scottish Enlightenment included David Hume author of A Treatise of Human Nature and one of Britain s greatest philosophers Adam Smith author of The Wealth of Nations a pioneer in the study of political economy and Joseph Black the scientist who discovered the concept of latent heat Robert Burns s poems and Walter Scott s novels rekindled interest in Scotland s history and nationhood Scott especially worked hard to raise Scotland s profile The Modern City In the 19th century Edinburgh was swept up in the Industrial Revolution The coalfields of Lothian and Fife fueled the growth of baking distilling printing and machine making industries giving Edinburgh the epithet Auld Reekie Old Smoky With the arrival of the railways in the mid 1800s the city grew almost exponentially as new lines led to the spread of Victorian suburbs such as Marchmont and Morningside During the 20th century Edinburgh became a European center of learning and culture The University of Edinburgh has made outstanding contributions to various fields The Edinburgh International Festival held annually since 1947 is acknowledged as one of the world s most important arts festivals In addition the city s rich history and architecture have made it one of the most popular tourist destinations in the United Kingdom Nationalism never completely disappeared however and in the latter part of the century there has been a concerted though peaceful effort to gain self determination for Scotland In 1979 the nationalists were in disarray when a referendum was defeated and further efforts came to nought during Conservative rule in the British Parliament at Westminster through the 1980s and early 1990s But the Stone of Destiny was returned to Scottish soil in 1996 700 years after it had been taken south by the English The general election of May 1997 proved to be a turning point The British Labour Party supported the return of domestic policy making power to Scotland When it was victorious at the ballot box among the new government s first tasks was to organize a referendum on Scottish devolution This took place in September 1997 with the majority supporting the creation of a Scottish Parliament although many strident nationalists thought the proposals did not go far enough The Scotland Bill was put before the British Parliament in January 1998 and became law as the Scotland Act in November 1998 Political power thus returned to Edinburgh after nearly 300 years Elections were held in May 1999 and the new Parliament opened on the first of July The city now buzzes with energy and confidence as MPs and policy makers gather to make plans for the future of the Scottish people
