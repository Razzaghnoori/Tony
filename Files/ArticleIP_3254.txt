 Big and Stupid What the new monstrously budgeted Godzilla brings home is that size doesn t matter that tacky crudeness harnessed to a real vision can have more brute power than all the state of the art computer wizardry that Hollywood s money can buy This time the title titan is a devil visaged lizard who convincingly wrecks Manhattan lays a load of eggs that hatch velociraptor like little i e 9 foot dinosaurs and gets nailed on his way to Brooklyn by a coalition of scientists the military and the French secret service don t ask The movie directed and co written by Roland Emmerich the Teutonic schlockmeister who awed or stupefied the world with Independence Day 1996 isn t entirely lame The way the beast is finally snared has a certain architectural piquancy And sequences of the great lizard winding among skyscrapers as if they re hedges in a lawn maze his tail sheering off floors as it whips around corners have been engineered with bravura Otherwise size really is about all that this tedious underpopulated beanbag of an epic has going for it Its brain remains disproportionately teensy It s no big news that in the Japanese Godzilla or Gojira the creature played by a guy in a rubber suit stomping around a miniature Tokyo was a metaphor for the A bombs that leveled Hiroshima and Nagasaki Even in the American edit with Raymond Burr tacked on as a portentous reporter the aura of mourning was palpable Godzilla is the only cheesy disaster flick that feels as if it was made by people who d actually lived through some kind of horrific devastation And even after countless sequels of escalating silliness in which the monster became Japan s savior battling other mutant reptiles and space aliens and rescuing Japanese boys who d call out in laughably dubbed English Thanks Godzilla Come back soon Godzilla retained a nuclear haunted nobility I m not just endorsing retro chic when I say that the guy in the rubber suit is more fun For my money he s also scarier I don t want an anatomically correct Godzilla The original Godzilla is a dragon a mythical destroyer who s close in spirit to the Jewish legend of the Golem the colossal indestructible clay man summoned up out of all the dark forces of this world who can t be destroyed by any of this world s weapons The Godzilla who lumbers through a metropolis on two legs erect slowly crushing cars and knocking over buildings robotically training his radioactive breath on anything and everything he sees is a mythical vision of Armageddon The new down to earth Godzilla is much closer to the tyrannosaurus of Jurassic Park and to American giant monster pictures such as The Beast From 20 000 Fathoms He s almost never erect he stoops to incinerate He s supposed to be smart He can out swim torpedoes and dodge heat seeking missiles which take out the Chrysler Building among other man made wonders And just when people say Whew I think I lost him he pops out from some cunning hiding place and gobbles them down So why does he still strike me as a less than formidable opponent Well any forefather and given his reproductive capacities foremother of a new species that chooses to travel halfway around the globe to lay his eggs in the middle of Manhattan doesn t seem built to survive evolutionarily speaking Emmerich cribs his basic suspense techniques the low angle camera riding in on open mouthed spectators from Spielberg s Jaws and Jurassic Park his egg imagery from Alien his marauding baby dinosaurs from Gremlins and a scene of the U S Army striding through some South Seas devastation from Apocalypse Now What s uniquely his own is the way the havoc periodically grinds to a halt to make room for relationship scenes in which the characters maintain a soap opera obliviousness to everything crumbling skyscrapers fire breathing beasts but their feelings Oh yes there are human characters sort of Matthew Broderick that charmingly worried wise guy plays an expert in radioactive genetic mutations He stays heroically credible even as the film grows insanely incredible as when he has to pretend to outrun the rampaging 30 story Godzilla for half the length of Manhattan island in a tiny yellow cab The other performances are as crude as the writing although Hank Azaria brings terrific bonhomie to the part of a daredevil TV cameraman and the brilliant Harry Shearer doesn t entirely disgrace himself as a pompous anchorman As a member of Broderick s team the spiky forward redhead Vicki Lewis could have walked off with the picture if she hadn t been brushed aside in favor of a dumb blond aspiring TV reporter played by Maria Pitillo a sitcom actress who can t utter a line without the left side of her mouth curling up in Valley Girl incredulity or down in Valley Girl petulance Contrary to what you might have read or awaited hopefully Mayor Ebert and his contentious aide Siskel do not get squashed Which brings me to another well known critic Aristotle who at the dawn of Western drama deemed spectacle the medium s least important component It s true that cinema is a less cerebral form and that much of what Aristotle considered a thrilling night out would make us commit suicide out of boredom But if as a filmmaker you re going to make spectacle the top priority you d better show us stuff we ve never seen before You d better keep those miracles coming or we re apt to grow nostalgic rather quickly for the days of spaceships on wires and monsters in rubber suits
