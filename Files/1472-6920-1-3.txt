 Background Unfortunately most clinicians either do not seek evidence or ineffectively seek evidence 1 Practicing clinicians rarely search MEDLINE 2 and when they do they usually find half of the germane research that a medical librarian finds 3 Even librarians can only find evidence to answer half of the questions posed 4 As a result many clinicians are practicing with less than has been proved 5 To encourage evidence seeking students have been taught critical appraisal of medical research Regardless of the instructional format such as Journal Club research has demonstrated that this instruction does not increase medical students actual use of literature 6 7 We hypothesized that we could increase students frequency of searching for evidence by focusing on how to find evidence as well as how to appraise it We conducted two controlled trials to test this hypothesis In the first trial we taught students in the intervention group how to search for evidence as well as how to appraise evidence Prior to the second trial we created an Internet site SUMSearch http SUMSearch UTHSCSA edu 8 to automate finding evidence We taught how to appraise evidence and how to use SUMSearch to students in the intervention group Results were measured with questionnaires at the end of the study periods Materials and methods Subjects Subjects were third year medical students at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio During the medicine clerkship we taught the students how to find and appraise medical evidence We performed two quasirandomized controlled studies 1997 1998 and 1999 2000 For each trial we surveyed the entire class of approximately 200 third year medical students at 6 months after approximately half of the class had taken the course intervention group The remaining students comprised the control group Group assignment occurred in a quasirandomized manner At our institution students place themselves into 16 groups of 10 to12 members The Dean s Office combines these 16 groups into 8 larger groups in order to achieve similar distributions of gender ethnicity and academic performance The Dean s office randomly assigns medical students to a sequence of rotations A student from each group draws from a bowl a number that indicates the order of clerkship rotations Interventions 1997 1998 Trial We made four computers available to all students in key clinical locations Each computer provided the following software compatible with Microsoft Windows Scientific American Textbook of Medicine the Cochrane Library and Best Evidence MEDLINE was accessible with OVID Windows Client which was customized with search filters 9 The Internet access encouraged use of the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness DARE practice guidelines online journals and journal clubs The computers had a customized interface Figure 1 that displayed and organized these resources The interface which could not be removed offered context sensitive online help Additional File 1 lifelong hlp and tracked the usage of each resource We used the usage logs to guide enhancements to the interface Because we prioritized accessibility and the ability to log in rapidly we did not use usernames and passwords to track individual students We taught the intervention group students how to find and appraise medical evidence using the resources on these computers Table 1 File 1 Help file 1 lifelong hlp 855 KB This file provides the online help and contains the course content for the 1997 1998 study This file can be opened

Because of developments in the Internet we converted access to all resources to the Internet via the public address http Clinical UTHSCSA edu This allowed access from home and hospital networks and easier maintenance We replaced the Windows interface on our clinical computers with a customized Internet browser whose home page was this Internet address We had observed during the first trial that searching for evidence even after instruction was still very difficult for students Because searching for medical evidence can follow an algorithm we created SUMSearch http SUMSearch UTHSCSA edu an Internet site that automates searching for medical evidence 8 SUMSearch searches for medical evidence at high quality Internet sites including DARE National Guideline Clearinghouse and PubMed SUMSearch searches PubMed with four different strategies Three strategies are for finding systematic reviews practice guidelines and traditional review articles and the fourth will find original research using validated search filters 8 In addition SUMSearch automatically reformats and re executes the search for original research multiple times until the best possible results are found Based on feedback from students between studies during the 1998 1999 academic year we also changed our educational intervention We reduced instruction on each individual resource but we increased instruction on SUMSearch Table 1 At the same time as our second trial the Department of Family Medicine was also teaching an evidence based course in their clerkship Thus half of the students who had been on the Family Medicine rotation during the first half of the year received that intervention The Family Medicine intervention consisted of three 90 minute sessions that taught how to frame clinical questions search for evidence and critically appraise evidence A comparison of the two courses indicated that the Internal Medicine course focused on how to find evidence while the Family Medicine course focused on how to appraise evidence Outcomes The principal outcomes were self report of search frequency satisfaction with results and satisfaction with speed of searching We queried these principal outcomes identically in both trials We also asked in the second trial whether search frequency influenced patient care In both trials we assessed retention of content although we do not report these results at this time For both trials surveys were administered at 6 months after half of the students in the third year class had taken the course The median time between completion of the course and administration of the questionnaires was 3 months for students in the intervention groups Analyses Principal outcomes measuring search frequencies and influence from searching were dichotomized into at least once a week and less often or no answer Outcomes measuring satisfaction were dichotomized into being satisfied with more than half of search and less often or no answer Questionnaires were analyzed by intervention and control group We tested significance with the two tailed Chi square test In the second trial we performed a Mantel Haenszel analysis to quantify the independent contributions of the Internal Medicine and Family Medicine courses on the outcomes 10 Results 1997 1998 study Of 207 third year medical students in the first trial 167 81 students completed the year end questionnaire 63 62 of 102 students who had attended the course and 87 83 of 105 who had not We excluded 17 incomplete questionnaires Table 2summarizes their self reported behaviors The intervention and control groups did not differ significantly in self report of frequency of literature searches 20 and 17 respectively satisfaction with quality of results 32 and 28 respectively and satisfaction with speed of searching 24 and 17 respectively B 1999 2000 study Of 205 third year medical students in the second trial 157 77 students completed the questionnaire of which 90 87 of 104 students had completed their medicine clerkship and 67 66 of 101 students had not Of the students with missing results 24 were on one rotation that we could not access during the survey period These 24 students had been randomly assigned to a sequence of rotations that placed both their Internal Medicine and Family Medicine rotations in the latter part of the year and thus the control group contains more missing data Similar to the results of the first study there were no significant differences in self reported habits between the two groups We detected an insignificant trend for control group students to search more and be more satisfied with quality and speed of their searches Lastly we stratified the analysis by whether students had received both courses one course or no course No combined impact was detected on frequency of searching or satisfaction with searching The only significant finding was self report of being influenced by a literature search Mantel Haenszel analysis confirmed that this effect was attributable to the Family Medicine course even though the Family Medicine course was not associated with increased search frequency Comparing the two studies Among all students the self report of frequent searching and satisfaction with results significantly increased from the 1997 1998 to the 1999 2000 study Table 2 Searching once a week or more increased from 18 of all students in the first study to 44 of all students in the second study Students were more satisfied with their results 47 than with speed 27 of their searches Satisfaction with speed of searches did not increase Power analysis In the 1997 1998 study the intervention group was smaller 60 students In the 1999 2000 study the control group was smaller 67 students Both studies had approximately an 80 chance of detecting a 20 absolute difference between the intervention and control groups 11 There were 60 non responders in the 1997 1998 study Among these students if all 42 students in the intervention groups and none of the 18 control group students had actually become frequent searchers the prevalence of frequent searchers would have been 53 and 14 respectively This result and a similar reanalysis of the 1999 2000 would have been statistically significant Discussion Neither of the two Internal Medicine courses nor the 1999 2000 Internal Medicine course in conjunction with the Family Medicine course increased the self report of search frequency Despite teaching both searching for and appraising evidence our results are consistent with the negative impact of journal clubs 6 7 Possibly students lack time to search for evidence In both study years students were less satisfied with the speed of their searches than the results of their searches Although all students reported increased searching and satisfaction with in 1999 2000 our courses had no impact In addition it is doubtful that the SUMSearch Internet site which was taught only to the intervention students but available to all students was responsible Search frequency increased more in the control than the intervention groups 31 and 18 respectively Search frequency increased most in 1999 2000 when the control group again reported more frequent searching than the intervention group 48 and 38 respectively Although search frequency increased the quality of students medical searches was unclear Other studies have reported the apparent satisfaction of novice searchers with searches of uncertain quality 3 12 Moreover clinicians demonstrated satisfaction with their searches even though librarians who later replicated the searches found twice as many relevant studies and half as many irrelevant studies 3 Our power analysis reveals that we might have missed a positive result if all non responders had answered in a way to favor an intervention effect However we believe that non response more likely indicated reluctance to report infrequent literature searching In the second study logistical reasons prevented us from surveying all 24 students on one rotation in the control study In the first study all students were surveyed in one large room at the same time however fewer students in the intervention group completed their questionnaire We believe that students who adopted our teachings and became frequent searchers after our course were unlikely to sit in the room and not complete the questionnaire Therefore we believe that having better response rates would not reveal a positive effect but rather would make the results even more negative in the first study Published recommendations vary on how to best search for evidence in order to practice evidence based medicine First some authors recommend using Best Evidence at the beginning of a search 13 We taught the use of Best Evidence during the first trial Table 1 but not during the second study since we had informally observed that Best Evidence less often provided answers Second others encourage searching of the Cochrane Library We discontinued teaching this strategy before our studies because the Cochrane Library addresses only selected therapeutic questions Instead we taught the use of the Internet site of the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness DARE DARE contains succinct summaries of Cochrane reviews and high quality systematic reviews from other sources that address diagnostic and therapeutic questions We also recommended searching MEDLINE for additional systematic reviews and the National Guidelines Clearinghouse for selected practice guidelines based on systematic literature review e g United States Preventive Services Task Force and Canadian Task Force for Preventive Health Care Third some experts advocate not searching MEDLINE due to the difficulties in searching it 13 Because very recently published original studies may not be included in systematic reviews or secondary publications we taught and automated with SUMSearch the use of PubMed to search MEDLINE and PreMEDLINE for recent studies Neither our intervention that taught and automated one strategy 14 nor the intervention by Family Medicine which recommended another strategy using Best Evidence and the Cochrane Library 13 influenced search frequency or satisfaction We propose two explanations for why our interventions failed First students lacked sufficient time to seek evidence Studies suggest that a wide gap exists between the 2 minutes clinicians typically allot to seeking evidence 2 and the amount of time needed to search MEDLINE 4 12 13 Indeed some have likened MEDLINE searching to attempting to drink water from a fire hose 15 Although MEDLINE is certainly more difficult to search than other resources recommended for evidence based medicine the other resources in aggregate probably require excessive time to search if they are searched in sequence as recommended Even though SUMSearch automated searching of MEDLINE and other resources for evidence based medicine generally students were dissatisfied with the speed of searches Table 2 Second our search strategy like the other existing search strategies requires clinicians to spend time comparing and contrasting individual documents All strategies recommend starting a search by seeking individual documents whether the document is a study a secondary publication of a single study or a systematic review Although efficient when a recent well done systematic review captures all the relevant studies this strategy is burdensome when the results of trials or systematic reviews are contradictory or when original studies have been published since the last systematic review To be sure a single study may not adequately address a clinical question 16 17 Admittedly our course might have increased search frequency by students if the instruction had been integrated across all the clerkships and linked to students clinical duties However even with course improvements we might have achieved success in teaching a technique that is too cumbersome to use during clinical care That is the technique may require more time than students will have when they enter practice Further research and development of more efficient strategies for seeking medical evidence are needed Haynes recently questioned Is it time to change how you seek best evidence and proposed that we first seek evidence in resources such as UpToDate Scientific American or Clinical Evidence 18 These systematic textbooks contain summaries of medical evidence are reliably updated and are well referenced with links to the abstracts of references Our negative study supports this idea as it may reduce the need to search for and appraise individual studies and systematic reviews Thus a proposed strategy is to search a systematic textbook first and then use an automated meta search engine to seek evidence published since the literature search of the systematic textbook However research is needed to assess the validity of the content of systematic textbooks In addition research is needed to quantify how up to date are these resources Conclusion Exposure to two courses within one academic year and the use of automated searching did not increase students self report of frequency of seeking medical evidence While we recognize the importance of students understanding how medical evidence is found and appraised we are concerned that students lack the time to search for original research and will have even less time when they enter medical practice We encourage innovations in evidence based medicine that will reduce the time needed to search for medical evidence The two trials in this report were separately reported at the American Association of Medical Colleges Group on Educational Affairs Society of Directors of Research in Medical Education San Antonio Texas 1 31 2000 and Clerkship Directors in Internal Medicine Annual Meeting Denver Colorado 9 98
