United States Senate The Honorable Thomas J Bliley Jr Chairman The Honorable John D Dingell Ranking Minority Member Committee on Commerce House of Representatives Subject Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration Medical Devices Current Good Manufacturing Practice CGMP Final Rule Quality System Regulation Pursuant to section 801 a 2 A of title 5 United States Code this is our report on a major rule promulgated by Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration entitled Medical Devices Current Good Manufacturing Practice CGMP Final Rule Quality System Regulation RIN 0910 AA09 We received the rule on October 11 1996 It was published in the Federal Register as a final rule on October 7 1996 61 Fed Reg 52601 The final rule revises existing current good manufacturing practice requirements for medical devices and incorporates them into a quality system regulation The quality system regulation includes requirements related to the methods used in and the facilities and controls used for designing manufacturing packaging labeling storing installing and servicing of medical devices intended for human use The rule adds preproduction design controls and is intended to achieve consistency with quality system requirements worldwide GAO OGC 97 3 Enclosed is our assessment of the Food and Drug Administration s compliance with the procedural steps required by sections 801 a 1 B i through iv of title 5 with respect to the rule Our review indicates that the Food and Drug Administration complied with the applicable requirements If you have any questions about this report please contact James Vickers Senior Attorney at 202 512 8210 The official responsible for GAO evaluation work relating to the Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration is Thomas E Slomba Assistant Director Mr Slomba can be reached at 202 512 9910 Robert P Murphy General Counsel Enclosure cc The Honorable Donna E Shalala The Secretary of Health and Human Services Page 2 GAO OGC 97 3 ENCLOSURE ANALYSIS UNDER 5 U S C 801 a 1 B i iv OF A MAJOR RULE ISSUED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION ENTITLED MEDICAL DEVICES CURRENT GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICE CGMP FINAL RULE QUALITY SYSTEM REGULATION RIN 0910 AA09 i Cost benefit analysis The Food and Drug Administration FDA performed a cost and benefit analysis evaluating the economic impact of the final rule The estimated total annual incremental cost to the industry is 81 9 million The majority of the costs 57 5 million represent the establishment of design controls for new products Most of the remaining costs are attributable to extending the quality system and requiring appropriate documentation evaluating suppliers and contractors and management review The benefits to the public health are estimated to be 36 to 44 fewer deaths per year and 484 to 677 fewer serious injuries per year attributable to design related device failures FDA assumed an economic value of 5 million per fatality avoided so that the monetary savings per year would be 180 to 220 million per year These figures do not include any monetary savings associated with the reduction in serious injuries Additionally the FDA states that the rule will result in fewer product recalls and better product quality Finally since the final rule is designed to harmonize with the international standards device manufacturers will not have to maintain two different quality systems to compete both nationally and internationally ii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 U S C 603 605 607 and 609 The FDA has concluded that the rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because almost all medical device establishments are classified as small under the Small Business Administration s definition of size An initial regulatory flexibility analysis and a final regulatory flexibility analysis have been prepared and included in the preambles to the proposed rule and the final rule notice respectively as required by sections 603 and 604 The analyses comply with the informational requirements of the sections GAO OGC 97 3 including the classes of small entities subject to the rule and alternatives considered to reduce the burden on the small entities The FDA in drafting the rule to ease the burden on small entities has not applied the design requirements to all Class I devices and component suppliers have been removed from the rule s coverage Also the requirement for traceability of components has been limited to where the agency believes it is necessary to protect the public health In addition other revisions were made to make the final rule less prescriptive and to allow establishments greater flexibility in meeting the requirements Finally the FDA will conduct workshops issue guidance manuals and videotapes and hold teleconferences to aid small entities in complying with the rule The analyses use both quantifiable and general descriptions of the effects of the rule on small entities as required by section 607 and numerous small entities participated in the rulemaking as required by section 609 by submitting comments on the proposed rule and by attending an open public meeting in August 1995 and the September 1995 meeting of the Good Manufacturing Practice Advisory Committee iii Agency actions relevant to sections 202 205 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 2 U S C 1532 1535 The FDA examined the final rule as prescribed by the Act and found that no mandate will be imposed on State local or tribal governments and it believes that the burden on the private sector will be below the 100 million annual expenditure level to require compliance with the Act However while the cost estimated by the FDA on the private sector is 81 9 million in view of the uncertainties in the estimates FDA has followed the requirements of the Act As required by section 205 FDA considered regulatory alternatives to the requirements of the rule but determined that the provisions of the final rule constituted the most cost effective and least burdensome alternative that would meet the objective of the rule To ease the regulatory burden the FDA has extended the effective date of the rule to June 1 1997 and will not take regulatory action for an additional year on the design control requirement Also FDA exempted almost all Class I devices However FDA rejected suggestions that low risk devices be exempted because the cost of implementation will exceed the public health benefits gained FDA found that all Class II and III devices even those devices from firms with excellent past records should be covered because their failure could adversely affect public health Page 2 GAO OGC 97 3 iv Other relevant information or requirements under Acts and Executive orders Administrative Procedure Act 5 U S C 551 et seq The rule was promulgated using the notice and comment procedures of 5 U S C 553 and the procedures contained at 21 U S C 360j f 3 concerning the establishment of an advisory committee to advise and submit recommendations to the Secretary regarding regulations concerning good manufacturing practices Meetings of the Device Good Manufacturing Practice Advisory Committee GMP Advisory Committee were announced by Federal Register publication on April 25 1990 55 Fed Reg 17502 and April 17 1991 56 Fed Reg 15626 An advance notice of proposed rulemaking was published on June 15 1990 55 Fed Reg 24544 and the proposed rule was published in the Federal Register on November 23 1993 58 Fed Reg 61952 soliciting comments from the public In addition various papers and working drafts of the rule were made available to the public and an open public meeting on the rule was held The preamble to the final rule discusses the comments which were received and the changes which were made to the rule based on such comments Paperwork Reduction Act 44 U S C 3501 3520 The final rule contains information collections that are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget and include device master records device history records quality system records and complaint files The FDA solicited comments on these requirements in the notice of proposed rulemaking and has evaluated and responded to them in the preamble to the final rule The preamble to the final rule contains an explanation of the need for the information and the burden estimates relating to each section of the rule The information collections associated with the final rule contain 3 527 901 burden hours which include 1 433 579 burden hours for a one time start up expenditure for 7 237 manufacturers and 2 094 321 burden hours expended annually by 7 237 manufacturers The FDA solicits comments on the information collections contained in the final rule until December 6 1996 regarding the necessity of the collection the estimate of the burden hours and ways to minimize the burden including electronic submission of responses After receipt of these comments FDA will publish a notice in the Federal Register when the agency is submitting the collections to OMB for approval and again when OMB makes a decision on approval modification or disapproval The information collections in the rule will not become effective until OMB approval is obtained and an OMB control number has been issued Page 3 GAO OGC 97 3 Statutory authorization for the rule The Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 Pub L 101 629 November 28 1990 amended section 520 f of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act providing the FDA with the authority to add preproduction design controls to the Current Good Manufacturing Practices regulation 21 U S C 360j f 1 A Executive Order No 12866 The rule was determined to be an economically significant regulatory action under Executive Order No 12866 requiring review by the Office of Management and Budget Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs OIRA OIRA approved the final rule as complying with the requirements of the Order based on information supplied by the FDA including a planned regulatory action document describing the reason for the rule and an assessment of the costs and budgetary impact of the rule Executive Order No 12875 Intergovernmental Partnership The FDA has reviewed the rule under Executive Order No 12875 and finds that the Order does not apply because the rule is not applicable to government facilities but to finished device manufacturers However regarding consultation with State local and tribal governments the FDA notes that there were two state government representatives who were members of the Good Manufacturing Practices Advisory Committee in 1995 which explored the need to revise the Current Good Manufacturing Practices regulation Page 4 GAO OGC 97 3
