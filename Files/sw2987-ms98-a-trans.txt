                do you use your credit cards very often   um no not really we use gas cards more than anything   okay is that just out of habit or convenience   uh basically convenience   uhhuh   uh which led to habit i guess   okay i dont use gasoline credit cards i used to have one but i didnt use it uh i used it so seldom that id get letters from Mobil uh reminding me that i had a credit card to use   oh really yeah we dont we dont ever we dont carry a whole lot of cash with us so we use the the gas cards because our families are both out of town and like when we travel and stuff we use the gas cards   right so you basically use them as an alternative to carrying cash   yeah yeah and then we have a an American Express thats through TI that Steve uses just for TI stuff   are you uh solicited a lot uh for other uh credit cards   yes yes a lot   what what uh criteria do you consider on whether or not youll accept a particular card   uh probably the uh uh if theres a premium each year and the uh the APR   yeah i wont get a card if theres an annual fee   and theres its its kind of hard to beat TI   right   and so uh you know usually we just trash it just tear it up and trash it and most most of the time it goes unopened   yeah i i i think that Texans is charging thirteen point nine percent uh interest   yeah if if that much theyre thirteen something but im not sure if its i think its a flat thirteen right now   it could be could be i dont uh use them often enough to even keep tabs on it   yeah   but most of them charge between eighteen and twenty one percent per year   yeah   i think thats   and then youre then youre if youre that lucky you get to pay them another twenty five bucks a year just to be that privileged to get twenty one percent a year   right right and i look for a grace period too so that they dont charge interest on from from the day of purchase   yeah yeah   and of course no annual fee   yeah that would that would help a lot i im not even sure why i mean the purpose of an annual fee im not really   well i i think it just generates revenue for the companies that uh for the banks that sponsor the credit cards   well i guess so because its not any more prestigious to have to pay it uh as far as getting another card where you dont i mean you know   no uh i get uh applications for cards from oh different places for various reasons uh i got an application from Home Depot for their card   oh really   and uh the incentive there was that theyd give you ten percent off on your first purchase with that credit card   yeah   so i got that card just so i could uh make a major purchase   have ten percent off but you got to use that credit card   right and get a discount on it   right yeah that   i did did the same thing with uh Foleys they uh uh had a fifteen percent discount on a purchase if you just apply for a card   yeah right i did that with my husband uh he was off working at TI in Austin one day and so i went out to the mall to kind of look around and hit Mervyns and found some stuff stuff after Christmas on sale and ended up getting fifteen percent off already off of it already whatever it was lower and i think thats the only card i have thats   yeah uhhuh   you know recently is gotten a Mervyns card and i used it for i think for the first time when i was in Houston this weekend and i have ive had it for months   yeah yeah i always maintain a zero balance uh i dont like owing anybody anything   yeah yeah i dont i dont like it a whole lot either   if you want to borrow money therere better ways to do it uh i think you can get a loan through the credit union for about uh oh i dont know nine or ten percent now i guess   yeah yeah   and uh keeping a credit cards uh charged up is just uh not a very good way to uh to make to make use of borrowing money   yeah i never understood how people could i mean there are some people who say well i cant charge it its at its limit and i thought God how can you charge a credit card to its limit it just it just i guess its that that you know lack of discipline when you have a piece of plastic that says pay later you know   yeah its the buy now pay later plan and uh live for today   yeah and i just its that yeah it just borrow worry about it tomorrow   nobody bothers saving any money   yeah and it just i dont i dont really go for them and i in fact i had my own before we got married and ended up cutting them up just for the fact that TI had lower rates   yeah sure   you know and decided and i mean when i tried to close with Chase Manhattan it was just like pulling teeth   oh yeah   i mean i couldnt close theyd send me a statement every little this is your new you know balance with bonus points or whatever you know and its like look i closed this months ago and i dont want any more of your letters i dont want anything and well you have a credit balance well send me a check  you know     right yeah well theres a a basic problem too with not using credit cards that they are good credit references when i closed on my house mortgage uh the mortgage company was looking for uh references credit references and i didnt have any credit cards charged up at all i keep the balance paid off so they make lousy credit reference then   yeah yeah yeah yeah they do but we we were in in that same boat a couple of years ago and they had said well just list your major ones and and the balance still owed on it you know or give it a balance still owed on it and   right   thats all we did   when the balance is zero it doesnt help much   right   i get a lot of uh pre approved applications from various organizations and i throw all those out   yeah and its like well who are you to approve  something for me without my permission anyway   right   but i think um i think what you can do as far as i dont think as many companies when you are a good customer i dont think they report that as much as they should their delinquent customers   right uhhuh   because a lot of times you have to write a nd ask them to report it to the credit bureau so that you look like you have good credit as far as you know paying off you know your cards early or on time or whatever   yeah uhhuh   that usually doesnt happen unless ive heard people say well you have to write to ask that and i say well you know if someones so quick to turn you over because youre thirty days late   umhum   i think they should they should do do that more often   yeah i think youre right uh   what do you think about that uh Discover card   i well uh  funny thing about the Discover card is i just pulled a uh one dollar check from them out of my briefcase today that expired uh last month i didnt cash it       uh they they sent me a dollar uh refund from last years purchase i i used it one time   oh really   and uh i got a dollar credit a dollar check but i didnt uh cash the check and the check expired but on my last statement i noticed that they credited my account with a dollar credit   the dollar you didnt cash   could very well be   oh oh well i was wondering how that that worked because its like you know well pay you for and im going wait a minute you know   ive got so many uh well i dont have a lot of cards but ive got a lot that i never used uh i stick basically with uh the Texans MasterCard and uh very seldom use the American Express card   yeah we dont we wouldnt even have one if it wasnt for TI and Steve traveling we just   sure corporate card   you know   i would never pay thirty five dollars or more a year for uh use of a card   no and uh we basically just have the we you know we cut up a lot of cards when we you know like its just as easy just to use two you know instead of paying so much
