 The Ms Makeover To call Ms a Media Event sounds less invidious than obvious Isn t that what all journalism is by definition and what even serious activism aspires to nowadays Most single issue magazines can only dream about the eye catching niche that Gloria Steinem and her fellow editors carved out for America s first glossy feminist publication 25 years ago With the glamorous Steinem at its helm and intermittently on its cover Ms was just the promotional vehicle the feminist movement needed to go mainstream But Inside Ms as you might expect of an authorized account of the magazine prefers to think of it as a Historic Event Mary Thom is herself a staff veteran who arrived as a researcher at the very start and went on to serve as executive editor under Editor in Chief Robin Morgan in the 1990s Thom touts her reliance on oral histories of many founders and long time staff members It is clear that she aspires to a down in the trenches record of a pioneering endeavor that in her opinion transcended the ordinary boundaries of journalism As such Thom requires unconventional characters daunting circumstances and heroic goals all of which she does her best to supply Hence Gloria Steinem one among a large cast of path breakers struggling to fulfill an unorthodox dream Hence the many pages devoted to the uphill battles on the business end Unsurprisingly bold determination prevailed and a new kind of magazine was born Ms seems more like a social movement than a national magazine Thom writes The offices were both a publishing enterprise and a center for activism Ms represent ed a state of mind Ms was a feminist mecca A flood of visitors were eagerly greeted and vetted as potential recruits to the cause Funds flowed out from the coffers of the Ms Foundation for Women giving fledgling feminist projects the boost they needed Such an epic saga of political activism may have been what Thom meant to write but soon enough she settles down into the blander form of the press release Hers is not the book to read for a serious assessment of the ideas in the many articles she makes sure to mention by author Her former colleagues she is well aware will head straight for the index She rehearses the main criticisms leveled against the magazine that it was politically conventional emphasizing male dominated electoral politics and skirting controversy that it was sentimental about sisterhood forever holding up individual women as inspirational role models But her reply to the critics consists of providing an exception or two to each of the complaints and then moving swiftly on She dutifully describes the big dramas that got Ms editors all riled up the crusade for and defeat of the ERA the smear campaign in 1975 by the radical Redstockings who attacked Steinem for work she d done a decade earlier on behalf of a liberal cause that had CIA backing the nationwide women s conference in Houston in 1977 What may have been the larger philosophical questions behind these contretemps Here is Thom s idea of an answer Then as today feminism was not an ideology set in stone but rather an adaptable set of attitudes and beliefs And yet bromidic and blurry though this public relations job is it is in its way not inaccurate For Steinem never was an editor of the sharp analytic variety she was a repackager Her aim was not to subvert the women s magazine but to give it a makeover to translate feminism into something familiar to the middle class Go back and reread the Ms of the 1970s and you rediscover how psychological how to ism for women at home became consciousness raising for women newly out in the world Confessional narrative became first person testimonial about the choices and changes in women s lives In the coping with children department the message changed from advice to mothers on say avoiding martyr complexes to advice on lobbying for child care and avoiding gender stereotypes with sons and daughters Soft focus messages about sexuality the importance of pleasing your man became pointed discussion of abortion rights and the myth of the vaginal orgasm By the 1980s the positions had grown predictable Ms was pro abortion pro day care pro ERA pro welfare rights pro clitoral orgasm But it is no small tribute to Ms that most of the issues it raised over the years are still around Ms was among the first women s magazines to run pieces about sexual harassment spousal abuse breast implants the economic impact of divorce all based on real reporting The formula was not original and didn t pretend to be soft personal stories plus hard facts with some prescriptions for action It was service journalism and its depth and quality were uneven as it generally is with service journalism Ms also relied a great deal on book excerpts hardly a sign of bold editorial entrepreneurship As for Ms political coverage crusades heavy on symbolism preoccupied the staff through the 1970s the ERA the Houston conference If the magazine followed electoral politics a little doggedly it participated in gestural politics a little overenthusiastically In Cracking the Women s Movement Protection Game in 1978 a staff writer was honest enough to acknowledge the journalistic and political pitfalls of such boosterism She had puffed pro ERA forces although they were in complete disarray Ms radical critics were right It was not in the business of making sustained ideological arguments or issuing eccentric polemics Few distinctive writers emerged from the magazine though over the years many contributed to it From the choice of name onward Ms real specialty was promotion above all of a usable salable symbolism It probably didn t hurt this larger endeavor that fellow founding editor Letty Cottin Pogrebin the author of How to Make It in a Man s World 1970 had a career as a high powered publicist behind her But it was Steinem s inspirational role at Ms that was the model for Ms role with its readers She was not a theorist She was an icon a catalyst plugged in to American women via the lecture circuit and to establishment men such as boyfriends Mike Nichols and Mortimer Zuckerman via the social circuit It s fitting then that Thom perks up whenever she s describing a party a gala a television show a promotional tour This was the true Ms state of mind and there were many such events to boast about The premier issue in the spring of 1972 got a plug from The David Frost Show on which Steinem and others appeared Then there was a big party at the New York Public Library to celebrate The next year the magazine s own birthday was the occasion of larger gatherings several of them aboard a chartered Circle Line boat Everything we did one member of the staff recalled got a tremendous amount of attention It would all sound narcissistically frivolous were it not so earnest And so ineffective financially the magazine was all but broke from the start and stayed that way In the 1980s The New Ms which had been granted not for profit educational status launched a campus issue to attract younger readers but a hectically busy Steinem was devoting less editorial energy to the magazine and it showed You can sense a magazine s desperation when it tries to generate hoopla on both its 10 th and 15 th anniversaries In the 1990s after being sold and resold Ms lost its spark but it still carries on Its covers are as flashy as ever though an arid cleanliness reigns within it resembles nothing so much as an alumnae magazine Ms has been ad free since 1990 Inside the current issue you will find what else an excerpt from Inside Ms On this 25 th anniversary there is no gala Instead there s a book that reads like a genteel obituary
