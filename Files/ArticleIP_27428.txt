 EM Glasnost EM in Iraq The German daily Die Welt reported strong irritation in Bonn over the arrangements for President Clinton s visit to Germany It quoted a source in Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder s office as saying We must make it clear to the Americans who the host is here The paper said in a front page report that as late as Tuesday afternoon Washington still hasn t provided Bonn with a proper presidential timetable Government spokesman Uwe Karsten Heye has frequently used the word chaos to describe the situation the paper said Die Welt s main lead was about the German government s decision to send 1 000 more troops to Albania to help with humanitarian relief Most British papers led Wednesday with a sudden volte face by the British government on the number of Kosovo refugees Britain would accept After being criticized especially by the Germans for only accepting 330 refugees so far compared with the 10 000 now in Germany 5 800 in Turkey 2 354 in France and 2 166 in Norway the government announced Tuesday that from now on about 1 000 refugees a week would be flown to Britain from the Balkans The conservative Daily Telegraph called the decision overdue the liberal Guardian said the government s response to the refugee crisis has been slow and niggardly But the Guardian s front page lead headlined The Terror of the Twisters was about the tornadoes in Oklahoma and Kansas The refugee crisis also dominated the main Italian papers which led Wednesday with the news that Italy has decided to take in another 10 000 refugees from the overcrowded camps in Macedonia To prevent them dispersing throughout the Italian peninsula 5 000 of them would be sheltered at the former U S cruise missile base of Comiso in Sicily La Stampa of Turin reported Bad has been turned into good the paper commented on its front page The instruments of death have been replaced by ones of survival La Repubblica of Rome published a brief front page comment by Nadine Gordimer the Nobel Prize winning South African novelist deploring the NATO offensive because it doesn t bring a solution to the horrors committed by Milosevic But the terrifying aspect of the problem is that so many of us who believe this don t have any other solution to propose she added All the French papers led not on Kosovo but on a domestic political crisis resulting from the jailing for the first time in French history of a prefect provincial governor in Corsica The prefect Bernard Bonnet who was sent to Napoleon s island by the socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin to impose law and order on unruly Corsican nationalists is alleged to have ordered his police force to burn down a beach restaurant as an example to them Now France s Parliament wants to know how much if anything Jospin knew about this illegal act The Spanish papers led on a politically controversial decision by the Spanish government to commit ground troops to join an eventual NATO invasion of Serbia El Mundo s second front page story was about the German couple killed by three tigers in a safari park in Alicante The man had his throat torn out and the woman was decapitated In Israel Ha aretz led Wednesday with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat s decision to postpone the declaration of a Palestinian state It also noted his riducle of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s election claim that this was his government s achievement Netanyahu has no doubt in his mind that the sole causes of this outcome were the pressures and threats that Israel applied to Arafat and the crude hints about the possibility of annexing territories or re occupying them the paper said in an editorial But it pointed out that Arafat had merely postponed the declaration and that meanwhile he had won broad international support for the principle of Palestinian statehood He has surpassed Netanyahu in status at the White House the editorial said while Europe stands united behind him and the Arab states are only waiting for the signal to send official representatives to the Palestinian state Some Arab papers have been telling of glasnost in Iraq with Saddam Hussein reportedly easing government restrictions on freedom of expression and political opposition According to a piece in Monday s edition of the Pan Arab paper al Quds al Arabi Saddam has approved a number of specific political and security measures to tackle the political and social frustrations caused by nearly nine years of U N sanctions These included a new law on political pluralism passed recently by the National Assembly which would allow certain active political groups to hold meetings and form new political parties Another was the decision to show various degrees of tolerance toward public criticism of the Iraqi government The article was written by al Quds al Arabi s Amman correspondent Bassam Badareeen who reported from Baghdad last week that ordinary Iraqis were becoming more openly critical of the authorities without apparently fearing retribution by the secret police Tuesday Le Monde of Paris devoted its front page lead and its one editorial to the first decline in 15 years of the power and influence of the French extreme right An opinion poll conducted for the newspaper showed that a recent split between the right wing leaders Bruno M gret and Jean Marie Le Pen has greatly reduced their popular appeal Support for Le Pen s ideas has fallen to 11 percent from 20 percent a year ago The editorial said the bitter battle between the two men has totally destabilized their followers who have been raised in the cult of the leader It has also opened the public s eyes to the true nature of these leaders and their methods Other factors in their diminishing appeal have been their defense of the Milosevic regime in Yugoslavia and the economic recovery in France In another front page story Tuesday Le Monde reported that according to a British organization Global Witness Cambodian forests are being illegally destroyed to feed the garden furniture industry in Vietnam Tuesday s Corriere della Sera of Milan reported that Geraldine Chaplin has written to Roberto Benigni the Oscar winning star and director of Life is Beautiful to thank him for reminding her of her father Charlie Chaplin with his elegance and class in every little gesture his nobility of spirit and above all his ability to be

the putting up for sale of a London house for 35 million pounds about 56 million making it according to the Daily Telegraph the most expensive house in Europe By grand mansion standards it is relatively modest with 10 bedrooms nine bathrooms four reception rooms a small garden and a wine cellar that is actually more of a cupboard But it is very close to Kensington Palace where the late Princess Diana lived The sale consists of a lease of only 99 years and the purchaser will have to pay an additional 1 2 million pounds 1 9 million in taxes and an estimated 328 000 in legal fees the Telegraph said In Japan Asahi Shimbun reported Wednesday that raccoons imported from the United States as pets have become an ecological and agricultural nightmare in Japan Escaped or abandoned

foxes and gray herons from their natural habitats Raccoons particularly baby ones became fashionable as pets in the late 1970s because of a popular cartoon program on television called Araiguma
