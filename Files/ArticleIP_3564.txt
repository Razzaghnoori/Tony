question about Sen John McCain s extraordinarily mean spirited joke about Chelsea Clinton at a recent Republican fund raiser First I wonder if you agree with many members of the press that the joke is in the Washington Post s words too vicious to print In my experience vicious things reflect more harshly on the person who says them To that end I tend to think that not printing the joke has unfairly spared McCain from a well deserved kick in the shins from the American public Second I am intrigued by the idea that McCain and Chelsea may bump into each other any number of times before her father leaves office How in your opinion should Chelsea conduct herself in the senator s presence I m certain that the apology from McCain to her father has likely left her with no option but to treat the senator with respect and courtesy But is there a good way to make a boorish person squirm without being boorish yourself Puckishly Kate Wrath Dear Puck How nice to hear from you again Your queries are interesting ones Prudie is in agreement that withholding direct quotes by public people often protects the evil sayer from others as well as from themselves The mirror image consideration however is that it is unappetizing to give the offending remark wider circulation especially when it is insulting to a person of tender years Reality though must come into play and in cases such as this there will always be a way for the outr remark to become known Curious readers who want to see the joke in all its tawdriness can consult David s Plotz s thoughtful Assessment of Sen McCain in a recent Slate Also the censoring process increases curiosity as when one refuses to answer a child s question A sidelight that has been generally overlooked is that the U S attorney general took a double slam in the senator s joke In any case thoughtful people will surely wonder about the judgment and heart of a man who could publicly denigrate the looks of a young woman who has famously conducted herself like a lady And Prudie knows in her heart that McCain is toast as far as the president is concerned Prudie being old enough to remember Truman and the opera critic As for your second thought How should Ms Clinton behave toward the senator while being both correct and shaming My old Midwestern mother taught me the answer to that one years ago Kill em with kindness and they don t know where to look Prudie turning the other cheek Dear P My sister her husband and daughter are spending a few weeks with us We love them all Trouble is little Alexandra does not know from discipline and I nearly twitch when I see her talk back to her mom I have bitten my tongue all week but I finally said something to the brat My brother in law then chastised me for being harsh I realize that criticizing the kid is criticizing the parent or at least the parenting but somebody should say something to somebody I muttered my apologies to keep the peace but I felt sullied having done so What do you think Lost in My Own House Dear Lost Prudie sympathizes with your situation And you are indeed correct that admonishing someone else s child is also a comment on the parenting but inappropriate outbursts by any youngster inspire most sensitive people to try to interject a little decorum Then too the outr behavior you describe was taking place at your house allowing you to feel rightly Prudie thinks that l tat c est moo I m bossy around here The odds are not great but sometimes an outsider s rebuke can serve to wake up the parents in which case you ve done a good turn all around You might even continue the discussion with the tyrant tyke s folks pointing out that discipline bespeaks love and that the kid will have hell s own time if she continues speaking to people in such a manner If your one stab at being the kiddie kaiser causes your sister and her husband to invite you to mind your own business at least you will know that you tried Prudie civilly Dear Prudie When a friend colleague or loved one stumbles it seems inelegant to ask Are you all right How would you suggest I more properly offer sympathy My best attempt Is your dignity intact Robert J Lederman Ann Arbor Mich Dear Rob Prudie suggests you go back to Are you all right There is something peculiar about asking Is your dignity intact unless perhaps dignity is code for derri re in Michigan Prudie solicitously Dear Prudie Your response to the query about the Zone Diet was rich in common sense and went halfway toward torpedoing the trendy useless diet industry The other half is to increase the calories one burns There s a time honored way to do this It s called taking a walk How does Prudie feel about exercise as the road to a trimmer slimmer you Gary Reno Nev Dear Gary Of course Prudie agrees that working out is the better part of weight loss she just plum forgot to mention it And walking is wonderful exercise It requires no special equipment or membership fees and you can t strain anything Modified eating with no physical exertion would be like putting lipstick on a donkey perfectly pointless Prudie gratefully
