The g iro a percussion instrument made of a notched dried gourd was developed by the Ta no Indians To this the Spanish added several types of guitars with the ten stringed cuatro being the most famous it is the national instrument of Puerto Rico African slaves brought with them the wherewithal to produce tambours wood covered in animal skin to create drums and maracas dried gourds filled with seeds

country folk of the island death unrequited love and poverty resulting from bad harvests Salsa is probably the most famous form of music to emerge from Puerto Rico Ironically salsa which means sauce was imported back to the island from the Puerto Rican community who settled in New York city in the late 1940s Salsa combines an array of percussion instruments with a swinging horn section You will hear it everywhere A much older Latin dance making a comeback is the merengue which when it first became popular was considered to be so provocative that it was banned by the Spanish authorities Finally there are the compelling bomba and the plena A genre directly related to the rhythmic beats of African music bomba makes use of animal skin drums along with maracas and higher pitched percussion instruments Plena music is said to have its roots in Spanish colonial courtly behavior though the instruments used are also Ta no and African Most of the stage shows at the larger hotels
