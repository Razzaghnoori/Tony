 A Snowball s Chance Impeachment is still a minority taste In mid August 25 percent of adults supported impeachment by the beginning of this week almost 40 percent did But why is that number growing at all The Starr report Clinton s response or just the slow sinking in of the story may all be factors But opinion polls themselves can change the results of opinion polls They can even turn a minority view into a majority one without anyone actually changing his or her mind about the rights and wrongs Here s how Start with a poll indicating that 25 percent of voters think Clinton deserves to be sacked Three quarters think he doesn t But of that 75 percent who don t think he should quit or be impeached many are disturbed at the thought that he has lost the confidence of so many other citizens and some will feel that whatever their own views the president should go because he has lost the ability to govern effectively This argument is already a subtheme among the commentariat How many will feel this way Impossible to say of course If everyone in the country except you felt that Clinton was disqualified on moral grounds you would almost certainly conclude that he should go on effectiveness grounds alone If half the country disagreed with you you might or might not buy the effectiveness argument If 10 percent of the country favored impeachment you almost surely would not worry that this made the president ineffective Let s suppose that at 25 percent favoring impeachment one out of 15 of the remaining 75 percent believes that having a quarter of the population wishing him impeached makes the president dangerously ineffective The next time a pollster comes around this small group tells him or her they think Clinton should go Thus the next poll results show that an additional 5 percent of voters now want him out and the total for ouster is now 30 percent Of the remaining 70 percent one in 14 thinks that 30 percent favoring impeachment is too much for effective governance and thus the next poll publicizes the news that 35 percent of voters think Clinton should go If an equal number of pragmatic voters now one in 13 of the remaining Clinton supporters think that 35 percent is enough they ll flip and the next poll will show that 40 percent of voters think impeachment is warranted Two iterations later 50 percent of American voters want to send Clinton to the showers And that s enough for Congress Clinton is impeached by a snowball A majority of Americans now believes he must go even though only one in four actually believe he deserves to go The dynamic eventually loses steam of course The halt comes when there is no one left who wishes Clinton would stay but thinks the current level of impeachment sentiment means he should go But is the end north or south of 50 percent We don t know This dynamic is perhaps easier to see in the stock market as explained in a famous passage by John Maynard Keynes Keynes wrote of Those newspaper competitions in which the competitors have to pick out the six prettiest faces from a hundred photographs the prize being awarded to the competitor whose choice most nearly corresponds to the average preferences of the competitors as a whole It is not a case of choosing those which to the best of one s judgement are really the prettiest nor even those which average opinion thinks the prettiest We have reached the third degree where we devote our intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be And there are some I believe who practise the fourth fifth and higher degrees An example of Keynes point Suppose AT T stock trades at 50 A group of optimistic but thickheaded investors suspects that a share of AT T is actually worth 100 Most investors are skeptical correctly divining that future earnings justify a price of only 50 But if some skeptics suspect that optimists will buy AT T for 100 then these skeptics will buy AT T and drive the price to say 60 The fact that the market newly contains optimists and speculating skeptics moves another group of more conservative skeptics to start buying driving the price to 70 even though the new group believes the stock is only worth 50 After all it s OK to buy a stock you know to be overvalued as long as someone else it doesn t matter whether it s a skeptic or an optimist will pay even more for it The process iterates bringing more and more investors aboard until someone gets spooked about finding a speculating skeptic or an idiotic optimist who will continue the game The result is often a precipitous sell off Keynes writes The actual private object of the most skilled investment today is to beat the gun as the Americans so well express it to outwit the crowd and to pass the bad or depreciating half crown to the other fellow Keynes believed that this kind of speculation was pernicious The reason is that it diverts attention from something called enterprise by which Keynes means the development of real operating businesses Can a similar argument apply to the voting example It is indeed troubling that Clinton could be driven out by voters who don t necessarily deplore his conduct Something smells rotten about the idea that you must surrender your opinion to your neighbor The real polity like the real economy ought to be what counts
