                            What holds cells together or connects them with the extracellular matrixand what        happens when these interactions break downis one of the keys to determining how tumors        metastasize One group of compoundsintegrinsare a central part of these interactions Not        only do integrins play a part in cellcell and cellmatrix adhesion but they also are        involved in signal transduction the method by which a cell relays information from        receptor binding to cellular response and in triggering cell death by linking to other        molecules One such member of this receptor family is the av integrin which is expressed        on both the tumor cells and the new vasculature of various tumors including melanomas        av integrin has a role in cell migration and extravasation which occurs during        metastasis and also in angiogenesisthe development of new blood vessels that are        essential for the growth of tumors These blood vessels are the target for one class of        anticancer drugsangiogenesis inhibitors Molecules that bind to av integrin have also        been used to target therapeutic compounds to tumors compounds that antagonize this        integrin can lead to apoptosis programmed cell death of cells that express it        Haubner and colleagues the authors of a paper in this months         PLoS Medicine  have previously developed a fluorinelabeled peptide          FGalactoRGD that has a high affinity for av integrin          FGalactoRGD has many of the features essential for a tracer it is        specifically accumulated by tumors that express av integrin it is efficiently eliminated        by the kidneys and it is stable in vitro and in vivo        In the research paper in         PLoS Medicine  Haubner and colleagues take the development of the        compound further towards clinical application First in a mouse with human melanoma they        used highly sensitive positron emission tomography PET scanning to show not only that the        level of uptake of integrin was specific for the tumor but also that the uptake was in        direct proportion to the amount of av expressed thus potentially allowing quantification        of receptor expression however larger tumors showed a poorer correlation possibly        because of the presence of necrotic areas that do not express the integrin        In humans this picture was a little less clear in a small study of patients with        tumors including melanoma the authors found a good deal of difference between patients in        the uptake of the marker by tumor cells and the corresponding tumor vasculature However        there was good correlation between the tracer uptake and conventional staining for the        integrin by immunohistochemistryagain suggesting that the marker is truly reflecting the        in vivo level of the integrin        What do these results mean for clinical applications As well as identifying tumors that        express this marker this approach might also offer a noninvasive way to assess the degree        of new vessel formation in tumors The approach could provide important information for        planning and monitoring antiangiogenic therapies targeting this integrin and could reveal        the involvement and role of this integrin in metastatic and angiogenic processes in various        diseases
