 That 70s Gossip After making her way through this month s tabloids Keeping Tabs feels as though she s been stuck in a bit of a time warp The tabs suffering from an overload of nostalgia read like magazines one might have thumbed through while waiting backstage at the Mike Douglas or Merv Griffin shows How else to explain headlines such as Linda Lavin finds happiness in the heartland and Rhoda shattered as charity folds The latter would of course be actress Valerie Harper whose partner in the failed venture turned out to be none other than Dennis Weaver television s McCloud Why there s Dukes of Hazzard star Catherine Bach at a premiere An exclusive interview with Charles Nelson Reilly A new album from the real life band that inspired the Partridge Family The Globe meanwhile has landed showbiz insider Charlene Tilton she played Lucy Ewing on Dallas you ll no doubt recall as its newest gossip columnist I mean if Charlene Tilton s not where it s at who is After a brief check to verify that The Gong Show is in fact no longer on the air Keeping Tabs perused the Globe s story about rhinestone cowboy Glen Campbell who is shown relaxing in the comfy floral pattern bedroom of his Phoenix Ariz mansion The Globe also reports that Lee Bionic Man Majors is set to return to television in a British sitcom The National Enquirer has a page of photos of stars including both Lisa Whelchel of The Facts of Life and Barbara Mandrell sporting the hairdo made famous by Majors ex wife Farrah Fawcett circa 1977 But apparently life is a mixed bag for Fawcett these days While the Star has a story titled Fabulous Farrah shows she s still got it at 52 it also reports that Fawcett is in such dire financial straits that she s had to cut back her gardener s visits from five to three times a week And the Star couldn t refrain from running a truly unfortunate time lapse sequence of the actress picking her nose in public Even when they do manage to focus on celebs who have actually worked regularly in the last say 10 years the tabs seem uncommonly fixated on looking backward The Enquirer s special double issue contains 42 count em pages chronicling celebrity style makeovers over the years while this week s Star devotes 30 full pages to before they were stars pictures Vanna White was a very cute baby indeed And Keeping Tabs is pretty sure she had the exact outfit that Melissa Gilbert once wore in 1982 With so much photographic evidence on hand it s only natural that there s much discussion about who s had plastic surgery The tabs short answer pretty much everybody The Globe has the requisite doctor on hand to assess 10 celebs before and after photos He gives high marks to Sharon Stone s light handed surgical touch but pans Mickey Rourke whose skin is pulled back so tightly he looks like a lizard Those reported to be contemplating plastic surgery include pop star Britney Spears liposuction per the Star Judge Judy Sheindlin face lift breast lift dermabrasion also from the Star and Camilla Parker Bowles 50 000 worth of miscellaneous fixes to help her win the race against Sophie Rhys Jones to become the new Princess Diana says the Globe The most talked about face lift prospect is of course Hillary Rodham Clinton Both the Star and the Globe report that the first lady wearing dark sunglasses and a navy blue pantsuit was seen visiting the offices of a Park Avenue plastic surgeon while the Enquirer insists that no consultations were done in person Instead the circumspect first lady is said to have sent various doctors high resolution photos taken of her face from different angles in order to get their opinions We learned of the putative planned lift only after discovering that the before and after photos of Clinton promised on the cover of the Sept 28 Star were nothing more than a computer simulation much like the Globe s simulated mugshots of JonBenet Ramsey s parents around whom tabloid suspicion is once again furiously swirling Perhaps the tabloids loaf was sliced just a little too thin but there seems to be an unusually high ratio of tantalizing headlines to banal copy this month To wit The new book that the Star claims blows the lid on pop star Brandy s love life reveals such gasp inducing nuggets as I liked former boyfriend Kobe Bryant He had that confidence and innocence about him that attracted me The remote island paradise where the Star says Frank and Kathie Lee Gifford bumped into Frank s former paramour Suzen Johnson turns out to be Nantucket Mass which last we checked sits a mere stone s throw from the coast of Cape Cod The Globe teases us with the secret life of Sopranos hunk James Gandolfini which turns out to be that he is married and has a child And those intimate secrets about Princess Diana offered up to the Star by her former butler She d put an outfit on and come downstairs and look at me and say You don t like this do you If I said No I don t she d go back upstairs and try something else on The tabs seem so mired in the mundane that they ve beefed up their coverage of celebrity errand running The low point might have to be a Globe story titled Lisa Kudrow s friendly trip to the hairdresser complete with a photo of Kudrow whose expression suggests she may have just realized she s not alone with her head piled high with silver foils The Globe also catches every minute of Barbra Streisand and James Brolin s action packed trip to a plant nursery while the Star spots rock star Mark McGrath of the band Sugar Ray washing his undies with the ordinary folk at a Hollywood laundromat Hel lo Tabloid editors on holiday Who is he sleeping with for God s sake After slogging through all three pages of the Star s supermarket secrets of the superstars Keeping Tabs was particularly interested to learn that Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorm who seemed to just vanish into thin air at about the time the Carol Burnett Show went off the air are alive and well and often seen picking up the latest stain removers and cleaning supplies at Trancas in Malibu A store insider at the Erewhon supermarket on Beverly Boulevard breaks the startling news that Love Boat captain and Mary Tyler Moore stalwart Gavin McLeod is crazy about our almond butter Finally the Globe reports that NYPD Blue s Dennis Franz was spotted spending 15 minutes in a supermarket inspecting some 50 ears of corn He sniffed each ear poked it and even counted all the kernels confides an observer Keeping Tabs is highly skeptical of a Franz corn purchase however because the National Enquirer says that the actor recently shed 35 pounds on the kind of high protein low carbohydrate diet in which corn is verboten Franz the story says owes it all to the diet books sent him by wouldn t you know it Three s Company star Suzanne Somers We bet he ll be fitting back into those old leisure suits in no time
