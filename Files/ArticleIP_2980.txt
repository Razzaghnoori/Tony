 Z For honesty s sake any early criticism of Thomas Pynchon s new novel Mason Dixon ought to be labeled provisional or tentative The text of the book was released two weeks ago as of this writing And because it will take any normal human being at least that long to read the galleys 773 pages let alone reflect upon their contents it s a fair bet that anyone who reviews the novel has 1 merely skimmed it meaning his impressions are superficial 2 actually read every page but only by foregoing food and rest meaning his impressions are warped by stress or 3 not read the book at all meaning his impressions are just as worthy as those of the thousands of other literate folk who will buy Pynchon s novel on reputation read the jacket copy put it down and pronounce it either another masterpiece or a disappointing falling off though somewhat better than Vineland his previous book Indeed I have already heard the latter view bandied about at New York cocktail parties Here is my own preliminary view based on 400 pages read 200 skimmed and 100 foregone Maybe just maybe minimalist fiction wasn t such a bad thing after all As I said it should take any normal human being at least two weeks to get through Mason Dixon but that begs the question of whether Pynchon s writings are intended for normal human beings I don t think they are They partake of what the Elizabethans called euphuism the pursuit of linguistic complexity for its own sake As such they re intended for literary monastics for the tenured priesthood of paid interpreters that sprang up in colleges after World War II with the help of massive public funding from schemes such as the GI Bill and Pell grants This professional audience for difficult texts created the demand that Pynchon first filled with V and Gravity s Rainbow the semiotic monoliths whose mix of scientific imagery Cold War absurdity and Joycean allusion provided a kind of full employment program for a generation of rising postdocs In academia Pynchon found his patrons In Pynchon academia found its paychecks The problem is that Pynchon is performing for a court that no longer exists The boom in subsidized deconstruction is over What s Mason Dixon about I ll get to that Think about what s happened to the novel since the fat fecund days of Gravity s Rainbow It s grown thin and literal and modest so much so that the typical first novel isn t called a first novel anymore it s called a memoir just one step from journalism and it s immunized from conventional criticism by its traumatized sincerity Even the bright young men who imitate Pynchon by fortifying their fashionably fractured stories with math and science myth and metafiction can t really hold a candle to the master They write Italian compared with Pynchon s Latin perhaps because they no longer have a church behind them merely chains of secular superstores Which brings me to the new novel itself Written in 18 th century English magical is spelled magickal for example and the predominant punctuation marks are the dash and the apostrophe it tells the picaresque tale of two astronomers best known for surveying the Mason Dixon line which separates Pennsylvania from Maryland and the American cultural North from the cultural South We meet the pair as they re setting off from England for southern Africa where they hope to observe the transit of Venus for purposes of mapping the Earth s longitude You ll learn a lot about shipping in this novel and the main thing you ll learn is how important it was to find a reliable way of measuring longitude National fortunes depended on the feat making it the Age of Reason s equivalent to finding the Holy Grail As Mason and Dixon travel they have adventures Rollicking bawdy adventures They drink Carouse While staying in Cape Town with a family of Dutch colonists Dixon is set upon by its three young daughters whose mission is to arouse him to the point where he ll want to mate with their black slave thereby producing a light skinned offspring When the pair land in colonial America they hook up with Benjamin Franklin finding not a parsimonious Puritan but a turned on pre psychedelic party animal Franklin wears tinted glasses consorts with prostitutes and stages late night proto raves at pubs wowing the crowds with electrical experiments and machine made music The moment you ve all been waiting for the Saloon or the Orchid Tavern is pleas d to Present the fam d Leyden Jar Danse Macabre with that Euclid of the Electrick Philadelphia s own Poor Richard in the part of Death Next it s on to Virginia to see George Washington He greets the travelers by lighting up a hemp pipe and getting them roundly stoned To curb the men s munchies Martha serves muffins and doughnuts The comedy of anachronism is Pynchon s favorite kind and here as elsewhere in his work it isn t very funny Pynchon the verbal technician is genius but Pynchon the humorist is lame indeed and reminds one of a brainy college sophomore who studies joke books to make himself amusing Worse he s very big on language humor on purposely mismatching tone and topic and veering abruptly between high flown rhetoric and scatological bluntness Again not funny The man who once represented the future of literature and to some still does is bogged down in Ivy League revue style japery circa 1958 A farting priest who s quick with learned puns is his idea of hilarity As Washington and the surveyors pass the pipe intrigues and conspiracies involving all sorts of secret factions Jesuits Masons British trading companies are hinted at Everyone has a vital interest it seems in Mason and Dixon s wilderness survey and it becomes clear that the pair are really pawns in some obscure sociocultural power struggle that may involve as yet unknown advanced communication technologies When Washington reveals that French explorers have buried mysterious metal plates up and down the frontier die hard Pynchon fans will lick their chops Playful ingenious revisions of orthodox history based on complex covert affiliations and strange secret weapons are the master s trademark At bottom Pynchon writes mystery novels symphonic polymathic detective stories that resolve themselves not in simple sums but in hip new intellectual logarithms And he pays his readers the ultimate compliment of writing as though he knows they re capable of getting his erudite cosmic jokes That s the rub and that s why I m not a fan Pynchon is a writer you have to get and I find no activity less inspiring than Rubik s Cube ing through a clue strewn supertext in search of a paradoxical Eureka The low part of the higher mind that Pynchon so pyrotechnically appeals to the same part that responds to Escher drawings PDQ Bach and perspective switching holograms is not a part of myself I m in touch with nor do I particularly long to be I admire Pynchon I m wowed by him at times but the truth is I m happy leaving him to the experts whose academic labs gave birth to him They re the ones whose love he seems to want the ones who seem best equipped to give it to him May their funding never quite dry up
