 Slate Home Delivery Slate Home Delivery Click to go directly to Slate Home Delivery instructions Imagine this You wake up stumble out of bed pour a cup of coffee and go to your printer There fresh and warm are Slate s Today s Papers a few of your other favorite Slate departments maybe even a non Slate item or two such as that morning s Washington Post news digest No need to boot up or log on No need to read onscreen or wait for a printout Why there s no need even to go outside and collect the newspaper True home delivery inside your home Sound good It occurred to us a while ago Why can t people leave their computers and their printers on overnight or whenever and have their printouts waiting for them rather than vice versa There are push technologies such as PointCast and the channels on Microsoft Internet Explorer which will download Web pages automatically But none of them takes the next step of printing the pages out Why not Could it be that computer types don t appreciate the widespread aversion to reading things on a screen Whatever the reason how hard would it be to offer this service to Slate readers As we do with all deep philosophical questions we took this one to the nearest software developer who happened to be Slate s own Chief Computer Guy Andrew Shuman And Shuman gave his usual two part answer a Very easy No problem at all b Very difficult Would require many a moon Need new staff much wampum Accused of self contradiction he sniffed To you it s a contradiction To me it s a paradox Some people can t tell the difference And he added If you think it s so easy why don t you do it yourself So we did The process gave us new respect for software developers We deeply regret any harsh or impatient words we may have uttered to them or even behind their backs Nevertheless we have a solution Shuman wishes it known that this is not an official Slate service and the publisher wishes it known that we cannot supply support or advice on it It s just a whimsy of Slate s journalistic element It hasn t been tested It doesn t work on AOL and may not work on any configuration of equipment and services other than those on the editor s home machine Nevertheless we think it s pretty cool It s actually just an adaptation of some software from Hewlett Packard called HP Web PrintSmart You can download the software free from HP s Web site Although the site implies the software is intended only for HP printers it actually plays well with others PrintSmart has various features and you re welcome to piss away as many hours horsing around with it as we have But for our purposes it does three things First at a time and frequency you determine just once once a week every day or every weekday it dials your Internet service provider if necessary makes a connection downloads the Web pages you have selected closes the connection and hangs up Second it very cleverly reformats the pages to look good and save paper when printed out Third it does print them out PrintSmart can be customized for Slate fairly easily You can instruct the program to search in various ways for pages linked to other pages By setting these parameters correctly you can schedule an overnight printout of any combination of Slate articles or departments you wish You can add other Web sites too And in the morning if you wish you can go to a checklist of Slate pages preview them and choose other articles to print out all without dialing in again PrintSmart has some flaws and for our purposes it s more complicated than it ought to be Slate and HP both have ambitions for a simpler process and you can expect to see some developments over the next few months We also should mention a rival product put out by another printer company Canon Called WebRecord it has some advantages over PrintSmart For example it formats printouts for two or three columns a page thus saving even more paper But it doesn t have a search mechanism it doesn t have a scheduler and it costs 30 Nevertheless if you re into printing out it s worth investigating For instructions on setting up Slate Home Delivery using HP PrintSmart Michael Kinsley
