 where do you live uh in the Houston area uh huh well i used to i lived there for a long time but i m now in Palo Alto California which is i think the recycling capital of the world oh that s great so we have many recycling activities and i m in in full uh support of all of them oh we are too our community is uh just starting to get organized about it they just opened up a recycling center where we go and donate our our things and dump them off ourselves um hum and uh well that s something but it it seems to me that we ve gotten a whole lot better um cooperation out here uh by setting it up so that we pay just a little bit extra uh actually i don t think we pay very much extra at all too but the uh garbage men uh huh come by uh on your regular garbage day and pick up the recycling out at the curb i think that s great there s a few places in Houston where they re trying that out i don t know if it s the if they ve done it citywide yet or not where they have the color coded uh bags and uh bins yeah we have burlap sacks and they give us one for aluminum and oh uh steel one for metals uh huh and one for glass and then you can either bundle your newspapers or put them in grocery bags so we have we leave three little piles of things out on the curb every Thursday and the garbage men come by and uh collect them and leave us new bags when ours get old and ratty or leave the ones if they re still in good shape oh that s great and the it really pays for itself because oh then the city gets the money from the recycling uh huh yeah we re we re all for it our um we ve got several bins in our on in our garage where we uh you know sort things out and and take it to to the appropriate places yeah the one thing i wish we could recycle is magazines but they claim that because of the way they re bound they uh it s too expensive to recycle them at my office we have yes two big cardboard boxes in the library where everybody goes to pick up their mail and they re uh one s for white paper and one s for colored paper so anything like manuscripts or computer paper or um hum things like that goes in those boxes but we get tons of catalogs and things like that and magazines and there s no way to get rid of them it just seems like such a waste oh it does it does but i m sure that they can uh find some sort of uh use for them if you know you know there i ve seen talk about uh using garbage for uh energy um hum and so you know you could also apply the magazines toward that well that would be a help i wish they would do that here we have got so little landfill space left that we re going to run out before the end of this decade and it s really going to be yes a mess when we have to start hunting for places to put the things oh i know it we did have uh another novel uh experiment start this year now we can put all our yard clippings out you can you buy these super giant heavy duty paper bags they re about four feet high oh uh huh and you get them for i think it s about fifty cents a piece at the grocery store um you usually buy them by the dozen um hum and then you put all your lard yard clippings and uh leaf rakings and anything that will be compostible oh uh huh and those and the garbage men also pick those up on Thursdays oh that s great and then the uh they take them to a special part of our dump where composting is now in full swing and at the end of every year uh they sell all the composts to nurserymen and to local people who want to put it on their flowerbeds right well that s a great idea i wish we were that uh involved in uh or that our city was so involved in that involved in recycling yeah like that because you know i ve talked to many people and we wouldn t mind going its extra effort to do it uh if they make it so that it s not a horrendous inconvenience i think most people would yeah oh yeah you know and i don t mind you know at first it was the the little extra money that you got you know returning the cans in and stuff like that but now you know i don t mind as long as things are getting recycled you know that we don t get reimbursed right no i think it s it s to me more of a convenience to have them come pick it up uh huh than to get that two cents when you take it to the store we still have bins at the grocery stores where you can turn in bottles and cans oh i oh i know it um hum for cash but so few people uh have enough to make that worthwhile you d spend more in gas getting down there than you get back right yes and then the plus the time that you waste standing in line is valuable also now do the grocery stores in Houston have recycling for their paper bags and plastic bags we have i know of one that the one that we use uh has uh recycling for the bags uh huh and uh and they re promoting the cloth bags you know the reuse reusable cloth bags yeah well we can get a nickel a piece for any paper bags that we bring back to be reused oh that s great they just take it off like they do a coupon they just subtract it from your bill oh and they have a giant bin by the front door for the plastic bags and they say you know as long as it s clean they don t want a plastic bag that s full of goop uh huh yes here they don t want your rotted tomatoes but they want any clean and dry plastic bag so i keep and the thing is i hardly have room now for all the things that we re saving it to recycle so right outside the back door i ve got the two burlap bags hung up for the cans and bottles uh huh and there right outside the that place where the garbage can is we have the bag for the newspapers and now we ve got the bag for the plastic bags i understand uh my husband about once a weekend he ll go uh to a couple of areas where he knows that the people just throw cans out oh yeah and he ll go pick them up because he just can t stand that he he well how nice that s great and uh it s so you know he we have all our piles of of recyclables also um hum i remember at Christmas the the only thing that i m when you were talking about the composting the only thing that our city did that was they did uh provided a place for us to take our Christmas trees um hum uh to for them to mulch yeah for for city use and well that s they just put all our Christmas trees in the regular uh compost uh huh pickup so they did say that you had to put it out within i think it was uh three weeks after Christmas and uh huh right uh otherwise you would have to treat it like you would any other lawn refuse it would have to be cut into four foot lengths so you know if we have branches or something they have to be cut in four foot lengths but otherwise uh they have to be in one of their paper bags uh huh well that sounds like you all really have a a great system worked out there and they even picked up our uh styrofoam plastic packing materials they brought uh the week after Christmas they left a plastic bag on everybody s front doorknob with a little note on it saying we re trying something new next week only uh huh if you have any uh of those little uh styrofoam peanuts that uh huh any of your Christmas presents were packed in put them in this bag and leave it out with your recycling and we ll uh take all of those back and try to recycle them right well see that s one but i that s not going to be a regular feature that was just a one time thing right after Christmas well the but uh something need does need to be done about the styrofoam well those things must take up a huge amount of space in landfills that uh oh yeah i mean they don t uh uh they don t mash they don t compress at all and they stay forever no right and i ve seen where some places have taken a plastic and uh they re recycling them into other plastics um hum and the styrofoam also into insulation and things like that and i think that would be great if they could get something organized along those lines yeah i do too the difficulty with that is that very few people have enough to make it worthwhile it they really have to rely on businesses that generate a lot of that stuff right uh because otherwise uh you know they re not going to go house to house collecting it and you re not going to bother if you have one bag full to drive all the way to some recycling center to turn in just your little plastic peanuts um hum right oh i was thinking about you know like the uh the styrofoam used at uh the fast food restaurants yeah that if everybody uh and so yeah i know like our cafeteria here uses a lot of styrofoam but uh now we quit that about two years ago no three years ago when we got China mugs for everybody um so and the only difficulty with that is that we re in the middle of a five year drought and so i it s a real difficult choice whether we want styrofoam cups to fill up our landfills or uh China cups to use up our water but at the moment we re using the China cups and everybody gets one at the beginning of the year and then uh you re supposed to keep it recycled every day well that s good that s uh yeah they should last a while well let us hope that everybody s going to be paying more attention to this and that we will get uh better reuse of things because i believe we are i i do believe everybody is starting to pay attention and take heed of what is happening yep and so it ll it ll be good in the long run well i enjoyed it it sure will well good to talk to
