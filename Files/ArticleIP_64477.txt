 The Mark of McCain John McCain s five years as a prisoner of war positioned him to run for president as the candidate of character His Vietnam ordeal it was said made him candid brave inner directed Now McCain is running from the character issue His Vietnam ordeal detractors allege left him irascible unstable unfit for the presidency McCain has now released 1 500 pages of medical records to provide what the New York Times has called the broadest look ever given the public at the psychological profile of a presidential candidate Presidential character has returned as a public and media obsession To be sure the character of presidents has always mattered Whether charging that Thomas Jefferson took a slave as his mistress or that Grover Cleveland fathered an illegitimate child opponents have long assailed the morals of presidential aspirants But in the 19 th century such mudslinging never amounted to a full scale attempt to assess a candidate s psychological profile John Adams John Quincy Adams and Abraham Lincoln all probably suffered from melancholy or depression but their mental health didn t enter the public debate Most people didn t even know about their conditions Only with the rise of Freudian theory specifically the idea that not only the ill but also well functioning people are captive to unconscious motives did anyone think to psychoanalyze a president According to Stanley Allen Renshon author of the invaluable book The Psychological Assessment of Presidential Candidates the first such effort appeared in a 1912 New York Times Magazine article titled Roosevelt as Analyzed by the New Psychology The article tried to explain inconsistent comments that former President Theodore Roosevelt had made about supporting his successor William Taft by postulating that TR harbored an unresolved repressed wish to run for president again himself Though hardly controversial by today s standards not least because we know that TR did choose to run in 1912 the story provoked an outcry including a denunciation from Freud himself Just as the spread of psychoanalysis made putting candidates on the couch acceptable the advent of nuclear weapons made stability the watchword not only in geopolitics but also in psychopolitics In the 1956 presidential race Democrats seized on what columnist Max Lerner called The Triple Issue President Eisenhower s frail physical health he d had a heart attack in September 1955 nukes the Soviet Union built a hydrogen bomb in November 1955 and in Lerner s phrase the character of Richard Nixon liberals viewed Nixon then vice president as bellicose and ruthless In an election eve speech Adlai Stevenson the Democrats standard bearer said that As a citizen more than a candidate I recoil at the prospect of Mr Nixon as custodian of this nation s future as guardian of the hydrogen bomb as Commander in Chief of the United States armed forces Close aides disapproved feeling Stevenson had gone too far Yet Democrats reprised the issue in 1964 To Barry Goldwater s slogan In your heart you know he s right Democrats countered In your guts you know he s nuts Lyndon Johnson s camp portrayed the Republican senator as a trigger happy Strangelove likely to blow up the world The now defunct magazine FACT published by the eccentric Ralph Ginzburg polled 12 356 members of the American Psychiatric Association and used the 2 419 responses to conclude that the psychiatrists considered Goldwater paranoid While plenty of psychiatrists did question Goldwater s temperament and judgment the study s methodology was so egregiously flawed that Goldwater won a libel suit against the magazine though significantly it also allowed that more reliable psychological assessments of a candidate might reasonably inform voters decisions Ironically it was the victors of those races Johnson and Nixon who would further elevate the question of psychological fitness for the presidency With Nixon the issue surfaced when muckraker Drew Pearson told a National Press Club audience just after the 1968 election that as vice president Nixon had consulted Arnold Hutschnecker a New York physician specializing in psychosomatic illnesses To his death Nixon maintained he had consulted Hutschnecker only as a physician and not for psychotherapy though skeptics wondered why he would travel to New York for a checkup One unproven claim was impotence When in 1973 Gerald Ford appeared before a Senate panel to be confirmed as vice president he had to explain his own visits to Hutschnecker One Question Marks Ford Hearing read the New York Times headline over the story about Ford s testimony Ford s explanation He had visited the doctor on Nixon s urging but only socially The Hutschnecker episode introduced a new aspect of the character issue the stigma of seeing a shrink In the New York Times Hutschnecker argued that seeking help to secure one s emotional stability denoted not weakness but courage and should not be stigmatized Most commentators agreed Hovering behind this debate of course was the lingering memory of the 1972 campaign when Missouri Sen Thomas Eagleton days after being chosen as George McGovern s running mate resigned from the Democratic ticket after revealing that he had undergone hospitalization and electroshock therapy for depression That story quickly and somewhat inaccurately came to be portrayed as an illustration of the public s By 1976 the character question was morphing from the matter of mental stability into the larger issue of what kind of a president a candidate would make Watching Johnson and Nixon visit their private demons on the nation made the public correctly curious about candidates hidden selves Academicians most notably political scientist James David Barber in his influential Presidential Character explored how to predict a president s performance based on a systematic study of his character Meanwhile the decline of the major political parties was creating a new candidate centered politics which emphasized the individual and further spotlighted his psychic makeup In these years however what people meant by character became increasingly confused In 1976 Jimmy Carter stressed his character by which he meant his alleged honesty In 1988 the press expanded the issue to include questions of marital infidelity judgment and narcissism as Gary Hart learned the hard way By the Clinton years the character question was reduced to a checklist of intrusive inquiries about past infidelity military service and drug use and if evasive or dishonest answers were given also about honesty and integrity What we mean and should mean by character needs to be disentangled First there s no question that seeking psychological help needs to be destigmatized Al and Tipper Gore have helped by saying they ve each had counseling but as Frank Rich has noted Tipper s use of such euphemisms and the avoidance a professional title that might include the prefix psych sent the signal consciously or not that she wasn t entirely free of shame herself When after the Lewinsky affair President Clinton chose not to see a real clinician but a bunch of ministers he sent the same message Yet removing the stigma of therapy doesn t mean rejecting consideration of character Obviously a president s ambition judgment temperament integrity and ways of relating with other people among other psychological qualities bear greatly on how he will govern at least as greatly as whatever election year stands he stakes out on the issues of policy The Johnson and Nixon presidencies are only the most salient examples of this truth Many others exist too One historian has argued cogently that Calvin Coolidge s psychological problems helped The real question then is how to assess character Clearly the press has done a lousy job with its focus on behavior such as infidelity or drug use that most people don t care about Alternatively some psychotherapists have argued that professionals alone should do the evaluating In the 70s Arnold Hutschnecker reveling in his 15 minutes of fame proposed establishing an official board of psychiatrists to screen all presidential candidates Not surprisingly the push for a shrinkocracy has gained little support Yet just because we ve failed to think clearly about what character involves doesn t mean we should cease to think about it The press can also do a poor job analyzing policy issues what was the last really illuminating story you read about the Social Security trust fund but no one argues it should abandon the enterprise The press is right to focus on character Now it needs to think more rigorously about how to do so
