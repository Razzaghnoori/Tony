 Background Engagement of antigen receptors on lymphocytes leads to the rapid sequential activation of non receptor tyrosine kinases including well studied members of the Src and the ZAP 70 Syk families 1 2 Recently the Tec kinases have also been implicated as important components of signaling from antigen and other lymphocyte cell surface receptors reviewed in 3 4 5 This subfamily includes six members Btk Tec Itk Tsk Emt Bmx Emt Dsrc29 and Rlk Txk 3 6 7 The importance of the Tec kinases in antigen receptor signaling was first demonstrated by the observation that mutations in BTK result in the human disease X linked agammaglobulinemia XLA and the murine counterpart X linked immunodeficiency xid These severe B cell immunodeficiencies are characterized by diminished numbers of mature B cells and reduced immunoglobulin levels associated with impaired PLC activation and Ca mobilization in response to surface IgM stimulation sIgM 8 9 10 11 Btk kinase activity and tyrosine phosphorylation increase upon stimulation of sIgM as well as the IL 5 and IL6 receptors in B cells and upon crosslinking of the high affinity IgE receptor Fc RII in mast cells 12 13 14 15 It is now clear that the other Tec kinases participate in similar signaling cascades in multiple cell types Itk a Tec family kinase that is predominantly expressed in T cells is tyrosine phosphorylated and activated after stimulation of either the T cell receptor TCR or CD28 in T cell lines and Fc RII in mast cells 12 16 17 18 Recently we have found that Rlk Txk can also be phosphorylated after TCR engagement 19 Furthermore we have found that combined mutation of Rlk and Itk leads to profound defects in TCR signaling associated with impaired activation of PLC 20 Such data suggest that members of this family may function similarly in signaling pathways downstream from these cell surface antigen receptors Several lines of evidence indicate that in these signaling cascades Tec family members act downstream of Src kinases Src kinases are activated within seconds of sIgM stimulation in B cells while Btk is activated within minutes 14 Moreover Src family kinases have been found to phosphorylate and activate Btk Itk Tec and Rlk when co expressed 16 19 21 22 23 Phosphopeptide mapping and mutational analyses of Btk have identified Y551 in the activation loop of the kinase domain as the major Src transphosphorylation site Phosphorylation of Y551 and a putative autophosphorylation site Y223 in the SH3 domain of Btk 23 24 are observed following BCR activation suggesting that these tyrosine phosphorylations are functionally important for antigen receptor signaling Although physical binding of full length Btk to Src family kinases in vivo has not been reported in vitro interactions have been demonstrated between proline rich motifs in the amino terminal sequence of Btk and the Src homology SH 3 domains of Src family kinases 25 26 Recently it has been found that the activation of Btk and Itk by Src family kinases is potentiated by and requires the activity of Phosphoinositide 3 kinase PI3K the products of which interact with the PH domains of Tec kinases 27 28 This interaction helps localize Tec family kinases to the membrane where phosphorylation by Src kinases can occur Data suggest that for Itk this membrane association specifically targets the protein to glycolipid enriched detergent insoluble membrane microdomains known as RAFTs and that both this association and the activation of Itk requires the PH domain 29 rlk TXK encodes a kinase expressed in T cells and mast cells that closely resembles members of the Btk Tec family of kinases 30 31 32 However in contrast to the other Tec family members Rlk lacks a pleckstrin homology domain Instead we have found that the rlk gene encodes a distinctive palmitoylated cysteine string motif near its amino terminus Furthermore we have found that an internal translational start site downstream of the region encoding the cysteine string motif gives rise to a second isoform that lacks the palmitoylated cysteine string and that can be localized in the nucleus 19 Although these distinctive features suggest that Rlk may have atypical functions Rlk shares with Btk kinases the homologous proline rich motif that binds the SH3 domains of Src kinases and the tyrosines at equivalent sites in the SH3 and kinase domains We have recently shown that Rlk can be phosphorylated and activated by the Src family kinase Fyn However consistent with the lack of a pleckstrin homology domain activation of Rlk is independent of PI3K activity 19 To further characterize the mechanism of activation of Rlk Txk we studied the nature of Rlk s localization and interaction with Src family kinases We report here a physical association of Rlk with Fyn both in vitro and when co expressed in 293T cells Similar to Btk and Itk we find that a conserved tyrosine in the activation loop of the Rlk kinase domain Y420 mediates specificity for transphosphorylation of Rlk by Src family kinases This tyrosine is also critical for in vivo activation of Rlk since mutation of Y420 to phenylalanine Y420F reduces phosphorylation of Rlk upon co expression with Fyn or after engagement of the TCR Furthermore we have observed that the phosphorylation of Rlk by Fyn increases Rlk turnover consistent with the increased turnover observed with other TCR signaling molecules following activation In contrast localization of Rlk does not appear to rely on tyrosine phosphorylation or kinase activity of Rlk Instead we find a constitutive association of a fraction of the full length Rlk with a detergent insoluble RAFT fraction Association with the RAFT compartment does not depend on tyrosine phosphorylation nor on PI3K activation but rather on the presence of the cysteine string motif Thus despite lacking a pleckstrin homology domain Rlk is localized in RAFTs is phosphorylated by Src family kinases and may transduce signals downstream of Src family kinases during T cell activation Results Rlk Interacts with Fyn Rlk Txk is a Tec related kinase that is predominantly expressed in cells of the T cell lineage 30 31 32 We have recently demonstrated that Rlk is phosphorylated following stimulation of the Jurkat T cell line by crosslinking of the CD3 chain of the TCR 19 We have further observed that Rlk can be phosphorylated and activated by co expression with the Src family kinase Fyn in a PI3K independent fashion In contrast activation of Btk and Itk by Src family kinases is PI3K dependent To further characterize the mechanism of Rlk activation by Src family kinases we examined potential interactions of Rlk with Src kinases both in vitro and in vivo The proline rich region of Btk has been found to bind to SH3 domains of Src family kinses in vitro To determine whether the amino terminus of Rlk Txk interacts with Src family SH3 domains in vitro we performed in vitro filter binding analyses GST fusions encoding the Rlk amino terminal and SH3 domains or the amino terminus alone containing the cysteine string and proline rich region bound biotinylated GST fusions of the SH3 domains of Fyn Hck and Lyn but not those of Src or Lck despite the ability of these constructs to bind other proline rich sequences Fig 1Band data not shown 25 33 The Rlk fusion proteins also failed to efficiently bind SH3 domains from other kinases including Abl Csk and Btk A weaker but detectable binding to the SH3 domain of Grb2 however was observed These data agree both with two hybrid experiments and in vitro filter binding assays that have demonstrated specific binding of the proline rich region near the amino terminus of BTK and Tec to the SH3 domains of the Src family kinases Fyn Lyn and Hck 22 25 26 Because Fyn is expressed in T cells and Hck and Lyn are not we pursued the connection between Rlk and the T cell specific isoform p59 FynT Co immunoprecipitation demonstrated an interaction between these proteins in extracts of cells in which both Rlk and Fyn were expressed Fig 1C Anti Rlk serum precipitated Fyn from lysates only when Rlk was expressed Fig 1C lane 4 Likewise anti Fyn serum could precipitate Rlk only when both Rlk and Fyn were produced data not shown This interaction was not dependent on the activity of either kinase as co immunoprecipitation was observed with either wild type WT or kinase inactive versions of the two proteins Furthermore both isoforms of Rlk were also able to co precipitate with Fyn data not shown Finally we have not observed co precipitation of full length Rlk with several other proteins involved in TCR signaling unpublished observations Rlk co localizes with a portion of Fyn To further examine potential interactions between Rlk and Fyn we compared the subcellular distribution of Rlk to that of p59 FynT For these and subsequent analyses we utilized Green Fluorescent Protein GFP tagged versions of Rlk We have previously demonstrated that these fusion proteins are kinase active and exhibit localization patterns similar to those observed by indirect immunofluorescence for wild type Rlk Furthermore we have found that like WT Rlk they co precipitate with Fyn data not shown However unlike WT Rlk Rlk GFP does not co migrate with immunoglobulin heavy chain Since these GFP fusions behaved similarly to wildtype Rlk in all known respects except for electrophoretic mobility we used GFP fusions of mutant and wild type versions of Rlk to facilitate studies of Rlk localization and activation We co transfected Fyn and Rlk GFP expressing constructs into HeLa cells and visualized Fyn with anti Fyn serum and Texas red conjugated secondary antibody Fig 2 Examination of cells expressing both kinases demonstrated that a portion of Fyn co localized with a portion of the Rlk protein as indicated by the yellow staining in overlapping images center panel Thus Fyn and Rlk can reside in similar compartments within the cell further supporting a potential interaction between these two molecules Fyn phosphorylates and activates Rlk A Conserved Tyrosine Y420 Provides Specificity For Phosphorylation of Rlk By Src Kinases To further examine the consequences of the interaction between Rlk and Src Family kinases we examined tyrosine phosphorylation of Rlk by Fyn using co expression studies As previously demonstrated co expression of kinase active Fyn and Rlk GFP in 293T cells led to a marked increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity of wild type Rlk GFP Fig 3A lane 1 and 2 3B lane 1 and 2 This was not observed in cells transfected with kinase inactive Fyn and the increase in kinase activity on enolase appeared to be due to Rlk rather than Fyn since we barely detect phosphorylation of enolase when WT Fyn is co expressed with kinase inactive Rlk 19 Thus the phosphorylation of Rlk appears to cause an increase in Rlk kinase activity Like other Btk family members Rlk contains a highly conserved tyrosine Y420 within a consensus sequence for phosphorylation recognized by Src family tyrosine kinases 23 This site corresponds to the location of the autophosphorylation site in the activation loop of Src related kinases 34 To determine whether this tyrosine is required for Rlk activation by Src family kinases we mutated it to phenylalanine Y420F In contrast to WT Rlk GFP tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity of the RlkY420F mutant was not significantly increased by co expression with Fyn Fig 3A Band data not shown These results suggest that Y420 is a major site of phosphorylation by Fyn and that phosphorylation at this site leads to activation of the Rlk kinase Furthermore since baseline tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity of the Y420F mutant is also lower than WT Fig 3Band data not shown it is possible that phosphorylation by endogenous Src family kinases may contribute to the activity of Rlk in 293T cells although we cannot exclude the possibility that this mutant lowers kinase activity for other reasons The major autophosphorylation site in Btk maps to Y223 within the SH3 domain 24 an analogous tyrosine is conserved in Rlk Y91 Mutation of this tyrosine Y91F reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of Rlk approximately two fold when the Y91F mutant was expressed alone or with Fyn Fig 3A However Fyn still significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of Rlk Y91F consistent with use of an intact transphosphorylation site Y420 Fig 3A The in vitro kinase activity of Rlk Y91F was also lower about half that of wild type however the kinase activity was still augmented by the presence of Fyn Fig 3C These results suggest that tyrosine 91 may be required for optimal phosphorylation and kinase activity of Rlk but is distinct from the major site phosphorylated by Src family kinases Finally since the larger isoform of Rlk consistently exhibits higher levels of tyrosine phosphorylation see Fig 3A we mutated the single tyrosine Y6 not found on the shorter isoform Mutation of Y6 did not greatly reduce the tyrosine phosphorylation of Rlk either in the presence or absence of co expressed Fyn Fig 3D Significantly the larger isoform still exhibited a higher level of tyrosine phosphorylation than the shorter form of Rlk Thus the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the larger isoform cannot be attributed solely to a phosphorylation site present on the larger protein species Rlk localizes in RAFTs Since the relative increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the larger form of Rlk did not result solely from an additional site for tyrosine phosphorylation it was possible that this increased phosphorylation of the longer isoform of Rlk may result from preferential localization close to Src family kinases Like other proteins modified by palmitoylation the Src family kinase Fyn is found localized in RAFTs a membrane microdomain fraction enriched in signaling molecules that can be isolated by sucrose gradient fractionation To examine whether Rlk is also associated with RAFTs we performed sucrose gradiant fractionation of lysates from Jurkat lymphoma cell lines transfected with Rlk GFP Upon such fractionation we observe the Src family kinase Fyn constitutively associated with the RAFT fraction Fig 4A In contrast PLC was not found in the RAFT fraction constitutively but a portion became inducibly associated with RAFTs upon activation Similar to Fyn a portion of Rlk was also found constitutively associated with RAFTs Notably this association consisted primarily of the larger form of Rlk which contains the cysteine string and is palmitoylated Furthermore the association of Rlk with RAFTs only marginally increased upon stimulation through the TCR Upon TCR signaling many molecules have been found to show markedly increased association with RAFTs Since we have found that Rlk can be phosphorylated by Src family kinases leading to activation of its kinase we evaluated whether phosphorylation could influence RAFT association Neither mutation of a conserved lysine in the kinase domain which rendered Rlk kinase inactive nor mutation of the Src family kinase phosphorylation site tyrosine 420 prevented association with the RAFT fraction Thus phosphorylation and activation of Rlk does not appear to contribute to its association with RAFTs Fig 4B A key mechanism of targeting proteins to RAFTs is lipid modification Since the long form of Rlk is palmitoylated on its cysteine string motif and palmitoylated proteins can be associated with RAFTs we examined the localization of a mutant version of RlkCM in which the cysteine string is mutated thereby preventing palmitoylation of the long form of Rlk The cysteine string mutant demonstrated marked reduction in RAFT association Fig 4B Indeed while a small amount of the Rlk cysteine string mutant was still found associated with the RAFT fraction the amount of the long isoform of RlkCM in the RAFT fraction was equivalent to that of the short isoform This observation suggests that the cysteine string may be a major mechanism of targeting full length Rlk to lipid RAFTs However the localization of a small portion of both the short and long isoforms of the cysteine string mutant to RAFTs suggests that other targeting mechanisms may also contribute to the localization of this kinase in RAFTs Recent data suggests that both Itk and Btk can also be associated with lipid RAFTs 29 35 For Itk this association requires the PH domain and products of PI3K For example in the Jurkat lymphoma cell line which is deficient in the inositol phosphatase PTEN Itk is constitutively associated with the membrane 36 Since our RAFT analyses of RLK were performed in Jurkat cells we also examined the effects of PI3K inhibition on Rlk localization Treatment of Jurkat cells with Wortmannin had no effect on Rlk association with RAFTs Fig 4C Thus RAFT localization of Rlk like its activation by Src family kinases appears to be independent of the activity of PI3K Fyn alters the half life of Rlk in the detergent soluble fraction of transfected cells In experiments with Rlk we often observed a change in the relative ratio of the two isoforms of Rlk when co expressed with Fyn Furthermore activation of Jurkats appeared to be associated with a loss of Rlk from non RAFT fractions see Fig 4A Since phosphorylation of Rlk did not seem to affect association with RAFTs we examined whether Fyn altered other properties of the Rlk protein To start to address this issue we measured the effect of Fyn on the protein stability of Rlk Rlk was expressed in 293T cells either in the absence or the presence of Fyn the cells were labeled for 15 minutes with 35S methionine and cysteine then incubated for increasing times with unlabelled methionine and cysteine When expressed alone labeled Rlk appeared stable in the detergent soluble fraction for 90 minutes Fig 5A top panel When co expressed with Fyn however Rlk disappeared from the soluble fraction at a significantly faster rate Fig 5A lower panel half life between 30 and 60 minutes The change in half life was particularly noticeable for the larger form of Rlk In the presence of kinase inactive Fyn the half life of Rlk was not altered suggesting that the phosphorylation of Rlk by Fyn is necessary for the decrease in half life of Rlk Fig 5B Similarly co transfection of wild type Fyn with RlkY420F did not alter the half life of RlkY420F in the soluble fraction data not shown again arguing that phosphorylation of Rlk by Fyn is required for this increased turnover in the soluble fraction Since this analysis included only Rlk protein in the soluble fractions of detergent lysates these results may represent changes in protein stability or subcellular localization and detergent solubility factors that all can contribute to changes in intracellular signaling In particular since Rlk can be associated with detergent insoluble RAFTs it is possible that a change in subcellular localization or associations may contribute to the decrease in Rlk protein To address these possibilities we performed similar analyses after lysing cells under harsh detergent conditions using 1 SDS then diluting the samples before performing immunoprecipitations Consistent with our observation that the phosphorylation status of Rlk does not significantly contribute to its association with RAFTs we still observed a decreased half life of Rlk co expressed with Fyn when lysed under these harsh conditions data not shown arguing that phosphorylation by Fyn specifically accelerates Rlk turnover Rlk phosphorylation in response to TCR engagement requires Tyrosine 420 The ability of Src family kinases to activate Rlk and to promote Rlk protein turnover suggests that Rlk may function downstream of Src family kinases in T cell receptor TCR signaling To determine the requirements for Rlk activation downstream from the TCR we introduced constructs expressing Rlk GFP or Rlk GFPY420F into the Jurkat Tag cell line Stimulation of the cells with an antibody directed against CD3 OKT3 increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Rlk Fig 6 However phosphorylation of the Y420F mutant was markedly reduced relative to WT Rlk GFP These results suggest that Rlk can be phosphorylated on Y420 in response to TCR stimulation supporting a role for Rlk downstream of Src kinases in signaling from the TCR analogous to Btk s role in signaling from sIgM Discussion By several criteria Rlk appears to be a member of the Tec family of tyrosine kinases yet significant differences exist between Rlk and the other kinases in this family To elucidate functional similarities and differences between Rlk and other Tec kinases in signaling from antigen receptors we investigated the interactions of Rlk with Src family kinases Our data suggest that such interactions occur and that the phosphorylation events leading to the activation of Rlk are analogous to those required for the other Tec family kinases However our data also suggest that the regulation of Rlk has distinct properties First we have observed an in vitro interaction of the amino terminus of Rlk with the SH3 domains of Src family kinases Second we have demonstrated interactions between these molecules in cells co expressing both Rlk and the Src family kinase Fyn The two kinases can be immunoprecipitated when co expressed Moreover co expression with Fyn as well as other Src family kinases data not shown leads to increased phosphorylation of Rlk and activation of the Rlk kinase in agreement with observations made with other Tec family members It has been proposed that Src kinases activate Btk through phosphorylation of a tyrosine Y551 in the activation loop of Btk leading to increased kinase activity and autophosphorylation of a tyrosine in the SH3 domain These patterns of Btk phosphorylation have been observed upon cross linking of IgM arguing that this pathway is functional in the signal transduction from antigen receptors 23 37 38 Our mutational analysis of Rlk supports a similar mechanism for activation of Rlk by Src family kinases downstream of the TCR Rlk kinase activity is increased by Src family kinase mediated phosphorylation of a conserved tyrosine Y420 equivalent to Y551 in the activation loop of the kinase domain of Btk Mutation of this site causes a reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity of Rlk which is not substantially enhanced upon co expression with Fyn or upon TCR stimulation Thus this Src kinase phosphorylation site appears to be important for activation after TCR stimulation Mutation of a second tyrosine equivalent to the putative autophosphorylation site of Btk slightly reduces tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity of Rlk However phosphorylation and kinase activity of this mutant still can be enhanced after co expression with Fyn Thus despite its unique amino terminus Rlk utilizes a transphosphorylation activation mechanism similar to other Btk family members Although our original SH3 domain binding experiments suggested a specific interaction between Tec kinases and the Src kinases Fyn Lyn and Hck we have been able to observe both activation by and co precipitation with other Src family kinases including Lck and Src in 293T cells data not shown Thus in vivo interactions with Rlk may not be restricted to a particular subset of Src family kinases Indeed we have found that mutation of the proline rich region did not abolish Rlk co precipitation with either Fyn or Lck data not shown suggesting that interactions between these kinases may not occur solely through an SH3 mediated interaction at least in the 293T expression system Nonetheless whether there is a specific connection between Rlk and the Src family kinase Fyn in T cells remains an interesting question Recent data suggests that phosphorylation of the T cell adaptor molecule SLP 76 occurs after stimulation of T cells with altered peptide ligands in a Fyn dependent manner that is independent of the adaptor molecule LAT 39 40 Notably Rlk has also been found to be capable of phosphorylating SLP 76 41 It will be of interest to determine whether Rlk participates in this novel activation pathway While Rlk is phosphorylated similarly to Btk and Itk there are marked differences between these two kinases Perhaps the most obvious of these differences is the lack of the pleckstrin homology domain in Rlk Data suggest that membrane association of Itk and Btk requires the interaction of their PH domains with products of PI3K thereby facilitating phosphorylation by Src family kinases 27 28 In contrast we have recently demonstrated that PI3K inhibitors do not alter activation of Rlk by Fyn suggesting that the requirements for activation of Rlk by Src family kinases are distinct from the other Tec kinases It is also of note that we can reproducibly co immunoprecipitate Rlk and Fyn perhaps due to their association with RAFTs whereas we have been unable to co precipitate Itk with Src family kinases when co expressed in 293T cells data not shown again demonstrating distinct properties of the Rlk protein compared to certain other members of the Btk family The combination of similar and distinct features is further supported by the observation that TXK can rescue phospholipase C activation in BTK deficient DT40 cells but fails to rescue a defect in apoptosis 42 Interestingly we also find that the full length form of Rlk has a higher basal level of tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity than Itk when expressed in heterologous cells consistent with potentially different localizations and upstream interactions unpublished observations The full length isoform of Rlk also exhibits higher tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity than the short isoform This differential phosphorylation does not appear to result solely from a distinct phosphorylation site on the full length Rlk since mutation of the only additional tyrosine found in the full length Rlk Y6 does not greatly reduce the phosphorylation or activity of Rlk when expressed either alone or in conjunction with Fyn Instead the increased phosphorylation may result in part from distinct properties of full length Rlk Indeed we report here that the palmitoylated cysteine string is responsible for the targeting of Rlk to RAFTs detergent insoluble glycolipid enriched membrane microdomains that contain many signaling molecules including Src family kinases Our data may provide the first demonstration that a cysteine string motif can lead to protein association with RAFTs Of note Itk and Btk have been found to be associated with lipid RAFTs upon activation of antigen receptors 29 35 However the association of Itk with RAFTs requires its PH domain and is dependent on the products of PI3K Indeed in Jurkat cells which are deficient in the inositol phophatase PTEN Itk is constitutively associated with the membrane unless the cells are treated with inhibitors of PI3K or transfected with PTEN 36 In contrast we have found that Rlk association with RAFTs like its activation by Src family kinases is PI3K independent Thus although Rlk like Itk and Btk is activated by phosphorylation by Src family kinases and can be found in RAFTs its requirements for this activation may be unique Co expression of Rlk and Fyn also led to a rapid disappearance of Rlk from the detergent soluble fraction as measured by pulse chase analysis Fig 5 This phenomenon could result from either a change in protein location to a detergent insoluble fraction or increased turnover of Rlk Activation of tyrosine kinases and other signal transduction molecules is associated both with changes in subcellular distribution and with changes in protein stability For example crosslinking of the T cell receptor results in a transition of the receptor complex to a detergent insoluble fraction 43 44 45 as well as to increased turnover of TCR components 46 Nonetheless the decreased half life of Rlk in both detergent soluble and insoluble fractions argues that activation of Rlk leads to increased degradation of the Rlk protein similar to that observed for other components of the TCR complex but not previously reported for Tec family kinases The dependence of this increased turnover on phosphorylation of Rlk suggests that a phosphotyrosine dependent association with another molecule may be required for this process reminiscent of the increased degradation of the PDGF receptor and Syk caused by association with the ring finger protein Cbl 47 48 49 or the Lck dependent degradation of the TCR 50 Recent evidence from gene targeted mice suggests that Rlk may synergize with Itk in signaling from the T cell receptor to activate phospholipase C 20 The similarity of the phosphorylation of Rlk by Src family kinases to that which activates other Tec kinases suggests that Rlk also functions downstream of Src kinases in TCR signal transduction pathways Rlk and Itk may therefore function together in these TCR signaling events in a fashion similar to Btk in BCR signaling Recent data argue that Itk interacts directly with Slp 76 and Grb2 to participate in a LAT nucleated T cell signaling complex involved in PLC activation 5 29 It will be of interest to examine the interactions of Rlk with other components of this complex Indeed the potential in vitro binding of the amino terminus of Rlk to the SH3 domain of Grb2 hints of similar protein interactions Thus although Rlk appears to be distinct among the Tec kinases in the lack of a PH domain the presence of a palmitoylated cysteine string and the existence of a shorter isoform that can localize to the nucleus Rlk may contribute to similar signaling pathways Indeed our data suggest that the cysteine string may serve as a surrogate to the PH domain for targeting Rlk to RAFTs It is also notable that recent data suggest that Btk can translocate to the nucleus upon B cell activation similar to the nuclear translocation we have reported for Rlk 19 51 Nonetheless the PI3K independence of the activation of Rlk activation and its association with RAFTs suggests that Rlk may also have distinct contributions to these signaling pathways Materials and Methods Cell Culture and Reagents 293T and
