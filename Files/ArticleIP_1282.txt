 Books Underboss Sammy the Bull Gravano s Story of Life in the Mafia by Peter Maas HarperCollins Critical and commercial success for the biography of Gravano the most famous snitch in Mob history who brought down John the Teflon Don Gotti offed 18 people and ordered his own brother in law s execution Drawing on extensive interviews with the Bull it is a brilliantly constructed and grimly fascinating morality play on the subject of loyalty Donald Westlake the New York Times Book Review Though it retreads tired observations about Mafia life Underboss still enriches the portrait of a subculture some of us can t get enough of Bruce Handy Time HarperCollins plugs the book The Actual A Novella by Saul Bellow Viking The 81 year old author s latest is admired as a mature work same old Bellovian subject Jewish man brooding over a woman but a more subdued elegiac tone Almost everyone lavishes praise on the book not minding the absurdities they find in the plot such as the emergence of a 92 year old trillionaire who befriends the brooding man The Actual is not a young man s piece of fiction It is instead something far more rare the work of a great master still locked in unequal combat with Eros and Time says Louis Begley in the New York Times Book Review Bellow writes now with as much authority and energy as he did nearly half a century ago Jonathan Yardley the Washington Post Television Roseanne May 20 ABC 8 p m EDT PDT Roseanne s finale after nine seasons leaves reviewers unimpressed but it occasions encomiums for the show s working class grit The most groundbreaking kitchen sink sitcom since All in the Family declares Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly Most agree however that the show declined in its last years especially after Roseanne s character won the lottery and the family forsook its proletarian roots while the actress herself mutated from caustic social critic into pop icon A rich Roseanne Conner says the New York Times Caryn James was as bizarre as the conspicuous physical makeover that no one in the Conner family ever mentioned See David Plotz s Assessment of Roseanne in Slate and ABC s page for the show Also in Slate Larry Doyle s

anti David Copperfield Instead of ornate props and gorgeous showgirls he shares his act lovingly with ordinary men and women in the street writes John O Connor in the New York Times But many find an average performer behind the populist hype Corny card tricks and coin feints and levitation stunts updated with post grunge chic declares Time s David Handelman adding that Blaine s best magic trick

festival s second week It reasserted its claim to seriousness says the New York Times Janet Maslin Credit is given to the two winners of the Palme d Or Iran s The Taste of Cherries about suicide and Japan s The Eel about a man who murdered his wife Still some whining lingers The quintessential Cannes fortnight indeed would involve no films at all just invitations to parties that never happen and rumors of films that will never be made says The New Yorker s Anthony Lane See the Summary Judgment entry for Cannes first week Movies Night Falls on Manhattan Paramount Pictures Critics mostly dismiss Serpico director Sidney Lumet s 41 st film as hackwork Rehashing his favorite subject of New York City police corruption Lumet slaps together they say an implausible plot a year after law school an ex cop becomes a crusading district attorney formulaic characters bad ass drug dealer idealistic liberal defense lawyer and preachy moralizing The predictable lesson justice isn t cut and dry clogs the film s gears says the Washington Post s Eric Brace Among Lumet s defenders are the Los Angles Times Kevin Thomas who says the director makes the unlikely plot twists believable the old fashioned way through interaction with a screen full of strongly drawn fully dimensioned psychologically valid characters Love Valour Compassion Fine Line Features Terrence McNally s Tony winning play from 1994 about eight gay men who vacation together doesn t translate well to film critics say They regard the adaptation which stars Seinfeld shlub Jason Alexander as a stodgy affair Elliott Stein the Village Voice And the hypercampy characters feel like relics of an era when gay men were routinely lampooned more The Boys in the Band than a gay Big Chill says Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment

in the New York Review of Books and T Coraghessan Boyle in the New York Times Book Review Writes Boyle Mason Dixon is a groundbreaking book a book of heart and fire and genius and there is nothing quite like it in our literature except maybe V and Gravity s Rainbow The New Republic s Jed Perl attacks The New Yorker s Adam Gopnik and the New York Times Michael Kimmelman for their elitist attacks on Picasso s popularity If they are frequently just plain hostile to Picasso it could be because they are annoyed at the thought that the public doesn t really need a commentator s help Recent Summary
