 Background The iron status of an individual may play an important role in cardiovascular health with either an excess of iron mainly the storage form ferritin or iron deficiency leading to significant problems Sullivan 1 has proposed that excess iron i e any iron in the ferritin form leads to formation of free radicals that can worsen ischemic myocardial injury and contribute to atherogenesis This hypothesis has considerable experimental 2 3 and epidemiological 4 5 support However the iron hypothesis has not been universally accepted 6 and considerable debate on the role of iron overload on cardiovascular disease continues 7 8 9 10 Iron deficiency has also been shown to lead to ventricular hypertrophy in developing rats 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 While the mechanisms responsible for this hypertrophy have received little research attention studies have documented an eccentric hypertrophic pattern 15 16 17 which has led investigators to suspect a ventricular volume overload at end diastole as a primary hypertrophic stimulus The hypothesized volume load if it occurs does not result from a change in blood volume 18 It has also been hypothesized that a chronic elevation in sympathetic nervous system activity is involved in iron deficiency induced hypertrophy Evidence to support this view includes the observations of increased levels of norepinephrine in plasma and urine and decreased norepinephrine content in the iron deficient heart 19 20 21 22 Rossi 23 after finding that reserpine administration prevented the development of this hypertrophy even suggested that norepinephrine is the causal agent in the pathology While little published research has subsequently focused on iron deficiency hypertrophy there have been numerous studies investigating the role of sympathetic neurotransmission with cardiac hypertrophy induced via various methods coronary artery ligation chronic pressure overload transgenic models etc Most have demonstrated alterations in either plasma or heart norepinephrine content and a de sensitization of the beta adrenergic receptors of the heart 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 Recently the alpha adrenergic receptor has been shown in vitro to be an important modulator of ventricular hypertrophy However even in transgenic animal models overexpressing alpha receptors the beta adrenergic receptor appears to play an important role in hypertrophy development and the transition to heart failure 34 35 Regardless of which receptors are involved in the various forms of hypertrophy the sympathetic nervous system does appear to play a role in most if not all forms of cardiac hypertrophy and much remains to be done in this area 36 Almost no attention has been paid to the peripheral vascular consequences of iron deficiency 37 With iron deficiency the poor oxygen carrying capacity of the blood must be offset in order for the animal to develop to full maturity Therefore the chronic sympathetic activation associated with iron deficiency should result in increased cardiac output In turn flow through the major arterial network would be enhanced in an attempt to maintain near normal oxygen delivery Kamiya and Togawa 38 have found that increased flow stimulates remodeling of an artery to a larger diameter through an endothelial dependent mechanism It has yet to be demonstrated whether iron deficiency will stimulate a similar arterial remodeling Collagen is an integral component of the arterial wall providing rigidity and support Iron is necessary in the synthesis of collagen 39 and collagen content has been shown to be reduced in iron deficient hearts 40 If this is similarly true for arteries in iron deficient animals a significant increase in distensibility would result altering the normal pressure volume relationship We investigated three hypotheses using anesthetized rats First we hypothesized that in iron deficient rats intravenous norepinephrine would cause an altered cardiovascular response either in heart rate or rate of arterial pressure generation contractility dp dt 1 Second we hypothesized that iron deficient arteries would be larger and more distensible than in iron replete controls Finally we hypothesized that a daily injection of the beta adrenergic antagonist propanolol would significantly reduce the development of ventricular hypertrophy Our results suggest that iron deficient hypertrophic hearts display a hyper sensitive inotropic but not chronotropic response to norepinephrine Second abdominal aortas from iron deficient rats display not only increased diameters but also significant increases in distensibility Finally propanolol injections do not prevent the development of iron deficient cardiac hypertrophy drawing into question the potential causal relationship between beta adrenergic neurotransmission and this form of hypertrophy Results and Discussion Body weight heart weight and hematocrit Experiments 1 and 2 Rat growth rate is shown in figure 1 There were no differences between any of the experimental groups see Materials and Methods until the animals reached 45 days of age after which iron deficient rats are of less mass than controls p 0 05 Figure 1also shows the final mean body mass of the four experimental groups Iron deficient and control groups more than doubled their body mass from 1 week to 1 month on the respective diets p 0 0001 The control rats also had a significantly greater mass than the iron deficient rats p 0 0004 in the one month group p 0 0006 but not at one week p 0 1530 The control rats in this study increased mass at a rate similar to that published for the ad libitum fed CD rat 41 42 suggesting growth was inhibited by iron deficiency It is likely that growth inhibition is attributable to metabolic causes arising from both oxygen delivery and mitochondrial insufficiencies associated with iron deficiency 14 The growth data for both the control and iron deficient groups are also similar to that reported for male Wistar rats fed an iron and copper deficient diet 15 but the iron deficient rats at 52 days of age were larger than reports of 10 week old Harlan Sprague Dawley rats fed an AIN 76 iron deficient diet 17 Heart mass increased significantly from 1 week to 1 month of the diets figure 2 p 0 0001 Diet group differences were not apparent at 1 week p 0 8674 but the hearts of iron deficient rats were of greater mass at 1 month p 0 0357 indicating that the heart has undergone hypertrophy by this time These differences remained significant after normalization of heart weight to body weight data not shown This time frame for development of hypertrophy is similar to previous findings with iron or copper deficiency 14 15 16 17 40 43 Mean hematocrit levels figure 2bottom of iron deficient animals were significantly less than controls after 1 month p 0 0001 but not 1 week p 0 3102 of the respective diets Many studies have documented significant hematocrit decreases after one month of an iron deficient diet 14 15 16 17 40 43 However few of these report data for 1 week though one published study indicated a small but significant difference 15 and we have observed a group difference after 1 week of iron deficiency in another study Mullendore et al manuscript in progress We speculate that the ability to create significant iron deficiency in this short time is dependent upon the purity of the iron deficient diet as well as individual animal differences Nonetheless examination of several time points during the progression of iron deficiency can potentially provide important insights into the development of resulting physiological alterations Experiment 1 Cardiodynamics In these experiments an infusion of intravenous saline was used to ensure that the delivery method employed did not evoke a cardiovascular response In all variables measured which include heart rate and ventricular contractility figure 3 systolic and diastolic pressures figure 4 there were no differences between pre infusion and peak responses to saline Therefore any differences seen with intravenous norepinephrine were attributable to the catecholamine and not the infusion per s Prior to the infusion of saline group differences were already apparent between iron deficient and control rats at 1 month in heart rate p 0 0025 systolic p 0 0041 and diastolic pressure p 0 0020 but not contractility p 0 6373 We believe these pressure changes are associated with vascular remodeling as discussed below Figure 3also shows heart rate and contractility immediately prior to and at peak response to intravenous norepinephrine infusions Prior to norepinephrine infusion there were no differences between iron deficient and control groups within each duration in either heart rate or contractility p 0 05 Heart rate was unchanged from pre norepinephrine infusion to peak response p 0 3905 The only difference in peak heart rate response to norepinephrine was the iron deficient group at 1 month p 0 0272 which showed a significant decrease Contractility was significantly increased for both control p 0 0259 and iron deficient p 0 0008 groups from pre infusion to peak response At one month contractility for iron deficient rats increased 43 71 upon norepinephrine infusion while the control group at 1 month increased only 10 0 Figure 3demonstrates a unique response pattern to the sympathetic nervous system neurotransmitter norepinephrine For both control and iron deficient groups the response to norepinephrine is to increase contractility in the absence of chronotropic increases Cardiac output therefore would be expected to increase due to enhanced stroke volume with an uncompromised filling time and a more powerful ventricular contraction In fact this pattern is even more exaggerated in the iron deficient animals at 1 month Heart rate in this group was decreased which allows the animal two potential advantages First ventricular filling time would be increased potentially allowing for greater end diastolic and stroke volumes This would be expected chronically to result in a eccentric hypertrophic pattern a condition that we and others 15 17 have found in iron deficient rat hearts Second the decrease in heart rate in iron deficient hearts when norepinephrine was infused would allow for longer myocardial perfusion time which would compensate for the decreased oxygen carrying capacity of the blood and impaired mitochondrial function 14 The iron deficient norepinephrine response compliments the finding of an increase in capillary lumenal volume in iron deficient hearts 15 which should also allow for better myocardial perfusion during diastole Norepinephrine infusion resulted in a dramatic enhancement of contractility 43 71 in 1 month iron deficient rats when compared to 1 month control rats 10 0 By utilizing a hyper sensitive response to sympathetic stimulation coupled with an unchanged or lower heart rate the iron deficient heart can potentially offset some of the oxygen delivery deficiencies of anemic blood without risking myocardial ischemia These appear to be positive adaptations at least short term in response to a serious nutritional challenge Iron deficient cardiac hypertrophy is not unique in this regard as Lin has recently documented enhanced contractility without increased heart rate in hyper sympathetic transgenic mice 34 In contrast there is a large body of evidence which suggests that cardiac hypertrophy which has progressed to the point of pathology ultimately results in a decrease in contractility 25 26 27 29 30 32 33 44 45 We have not yet investigated whether the iron deficient heart will similarly lose the augmented contractility response in time It has been suggested in several papers that changes in sympathetic nervous system responsiveness may begin as a positive adaptation but ultimately results in pathologic failure of the myocardium For example Engelhardt 46 in a study of mice genetically bred with an increase in beta adrenergic receptor density showed that increased contractility was an initial response but by 35 weeks contractility was reduced by 50 and ejection fraction by 20 The genetically altered hyper adrenergic heart ultimately failed after initial enhancement of cardiac function Mukherjee and Spinale 47 in a recent review concluded that with hypertrophy comes a decrease in cardiac contractility as a result of changes to the L type Ca 2 channel However the authors noted that this adaptation while generally present in a failing hypertrophied myocardium is not necessarily present in less serious cardiac hypertrophies Similarly Tse 48 found that in compensated hypertrophy the population of beta adrenergic receptors is relatively normal but in heart failure the beta receptors have both down regulated and de sensitized Sheridan 49 and Iaccarino 35 came to a similar conclusion regarding heart failure and adrenergic down regulation Figures 4shows systolic and diastolic pressures before and after the norepinephrine infusion There was a significant increase in systolic pressure for both the control p 0 0020 and the iron deficient p 0 0001 groups from pre infusion to peak response Diastolic pressure similarly increased from pre infusion to peak response for both control p 0 0040 and iron deficient p 0 0001 groups when norepinephrine was infused These observations are consistent with the vasoconstrictive effect of norepinephrine Also increased heart contractility is expected to increase peak systolic pressure The diastolic pressure of iron deficient rats was significantly lower than controls both before p 0 0131 and after p 0 0004 norepinephrine infusion This is consistent with the idea of vascular remodeling to a larger arterial diameter with iron deficiency discussed below which could reduce the afterload against which the heart must work to eject blood Experiment 2 Representative aortas from control and iron deficient rats after one month on the respective diets are shown in figure 5 and mean aorta external diameter at 100 mmHg pressure is illustrated in figure 6 There was a significant duration effect p 0 0001 likely due to body growth Overall the diameter of aortas from iron deficient rats was greater than from control rats p 0 0280 The regulation of lumenal diameter in large arteries is accomplished through the maintenance of shear stress along the arterial wall 38 50 51 52 53 54 As blood flow through an artery increases shear is also increased and the endothelium releases nitric oxide for vasodilation 55 Chronically the arterial wall will remodel to a larger diameter to accommodate the increased flow 38 While we did not measure arterial flow through these iron deficient arteries the enhanced inotropic compensation to iron deficiency combined with the enlarged aortic diameter leads us to suspect a flow dependent mechanism for remodeling Future investigations will be necessary to confirm this assertion Aortic distensibility the increase in external diameter during stepwise internal pressure increases is also shown in figure 6 There is a significant group difference p 0 0101 with the iron deficient aortas more compliant than the controls overall A decrease in collagen production with iron deficiency could account for this enhanced distensibility It has been reported that collagen production is reduced in iron deficient hearts 40 but we are aware of no studies that have specifically examined alterations in collagen production in iron deficient arteries Further research regarding this issue is warranted Experiment 3 Figure 7shows the heart weight to body weight ratio for rats that received a daily intra peritoneal injection of either the beta blocker propanolol or saline for 1 month This ratio was significantly greater in rats fed the iron deficient diet than controls p 0 0002 Clearly iron deficient cardiac hypertrophy is not caused by chronic stimulation of beta adrenergic receptors in the heart Many studies have shown that chronic intravenous infusion of norepinephrine is sufficient to cause hypertrophy and that various forms of hypertrophy are linked to a decrease in either beta adrenergic receptor density or a decreased responsiveness to beta adrenergic stimulation 46 48 49 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 Barth for example showed that norepinephrine infusion induced left ventricular hypertrophy that could be prevented by an adrenergic receptor blocker 58 It has been suggested that ornithine decarboxylase is a link between beta adrenoreceptors and stimulation of tissue growth factor which results in hypertrophy 64 However recent studies have focused on alpha adrenergic reception as a mediator of cardiac hypertrophy 35 although some question the role of the alpha adrenergic receptor as a hypertrophic mediator in vivo 34 To date no published studies of which we are aware have examined alpha adrenergic reception and the development of cardiac hypertrophy with iron deficiency The literature surrounding norepinephrine and its role in the development of iron deficient hypertrophy documents the following facts 1 prolonged iron deficiency causes cardiac hypertrophy 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 23 2 the pool of stored norepinephrine in the heart is decreased with iron deficiency 17 21 3 plasma and urine concentrations of norepinephrine are increased with iron deficiency 19 20 21 22 68 and 4 chronic administration of reserpine which depletes norepinephrine prevents the development of iron deficient hypertrophy 12 but not hypertrophy that results from aortic banding 23 This combined with other studies that relate chronic adrenergic stimulation to hypertrophy led Rossi to the conclusion that iron deficiency hypertrophy was caused by chronic sympathetic stimulation However our finding that a daily injection of the beta blocker propanolol does not prevent the development of iron deficient cardiac hypertrophy suggests that beta adrenergic sympathetic stimulation may not be a causal agent in the development of hypertrophy Future investigation is warranted into the potential alpha adrenergic role in this hypertrophy Conclusions The purpose of this study was to investigate cardiac and vascular responses associated with the development of iron deficiency In our first experiment we tested the hypothesis that the iron deficient heart would display an altered response to norepinephrine the sympathetic nervous system neurotransmitter In contrast to what has been seen with most cardiac disease states we found that the iron deficient heart is hyper sensitive to norepinephrine This suggests an adaptive compensation to the depletion of the neurotransmitter stores in the heart sympathetic nerve terminals Further we found that contractility was enhanced but heart rate was not This would allow for the iron deficient animal to increase cardiac output through enhanced stroke volume while maintaining the amount of time available for cardiomyocyte perfusion Our second experiment was designed to investigate whether vascular morphology would be altered with iron deficiency Our results show an increase in abdominal aorta diameter suggesting that a flow dependent remodeling of the arterial wall occurred Also distensibility was significantly increased which we suggest may be due to a reduction in arterial collagen These morphological adjustments can be seen as a positive adaptation to simultaneously reduce afterload on the heart and improve blood flow to peripheral tissues Our final experiment was a simple test to determine if the beta adrenergic antagonist propanolol would prevent hypertrophy The failure of the beta blocker to prevent hypertrophy suggests that if the sympathetic nervous system is a causal agent in the development of this form of hypertrophy the signaling mechanism is not mediated by the beta adrenergic receptor In summary much remains to be learned about this form of hypertrophy Further experimentation may serve to elucidate not only the pathology of iron deficient cardiac hypertrophy but other forms of this pathology as well Materials and methods Experiment 1 cardiovascular response to norepinephrine Experimental procedure Rats were sedated by intra muscular injection right hamstring of 65 mg kg 1body mass ketamine hydrochloride Three minutes later they were anesthetized with 6 5 mg kg 1body mass xylazine Adequate anesthesia was demonstrated by little or no withdrawal reflex to a toe pinch Once anesthetized one PE 50 Becton Dickinson catheter filled with heparinized saline solution 131 9 mM NaCl 4 7 mM KCl 2 0 mM CaCl 2 1 17 mM MgSO 4 17 4 mM NaHCO 3 50 IU heparin sodium was surgically implanted into the right carotid artery and another into the left jugular vein Following catheterization and closure of the incision the carotid catheter was connected to a pressure transducer Cobe Model CDX III and analog to digital conversion system ETH 250 bridge bio amplifier used in bridge mode with an input gain of 100 and a 50 Hz filter C B Sciences Inc and MacLab 4E analog to digital converter A D Instruments Inc The converter was connected via SCSI interface to an accelerated Power Mac 6100 66 computer Apple Computer Inc Cupertino CA Chart software Version 3 4 2 sampling every 0 01 s and set to accept a maximum input of 1 V A D Instruments Inc was used to visualize the output The pressure transducer system was calibrated by mercury manometer at the beginning of each experiment and was found to be linear and consistent throughout the range of pressures measured One hundred microliters of saline solution was infused into the jugular vein catheter and the cardiovascular response was recorded via the carotid pressure transducer until pressure stabilized near its baseline value This procedure was repeated using 100 L of 1 52 mM norepinephrine in saline solution and the arterial trace recorded Data Treatment and Statistical Analysis Cardiovascular variables were analyzed immediately prior to infusion pre infusion and at the maximal pressor response peak response 20 s after jugular infusion Chart software was used to determine minimal diastolic and maximal systolic pressures and heart rate Contractility dP dt 1 was measured as the average slope between each pair of data points within the systolic pulse Pulse pressure was calculated as the difference between systolic and diastolic pressures Analysis of Variance was performed using StatView software Version 5 0 1 SAS Institute Cary NC to determine diet iron deficient vs control and duration 1 week vs 1 month effects Paired t tests were employed to determine significant changes from pre infusion to peak response Dependent variables were heart rate contractility systolic pressure and diastolic pressure Probabilities below 0 05 were accepted as significant for all statistical procedures throughout all experiments in this study Experiment 2 remodeling of abdominal aorta Experimental Procedures After experiment 1 the rats were decapitated The abdominal aorta was carefully exposed and two catheters were surgically implanted The first was inserted just caudal to the superior mesenteric artery and the other just cranial to the inferior mesenteric artery The superior catheter was used for stepwise saline infusions at a range of pressures from 0 120 mmHg Exact pressures were measured via a pressure transducer attached to the inferior catheter Digital images of the abdominal aorta were taken at each pressure with a Kodak DC120 digital camera coupled to a dissecting microscope Leica MZ6 The external diameter of the abdominal aorta was measured using NIH image software Version 1 62 National Institutes of Health Bethesda MD on an accelerated Power Mac 7500 100 Apple Computer Cupertino Ca The system was calibrated by using the digital image of a ruler at the same magnification Data Treatment and Statistical Analysis Regression analysis was performed using aorta external diameter and inflation pressure as dependent and independent variables respectively Distensibility was estimated as the slope of the regression line for each individual animal The external diameter of the abdominal aorta at 100 mmHg pressure was also estimated from the individual regression equations Analysis of Variance was then performed on distensibility and 100 mmHg external diameter Experiment 3 propanolol effects on heart morphology Experimental procedures Ten rats 5 iron deficient and 5 control were given a daily intra peritoneal injection of either propanolol 50 mg kg 1body mass per day or saline solution After 1 month the rats were sacrificed by decapitation and the hearts were carefully extracted and weighed Data treatment and statistical analysis The heart mass to body mass ratio was calculated and Analysis of Variance was performed as above
