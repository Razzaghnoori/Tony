 Background Drosophila melanogaster has been a leading model for the study of aging for over 80 years 1 2 3 4 5 The intensive use of Drosophila as a model for developmental biology has produced a wealth of genetic and molecular biological tools that are readily adapted to the study of aging Aging is associated with characteristic changes at the physiological and molecular level however organismal life span is still the best measure of aging rate The most successful studies of aging generally involve manipulations that increase life span Experimental alterations of environment or genetic makeup that cause decreased life span might create novel diseases or pathologies that do not usually limit life span in a normal individual In contrast a manipulation that increases life span is thought to be more likely to identify mechanisms that normally limit the life span of the organism Laboratory selection of Drosophila populations for late life reproduction results in extended life span 6 7 8 The genetic selection experiments demonstrate that life span has a large genetic component and is highly plastic Increased life span was generally correlated with increased stress resistance including increased oxidative stress resistance 9 10 An important question in the study of aging in invertebrates is whether life span can be increased without a trade off with metabolic activity Certain manipulations that decrease metabolic activity cause increased life span such as lower culture temperature 11 In the genetic selection experiments life span is increased without a reduction in metabolic activity 12 13 Single gene mutations have been identified that increase Drosophila life span These mutations identify negative regulators of life span as mutations expected to decrease activity of the gene lead to increased life span mth encodes a protein related to G protein coupled receptors and appears to negatively regulate life span stress resistance and body size 14 Indy is related to a mammalian cotransporter involved in membrane transport of Krebs cycle intermediates leading to the suggestion that Indy mutations might increase life span by decreasing the availability of nutrients 15 Certain mutant alleles of either the Inr or the chico genes can increase Drosophila life span 16 17 Inr is homologous to the mammalian insulin receptor and insulin like growth factor receptor while chico is homologous to the mammalian insulin receptor substrate The data indicate that an insulin like signaling pathway negatively regulates life span as had previously been found for the nematode C elegans 18 This pathway for life span regulation may be even more highly conserved during evolution as there are many similarities with life span regulation in mammals and in yeast The increased life span regulated by the insulin like signaling pathway in C elegans is associated with increased resistance to stress including oxidative stress 18 19 20 21 This has led to suggestions that increased oxidative stress resistance and decreased amounts of oxidative damage may be the mechanism by which mutation of the insulin like signaling pathway causes increased life span Consistent with this idea life span extension in C elegans is associated with increased expression of the gene encoding the mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme manganese containing superoxide dismsutase MnSOD 22 In Drosophila mutations of chico that extend life span increase total SOD enzyme activity however resistance to oxidative stress was not detectably increased at least not as assayed by paraquat resistance 16 Therefore it remains to be determined if mutation of the insulin like pathway in Drosophila increases life span by increasing SOD activity or by some other mechanism s Increased life span caused by overexpression of a gene by definition identifies a positive regulator of life span Several genes involved in oxidative stress defense have been found to increase life span when overexpressed in transgenic flies These include genes for both forms of SOD the Cu ZnSOD found in the cytoplasm and outer mitochondrial space and MnSOD found in the inner mitochondrial space 23 24 25 These enzymes convert the most common oxygen radical produced by the mitochondria superoxide into hydrogen peroxide and water Abundant catalase enzyme then converts the hydrogen peroxide into molecular oxygen and water Overexpression of Cu ZnSOD or MnSOD increases life span up to about 40 and the amount of life span increase is found to be proportional to the amount of enzyme increase in each case The life span increase caused by SOD overexpression is not associated with a detectable tradeoff in metabolic activity as oxygen consumption was normal throughout the extended life span of the flies 24 Overexpression of the antioxidant enzyme peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase is also associated with increased life span 26 Finally several genes implicated in repair and stress responses have been shown to be able to extend Drosophila life span when the flies are cultured at elevated temperatures 27 28 29 30 Testing specific genes by overexpression in transgenic flies is a candidate gene approach meaning that the investigator must make an educated guess as to which genes are worth assaying by this relatively labor intensive method Recently genetic methods have been developed that allow for the efficient overexpression of random genes in Drosophila P type transposable elements have been engineered to have transcriptional promoters directed out through the end of the element 31 32 These elements will often insert upstream of gene coding regions causing overexpression of the gene and mutant phenotypes The PdL P element contains an outwardly directed tet on promoter 33 34 The transcription of this promoter is activated upon feeding the fly doxycycline leading to conditional gene overexpression and conditional mutations Conditional gene overexpression mutations have several potential advantages for study of aging and life span By waiting until flies are young adults to activate gene overexpression effects can be identified that are specific to adult aging The system also provides powerful controls for genetic background effects because control no DOX and over expressing DOX flies have identical genetic backgrounds and therefore any differences in life span must be due to DOX administration and gene overexpression The PdL system allows the investigator to search for genes that can increase life span without having to guess ahead of time which genes these might be Therefore the approach has the potential to identify genes and pathways not previously known or suspected to be involved in life span regulation Results In the rtTA transgenic construct the powerful and tissue general actin5C promoter drives expression of the rtTA transcriptional transactivator 33 When flies are fed doxycycline rtTA binds to target sequences in the synthetic tet on promoter in the PdL P element This outwardly directed promoter often causes overexpression of genes near the PdL insertion site and yields various mutant phenotypes 34 PdL is 8 4 kilobases kb long and contains the P element inverted repeats the mini white transformation marker gene and the 500 base pair bp tet on promoter directed out through the 3 end of the element The tet on promoter contains no open reading frame ORF or translation initiation sequences Therefore PdL must insert upstream of an endogenous translation intiation site ATG to cause overexpression of a protein The transcripts initiated within PdL will therefore contain 280 bp of 5 untranslated sequence derived from PdL itself To search for genes that might extend life span new insertions of PdL were created on the second and third chromosomes by appropriate crosses to a strain expressing P element transposase Figure 1 Approximately 10 000 males bearing a new PdL insert and an rtTA transcriptional transactivator insertion were generated The males were generated in eight staggered groups each of around 1 200 individuals In an attempt to increase the variety of mutations identified two different rtTA insertion strains were used The first six cohorts of males contained an insertion of the rtTA construct called rtTA 3 E2 that is associated with moderate levels of target gene expression and low levels of leaky expression in the absence of DOX 33 The last two cohorts of males contained an rtTA insertion called rtTA 3 M1 which is associated with a high level of target gene expression and greater leaky expression To obtain adult flies of defined age the second cross was cultured at 25 C in urine specimen bottles Figure 1 Prior to eclosion of the majority of pupae bottles were cleared of adults and flies were allowed to emerge over the next 48 hours The majority of the males will have mated during this time The males only were then removed and were designated 1 day old and were maintained at 25 C at 40 per vial in culture vials with food supplemented with 250 g ml DOX and passaged to new vials every 48 hours The expectation was that some of these flies might live longer due to the overexpression of a beneficial gene For the first four cohorts at approximately 30 survival of the cohort each of the males was individually mated with four third chromosome balancer stock virgin females This was so that a stable line could be recovered later if that fly was found to be one of the longest lived Only about 21 of these males were found to be fertile meaning that there was selection for males that maintained fertility during aging After 4 days the fertile males were removed from the crosses placed in individual numbered vials and passaged every two days until they were all dead For the rest of the cohorts the males were mated at approximately 65 survival of the cohort which increased the frequency of fertile males to about 32 Stable lines were recovered for the approximately 1 4 longest lived flies from each cohort These 144 lines should therefore be enriched for ones in which PdL is causing overexpression of a gene with a benefit for life span In addition lines in which PdL causes overexpression of a gene with large negative effects on life span should have been eliminated by this step Each of the 144 new PdL insertion lines was crossed to the appropriate rtTA chromosome strain and males containing both constructs were assayed in large cohorts around 400 flies for doxycycline dependent effects on life span Figure 2 The mean life spans of the different strains in the absence of DOX varied greatly from 40 to 84 days Both increases and decreases were observed in the presence of DOX For the 110 lines tested with rtTA 3 E2 there was an average 1 8 increase in the presence of DOX Figure 2a and for the 34 lines tested with rtTA 3 M1 an average 3 0 increase in the presence of DOX Figure 2b consistent with previous results that DOX itself has little to no effect on life span However several lines were identified where there was a significantly greater than average increase in life span in the presence of DOX To confirm these results these lines were assayed one or more additional times Table 1 As a control Oregon R wild type flies were repeatedly crossed to the rtTA strains and assayed for life span in parallel The Oregon R controls exhibited changes in life span from 5 14 to 4 71 with an average change of 0 45 In contrast six PdL lines were found to yield significant and reproducible increases in life span in the presence of DOX ranging from 5 to 17 Line PdL 3 3E36 was associated with the largest increase in life span average 12 Table 1 The PdL insert in this line was located in the large first intron of the encore gene 35 with the promoter oriented in the sense direction Figure 3a PdL caused the expression of a pair of approximately 1 4 kb transcripts that contain a 44 amino acid ORF identified by the Drosophila genome project as CG14975 as determined by northern blot with a CG14975 probe These transcripts were not detected in the absence of DOX in the adult males and this putative gene was named Red herring Rdh Northern analysis using a probe from encore exon 3 indicated that levels of the normal sized encore transcript were not detectably altered by DOX as indicated by the arrowhead Figure 3a However DOX appeared to induce expression of both larger and smaller RNAs containing encore coding region sequences resulting in a smear of hybridization in the upper part of the lane as indicated by the asterisk Representative survival curves are presented Figure 3a Line PdL 2 4G14 contains an insert at the 5 end of the VhaSFD gene encoding the vacuolar proton pump ATPase H ATPase SFD subunit 36 DOX caused an approximately fourfold overexpression of the VhaSFD transcript and an average 8 increase in life span Figure 3b Representative survival curves for the PdL 2 4G14 line are presented Figure 3b Line PdL 3 2C33 contains an insert at the 5 end of a gene with homology to a maltose permease from Bacillus stearothermophilus 37 which was named Sugar baby Figure 3c DOX caused an approximately 8 5 fold overexpression of the Sugar baby transcript and was associated with an average 6 increase in life span Three genes with previously characterized mutant phenotypes were also identified by PdL insertions Line PdL 3 8S64 contained an insert at the 5 end of the filamin gene A transcript Figure 3d Filamin is an actin binding protein involved in cytokinesis and ring canal formation 38 39 filamin A was overexpressed approximately fivefold in the presence of DOX and associated with an average 8 5 increase in life span Expression of the filamin B transcript was not detectably altered Line PdL 3 8S25 contained an insert at the 5 end of the B transcript of the four wheel drive fwd gene Figure 3e fwd encodes a 1 phosphatidylinositol 4 kinase PI 4 kinase that regulates actin organization and ring canal formation during germline cytokinesis 40 fwd B was overexpressed approximately 10 fold and associated with an average 8 increase in life span Finally line PdL 3 8R128 had an insert at the 5 end of the CTP phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase 1 Cct1 gene Figure 3f Cct1 encodes a homolog of the rate limiting enzyme in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis 41 Cct1 was overexpressed approximately 1 7 fold and was associated with an average 7 increase in life span Discussion The genetic screen described here had several unusual aspects and the potential to identify a novel set of genes involved in life span regulation First the screen was designed to identify positive regulators of life span that is genes that will increase life span when overexpressed Most genetic screens for life span regulators in Drosophila and other organisms such as C elegans have involved loss of function mutations and therefore have identified negative regulators of life span 14 15 42 43 Second mutants were identified on the basis of the phenotype of increased life span under normal conditions as opposed to some surrogate phenotype expected to correlate with life span such as increased stress resistance Because the PdL mutations generated here were screened directly for extended life span under normal conditions the screen had the potential to identify genes and pathways not previously suspected to have a role in aging and life span regulation Results were reported recently for a screen for positive regulators of life span using a different P element based gene overexpression strategy 29 In that study a heat stress inducible system was used and lines were screened for life span at the moderate heat stress condition of 30 C Several genes were identified that increased survival when overexpressed including genes involved in heat stress and oxidative stress responses It is interesting to note that there is no overlap with the genes identified here with PdL at 25 C This may be due to the small fraction of the genome that has been tested so far or it may indicate that different mechanisms limit life span under normal and moderate heat stress conditions It is difficult to estimate the number of genes that were tested in the PdL screen but it is certain to have been only a tiny fraction of the genome In previous experiments approximately 7 of PdL insertions were found to cause lethal and visible phenotypes when the PdL promoter was activated during larval and pupal development 34 Seven percent is certainly a large underestimate of the frequency at which genes are overexpressed as embryogenesis was not tested and not all genes will be lethal or have an obvious visible phenotype when overexpressed The original 10 000 PdL insertions generated here went through an initial enrichment step of unknown efficiency to yield the 144 lines that were tested in large cohorts Lines in which a gene was overexpressed that had a positive effect on life span should have been enriched in the final 144 lines whereas ones with a significant negative effect should have been eliminated The enrichment step appears to have been at least partially successful as the largest negative effect on life span observed among the 144 lines tested was 7 5 and PdL is known to be able to create mutations with negative effects of up to 30 34 The molecular characterization of the mutations suggests a low frequency of false positives If the six PdL insertion strains were a random set then PdL would be expected to sometimes be in the wrong orientation and or downstream of the ATG translation start However all six lines were found to have PdL insertions at the 5 end of a gene and oriented in the sense direction and in all six lines a transcript was overexpressed that was expected to contain a complete ORF The magnitude of life span increases caused by the PdL mutations was generally small ranging from 5 to 17 This is in contrast to overexpression of SOD genes or certain single gene mutations such as mth where life span increases range from 20 to 50 14 23 24 25 There are at least two possible reasons for the relatively small life span increases observed here First as only a fraction of the genome has been tested it may be that genes with larger effects exist but have not yet been identified Second the tet on system is sometimes leaky meaning that at certain genomic locations there can be significant expression of the tet on promoter in the absence of DOX 33 It is possible that in some of the lines the increase in life span between DOX and DOX is reduced because there is already some gene overexpression and life span extension in the DOX flies Such a line might be expected to have an unusually high DOX life span relative to the other lines and it is notable that this appears to be the case for the lines bearing mutations in the VhaSFD and Sugar baby genes When this difference is included in the calculations the life span increases for VhaSFD and Sugar baby are approximately 20 and 17 respectively The largest average increase in life span caused by DOX 12 was obtained for the PdL 2 3E36 insertion in the large first intron of the encore gene A pair of approximately 1 4 kb transcripts was expressed containing a 44 amino acid ORF with no detectable homologies While there are a number of Drosophila genes encoding functional ORFs of this size it is also possible that these transcripts do not encode a functional protein but rather function at the RNA level to affect life span There are no cDNAs in the databases containing these intronic sequences and we were unable to detect these transcripts in wild type adult males using northern blots The data suggest that these transcripts are not expressed under normal conditions or are expressed at very low levels Further experiments will be required to determine the mechanism of life span extension in this line and the elusive nature of the intronic gene suggested the name Red herring The northern analyses also indicated induction of a small amount of a large transcript containing the encore coding region Therefore it is also possible that the life span extension in this line is caused by an increase in the expression of encore encore is a member of a novel family of proteins with multiple functions during Drosophila oogenesis 44 Two of the genes identified appear to be involved in membrane transport The VhaSFD gene encodes the Drosophila homolog of the vacuolar H ATPase SFD subunit The vacuolar ATPase is an ATP driven proton pump found in the endomembranes of eukaryotic cells 36 45 46 47 It is composed of a cytoplasmic ATPase domain called V 1 that contains VhaSFD and other subunits and a multisubunit membrane channel component called V 0 The vacuolar ATPase is involved in the acidification and energization of organelles such as Golgi derived vesicles clathrin coated vesicles synaptic vesicles and lysosomes The proton pumping is required for processes such as protein trafficking receptor mediated endocytosis neurotransmitter release and intracellular pH regulation and waste management The free membrane V 0 domain has also been implicated in membrane fusion events In higher organisms the vacuolar H ATPase is also found in the plasma membrane of specialized epithelial cells where it functions in bulk transport In Drosophila this is the Malpighian or renal tubule The VhaSFD subunit is required for the ATPase activity and assembly of the vacuolar H ATPase and may function as a dissociable regulatory subunit Therefore overexpression of VhaSFD may affect life span by increasing activity of the vacuolar H ATPase The Sugar baby gene is related to a maltose permease from Bacillus stearothermophilus 37 suggesting that it may function in transport of maltose or other sugars across a membrane Recently loss of function mutations in another putative membrane transporter Indy have been found to increase life span 15 It is possible that overexpression of the putative transporter encoded by Sugar baby could increase life span by increasing uptake of a particular sugar and altering energy metabolism pathways Filamin is an actin binding protein with a homolog in humans called actin binding protein 280 ABP280 38 39 Filamin binds to several cell membrane proteins and intercellular ligands involved in signal transduction and appears to act as a downstream effector in remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton During Drosophila oogenesis filamin localizes to the ring canals which are membrane associated actin cytoskeletal structures that create intercellular bridges between germline cells Loss of function mutations of filamin disrupt the normal function of these actin cytoskeletal structures Filamin has several additional interactions with potential relevance to aging studies Presenilins are membrane proteins found in both humans and Drosophila and mutations in human presenilins are associated with early onset familial Alzheimer s disease FAD 48 Drosophila filamin binds to both Drosophila and human presenilins and filamin interacts genetically with presenilin in Drosophila 49 Dominant adult phenotypes produced in Drosophila by overexpression of presenilin can be suppressed by overexpression of filamin Filamin also interacts specifically with Drosophila Toll and Tube proteins 50 Toll and Tube are members of a signal transduction pathway that activates the Rel transcription factor Dorsal and is involved in developmental patterning and in the adult immune response Several of the immune response genes regulated by Rel transcription factors are dramatically induced during Drosophila aging G L J Carrick and J T unpublished data fwd encodes a phosphatidylinositol 4 kinase PI 4 kinase that converts phosphatidylinositol PI to phosphatidylinositol 4 phosphate PIP 40 This is the first step in the synthesis of the key regulatory membrane phospholipid PIP2 which is generated from PIP by a PI 4 5 kinase PIP2 interacts directly with a number of proteins regulating both their sub cellular localization and their activity Data from yeast and mammalian systems implicates homologous PI 4 kinases and PIP2 in regulation of secretion and membrane vesicle trafficking 51 52 In Drosophila fwd gene function is required for the formation of ring canals and cytoplasmic bridges during cytokinesis in male meiosis PIP2 is also the precursor to the important second messengers PIP3 and diacylglycerol PIP3 is involved in the insulin like signaling pathway that affects life span in Drosophila and C elegans 53 and it will be of interest to determine if fwd overexpression is somehow affecting this pathway CTP phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase Cct catalyzes the conversion of phosphocholine to CDP choline and is the rate limiting enzyme in the phosphatidylcholine biosynthetic pathway 41 Phosphatidylcholine is a major membrane phospholipid and is a precursor to second messengers involved in signal transduction at the membrane including the PIP PIP2 and PIP3 discussed above There are two genes encoding Cct in Drosophila Cct1 and Cct2 and mutations in the Cct1 gene disrupt patterning during oogenesis T Gupta and T Schupbach personal communication Overexpression of Cct1 might affect life span by increasing synthesis of phosphatidylcholine and altering membrane structure and or phospholipid signaling pathways It is striking that most of the genes identified in this screen as positive regulators of Drosophila life span are implicated in functions at the membrane including regulation of transport phospholipid metabolism signal transduction and actin cytoskeleton organization It is tempting to speculate that some of these genes may be acting in the same pathway s for life span regulation For example both filamin and fwd are involved in the function of ring canals which are membrane associated actin cytoskeletal structures that create intercellular bridges between germline cells during early mitotic divisions 38 39 40 encore is also required for normal early mitotic division of the germline cells 44 In C elegans germline cells have recently been shown to send signals that regulate life span of the adult organism 54 55 56 and it will be of interest to determine if any of the genes identified here increase life span through effects on the germline Both fwd and Cct1 are involved in phospholipid metabolism and phospholipid signaling pathways are implicated in life span regulation in Drosophila and other organisms 53 The conserved insulin like life span regulatory pathway includes a PI 3 kinase that converts PIP2 into PIP3 The enzymes encoded by fwd and Cct1 are both in the biosynthetic pathway for PIP2 and therefore might affect the insulin like pathway by altering the availability of this substrate Further experiments will be required to confirm the role of these genes in life span regulation and to determine their interactions with each other and in known or novel life span regulatory pathways Materials and methods Drosophilastrains All D melanogaster strains are as described 33 34 57 58 Drosophilaculture and life span assays Drosophila were cultured on standard agar molasses corn meal yeast media 59 To obtain adult flies of defined age the indicated PdL lines and Oregon R control strain were crossed to an rtTA stock and cultured at 25 C in urine specimen bottles Prior to eclosion of the majority of pupae bottles were cleared of adults and newly eclosed flies were allowed to emerge over the next 48 h The majority of the males will have mated during this time The males only were then removed and were designated 1 day old and were maintained at 25 C at 40 per vial in culture vials with food At 4 days of age the males were split into control and experimental groups of 200 males each with experimentals DOX placed on culture media supplemented with 250 g ml DOX Dead flies were counted at each passage and the number of vials was progressively reduced to maintain approximately 40 flies per vial To calculate mean life spans for the experimental DOX and control DOX cohorts each fly s life span was tabulated and their life spans were averaged and the standard error of the mean SEM calculated Statistical significance of differences in mean life span was calculated for each experiment using unpaired two sided t tests ANOVA Two way analysis of variance ANOVA was performed for each life span dataset The first dataset
