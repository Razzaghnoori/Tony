 Gone With the Wind Cold Mountain is sincerely plausible It is a solemn fake You will not hear this from the readers and judges who have helped make Charles Frazier s Civil War tale probably the most popular novel about that period since Gone With the Wind Since its publication in June Cold Mountain has sold more than a million copies in November it won the National Book Award The book is so professionally archaeological so competently dug that one can mistake its surfaces for depth But it s like a cemetery with no bodies in it All the records of life are there the facts and figures and pocket histories pointing up out of the ground but what s buried there was never alive Most people don t want novels to be in the deepest sense unreal They want them to obey the conventions of current realism Thus John Berendt author of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil has said of Cold Mountain that it is utterly convincing down to the last detail And he s right But Cold Mountain is utterly convincing in an unreal way Frazier has written a stirring story of bloody simplicity and epic power As a storyteller he hardly ever errs This is a remarkably tremorless first novel It is the story of Inman a Confederate soldier who is wounded in 1864 and briefly hospitalized and who then deserts to find his way home He travels raggedly from Tennessee to the mountains of North Carolina where he had grown up There near Cold Mountain waits his sweetheart a woman called Ada Monroe The daughter of an upper class Charleston S C minister who has died just before the book begins she is struggling to make her old farm profitable The novel alternates Inman s story and Ada s story She waits he travels Inman is silent good and strong one must imagine a Confederate Clint Eastwood He is metaphysically alone as the conventions of adventure dictate He wished not to be smirched with the mess of other people But messes just keep on smirching him He goes through a shower of picaresque trials Three men set on him he single handedly beats them off he saves a pregnant woman from death and another woman from a band of renegade federal soldiers various men try to recapture him he is seduced by a woman whose husband discovering the couple tries to shoot him Inman s conversation in late 20 th century writing school style is intelligently starved It is still a cloudy matter to me if I did the right thing letting you live and his inner life is carefully rationed He is a Homeric foot soldier Frazier has said he had Odysseus in mind and quite unreal The novel s unreality flows from Inman s unreality Cold Mountain rolls the brougham of itself from episode to episode until Inman reaches home A puff of sentimentality is exhaled at the end of the book Inman is reunited with Ada only to be shot down at the last minute But the tragic couple was permitted a night of passion and a moist epilogue shows a happy little girl the product of this union frolicking with her mother some years later the happy end of a happy ending Frazier is a good writer calm for the most part unsentimental often rich But the novel is a refined exercise It is worth bearing in mind that Frazier was until recently a professor of English although the jacket copy omits this fact preferring us to believe that he and his family merely raise horses in Raleigh N C Cold Mountain is in fact a willed pastiche of Stephen Crane that is modern prose with occasional attacks of nostalgia There was not moonlight nor the prick of lantern light from some welcoming home The town of Cold Mountain was ahead but they knew not how far Or this as Inman battles the three thieves H e eventually smote the three down to their knees in the dirt of the street so they looked like those of the Romish faith at prayer Such prose if not quite antiquarian s dust is the carbon of something once fiery It is not a living 19 th century prose or a living contemporary prose but rather a 20 th century reduction living off the alms of the 19 th century Frazier does the opposite of writers such as Melville or Woolf who historicize the language by shaking its roots Linguistically he is not in search of the historically rejuvenating but the historically plausible But most great historical fiction George Eliot Stendhal Tolstoy is not written in historical prose Crane in The Red Badge of Courage wrote in 1895 about the Civil War but it would not have occurred to him to write in anything but the living language of his own age which admittedly was closer to the earlier period s than Frazier s is To compare Crane and Frazier is to compare a genuine fibrous style with academic tissue Frazier controls all his similes so that they stay ruly His similes there is at least one per page are either trimmed for historical plausibility like the thieves Romishly at prayer or more frequently made to involve an animal the idea perhaps being that in simpler times a homely rustic simile would have come to mind So we have a man s tongue grey as the foot of a goose a catfish the size of a boar hog a man who gets ready to take a blow like a cowed dog a night as dark as the inside of a cow an old man whose dugs hung down like those on a sow hog an entire farmyard of likenesses Crane by contrast lets his similes go everywhere In battle one man has a shoeful of blood He hopped like a schoolboy in a game A corpse is seen and Crane describes the dead man s beard moving in the wind as if a hand were stroking it In short Frazier sacrifices aesthetic life to historical life The result is that while one continues to believe Cold Mountain on the surface one stops believing it at any deeper level There is a false consciousness to a late 20 th century writer s efforts to evoke a 19 th century man in a language that belongs to neither When Inman is seduced for instance he places his hand on the woman s leg high up Frazier writes of the woman s genitals that to Inman they seemed extraordinarily fascinating though it was but a mere slot in flesh The reader realizes instantly that a deserting soldier would never think like this that he would never use these upholstered words The private language of a man like that would be both simpler and more strange more original than Frazier s ecclesiastical English Instead we have Frazier s fancy plausible idea of how a vagina might have been described in 1864 had this been written down But Inman is not writing anything down he is being seduced he is speaking to himself One sees that Cold Mountain is condemned to be a literary approximation of an already literary idea of reality Henry James complained to Sarah Orne Jewett in a letter of 1904 that the historical novel had a fatal cheapness Although the novelist might be able to render well all sorts of facts and dates and general furniture she could never truthfully render the old consciousness The great historical novels are always about contemporary consciousness This inability to convey the old consciousness was not a matter of inaccuracy but of bad faith It would always be the new consciousness imagining what the old consciousness was like forcing it to be old And even then James added it s all humbug Cold Mountain is advanced humbug
