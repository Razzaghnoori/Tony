 September 15 1992 Name Address City ST Zip Dear Mr Name The space age began with the launch of Sputnik in October 1957 This remarkable accomplishment happened during the first semester of my junior year at DePauw University where by sheer coincidence I was being severely challenged by an Introduction to Classical Mechanics where I was studying the equations of gravity and orbital motion as taught by Dr Correll Believe me I never dreamed that some 25 years later my life would depend on my precise understanding of real time solutions to these same equations Had I known such strange events would occur I assure you I would have spent much more time studying physics in Minshall Lab and less time playing bridge in the Hub The point is the liberal arts education you and I received at DePauw gave us the tools to learn and I m convinced instilled in us the curiosity to keep learning In our changing world the sky is no longer the boundary to our travels In our changing world there are likewise no boundaries to where a DePauw education can lead us That s why I m writing to you and asking for your help in this year s Annual Fund Why should we support DePauw Simply stated we must offer the 2 100 students now enrolled at the University those same opportunities to develop skills they will need to meet ever moving challenges Through our support of the Annual Fund you and I can help continue the educational tradition we enjoyed a strong foundation for a lifetime of continued learning and growth There is no doubt in my mind that the pop quizzes my dad Professor Perk Allen gave his accounting students served an important purpose His lesson of be prepared real life will test you every day was carried by each of his students into their individual careers It is practical advice that remains true today Is a liberal arts education still sufficient Some argue that the growing pace of technology makes a liberal arts education less valuable in the 90s I believe just the opposite A liberal arts education is even more valuable today precisely because technology outdates itself so rapidly The ability to keep learning to keep discovering and to keep inventing becomes even more important if we are to compete in tomorrow s world For example when I was at DePauw the most technical educational experience I can remember was visiting the IBM plant east of Greencastle to observe the manufacture of computer cards This was the future Yet those cards quickly became obsolete as computers shrank in size and new data handling technologies were invented Today we can readily buy lap top computers with data storage capacity far greater than that entire IBM factory could have offered Yes as a science student at DePauw I did learn the methods of mathematics and the mechanics of physics More importantly I remember that professors like Dr Gass and Dr Cook also taught us to persevere in the face of occasional failures and instilled in us the confidence to tackle complicated sounding subjects subjects which might be difficult to learn but which could yield great rewards And coaches like Mike Snavely and Charlie Erdmann taught us about the importance of teamwork not only on the playing field but in the classroom and in the dormitories fraternities and sororities during the course of our daily lives as undergraduates Your memories are probably very similar Regardless of when you studied in Greencastle the fact is that the only way we can keep up with changes of today s world is to possess the energy and the ability to continue learning Through some 30 years so far my DePauw education hasn t let me down The challenges I face today in applying new technology in the manufacturing of low cost space products depend upon my ability to keep learning Believe it or not the wondrous Sputnik satellite of 1957 compares to a 1990s communications satellite as those obsolete IBM computer cards compare to modern disk storage units You have your own special memories and reasons to support DePauw but we are all members of the DePauw family of friends classmates and special professors My closeness to the University is strengthened by a family legacy which goes back over 100 years to my great great grandfather Professor William F Swahlen who taught Greek at Indiana Asbury from 1887 1914 and carried on with my great grandfather Joseph P Allen 97 my mother Harriet Taylor Allen 28 my father Joseph P Perk Allen 30 professor emeritus of economics my brother Dr David T Allen 61 my wife Bonnie Darling Allen 61 and continues today with my nephew Tim Allen 92 Like mine your ties to DePauw are a part of a proud tradition on a campus where the sense of history is treasured And these ties coupled with our classroom experience are a valuable part of our DePauw education We must pass this tradition along Our generous gifts to the Annual Fund will give today s students the opportunities that older alumni shared with us by making their gifts to the Fund This year your Class of 1943 celebrates its golden anniversary and it s time once again to reminisce about your days at DePauw Please consider making a special gift this year in honor of your reunion and those special memories Your support will make a difference I really believe that our support of DePauw does matter The DePauw classes of 1993 1994 1995 and 1996 can make a difference in today s world They matter and our support to them matters We must invest in their future and ours Sincerely Joseph P Joe Allen 59
