 Patricia Smith age 59 and I m from Connecticut What kind of stories were told to you as a child We have a family picture of me and my brother and sister sitting on the couch with my mother reading us a story I do not remember what the story was about Um the stories I remember the most was listening to the radio Um I don t remember stories from my mother reading them It was a stand up big radio we didn t have a TV at this time and I sat leaning on the radio listening to my favorite The Shadow Only the Shadow Knows a mystery story every week I do not remember being read to with books I remember one night though having to walk up the street to the farmhouse to get milk It was Christmastime and it was cold and being bundled up I walked at nighttime slowly up the street There was a full moon I slowly looked up at the moon and saw a gold sleigh and Santa approaching the left side of the moon I was surprised and did not believe what I was seeing so I paused and I gazed in awe that I actually saw Santa and the sleigh I couldn t get it out of my mind as I continued my walk When I got home I told everyone and don t remember any responses I was told by a friend there was no Santa that really bothered me so I asked my dad one night during the Christmas season He had a way of speaking with a strong voice that we never questioned when he used it And when he when I told him what my friend said he sat me down saying That is not true there is a Santa in that voice we never questioned Your friend is wrong and let me tell you why And he just proceeded with his loving logic and questions to prove to me there really was a Santa Everything he said made sense to me and I could feel myself well up inside with pride and love for my father and I felt so good and happy that my friend was now wrong and I was right and there really was a Santa and that Santa was in my heart and mind now Which one was your favorite story That was my favorite story it was the most impactful story And to this day I can still remember feeling so proud that my dad convinced me and all those feelings of believing that that was true and I can still feel that today Did you read books or tell stories to your children Yes I did both I read books and told stories What kind of books did you read to your children Where did you read them Why did you read them Well uh Children s books um like Dr Seuss and I did a lot of books on feelings about being sad happy neat and angry and things like that um so they could understand the feelings at those levels And um I got books like transactional analysis which they called TA for tots and I m OK You re OK um a gamut of fairytales uh like The Three Little Pigs and things like that every I love children s books and every children s book I could get I brought for the kids Um I had many many books for my children Uh the books were always available to them I read to them at bedtime uh in their beds other times they sat in my lap during the day um like going over the pictures the sounds and the tone of voice uh through me um as to what the character was feeling scared happy angry When I felt like it um it would be effective and my children s behavior said They were really into this story at that point then I would add my own words and make up more of what had caught their interest Um being each character myself as I read added added more excitement for them and for me Sometimes we d lay on the carpet and read and I d follow their interest when to stop and when to start and when sometimes to turn the page It was all up to their interest Um I read at bedtime as a calming down for all of us being together and ending our day Sitting on the couch with them uh gave me the feeling of closeness and the uh children s closeness or bonding with me Um and when we read was whenever anybody wanted to read and sometimes I would introduce a new book to them and say I have a new story for you OK What kind of stories did you tell your children Do you recall any of them Oh yeah oh yeah I recall them I made up stories um that I told to my children also They were older and enjoyed scary uh scary stories at that time So I told them scary stories that chilled them At bedtime um when all were in the same bed and that s where they had to be for these stories Um I usually made up a story according to what they were feeling at different points in their lives Their favorite was The Wood Monster uh sometimes the kids felt like running away from home and whatever I would pick up with the kids that they were issuing is what I would make a story out of and to get my point across to them too Um this this story involved this Wood Monster story involved kids that uh felt like running away from home and this story involved kids who decided to do just that one late night Um they sneaked out of their bedroom windows and they all met and went into the woods Um as they thought this was really cool and they were sitting under a big tree in the woods the branches started moving the kids thinking uh that the wind was doing it but when the branches started to slowly come down and start touching them they got scared and the branches were trying to wrap around them then the trunk of the tree started bending also And they all started screaming running away They discovered as they ran by each tree in the woods that all the trees were alive and wanting to attach their branches around them There was nowhere they could go to free themselves of this nightmare except home So they finally all decided that this was not the thing and they got back into the house uh through their window and felt the safe warm comfort of their beds and vowed never to do that again And also certain stuffed animals my kids had were um were also made alive by me When they got thrown on the floor and not cared about I made up a story about how the animal felt being treated that way when it loved them so much and wanted to be snuggled up by them at night I played the animal of course and then with your arms around it I still do this once and awhile with my adult children One of my children was really drawn into this story and today she is very sensitive and compassionate with animals Um I also sent my young adult children Easter bunnies and the loving message that went with it uh was from the bunny Like this bunny talked with me at the store and he was so sweet and loving and really wanted to be with one of you one of my kids and not left on the shelf in the store all by himself so I would create that kind of story and attach it to the bunnies and send them to my children Do you read stories now And If so what kind Um I some of them are made into stories um see for the past maybe 25 30 years I ve read many new age books uh from channeling to personal stories by the authors relating to their major life changes Um I have read many self awareness books and management books and books on raising children All of my reading basically involved self improvement at each level of my growth um including spiritual growth I read all of these books to help me be a more effective parent person manager and spiritual being Um my best reading time was in bed where I had no interruptions um and then I could focus on the information And I still send my adult children books on topics I think they could gain deeper insight to What s your favorite book now Um my very favorite book is God on a Harley Um it through that book it was me going through all the same experiences as the author and I saw more clearly what I needed to do OK well thanks Pat You
