 Background Clinical Importance of a Precancer Classification The best medical discoveries are generalizable For example if antibiotics were only effective on a single bacteria Alexander Fleming s chance discovery would have had limited medical value Bacteria have common biological properties e g a cell wall small size etc that make them different from flowers insects and people Knowledge of the general properties of bacteria can inspire therapeutic strategies that extend its value to all the members of its class Bacteriologists learn the names of all the different bacteria and group the different bacteria based on shared properties Bacteriologists use their knowledge of bacterial classes to develop new antibiotics and new therapeutic strategies Classification efforts typically begin by listing all the members of the classification domain i e creating a taxonomy Until now there has been no effort to list the precancers and or to associate precancer terms with their synonyms Any given precancer may have been studied by different researchers using different terms for the same lesion Absent a definitive terminology distinct lesions may have been studied under the same name The absence of a comprehensive precancer terminology severely limits the clinical value of research that includes precancer specimens Until now there has been no effort to group the precancers by shared clinical morphologic or biomolecular features If an agent were discovered that induced regression of a particular precancer there would be no organized precancer classification prompting anyone to select biologically related lesions likely to respond to the same agent It is the opinion of the authors that precancers should have a biological classification Database annotations using the precancer classification will provide a mechanism whereby each precancer its related precancerous lesions and the cancers known to develop from these lesions can be linked with relevant data contained in biological data sets e g gene expression arrays and proteomics arrays tissue microarrays pathology data sets Informatics Aspects of Classification Modern classifications serve as informatics devices capable of linking integrating and retrieving information contained in diverse biological data sets Creators of biomedical databases use terminologies to annotate individual data elements Data annotation involves appending descriptive information to experimental data with the intention of creating an encapsulated data object that can be intelligently connected to related data in other databases Annotations are a critical part of the data because the annotations assist in the discovery of the biological relevance of the data element Lesions annotated with terminology from the same classification can be linked even when they occur in heterogeneous data sets In the last several years a new type of data annotation model has emerged that will greatly enhance the research value of publicly available datasets This model is the self describing data collection In this model all of the data fields are tagged by metadata Metadata is data that describes the data elements XML Extensible Mark up Language is the most popular format for metadata annotation 4 The precancer classification is embodied in an XML file The data elements of the classification are instances of the precancer domain and the properties of the domain instances Examples of precancer data elements are values such as DCIS and Actinic keratosis and 000932 and ENG The metadata are the flanking tags such as concept synonym cui and language The Precancer XML file itself is annotated with sufficient information that anyone opening the file can fully understand the file contents Now and in the future researchers will need to organize their data in a way that permits thoughtful analysis Laboratories will be producing terabytes of data in the form of images tissue micoarrays gene expression arrays and proteomic arrays None of this data will have any value unless it is described in a standard manner that computers can understand Classifications exist to organize the instances of a domain so that information assembled from databases can be generalized or related to defined taxonomic groups Definition of Precancer and Common Terms in Use During carcinogenesis morphologically identifiable lesions occur that precede the development of invasive cancer These lesions are called precancers premalignancies preneoplastic lesions incipient cancers intraepithelial neoplasias and preinvasive cancers The plethora of terms reflects the difficulty of choosing a best canonical class term for the precancerous lesions Currently the term intraepithelial neoplasia seems to enjoy wide usage among the community of pathologists but this term has limitations 1 Not all epithelial precancers are intraepithelial Most of the mucosal dysplasias have a well defined territory bounded by the junction between the epithelium and the underlying stroma But not all premalignant epithelial lesions can be identified by the presence of atypical cell populations delimited by a basement membrane Dysplastic lesions of the liver kidney thyroid and adrenal are not delimited by a basement membrane 1 2 Not all precancers are epithelial 1 Intratubular germ cell neoplasms of testis myelodysplasias and non autonomous lymphomas are examples of non epithelial precancers 3 Not all intraepithelial neoplasms are precancers Neoplasms that are intraepithelial but that are not precancers include seborrheic keratoses intraepidermal nevi common warts and most so called benign epithelial tumors Likewise the term pre invasive cancer raises an existential question Use of the term pre invasive cancer implies that precancers have attained the biological properties of a cancer This assumption may not be true Precancers may lack constitutive properties of cancer or may have certain attributes that are absent in cancers At this point there is insufficient knowledge to conclude that precancers are types of cancer In this article the authors use the term precancers because this term conveys only the defining features occurrence prior to cancers and existence as an identifiable lesion When considering all the possible classes of precancers it is worth noting that 1 Not all precancers are neoplastic A diffusely hyperplastic lesion with no known neoplastic properties but with a frequent association with cancer arising from the hyperplastic tissue would be considered a precancer Examples include diffuse atypical endometrial hyperplasia AIDS associated lymphoid hyperplasia helicobacter associated gastric MALT hyperplasia diffuse gastric intestinal metaplasia etc 2 Precancers need not progress to cancer and often have a high rate of regression 5 6 The low risk of progression to cancer suggests a strategy for treatment based on enhancing the intrinsic regression rate of precancers 6 However when a precancer progresses cancer is the obligate outcome i e precancers never progress into types of lesions other than cancer This biological property allows us to infer that agents that induce precancers are carcinogens 3 The different kinds of precancers may vary in every biologic feature except those specified in their definition identifiable lesions that precede the development of cancer Since precancers by definition are the morphologic lesions that precede cancers one can expect precancers to occur in a somewhat younger population than the population of people who have cancers Using the same line of reasoning one can expect agents chemical or biological that induce precancers to also induce cancers The biological diversity of precancers When the different precancers are listed it becomes apparent that they fall into very different biological classes Consider the following three lesions all of which are usually considered to be precancers 1 Squamous dysplasia of the uterine cervix Squamous dysplasias are microscopic foci of atypical squamous cells They are not tumors in the sense that they do not present as a growing mass In the cervix they are almost always associated with a viral etiology 2 Tubular adenoma of colon Tubular adenomas are benign tumors that can measure several centimeters in diameter Nuclear atypia can be minimal or marked 3 Barrett s esophagus This is a glandular metaplasia occurring in the esophageal mucosa caused by local chronic inflammation These lesions typically show no nuclear atypia They are associated with an increased risk of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus What do these lesions have in common They are identifiable lesions that can precede the development of cancer Other than that they would seem to have very few features in common The diversity of biological types of precancers calls for the creation of a precancer classification Creating the Precancer Classification A classification is a hierarchy of taxa informative features that characterize an entity and distinguish it from other entities and a set of generalizable features that apply to groups of taxa For instance if chair is classified under furniture then we can expect that all of the generalizations that we can form on the topic of furniture will apply to chairs This is actually a remarkable concept as it allows us to apply general knowledge to specific items Even if I know nothing about chairs knowing that a chair is a type of furniture allows me to infer many things about chairs based on my general knowledge of furniture If furniture is something that belongs in a house then a chair belongs in a house The task of classification usually begins by listing every member of a domain in this case every precancer and then choosing groups that carry the greatest number of informative biological generalizations to every member of the group The list of every member of a domain is called a taxonomy A classification is a grouped taxonomy 7 The process of classifying lesions is different from the process of identifying lesions Identification involves assigning a name from an existing classification to a lesion The distinction between classification and identification is of great importance because classification schemes unlike identification schemes have properties that can be of immense importance in medical research 7 1 A classification contains every instance in its domain and every instance has a single and unique slot in the classification This facilitates the design of experiments that include every instance of related lesions 2 Good classifications contain classes carefully selected to have the maximally informative set of generalizable features common to all the class instances Having a classification allows us to compare two different instances based on the inherited properities of their classes 3 Classifications support annotation using the elements of the classification classes and instances as keys Database annotation can be used to improve the classification system Classifications are also different from ontologies Ontologies create logical rules between specified members of a group 8 Ontologies are expected to have competence the ability to respond to queries that draw from the formal relationships among group members A classification approach was chosen because the two primary goals of this effort were to create a comprehensive listing of precancer terms and to provide a broad hierarchy for precancer concepts Establishing a set of logical rules for the precancers is at this time not feasible What precancer classification is currently available ICD O International Classification of Diseases Oncology lists virtually no precancerous lesions 9 The ICD O is used by cancer registrars to annotate in a uniform way cases of treated malignancies With a few exceptions such as ductal carcinoma in situ of breast the cancer registries do not collect information on precancers The National Cancer Institute s Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results SEER and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention use data collected by the cancer registries to compile national statistics on the incidence of cancer The most comprehensive summary of the clinical and pathologic features of precancers is found in Pathology of Incipient Neoplasia edited by Henson and Albores Saavedra 10 None of these sources provides a classification of the precancers Precancer Classification 1 Acquired microscopic precancers These are the lesions that most people think of when they hear the term precancer All of the so called intraepithelial neoplasias fall into this category Most examples of the microscopic precancers occur commonly actinic keratosis cervical dysplasia They tend to be multifocal They tend to be non inherited lesions often with an identifiable causation e g sunlight human papillomavirus infection They seldom occur in children Exceptions are inherited diseases that heighten sensitivity to a causal agent such as the early appearance of actinic keratoses in children with Xeroderma Pigmentosum Morphologically they tend to have a high degree of nuclear atypia The microscopic epithelial precancers grow by a subtle replacement of the normal mucosa without producing a mass despite many replicative cycles of growth They progress to invasive cancer while still relatively small The term dysplasia is often applied to these lesions Dysplasia in the context of precancer is somatically inherited nuclear atypia Cytologists use the morphologic features of dysplasia to identify precancer cells Class 1 precancers often have an identifiable non dysplastic stage that precedes the appearance of nuclear atypia e g squamous metaplasia of bronchus Barrett s esophagus without atypia junctional nevus intestinal metaplasia of stomach 2 Acquired large lesions with morphologic atypia These lesions tend to have a uniform appearance throughout most of their long existence even from the smallest size i e they have a long stable growth phase They tend not to have precursor lesions from identifiable microscopic precancers e g class 2 lesions do not seem to arise from class 1 lesions Their chance of becoming malignant usually increases as the size of the lesion increases When they become malignant there is usually a morphologically apparent focus from within the large lesion that has crowding irregular growth pattern and marked cellular atypia that is strikingly different from the surrounding cells This focus enlarges shows frank invasion and is the presumed origin of the cancer that develops from the precancer These lesions tend not to regress spontaneously They tend to be long lived and do not progress to cancer without first growing to a large size These lesions are often multiple but do not occur in large numbers hundreds unless there is a germline mutation Prototypical acquired large precancers are colon adenoma and myelodysplasia 3 Precursor lesions occurring with inherited hyperplastic syndromes that often progress to cancer These lesions tend to occur very rarely in the general population but may occur with a high probability sometimes 100 in patients carrying the germline mutation The prototypical lesions are the Ret gene disorders Mutations in the RET gene are associated with the disorders multiple endocrine neoplasia type IIA MEN2A multiple endocrine neoplasia type IIB MEN2B and hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma Lesions in this general category tend to have a single gene mutation that may be the only lesion found in the precursor lesions The precuror lesions tend to have the morphology of simple hyperplasias without much nuclear atypia Precursor lesions tend to be multiple sometimes occurring in the hundreds and bilateral in paired organs These lesions tend to occur in a much younger population than the acquired precancers The resulting cancers can also occur at a relatively young age 4 Acquired diffuse hyperplasias and diffuse metaplasias With few exceptions acquired small focal metaplasias and hyperplasias have a very low chance of progression to cancer and have been excluded from the classification schema because they rarely result in cancer without first growing into diffuse lesions the class 4 lesions or acquiring nuclear atypia class 1 lesions Diffuse metaplastic lesions commonly precede cancers It is presumed that all bronchogenic squamous dysplasia arises from squamous metaplasia The normal bronchus simply does not have any squamous cells The squamous cells in bronchial squamous dysplasia must have originated from a metaplastic focus for directly from non squamous bronchial cells that differentiated directly to a dysplastic squamous phenotype The prototypical lesions are the diffuse Barrett s esophagus diffuse intestinal metaplasia of stomach and diffuse endometrial hyperplasia These lesions tend to have chronic identifiable causes e g gastroesophageal reflux disease post lye ingestion esophagus chronic gastritis long term tamoxifen therapy and tend not to regress so long as the causation persists Small foci of dysplastic precancers Class 1 may arise from the diffuse hyperplasias and metaplasias This class of precursor may include the so called regressing cancers such as helicobacter associated maltomas and AIDS associated Kaposi s sarcoma that can grow as multiple tumors all of which can quickly regress when the causative agent is withdrawn e g after antibiotic treatment for Helicobacter or after normal immune status is restored after withdrawal of cyclosporine in transplant recipients This class may also include secondary aplastic anemia e g benzene toxicity where the marrow is repopulated by an emerging population of hyperplastic cells that carry a a heightened risk of progressing to acute leukemia 5 Currently unclassified entities Most precancers will fall into one of the first four described classes However classifications may contain a subset of cases that defy facile classification For example the platypus has challenged animal classifiers Aristotle had no trouble recognizing that dolphins were mammals but it took the scientific community two millennia to agree We have created an unclassified category of precancers for the current draft classification 6 Superclass and modifiers A superclass is created to contain general precancer terms e g precancer dysplasia Methods The National Library of Medicine s UMLS Unified Medical Language System is a set of tools that facilitate the use of medical terminologies and the semantic relationships between terms and vocabularies The UMLS Metathesaurus is one of three knowledge sources within the UMLS and contains concepts and terms from about 100 different medical vocabularies The primary UMLS metathesaurus file used in the construction of the precancer terminology is MRCON The 2003 MRCON file is over 150 Mbytes in length and contains over two million different terms belonging to nearly a million different concepts MRCON and the entire UMLS metathesaurus are available at no cost from the National Libary of Medicine at http www nlm nih gov

esophagus all map to the same number in the first column C0004763 This is the UMLS CUI Concept Unique Identifier for Barrett s esophagus The authors collected precancer terms from the UMLS After review of the terms the authors added supplemental terms from their own knowledge Every additional term added by the authors matched a pre existing UMLS concept About 10 of the precancer synonyms were contributed by the authors After the terminology was assembled the authors created a classification system and assigned each precancer term to one of the precancer classes The entire classification was prepared as a metadata document using XML eXtensible Markup Language annotation Results The XML document containing the precancer classification and all accompanying metadata is PRESUM XML 425 kilobytes see Additional file 3 An example of the metadata annotation in the XML file is concept cui 0432487 cui precancer_class Acquired diffuse hyperplasias metaplasias precancer_class synonym term Post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder term synonym synonym term PTLD Post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder term synonym synonym term Post transp lymphoprolif dis term synonym synonym term PTLD Post trns lymphprolif dis term synonym synonym term PTLD term synonym synonym term PTLPD term synonym synonym term PT LPD term synonym synonym term post transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders term synonym synonym term post transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder term synonym synonym term post transplantation lymphoproliferative disease term synonym concept In the example five metadata tags are employed concept cui precancer_class term synonym along with and their corresponding closure tags marked by a slash character Because XML is case sensitive lower case letters were consistently employed to simplify implementation The concept tag indicates that a new concept will follow Since all of the precancer concepts derive from or correspond to existing UMLS concepts it was convenient to assign each precancer concept with the UMLS Concept Unique Identifier and mark these with a cui tag Each precancer concept is assigned one of the precancer classes In this case the term PTLD post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder is assigned to the precancer class of Acquired diffuse hyperplasias metaplasias The term is flanked by term tags and the class designation is flanked by precancer_class tags Because the term is a synonymous variant it is nested in synonym tags Term and synonym tags are used for each of the term variants of the single concept Raw XML files are made difficult to read by the large quantity of markup XML tags that annotate data elements Typically XML files are made readable with transformation scripts or with embedded presentation instructions cascading style sheets 11 A Perl script PRESUM PL was created to parse the XML file counting the classified lesions and outputting a viewable HTML file PRESUM2 HTM and a summary statement as follows The total number of precancer terms 4700 The total number of precancer concepts 568 a single concept has on average 8 3 near synonymous terms Number of concepts falling in the six precancer

65 222 228 150 jjb presum tar gz Discussion Limitations of the Precancer Classification Issues of inclusion The authors chose to err on the side of inclusion when developing the taxonomy If a lesion was considered a putative precancer even when the evidence seemed doubtful it was added to the taxonomy Issues of exclusion How does the classification deal with conditions associated with cancer but for which no precancerous lesion is known These conditions are often called cancer syndromes Persons identified possibly through genetic testing with a cancer syndrome who have not yet developed cancers may be considered to be in a precancerous stage of their disease In the absence of morphologically identifiable precancerous lesions these conditions were excluded from the classification Since these syndromes may have enormous relevance to our understanding of the carcinogenic process they were collected as a separate listing When the precancer classification undergoes community review these syndromes may be added as a distinct class It is available as a supplemental file with this publication see Additional file 2 Issues of unclassifiability Not all precancerous lesions fit into a biological group In most cases the unclassifiable lesions are concept placeholders such as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance Issues of omission Because the classification was completed by two authors it is presumed that researchers in the field of precancers will wish to add lesions to the taxonomy This may be particularly important for veterinary and comparative pathologists as the current classification is heavily weighted toward human lesions Issues of incorrect classification Classifications are hypotheses about the nature of their subject domain A taxonomist needs to place every known instance precancer in this case somewhere in the classification Once this is done the classification can be tested and re organized Conclusions This work represents the first attempt to create a comprehensive listing of the precancers the first attempt to classify precancers by their biological properties and the first attempt to create a pathologic classification of the precancers that recognizes fundamental biologic and morphologic distinctions taxons among the precancers A draft classification placed into the public domain is a first step
