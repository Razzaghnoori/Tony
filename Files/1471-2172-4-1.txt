 Background The tetraspanins are a family of cell surface proteins with four transmembrane domains two extracellular loops and conserved cysteine residues at key positions in the second extracellular loop 1 They facilitate a wide array of functions including cell activation differentiation adhesion morphological changes and motility which may all relate to the promiscuous associations of these molecules with integrins and other signaling proteins within the cell membrane and the cytoskeleton CD81 a defining member of the tetraspanin superfamily is widely expressed on human hematopoietic and other cells 2 It associates on B cells with a signaling complex that includes CD19 and CD21 3 as well as associating with MHC class II molecules 4 and other tetraspanins 5 6 On T cells CD81 interacts with CD4 CD8 CD82 and selected integrins 7 8 9 10 An anti CD81 antibody was first isolated for its ability to induce cell death in B cell lines 11 This is likely dependent upon CD81 s association with MHC class II molecules which can transmit death inducing signals in B cells 12 CD81 cross linking can also induce adhesion in B and T cells apparently by multiple pathways 10 13 14 Triggering of the CD19 CD21 CD81 complex on murine B cells has been shown to lower the threshold for B cell activation via the immunoglobulin receptor 15 On murine T cells and thymocytes CD81 costimulates T cell receptor mediated activation through a pathway independent of CD28 16 On human T cells CD81 costimulation results in increased IL 2 production and LFA 1 mediated T B cell adhesion 17 Murine CD81 also appears to play a role in thymocyte maturation as shown in fetal thymic organ cultures 18 Finally CD81 signalling has been shown to have an effect on the Th1 Th2 balance of immune responses In cell cultures of CD4 T cells and B cells from allergic individuals addition of anti CD81 antibody enhances IL 4 production from the T cells 19 In mice either complete lack of CD81 or lack of CD81 on B cells leads to impaired humoral and Th2 immune responses 20 21 Allergen induced airway hyperresponsiveness is also decreased in CD81 nullmice 22 Finally lack of CD81 on murine T cells diminishes IL 4 production with reduced expression of ICOS GATA 3 STAT6 and phosphorylated STAT6 23 In this report an attempt is made to reconcile the findings of general T cell costimulation versus specific Th2 biasing by CD81 in human T cells Short term CD81 cross linking on normal human T cells is shown to co stimulate T cell activation via antigen or superantigen extending previous findings in mouse splenocytes 16 and human PBMC 17 The effect appears to be a direct consequence of CD81 triggering on T cells Of interest production of both Th1 and Th2 cytokines is augmented by CD81 costimulation However during longer term stimulation of T cells the presence of CD81 costimulation leads to a disproportionate increase in IL 4 producing cells This is due to increased induction of proliferation Thus CD81 signalling provides short term costimulation of cells producing Th1 or Th2 cytokines but results in a disproportionate increase in Th2 cytokine producing cells during long term activation Results CD81 cross linking costimulates CD69 expression and IL 2 induction Two early events in T cell activation are the induction of CD69 expression and the stimulation of IL 2 production by the T cells To determine whether costimulation through human CD81 affected these early activation events peripheral blood cells from normal CMV seropositive donors were incubated for 6 h with a superantigen SEB or the viral antigen CMV in the presence or absence of an agonistic anti CD81 mAb 5A6 As seen in Figure 1 over a range of antigen or superantigen concentrations the addition of 5A6 increased the number of CD69 cells as well as the number of IL 2 producing cells measured by intracellular staining The effect of anti CD81 mAb was often greater than that of the classical costimulatory antibody CD28 The effect of anti CD81 was also greater for CD4 T cells A B E F compared to CD4 T cells C D G H It also appeared to be more dramatic for CD69 A C E G than for IL 2 B D F H As such essentially no effect was observed on CD8 CD3 CD4 T cell IL 2 production panels D and H Stimulation with 5A6 alone in the absence of SEB or CMV gave consistently 0 05 cytokine positive T cells in such experiments data not shown These results confirm and extend the findings of VanCompernolle et al 17 on CD81 costimulation of SEB induced CD69 expression Similar to results obtained by VanCompernolle et al 17 CD81 costimulation was also found to increase SEB specific proliferation as measured by BrdU incorporation data not shown Effect on Th1 and Th2 cytokines Since CD81 signaling has been implicated in the mouse to be preferentially important for Th2 dominated responses 21 it was examined whether CD81 costimulation in human T cells preferentially induced Th2 cytokine production over Th1 cytokine production To examine this 6 h stimulation with SEB or CMV was carried out in peripheral blood cells of normal human CMV seropositive donors in the presence or absence of anti CD81 mAb 5A6 followed by intracellular staining for IL 2 IFN or IL 4 As seen in Figure 2 addition of 5A6 approximately doubled the number of cytokine producing cells for each cytokine at these doses of SEB 0 1 g ml or CMV 0 5 g ml There was no preferential costimulation of cells producing IL 4 versus IFN or IL 2 CD81 exerts a direct effect on human T cells To determine whether the effects observed in the above experiments were due to direct stimulation of CD81 on T cells or whether indirect effects of ligation of CD81 on other cells were involved the following experiment was carried out PBMC from a normal human donor were depleted of non T cells by magnetic bead separation then T cells and non T cells were independently incubated with 5A6 anti CD81 mAb washed and re combined in the presence of SEB As seen in Figure 3 only when the T cell fraction was incubated with 5A6 was costimulation of CD69 expression and cytokine production observed Thus direct ligation of CD81 on T cells was sufficient to induce costimulation of T cell activation Effect of CD81 ligation on long term T cell activation Another possible way that CD81 could affect T cell cytokine production is by directing T cells towards Th2 cytokine production during long term stimulation Other investigators have shown in mouse systems that commitment to Th1 or Th2 cytokine production by na ve T cells requires prior cell proliferation 24 and reversal of Th1 or Th2 committed cells requires at least several days of proliferation 25 When normal human PBMC were stimulated for 7 days with SEB the presence of 5A6 anti CD81 mAb resulted in a modest increase in IL 4 producing T cells when those cells were restimulated with PMA and ionomycin Figure 4A No significant change in IL 2 or IFN producing T cells was seen Similar results were seen when PBMC were stimulated with plate bound anti CD3 mAb rather than SEB for 7 days in the presence of 5A6 anti CD81 mAb Figure 4B These results were more dramatic when CD45RO cells were first isolated by magnetic bead separation and then subjected to 7 d stimulation by anti CD3 in the presence or absence of 5A6 anti CD81 mAb As seen in Figure 4C the percentage of CD4 T cells producing IL 4 upon PMA ionomycin restimulation was increased more than 6 fold when 5A6 anti CD81 mAb had been added to the initial anti CD3 culture No significant change in IL 2 or IFN producing cells was seen A less dramatic increase in IL 4 producing cells was seen for CD45RO cells Figure 4D The results for CD8 T cells mirrored those for CD4 T cells except that the overall number of IL 4 producing CD8 T cells was lower data not shown Because the effect of CD81 on IL 4 producing T cells was most dramatic with CD45RO cells Figure 4C it was hypothesized that CD81 costimulation was affecting the number of IL 4 producing memory T cells over time To determine the effect of CD81 costimulation over time on the absolute number of IL 4 or IFN producing T cells the experiment of Figure 5was carried out CD45RO T cells were stimulated with anti CD3 anti CD81 mAb as in Figure 4 but cells were restimulated with PMA ionomycin after 1 3 or 7 d of culture The absolute number of IL 4 and IFN producing T cells was then quantified using intracellular staining and TruCount beads As seen in Figure 5 the number of IL 4 producing CD4 T cells increased much more significantly over time in cultures incubated with anti CD81 mAb than in those without The number of IFN producing CD4 T cells increased similarly in cultures incubated with or without anti CD81 mAb Thus CD81 costimulation appeared to preferentially induce the accumulation of IL 4 producing T cells over time To further test whether CD81 costimulation was inducing preferential proliferation of IL 4 producing memory cells experiments with CFSE labeling were carried out As seen in Figure 6A the percentage of IL 4 producing cells increased preferentially over time in long term anti CD3 stimulations that received CD81 costimulation relative to stimulations in the absence of anti CD81 mAb Although CFSE content was equal in all cells on day 0 Figure 6B the mean level of CFSE fluorescence of IL 4 producing cells became lower over time in the presence of CD81 costimulation versus anti CD3 stimulation alone Figure 6Band 6C This indicates that IL 4 producing cells had divided on average more times with CD81 costimulation than without The difference was apparent after one day of stimulation and did not increase over time consistent with a greater initial induction of proliferation of IL 4 producing cells in the presence of anti CD81 There was no such difference in CFSE levels for IFN producing cells in the presence or absence of anti CD81 Figure 6D However anti CD28 costimulation induced lower levels of CFSE in all cells including IFN producing cells after 3 days of anti CD3 stimulation p 0 001 data not shown Thus CD81 costimulation appears to uniquely induce greater proliferation of IL 4 producing cells relative to other memory T cell populations Discussion In this study it was shown that CD81 ligation on human T cells costimulates the induction of CD69 expression the production of cytokines and the proliferation of both CD4 and CD4 human T cells Greater effects were seen on CD4 T cells compared to CD4 T cells The costimulatory effects were documented using two antigenic systems a superantigen SEB and a conventional viral antigen CMV The effects were determined to be a direct consequence of CD81 ligation on T cells as anti CD81 mAb pre treatment of purified T cells but not non T cells induced the costimulatory effects In a previous study Van Compernolle et al showed that the enhancing effect of CD81 on SEB induced activation was inhibited by antibody to LFA 1 17 The current results are consistent with the model proposed by VanCompernolle et al whereby CD81 ligation induces an increase in LFA 1 avidity for ICAM 3 on accessory cells resulting in an indirect activation effect on the T cells However in the current study anti LFA 1 was found to only partially block cytokine production induced by either SEB or SEB anti CD81 data not shown This suggests that CD81 s effects on cytokine production may not be uniquely mediated by LFA 1 In fact other investigators have shown that anti CD81 mAb can directly costimulate purified murine T cells 16 in a presumably LFA 1 independent manner CD81 costimulation increased in equal proportion the number of T cells producing IL 2 IFN and IL 4 Using CD81 nullmice CD81 was found to be required for effective Th2 but not Th1 immune responses 20 21 22 23 But CD81 has also been found to generally costimulate T cell responses in mouse 16 and human 17 Thus the costimulation of T cell cytokine production by CD81 need not necessarily be biased towards Th2 cytokines The current results bear this out More recent results have shown that CD81 expression on T cells is indeed important for their induction of IL 4 production 23 in a mouse system The current study complements these results by demonstrating that CD81 directly influences the number of IL 4 producing T cells in cultures of stimulated human memory T cells The effect of anti CD81 mAb was to increase the absolute number of IL 4 producing T cells over time relative to cultures not costimulated with anti CD81 mAb Furthermore the CD81 costimulation appeared to cause a greater induction of proliferation of IL 4 producing cells relative to that seen in the absence of CD81 mAb The effect of CD81 costimulation on the number of IL 4 producing T cells could occur through several different mechanisms First it is possible that CD81 induces recruitment of na ve cells to the Th2 pathway This did not appear to be the case as the effect of CD81 was most prominent on CD45RO cells which do not include na ve T cells However CD81 signalling could induce the switching of some IFN producing Th1 T cells to IL 4 producing Th2 T cells over time This is a difficult mechanism to test due to the low number of IL 4 producing T cells in human PBMC relative to IFN producing T cells Experiments attempting to deplete IL 4 producing T cells prior to anti CD3 stimulation were attempted but could not be accurately interpreted since depletion of 100 of potential IL 4 producing cells could not be documented data not shown It was thus impossible to rule out this mechanism as possibly contributing to the accumulation of IL 4 producing cells over time although it did not appear to be the major mechanism see below Second it is possible that CD81 costimulation preferentially rescues IL 4 producing T cells from apoptosis and thus they accumulate to a greater degree over time This did not appear to be the case as IL 4 producing T cells were no more likely to be apoptotic than IFN producing or IL 4 negative T cells in long term stimulations data not shown Finally it is possible that CD81 induces preferential proliferation of IL 4 producing T cells relative to other T cells This indeed appears to be the case as seen by proliferation experiments using CFSE see Figure 6 As cells divide this cytosolic dye is diluted such that cells express lower levels of CFSE with each successive division Indeed after just one day of stimulation IL 4 producing cells in the presence of CD81 costimulation had lower mean levels of CFSE than did IL 4 producing cells in the absence of CD81 costimulation This was not true for IL 4 negative or IFN producing cells The relative amount of CFSE in CD81 costimulated cultures versus non costimulated cultures did not change further over time Thus it did not appear that IL 4 producing cells were continually proliferating faster in the presence of CD81 costimulation Rather they appeared to be more readily induced into proliferation as the maximum difference in CFSE levels was already observed after one day of stimulation Thus the primary mechanism by which CD81 costimulation induces Th2 bias in long term stimulation appears to be a greater induction of proliferation in IL 4 producing cells This complements the findings of Deng et al 23 in which the lack of CD81 in a murine culture system correlated with decreased expression of signalling molecules critical for activation and IL 4 production This effect of CD81 is not shared by other classical costimulatory molecules such as CD28 which has been shown to induce the proliferation of both Th1 and Th2 cells data not shown and references 26 27 28 29 It should be noted that the present study due to limitations of working with human PBMC could not address the results of withdrawing endogenous CD81 signalling Rather CD81 co stimulation could only be increased over basal levels by application of an agonistic mAb 5A6 Because endogenous CD81 costimulation could still occur in cultures without 5A6 added the differences due to addition of 5A6 might actually underestimate the full potential of CD81 s effect This caveat of the experimental system also implies that there could be considerable donor to donor variability in the effect of anti CD81 mAb as different donors could have different levels of endogenous CD81 costimulatory activity The natural ligand for CD81 has never been identified Conclusions In conclusion CD81 costimulation appears to have multiple effects on T cells including costimulation of Th1 and Th2 cytokine production in short term assays and preferential induction of Th2 cell proliferation in long term cultures of human memory T cells These results expand upon and help to explain the Th2 biasing effects of CD81 in mouse 21 22 23 and human 19 systems Methods Cells and cell separation Peripheral blood from normal human donors was collected under informed consent in accordance with an institutionally
