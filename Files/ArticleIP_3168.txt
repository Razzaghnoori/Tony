 Naming Names The 1996 elections had no sooner sloughed into despond than I came across the following sentence in an election eve wrap up by Michael Lewis in the New Republic There is no denying Lewis

weeping Masochism comes from the name of the demented 19 th century novelist Leopold von Sacher Masoch who described the relevant eponymous practices in his writings Recently a group in Ukraine has

derivative in this case derived from a name that of James Fallows editor of U S News World Report who has championed an approach to reporting that emphasizes hard analysis of serious issues and eschews the cult of journalists as highly paid pundits celebrities or oddsmakers Lewis confirmed that this meaning was precisely the one intended and said that as far as he knew his use of it in the New Republic marked this proper noun s maiden voyage as an adjective Fallows himself affably abashed was unaware of previous appearances of the term Eponymous words have never needed much tending or encouragement There are about 35 000 of them in the ordinary stock of the English language a figure that does not include the many eponymous words in the specialized languages of science engineering and especially medicine The use of eponyms in medicine is steeply on the decline but ordinary eponyms linguistic experts say are enjoying a growth spurt these days According to citations in recent

of memory To kevork someone is to assist him in the commission of suicide an eponym derived proximately of course from the work of Dr Jack Kevorkian but made possible by the prior success of the

1979 rap song by the Sugar Hill Gang The verb to bobbitt with its well known specific connotation under the household amputation rubric has become so widely used as to have now acquired metaphoric senses For instance the verb is used to mean to deprive of vigor in this sentence from a letter to the editor of the conservative Washington Times Bravo to Tony Snow for exposing the bobbi t ting of the GOP leadership when confronted with Democratic tirades Linguistic note from abroad The practice of bobbitting according to an Asia correspondent of some years my sister Cait as it happens is
