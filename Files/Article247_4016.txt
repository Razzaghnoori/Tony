 Murphy s Law A Chatterbox Investigation The death of Air Force Capt John Paul Stapp who during the 1940s and 50s allowed his body to be used in various experiments testing the effects of high speed transportation provides an occasion to consider how Murphy s Law came into being The New York Times obituary of Stapp who died Nov 13 at the ripe age of 89 tells it this way Stapp who was known for his razor sharp wit suffered an injury in the experiment that inspired Murphy s Law after a rapid sled ride in 1949 An assistant Capt Edward Murphy Jr had designed a harness to strap the rider in The harness held 16 sensors to measure the acceleration or G force on different parts of the body There were exactly two ways each sensor could be installed Murphy did each one the wrong way The result was that when Stapp staggered off the rocket sled with bloodshot eyes and bleeding sores all the sensors registered zero He had been restrained in vain A distraught Murphy proclaimed the original version of the famous maxim If there are two or more ways to do something and one of those results in a catastrophe then someone will do it that way But a 1978 article by Ted Bear then a flight center historian at Edwards Air Force Base in California where the experiment in question took place tells it this way Murphy s Law was named after Capt Edward A Murphy an engineer working on Air Force Project MX981 a project designed to see how much sudden deceleration a person can stand in a crash One day after finding that a transducer was wired wrong he cursed the technician responsible and said If there is any way to do it wrong he ll find it Both versions of the story have the same basic theme which is that it s always good to be prepared for lots of things going wrong But in the Times version Capt Murphy s comment seems to be an exercise in evading blame Rather than saying Gosh I m sorry Capt Murphy is attributing his own screw up to some larger cosmic tendency for all things to get screwed up It s the engineering equivalent of the familiar political dodge mistakes were made By contrast in Bear s version Capt Murphy is attaching blame to someone else Murphy is more or less calling the technician said to be responsible we never get the technician s version a schmuck In Bear s version Murphy is not stating any broad philosophical principle of any kind If this is the real version for what it s worth Capt Leah M Bryant told the story the same way in the Sept 1997 issue of Leading Edge the house organ of the Air Force Materiel Command then Murphy s Law was completely misconstrued In other words Murphy s Law is itself an illustration of Murphy s Law Neither the Times version nor the Bear Bryant version is particularly flattering to Capt Murphy To make matters even more confusing there s a third version of the story involving an entirely different Murphy not Capt Edward Murphy but Commander later Admiral Joseph M Murph Murphy Chatterbox was unable to obtain details of this story but Murph Murphy is the person to whom Edward H Heinemann an aircraft designer and engineer for Douglas Aircraft in the 1940s and 50s attributes Murphy s Law in his Heinemann s 1980 autobiography Ed Heinemann Combat Aircraft Designer Chatterbox got the poop on Murph Murphy from Fred Johnsen the historian at the Edwards Air Force Flight Test Center Johnsen told Chatterbox that Heinemann once showed him Murph Murphy s photograph and said That s the guy who invented Murphy s Law Johnsen said that while Heinemann spent a lot of time at Edwards he has no reason to think that Murph Murphy had any connection to Edwards at all There are several reputable people in the aeronautic industry who claim to have known Murphy and it s a different Murphy in each case Johnsen told Chatterbox regretfully At least Chatterbox thinks that s what Johnsen said
