        okay um i guess were going to talk describe uh job benefits and so what do you think next to salary do you rank is the most important job benefits     uh i would say the medical uh group insurance uh area as far as uh   uhhuh   covering medical costs for yourself or family members   umhum well um does your company have good benefits in that  in that regard   yeah i think i work for a a public school system district and uh  so its different than a company where   uhhuh   most companies fund almost the entire thing where the school district does um the employee must pick up a greater figure in the way of uh costs but overall um ive been pleased with it over the years i think the biggest frustration   oh yeah umhum   is because of the cost of insurance going up every year our district has had to alter uh you know change companies or now were on a managed care thing which has stressed a lot of people out although   hm   it has not disturbed me any how about yourself   i see uh well im my medical coverage is with an HMO um so   uhhuh   thats in my opinion thats getting thats bordering on a health clinic but it seems to be a good way to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage um   right yeah our district did that for the ninety one and the ninety school year or calendar years and i was in the HMO and um i i was because my my same doctor you know agreed to be in it for uh they usually sign a contract or something and um   umhum   uh i did have surgery last summer and i paid ten dollars when i went to see him that first day and ive never seen another bill so i i have to say it really works but again   right   i was fortunate because my doctor agreed to be in it uh if youve been going to a doctor for you know ten years or something and he elects not to join it can be very stressful for you know those people   yes thats right yeah im im fairly young myself ive only been when i first started working which three years ago is when i first got into full time employment   uhhuh   and uh at that time i immediately joined the HMO and i never really so the only doctor i ive kind of consistently had has been through the HMO and uh you know for me its worked out real good   yeah right but if you you know have a family and and um everybodys gone to different doctors uh it is hard to give up somebody who you feel knows you and your body and your just has you know all the medical history and you feel comfortable with it i im sure it would be very stressful and   umhum   my husband and i have just elected that if that happens i will go and just pay you can continue to go to your own doctor but your benefits are not as   hm   you know good so   umhum yeah um like you you mentioned you work for a school system i work for uh Georgia Tech in the research branch and i guess   uh oh all right   another one that that that i rank up there high is the uh kind of job flexibility and time off um i enjoy as a as a benefit   i do too are you talking about like spring break and right   right yeah getting a lot of a lot of breaks between quarters and that and having a lot of vacation   right it it really um i dont think most of our teachers now im not a teacher i am the a secretarial executive assistant but i dont think the teachers could stand the stress all all year long frankly it is just   umhum   Texas has really um   you know they want everybody educated no matter what its costs uh and it it would be just we all look forward to like in two weeks we have spring break and i dont know who looks forward to it more the students or the or the teachers and the staff what do you do there   umhum right well um im not actually on the teaching faculty but we have a large research organization associated with the university and thats who i work with   okay i like   um and were given you know a good bit of flexibility in what we do we can kind of pursue our own interests in terms of the research areas that we study   well thats good yeah i would think that that type of employment youre youre one day you might be really tuned in and the next day oh a little lukewarm or something and and um   right   you know its good that they allow you that   right   it um as i say the schools now we do have to work you know the day but we do get many days off and um we all look forward to it thats only reason i work there is that my children now have graduated and graduated from college but at the time   umhum oh yeah   i worked there because my hours and days were the same as theirs and uh ive just   umhum   continued to uh stay there   okay are there   so   are there any things that that youd like to see changed in terms of the the benefits
