 Bailando con el Diablo Dancing with the Devil A popularly narrated legend found throughout the Southwest south Texas and even parts of northern Mexico that tells of the appearance of the devil at community dances dance halls and discotheques Called the devil at the dance legend or devil haunts the dance hall in folklore literature it is considered to be an urban belief tale that has been adapted to contemporary situations The devil makes his appearance elegantly dressed usually in a suit he is strikingly handsome muy suave smooth and poised tall and refined Consequently he stands out from among the rest of the men Besides his stunning appearance he is always an amazing dancer knows the latest dance steps and selects the prettiest girl to dance As the tale is often narrated a disobedient young girl goes to the dance without her parents permission or she goes against her mother s express wishes While at the dance a handsome beautifully dressed man asks her to dance They dance all night until she suddenly notices with a shock that he isn t wearing shoes and in fact he doesn t even have feet instead he has chicken feet goat s hooves or a pig s foot and a chicken foot It is usually at this point after he s discovered that he disappears into thin air leaving the odor of sulfur in the air or in some versions of the legend just runs out the door The girl he was dancing with either faints or burns to death as she goes up in smoke If the girl doesn t die as in some stories she might suffer a burn on the shoulder or a man s handprint might be found on her back A small circle of people who are present at the dance observe this encounter and the narrator of the story usually says that she or he heard it from someone who was there The lesson learned is that one must not disobey one s parents for the handsome man is known to be the devil and the personification of evil It is noted that mostly women narrate these legends among themselves or from mothers to daughters in a didactic fashion to instill fear in young women so that they will not disregard parental authority In some variants a young girl specifically transgresses religious beliefs by insisting on going to a dance on Good Friday a religious holy day and a revered day of prayer in Chicano Catholic households The appearance of the devil on this day is an especially ominous sign Robe s collection of New Mexico legends contains thirty four variants of the devil at the dance tale Although the legends in this collection are from rural northern New Mexico collected in the 1950s and 1960s we find contemporary versions of the devil at the dance tales in south Texas and in Baja California from the 1980s Lim n and Herrera Sobek discuss versions of the tale circulating in nightclubs and discotheques among urbanized young people Of course not everyone believes such stories Martin s book contains a story by a man born in 1904 who says his friend played a trick on his community in Tucson by coming to a dance dressed in black with a fake rooster foot Eventually someone noticed his foot and yelled The Devil The Devil The narrator says he was there when his friend played the trick so he doesn t believe in the legend 50 References De Leon 1982 Glazer 1984 1994 Herrera Sobek 1988 Lim n 1994 Martin 1983 Robe 1951 Robe ed 1980 West 1988 Baile Dance El baile is an individual dance step a party or a ball El baile is historically one of the most important social traditions among Mexicans and Chicanos throughout Mexico and the United States Since the Spaniards conquered the Southwest bailes have been important community social and cultural events In Texas New Mexico and California because of the isolation of the communities dancing became the principal source of entertainment The social status of women in Spanish colonial society was limited and cloistered with their primary social venues consisting of church and home El baile provided entertainment and physical activity As an early California traveler put it I was astonished at the endurance of the California women in holding out night after night in dancing of which they never seemed to weary but kept on with an appearance of freshness and elasticity that was as charming as surprising Shay 100 It was at el baile that courtship occurred since girls although they may have gone to the dance chaperoned were allowed to dance with boys it was at el baile that families and relatives interacted that the week s work was forgotten and that life s mysteries were discussed The local dance brought the community together and allowed interaction between the sexes A girl was never able to reject a request to dance from a boy because to turn down an invitation exposed the boy to embarrassment and ridicule for his failure in competition and could be cause for revenge Countless corridos ballads leyendas legends and chistes jokes narrate events that are supposed to have occurred at el baile from fights to courtships to elopements Encounters with the legendary weeping woman La Llorona often occur after a dance when a solitary man is finding his way home From the devil at the dance narratives to the tragic death of Rosita Alvarez recounted in the corrido of the same name we learn of the importance of el baile in both rural and urban Chicano communities Major Horace Bell describes the difference between a baile and a fandango in Mexican California history and Arnoldo De Leon describes the baile in eighteenth century San Antonio Most Mexican national holiday celebrations such as Cinco de Mayo and El Diez y Seis de Septiembre will end with a community dance Even in modern times professional Latino and Chicano associations often close their national conferences with a baile

Corrido de Gregorio Cortez Ballads See Corridos Ballet Folkl rico The term refers to folk dance groups grupos folkl ricos that perform traditional Mexican regional dances The dances are carefully choreographed and well rehearsed they are representative of the dances from the different regions of Mexico An important characteristic of the dance performances is the elaborate beautiful costumes very full and colorful dresses that are the traditional dress from the various states of Mexico such as Jalisco Veracruz Chihuahua and Durango The dances many of which have been danced for decades such as El Jarabe Tapatio and La Negra are danced to Mariachi music and performed on the Mexican national holidays Las Fiestas Patrias such as Cinco de Mayo and El Diez y Seis de Septiembre These folk dance groups became popular in Mexico right after the Mexican Revolution but did not become prevalent in the United States until the 1960s It was the influence of the Chicano civil rights movement el movimiento Chicano that launched the institution of ballets folkl ricos as symbolic of a Mexican American cultural identity El Ballet Folkl rico de Mexico founded and directed by Amalia Hernandez in the early 1950s became the official cultural representative of the Mexican government and has often toured the United States Amalia Hernandez based her folklore costumes and folk dances on the authentic folklore traditions of the Mexican people This folkl rico group became the model on which most Chicano folkl rico groups are based Mexican folklore traditions folk songs and folk dances had been taught within Mexican colonias neighborhoods today known as barrios since before the 1930s usually through the efforts of a single individual in the community in church halls and mutual aid society halls but not in the public schools There was one exception in Tucson Arizona a teacher named Margarite Collier started a Mexican Folklore Club in 1937 in an elementary school for the specific purpose of maintaining the cultural traditions from Mexico This club existed until the 1970s and it established a long tradition of performing Las Posadas through the streets of Tucson Madelyn Loes Soloman documents that in Los Angeles the teaching of folk songs and dances was done by a Mexican born man in the late 1930s But it was in the late 1960s and 1970s that there was a revival in the formal organization of elaborate performances by large dance groups many made up of young children and teenagers Folkl rico groups perform for community events Cinco de Mayo festivals school functions Fiestas Guadalupanas celebrations of La Virgen de Guadalupe December 12 political events and other holidays Ballet folkl rico dances are now taught in many schools and students entering college often bring with them a knowledge of the dances and an interest in participating Several university campuses in California and the Southwest have dance groups totally comprised by and maintained by college

The film is about the life of the Chicano singer Ritchie Valens who recorded the song and made it very popular in 1958 The song actually goes back to early Mexican colonial history it has been traced to 1790 when it was performed at the Coliseo Theatre in Mexico City There are printed sources that cite the song being sung and danced in Veracruz during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries By the 1830s it was also a popular dance in Mexican California La Bamba is considered to be a son jarocho country folks dancing music an example of the mestizo mixed race musical tradition with strong African influences from the state of Veracruz The instrumentation of the traditional son jarocho included a small harp a small eight string guitar jarana and a small four string guitar requinto The dance that went with son jarocho was a zapateado a foot stomping dance There are two different accounts about how Ritchie Valens learned the song since he supposedly never learned Spanish One source states that he heard the song on a short trip across the border into Mexico and another states he learned the song from his uncle when he was five years old His innovative style mixed jarocho music with a rock n roll beat His recorded version of La Bamba in 1958 is the first known U S recording La Bamba has now been recorded more than 150 different times in the United States for example in 1966 by Trini Lopez in 1979 by the Plugz and in 1980 by Los Lobos The Rice University Marching Band and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir have also recorded it The movie with the soundtrack recorded by Los Lobos

Barbacoa de cabeza is the cooking of a beef head in this manner It is an old custom and cultural event that in parts of south Texas occurs every weekend with the barbacoa eaten on Sunday mornings In other parts of the Southwest this style of cooking is reserved for special events such as weddings funerals and large family gatherings According to the Diccionario de Mejicanismos Dictionary of Mexicanisms barbacoa is carne asada en un hoyo que se abre en tierra y se calienta como los hornos grilled meat cooked in a hole in the ground heated like an oven Cooking the beef head with this method means all the parts can be eaten such as the brains eyes tongue lips literally everything Although originally a discarded part of the cow now it is considered a delicacy and is prepared and sold in many neighborhood stores and restaurants along the Rio Grande border region Today the term barbacoa is used only to mean the cooking of meat in a pit also called pit cooking References Montano

as they are in Mexico today but at some point after World War II Chicano neighborhoods became known as barrios In Chicano culture barrios are identified by given names that in some way describe a characteristic of the neighborhood or reflect its history Some barrios are only a few blocks whereas others encompass large urban areas Some of the oldest barrios can be found in major cities like Los Angeles Chicago El Paso and San Antonio In San Fernando also known as San Fer two very early barrios were La Rana and El Bajillo The Frog The Little Low One Hoyo Marvilla another well known barrio in East Los Angeles was famous because it was where farmworkers lived and was extremely poor Barrios are sometimes called ghettos even though there are very negative and sometimes few positive attributes to living in barrios they can t always be presumed to be ghettos in the sense of places where a group is forced to live against its will Vigil s work on gang culture explains the allegiance felt by gang members toward their barrio Mary Helen Ponce writes in Hoyt Street about the barrio where she grew up in Pacoima California during the 1940s and 1950s Many Chicano novelists have set their

college students it printed humorous political and literary articles It is an example of a publication where Chicanos could express cultural and political satire Barriology was created as a spoof on the academic social sciences it involved testing those Chicanos not so fluent in the traditions and rituals of living in Chicano neighborhoods or barrios Con Safos carried monthly examinations developed by Antonio G mez PhD Barriologist Emeritus It was also a way of gently poking fun at Chicano culture reminding the readers of the uniqueness of the Chicano culture Some of the exam questions consisted of multiple choice answers others required the reader to fill in the answer Some sample questions follow Menudo is made from tripe which is a the cow s stomach b the cow s flank c horse meat

transposing the v for the b In Chicano communities in group chatter and published literature one frequently comes across the expression bato loco meaning a crazy guy a cool dude or a wise guy Bato was a word incorporated into the pachuco jargon of the 1940s and it is still very much a part of Chicano vocabulary today The bato loco or vato loco is the descendent of the pachuco and a close relation of today s cholo urban youth The bato is often mentioned in connection with his barrio as in el vato loco del Hoyo Mara The bato loco is tantamount to an archetype in Chicano culture he is that crazy

Bolillos Bread Rolls A bolillo is a small loaf of white bread or a large dinner roll which in the United States is sometimes called French bread Bolillos also known as birotes can be found in most Mexican and Mexican American bakeries and are often served in Mexican restaurants The folkloric use of bolillo occurs when it is derogatorily applied to Anglo Americans supposedly because they are as white as bread and because the Americans invaded and annexed Mexican territory the Southwest Although not as popularly known it carries the same meaning as gringo or gavacho Chicanos also often use the term as they do agringado to describe an overly acculturated Chicano one who is trying to be white It is believed the word was originally used to describe French soldiers when they occupied Mexico in the 1860s Although written references to its use in this way have not been found there are references to the French eating small loaves of white bread in corridos Am rico Paredes cites a stanza from a corrido ballad the Mexican soldiers sang after the Battle of Puebla celebrated on Cinco de Mayo that taunts the vanquished French soldiers with the following words Qu es de las piezas de pan

foremost a military man he became interested in ethnology and anthropology and wrote extensively on these subjects Born in 1846 to Irish Catholic parents in Pennsylvania he enlisted in the Fifteenth Pennsylvania Volunteer Cavalry during the Civil War In 1865 he attended West Point graduating in 1869 with a commission in the Third Cavalry He served with General George Crook from 1871 to 1886 and in 1891 wrote a well received book titled On the Border with Crook Through his friendship with the director of the Bureau of American Ethnology at the Smithsonian Institution Bourke studied anthropology and broadened his interests to include ethnology and folklore At various times he wrote pamphlets for the Bureau of Indian Affairs He gained fame as an Indian fighter but was also known as an anthropologist and writer Although primarily a military man he managed to conduct fieldwork among several Indian tribes and was considered an expert on the Apaches He was stationed along the Rio Grande for two years during the era of the Catarino Garza revolt and his diaries from this period are a valuable resource on the Garza movement He learned the Spanish language apparently because of his ethnological interests and wrote on the Tejano and Mexicano culture of the border region During the 1890s he published ethnographic articles about the Texas Mexican border in the Journal of American Folklore and the American Anthropologist Bourke observed chronicled and wrote both as a journalist and anthropologist about the folk medicine practices and the folk foodways of the Rio Grande region His approach to folklore study was that of the established tradition of the times which examined current customs traditions folkways and folk narratives as survivals of an earlier civilization Sometimes this survivalist perspective carried with it an attitude about the prior culture where the customs originated as having been a higher civilization Accordingly when Bourke became interested in Mexican customs and language he approached them as the cultural remains of a higher Spanish Arabic civilization In spite of the fact that his nineteenth century biases are very apparent in his writings the data he collected are valuable for the study of Chicano folklore of the Texas Mexican border He was elected president of the American Folklore Society in 1895 and he died in 1896 He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery References Lim n 1994 New Handbook of Texas 1996 Braceros Laborers Mexican workers recruited from Mexico under the Emergency Farm Labor Program known as the Bracero Program which was in effect from 1942 to 1964 The word bracero comes from the Spanish word brazo arm which is used as English uses hand to mean laborer In the same way bracero commonly means a man who works with his hands a laborer and is used when speaking of all farm and agricultural workers There was a shortage of farm laborers during World War II and this program offered an answer to that problem although some braceros also worked on the railroad Until only recently bracero was applied to any Mexican farmworker and is often used interchangeably with words like wetback or greaser The number of workers brought from Mexico ranged from a low of 4 180 in 1942 to a high of 62 091 in 1944 It is estimated that by 1947 nearly 220 000 braceros had worked in the United States under this program It continued even after the war and between 1955 and 1959 over 480 000 braceros were still working in the United States Some have compared the Bracero Program with legalized slavery and the impact on the perception of the Mexican farmworker by American agribusiness has been to foster contempt and disdain Many braceros chose not to return to Mexico when their contracts ended and instead stayed and hid from la migra the feared Immigration and Naturalization Service INS Many Chicanos of the Southwest and Midwest are descendants of braceros who came to the United States and stayed never returning to Mexico The bracero experience has been written about in novels and depicted in numerous movies and although the image presented is often a negative one like other Chicano folk heroes the bracero has become an archetype of the culture He is in the company of the historical mestizo character of Yo soy Joaqu n the revolutionary figure of Joaqu n Murrieta the mythical pachuco the stately

Experience In Mexico the experience was written about from the perspective of those who returned as in such books as Aventuras de un Bracero by Jesus Amaya Topete published in 1949 and reprinted several times and in the United States the novel Macho by Edmund Villase or published in 1973 References Acu a 1988 Galarza 1964 Guti rrez 1995 Herrera Sobek 1979 1993b 1998 Madrid Barela 1975 Nelson

the Southwest as can be seen by the large number of folk narratives and legends about witches collected in New Mexico and Texas in the last century This form of occultism is an integral part of the culture of Mexico and the Southwest The Spanish conquerors and colonists who settled New Mexico in the sixteenth century communicated to the indigenous communities a belief in witchcraft Beliefs in witchcraft were prevalent in Europe during the fourteenth fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and the missionary friars brought these beliefs to the New World The Spanish Catholic missionaries worked hard to convert the indigenous populations of New Spain and any non Christian belief that was not acceptable to the Spanish friars was often attributed to sin evil the devil or witchcraft Consequently it was easy to assign unexplainable natural phenomena to the work of witches and these beliefs have persisted over hundreds of years Contemporary witches can prepare love potions lift spells cure and cause illnesses and in general cause great harm They can also take on any form they desire such as a cat pig or owl and so can make themselves difficult to identify In folktales from New Mexico they often appear as balls of fire flying across the sky Curanderas are sometimes mistaken for witches because of their healing power but they are also often called upon to undo the work of witches Many of the folktales legends and cuentos stories collected in New Mexico by Aurelio Espinosa Juan Bautista Rael and R D Jameson Robe 1980 are about witches and witchcraft In the 1930s writers employed by the Works Progress Administration WPA as part of Roosevelt s New Deal collected many cuentos and legends about witches from the people of northern New Mexico and many beliefs expressed then are still held today For instance the way to tell if a person is a witch is to stick two needles in the form of a cross into the sill above a door if the person in the room is a witch she won t be able to leave the room Another belief is that only men named Juan or Juan Bautista or women named Juana have the ability to catch or overpower a witch Conversely the power of a witch cannot be exerted over a person named Juan or Juana A witch cannot sense the presence of a Juan so he may be able to trap her by drawing a circle on the ground and throwing his shirt turned inside out into the circle Witches often take the form of an owl in New Mexican Spanish called a tecolote from the Nahuatl word teolotl The hoot of an owl is an evil omen so one must be careful to stay away from owls In other parts of the Southwest owls are sometimes known as lechuzas A lechuza is a woman who has sold her soul to the devil and becomes an owl by night Only a woman can become a lechuza A prayer meant to keep witches away

Literally a little burro or little donkey a burrito has come to mean a taco made of a wheat flour tortilla instead of a corn tortilla filled with meat rice frijoles beans and chile then folded and rolled up There are several theories about the origins of the name burrito and there may be some truth to all of them One theory is that when flour tortillas became available in northern Mexico tacos de frijoles or bean burritos were easy to carry in the saddle bags of the vaqueros cowboys so for this reason they came to be called burritos as though they were the sidekicks of the vaquero s horse Tacos made from corn tortillas are much older they have been around since the epoch of the Aztecs Wheat and flour were introduced into New Spain by the Spaniards and one can see that the flour tortilla is similar to the flat bread found in many Mediterranean countries Once flour tortillas were discovered the move to making tacos from flour tortillas was logical Since corn tortillas are small and can only bend or fold over once and flour tortillas are more pliable and can be rolled several times the flour taco was a natural outcome A burrito can be made with any type of filling such as beans potatoes chile con carne chile colorado carnitas chile with meat red chile roasted pork meat or even peanut butter Flour tortillas and burritos are found in northern Mexico and the Southwest but are not known in other parts of Mexico Since at least the 1920s Chicanos from Texas have been making what came to be called burritos Originally they were called tacos another story about the origin of the name is that in the 1940s there was an establishment in Ju rez Chihuahua Mexico called Los Burritos that sold tacos made of tortillas de harina flour tortillas It became a well known place to go and people spoke of going a los burritos to the burritos when they wanted tacos of that kind Commercial burritos became available in San Francisco in 1961 according to an article in the San Francisco Chronicle and now there are supposedly over 150 burrito taquer as taco restaurants in the Mission District of that city Burros is the name reserved for the very large tortilla burritos in which the tortilla may be a foot and a half to two feet in diameter See also Tacos References Griffith 1988 Roemer 1993
