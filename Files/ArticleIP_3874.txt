subpoena to investigate white collar crime I was dismayed to read Akhil Reed Amar s proposal in Right and Huang to alter the meaning of immunity to allow for the fruits of immunized testimony to be used against a criminal defendant All attorneys have an obligation to represent their clients to the fullest extent allowed by law If Professor Amar s proposal became law I would be obligated to force all investigation targets to testify just so that I could obtain the fruits of the testimony It would be an excellent investigative tool Unfortunately it would be an excellent investigative tool precisely because it would eviscerate the constitutional right to avoid self incrimination While it would make my job easier it would also make this country a less desirable place to live Jordan Finegold Bexley Ohio Aural Hex There are apparently no boundaries to the misleading psychologizing of human experiences Now in Tyson s Choice Jeffrey Itell claims that Mike Tyson may be afflicted with manic depressive illness as evidenced by his having bitten off part of Evander Holyfield s ear Part of Itell s unintentionally hilarious evidence for his conditional diagnosis is the alleged historic connection between mania and artistic achievement which the author claims has been known since ancient times From this dubious premise Itell spins to his more preposterous conclusion that there may well be a similar relationship between manic depression and sporting achievement Itell points as evidence to two athletes one of whom was depressed and a psychiatrist who muses that there are many other cases But the author s exculpatory coup de gr ce is Tyson s claim that a psychiatric illness caused him to do things to Robin Givens his former wife that he would normally never do Then finalizing his ode to non sequiturs Itell analogizes Tyson s alleged disease to a fatal disease and even recommends that Tyson take psychoactive drugs and undergo a medical clearance on his behavior None of this nonmedical and simply silly analysis should blind the public to what happened in reasonably clear terms An irresponsible boxer motivated by fear of losing took the easy way out which entailed he correctly anticipated relatively few negative consequences In previous fights wherein he was winning or had a good chance to win his illness did not manifest itself Much alleged psychotic illness is the result of rational if wrong headed calculation Professor Richard E Vatz Associate Psychology Editor USA Today Magazine The Pondering Jew Herbert Stein s On Being a Jew reveals more about Stein s survival tactics in the face of anti Semitism than it does about the centrality of the Jewish experience Stein obviously chose to remember on which side his bread was buttered rather than address the larger issue of the Jew in a Christian world Of Richard Nixon s disgraceful anti Semitic utterances made public in recently revealed tapes Stein can only meekly remark Apparently Mr Nixon said some things that I wish he had not said Surely an entry for the understatement of the year As reported in the press at long last President Nixon in the privacy of the Oval Office said to his trusted aide John we have the power Are we using it to investigate the Jews I can only hope that we are doing a little persecuting Further Please give me the names of the Jews And How about the rich Jews The IRS is full of Jews Bob Even such a staunch supporter as William F Buckley Jr squirmed in embarrassment as he defended his hero Nixon calling him paranoid and dismissing his anti Semitism as all foam no teeth pointing out that Jews like Henry Kissinger William Safire and Herb Stein continued to support him although it was unlikely that they were unaware of his anti Semitic tendencies Yet Stein can now write But I know of nothing in his behavior to me to my family to Israel or to Jews in general that entitles him to anything less than my total loyalty Loyalty To a president who can mouth and therefore think such dangerous anti Semitic dynamite Stein s posture is that of one who puts self interest above principle opportunism above ethics In so doing he fails the Jewish people and does a grave disservice to the sense of fairness and decency to all Meyer Rangell Bloomingburg N Y Herbert Stein responds What was in Mr Nixon s heart and soul and whether that was represented by the offensive things he said to some people I do not know I can only reflect my own experience and observation I never had any reason to think that Mr Nixon was anti Semitic I never heard him make a remark that was in the slightest degree suggestive of such an attitude He was unfailingly friendly and sympathetic not only to me but also to other members of my family As is well known he appointed and relied upon a number of Jews Kissinger Burns Safire Garment and me His longtime political mentor Murray Chotiner was Jewish He defended Israel when it was in the greatest danger of its history in 1973 and the Israelis regarded him as their friend The statement in my article I know of nothing in his behavior to me to my family to Israel or to Jews in general that entitles him to anything less than my total loyalty is quite precise It said neither more nor less than I meant and I stand by it Mr Rangell attributes despicable motives to me which can be summed up as opportunism Since Mr Rangell does not know me I think it inappropriate for him to make such judgments about me The Reign of Chain Weighs Plainly on the Brain According to Seth Stevenson in Bound in Chains electronic chain mail is campaigned against by certain Web sites on the grounds that it wastes Internet bandwidth reduces productivity and exploits human emotions He goes on to consider the upside to such mail and closes by noting perhaps jokingly that he recently forwarded some on to 10 friends Electronic chain mail certainly is objectionable for the reasons Stevenson notes But more importantly it is specifically outlawed on virtually all electronic mail systems The Internet Engineering Task Force s RFC on Netiquette Guidelines instructs Never send chain letters via electronic mail Chain letters are forbidden on the Internet Your network privileges will be revoked Notify your local system administrator As the de facto rules of Internet use RCF 1855 should be read by all new Internet users including Slate writers Slate does nothing to overcome the numerous hurdles it faces to acceptance by Net culture in suggesting that it s OK to engage in a practice which is forbidden for numerous good reasons and which can result in its readers accounts being revoked Michael Fuchs Menlo Park Calif We Need to Talk I agree with Jacob Weisberg s Not Just Talk that a national conversation on race that focused on ways of lessening de facto segregation would be a good thing However unless I am mistaken this is not the conversation that President Clinton has proposed It seems that we are in for a conversation about race as such isolated from specific problems and specific policy proposals Thus the results are more likely to be those of Sheldon Hackney s ill conceived multicultural conversations which disintegrated predictably into the type of entrenched obscurantist indeed segregationist identity politics posing that is so familiar to those of us who have spent time on the campuses of elite universities Preliminary local conversations on race have already been held in North Carolina and they have gone nowhere They have been as they will be at the national level conversations about racism These make some people feel good by encouraging them to feel angry and they make others feel good by letting them feel guilty but they make the rest of us feel a distinctly tight sensation in our chests as our hopes for a rational discussion are systematically disappointed And they don t begin to address the concrete socioeconomic problems that exacerbate racial strife in this country which Jacob Weisberg correctly highlights Matthew J Feeney Namer vs Namer James Surowiecki writes in You Name It One can only speculate how executives of a company called Combined Insurance explained to themselves their decision to adopt the name Aon Actually anyone who knows anything about the insurance business understands the reason for the change Combined Insurance Company still exists and writes insurance under that name The parent company recently acquired by merger the world s largest insurance broker Alexander Alexander Services Inc and also a large British broker called Bain Hogg Group plc which does substantial business in Asian countries Alexander Alexander was known to all insurance professionals as A A which was a name with considerable brand value So the newly merged company had several problems how to announce to the world that it was now not only an insurance underwriter but also a broker how to keep the A A brand value without appearing simply to be gobbling up Bain Hogg and how to do this with a name that is easy to say in European and Asian languages The answer Aon is to my mind quite elegant It keeps the initial capital A and the first two syllables of A A pronounced A n A it puns on eon which implies longevity and stability a desirable connotation for an insurance services company especially one that has just undergone a major and disruptive change it has a remote but perceptible similarity in sound to Bain and it gives the company a unique legally protectable and memorable name unlike the generic Combined Insurance moniker The switch to Aon is very similar to the process that Standard Oil of New Jersey whose main subsidiary marketed in most places under the same Esso went through when it switched to Exxon Although I have no way of knowing I wouldn t be surprised if the Aon people modeled their choice on the Exxon example You ll notice that in my last sentence I idly speculated on the Aon company s use of the Exxon example That s all right for me I m just a letter to the editor writer But Surowiecki is a professional He should at least make a minimal effort to find out about his subject companies before he makes fun of them I learned quite a bit about Aon at www aon com which is more than Surowiecki did Joe Ruby Your Slippage Is Showing Regarding Scott Shuger s question in Today s Papers as to why less buying power for Americans in Japan and further slippage in the trade balance with European countries aren t of equal concern The United States runs a relatively small merchandise trade deficit with Europe relative to its deficit with Japan in some European countries e g the United Kingdom the United States runs a surplus Although a strong dollar relative to several European currencies notably the German mark and the Italian lira is worrisome it is nowhere near as serious as the huge 50 billion in 1995 trade deficit with Japan Another point to consider is that for much of the 1990s U S productivity growth has far outpaced that of its major European trading partners This means that there is potential for the U S dollar to grow relative to the European countries without giving rise to a further significant worsening of the U S trade balance with Europe In closing while I agree with you that a rising U S currency relative to its European partners may not be a positive development it is certainly not of equal concern with the persistent trade deficit with Japan Doug Heath Summary Fudgement In the interest of veracity a couple of corrections to your rather inaccurate synopsis of Richard Russo s Straight Man in Summary Judgment which naturally makes me wonder about that feature s synopses of those books movies etc that I haven t read 1 The synopsis infers that the narrative is propelled by an incident the protagonist loses his job which in fact does not occur until the last 30 pages of the novel And he is offered a better job Which he turns down 2 The protagonist in no way commandeers a television station In fact he becomes the inadvertent subject of a taped remote at the college campus OK seemingly small details But such are the delights of every Russo novel so you might as well get them right Harley Peyton Address your e mail to the editors to letters slate com Please include your address and daytime phone number for confirmation only
