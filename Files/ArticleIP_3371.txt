 That Evening at Dinner To hear the poet read That Evening at Dinner click By the last few times we saw her it was clearThat things were different When you tried to help herGet out of the car or get from the car to the doorOr across the apartment house hall to the elevatorThere was a new sense of heavinessOr of inertia in the body It wasn tThat she was less willing to be helped to walkBut that the walking itself had become less willing Maybe the stupid demogorgon blindRecalcitrance of body resentful of the lawsOf mind and spirit was getting its own back now Or maybe a new and subtle alien Intelligence of body was obedient nowTo other laws Weight is the measure of The force with which a body is drawn downward To the center of the earth Inertia isThe tendency of a body to resist Proceeding to its fate in any wayOther than that determined for itself That evening at the Bromells apartment after She had been carried up through the rational structureBy articulate stages floor after flashing floor And after we helped her get across the hall And get across the room to a chair somehowWe got her seated in a chair that was placedA little too far away from the nearest table At the edge of the abyss and there she sat Exposed her body the object of our attention The heaviness of it the helpless graceless leg The thick stocking the leg brace the medical shoe At work between herself and us there wasA new principle of social awkwardnessAnd skillfulness required of each of us Our tones of voice in this easy conversationWere instruments of marvelous finesse Measuring and maintaining with exactitude The fact or condition of the differenceThere was between us both in space and time Her smiling made her look as if she hadJust then tasted something delicious the charmHer courtesy attributed to her friends This decent elegant fellow human beingWas seated in virtue character disability Behind her the order of the ranged bookshelves The windows monitored by Venetian blinds These can be raised or lowered numerous slats Horizontally arranged and parallel Which can be tilted so as to admitPrecisely the desired light or air We were all her friends Maggie and Bill and Anne And I and the nice Boston Brahmin elderly manNamed Duncan utterly friendly and benign And of course it wasn t whether or not the worldWas benign but whether it looked at her too much She wasn t painfully shy but just the same I wouldn t be surprised if there had beenPainfulness in her shyness earlier on Say at dancing school Like others though she hadSurvived her childhood somehow Nor do I meanShe was unhappy Maybe more or less soBefore her marriage One had the sense of tripsArranged committees concerts baffled courage Living it through giving it order and style And one had the sense of the late marriage as ofTwo bafflements inventing the sense they made Together The marriage seemed to the outside world And probably was radiant and triumphant And I think that one could almost certainly sayThat during the last heroic phase of things After his death and after the stroke she hadBy force of character and careful management Maintained a certain degree of happiness The books there on the bookshelves told their stories Line after line all of them evenly spaced And spaces between the words You could fall through the spaces In one of the books Dr Johnson told the story In the scale of being wherever it begins Or ends there are chasms infinitely deep Infinite vacuities For surely Nothing can so disturb the passions or Perplex the intellects of man so much As the disruption of this union withVisible nature separation from allThat has delighted or engaged him a changeNot only of the place but of the mannerOf his being an entrance into a state Not simply which he knows not but perhapsA state he has not faculties to know The dinner was delicious fresh greens and reds And yellows produce of the season due And fish from the nearby sea and there were alsoAshes to be eaten and dirt to drink
