 Newt s Hypocrisy Dear Jim Can it be that our exercise in stunt online writing is nearing its conclusion already And just now when we d gotten to the topic of Newt Gingrich s sex life a subject that surely deserves a full week of breakfasts if anyone can stomach it Newt s hypocrisy is truly flabbergasting But the thing that always kills me about these politician dallies with comely staffer stories isn t the adultery or even the hypocrisy it s how these affairs undermine the work of the other women and men who hold the same jobs as the old guys paramours I m still waiting for the masses of former White House interns to file some kind of class action lawsuit Couldn t they get damages for their lost future earnings After all their once prestigious job title White House intern has been transformed into the world s easiest one liner It s got to be no fun having a lurid joke embedded in your r sum A final note on the dim fate of the San Francisco Examiner A column in today s soon to be Hearst owned San Francisco Chronicle suggests that we shouldn t be digging the Hearst owned Examiner s grave so fast But the same story fails to unearth a single credible potential buyer As you asked yesterday Isn t there someone in San Francisco who has the cash and hubris to lose millions year after year on a daily How about one of those IPO d cyber moguls After all they re experts in losing millions But here s how the CEO of CBS MarketWatch Larry Kramer reacted to the Chronicle columnist s suggestion that he should buy the Examiner How stupid do I look I reach 10 times that many people now Sigh So much for cross media synergies Jim I ve enjoyed your musings about murdered birds dead presidents deceased cooking show hosts and dying newspapers I wish you luck in all future poker games and many newsy breakfasts Yours Katharine
