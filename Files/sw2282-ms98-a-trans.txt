                do you believe in uh capital punishment   you know you youre talking to probably one of the the sixties late sixties and early seventies original hippies  now living in suburbia raising kids um   uhhuh yeah   i dont know i have a i have a real gut response that says nobodys got a you know a right to take anybody elses life on the other hand i have seen an awful lot of ive lived in major cities and i have kind of come to the conclusion that there are certain people that should just be shot   yeah well i think uh that based on um certain crimes it uh is merited uh there was a case just recently i dont know if you uh if you heard about this in uh New Hampshire i believe about the uh teacher school teacher who hired her uh one of her high school students to kill her husband and they found her guilty and gave her life with no parole   yes   and in a case like that uh where well youve got  a moral problem and an economic one uh   yeah   when when shes going to be in prison for the rest of her life with no chance of parole what good does it do anybody and the taxpayers are going to be footing the bill for the rest of her life shes a young young woman uh in her late twenties i guess so i just   something like twenty two or twenty three i remember reading that and being horrified   early twenties well i could be yeah   uh had she had any previous criminal history now thats the of thing id have to kind of look at   um i dont know i didnt hear that much about it uh just the uh the verdict that they had   in Texas if youre going to sentence somebody to uh to death what is is there a specific criteria that they have to meet   um i dont i dont really know about that uh uh if well uh i think i think its its only it only applies to certain a very few types of crimes uh murder and i think kidnapping could carry death penalty as well im not sure what how what the range is for uh for the crimes that uh would merit a death penalty   um if you were on a jury would would you be able to to give somebody a death sentence   uh i think it depends on what what it was they did and if the evidence was uh uh if there was no doubt in my mind that that person was guilty of that crime   umhum   and if they were uh if if  if i had no doubt that uh they would be a hazard to to the rest of uh the population as long as they were alive uh yeah i could probably go along with that   how about if it was uh a seventeen and a half year old with a a list and all uh of  what do they call it uh criminal as long as your armed over the history of a violent crime   well  i guess youve got a choice either you do life in prison or you can institutionalize somebody forever uh where theyre not a threat to to the rest of uh the population or or you can put them out of everybodys misery uh i dont know its its a real moral dilemma   yeah   i mean i come from the Catholic church and  they they uh are definitely opposed   yeah see i come from a Catholic church background too   to that type of umhum   and always thought you know that being raised in the midwest you really didnt see any crimes really any more heinous than uh shoplifting   right yeah   and it was very easy to maintain this stand that you know that that life is something that you have no right to to take   when you see all the people who are convicted of these crimes and they get out of prison after a few years all of the sudden here theyre theyre uh committing the same type of crimes all over again other people are victimized what do you do about it   i dont know you know there was a oh what was his Gary Gilmore did you ever read the book that Norman Mailer wrote The Executioners Song   no i never did   Gary Gilmore was the one who was arrested and uh found guilty of i think two or three murders in Utah Provo outside of Provo and he was the one that was petitioning to have have you know himself executed   uhhuh okay   when you read his book with all the interviews this guy did with Gary Gilmore you know it sounds like the guy had about every turn given to him every rehab opportunity given to him and even interviews with his mother she said that you know for for as a small child hes basically was amoral   right   and when i finished that book i kind of thought you know what do you how do with a person like this   well some people just are incorrigible and theres no way that they can ever deal with society and abide by rules so in in a case like that uh given what crime theyre guilty of uh yeah i could i could justify a death penalty for somebody who just has no chance of ever reforming or coming to grips with uh living in normal society   see i would i always come look at it do they have could they be put even in life imprisonment could they be put to useful labor   um yeah i believe so   could they do road work and those kind of things and now and then you get somebody like Charles Manson who just even hasnt a guy around   well people who tend to be say on death row they i think theyre kept in isolation all the time i dont believe that theyre given a chance to uh do anything productive or even uh mix with the rest of the prison community   and then what do you do about the the thing that you know the the the was it one tenth of one percent chance that they might have been convicted erroneously   right well  its its its real small but uh like i said i mean the death penalty could probably be justified if if the evidence if theres no doubt no i never have   have you ever sat on a jury either have i and im one of these people who votes regularly and im always registered wherever ive lived and i have never been called   i know several people at work whove been called on juries and they absolutely hate it   part of me says that id kind of like to do it just to see what its like to be in that position where you are playing you know life and death with somebody else could i bring myself to do it   well so much of it is game playing with the lawyers theyre plea doing their plea bargaining and and uh give and take type situation that uh theyre playing with peoples lives in effect uh by offering uh to uh uh offering to announce their guilt to a certain degree on a crime in order to get uh a lighter uh sentence sentence   yeah have you ever lived in a in a well but Dallas is im is are you calling from Dallas   uh yeah im in that area uhhuh   okay have have you ever been a victim of a crime   uh yes i have uh automobile uh vandalism   you know when we lived in Boston i had eleven cars stolen   my gosh   yeah some of them i had for two days and youd go to court and youd see these kids and then and   yeah   what they did is they usually hired kids to do this because you uh would get a you know a lighter sentence or no sentence or probation or you know something trivial and itd be the same damn kids   right sure   over and over and over again and the first couple of times you know i felt really sorry for them but after a while it was like you know shoot the little shits right then and there then i felt really you know guilty about feeling that way   yeah yeah id i dont have much sympathy for people that are uh uh victimizing others on a regular basis you know if its a one time offense and and the kid learns his lesson and uh shows remorse and promises never to do something again and they take some steps to educate him in the matter uh its its one thing but when theyre there over and over again and uh guilty of the same crimes uh nothing seems to help   yeah yeah i you know i really dont know what what i would do in that situation if i had to to make that judgment i think i would i think id be very easily swayed by fellow jurors   uh yeah well i think it depends on what the crime is uh youre not going to sentence somebody to death for stealing a car uh if its first degree murder or uh   boy if they ever catch this guy in in Richardson and Coppell whos been uh you know abducting the the young girls i dont think id even hesitate   right no something like that is just uh unforgivable   and then you get you know what do you do with you know people that are you know chronic child molesters   yeah well  i dont know   where even a psychiatrist says youre proba bly not going to change them theyre always going to be you know at risk in society and and and i think you know having kids has probably really   right   changed you know my thinking on this i dont know i really dont know   yeah i think people like that when they do get put in prison with the other hard core prisoners uh the child molesters in particular are not looked on kindly by the other prisoners they dont get a lot of respect and they they probably tend not to even survive in that uh type of environment because even in prison they have their code of ethics i guess if you can call it that   yeah but the code of ethics thats learned in prison is so so bent and twisted that you wonder when they get out of there even if they you know claim that theyre are rehabbed   sure well yeah they dont have any really useful job skills uh lots of places no   they dont even have social skills oh i dont know i really dont know i i think that if somebody asked me i would hesitantly say yes that i could could hand down a death sentence   umhum   uh then the big you know my big problem would be is what if you were in a in a state that absolutely did not allow it   well   and you were on a jury with some heinous you know criminal who had you know just wiped out an entire family   right youve got life without parole something like that   or parole in in uh fifteen twenty years   sure well case like Charles Manson hes uh hes been eligible for parole a couple of times already his case comes up every few years now i guess and uh people have to uh stand up and uh denounce him again and claim that hes not fit for society but were that close to letting people like that out of prison
