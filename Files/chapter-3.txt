 COUNTERTERRORISM EVOLVES In chapter 2 we described the growth of a new kind of terrorism and a new terrorist organization especially from 1988 to 1998 when Usama Bin Ladin declared war and organized the bombing of two U S embassies In this chapter we trace the parallel evolution of government efforts to counter terrorism by Islamic extremists against the United States We mention many personalities in this report As in any study of the U S government some of the most important characters are institutions We will introduce various agencies and how they adapted to a new kind of terrorism FROM THE OLD TERRORISM TO THE NEW THE FIRST WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBING At 18 minutes after noon on February 26 1993 a huge bomb went off beneath the two towers of the World Trade Center This was not a suicide attack The terrorists parked a truck bomb with a timing device on Level B 2 of the underground garage then departed The ensuing explosion opened a hole seven stories up Six people died More than a thousand were injured An FBI agent at the scene described the relatively low number of fatalities as a miracle President Bill Clinton ordered his National Security Council to coordinate the response Government agencies swung into action to find the culprits The Counterterrorist Center located at the CIA combed its files and queried sources around the world The National Security Agency NSA the huge Defense Department signals collection agency ramped up its communications intercept network and searched its databases for clues The New York Field Office of the FBI took control of the local investigation and in the end set a pattern for future management of terrorist incidents Four features of this episode have significance for the story of 9 11 First the bombing signaled a new terrorist challenge one whose rage and malice had no limit Ramzi Yousef the Sunni extremist who planted the bomb said later that he had hoped to kill 250 000 people Second the FBI and the Justice Department did excellent work investigating the bombing Within days the FBI identified a truck remnant as part of a Ryder rental van reported stolen in Jersey City the day before the bombing Mohammed Salameh who had rented the truck and reported it stolen kept calling the rental office to get back his 400 deposit The FBI arrested him there on March 4 1993 In short order the Bureau had several plotters in custody including Nidal Ayyad an engineer who had acquired chemicals for the bomb and Mahmoud Abouhalima who had helped mix the chemicals The FBI identified another conspirator Ahmad Ajaj who had been arrested by immigration authorities at John F Kennedy International Airport in September 1992 and charged with document fraud His traveling companion was Ramzi Yousef who had also entered with fraudulent documents but claimed political asylum and was admitted It quickly became clear that Yousef had been a central player in the attack He had fled to Pakistan immediately after the bombing and would remain at large for nearly two years The arrests of Salameh Abouhalima and Ayyad led the FBI to the Farouq mosque in Brooklyn where a central figure was Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman an extremist Sunni Muslim cleric who had moved to the United States from Egypt in 1990 In speeches and writings the sightless Rahman often called the Blind Sheikh preached the message of Sayyid Qutb s Milestones characterizing the United States as the oppressor of Muslims worldwide and asserting that it was their religious duty to fight against God s enemies An FBI informant learned of a plan to bomb major New York landmarks including the Holland and Lincoln tunnels Disrupting this landmarks plot the FBI in June 1993 arrested Rahman and various confederates As a result of the investigations and arrests the U S Attorney for the Southern District of New York prosecuted and convicted multiple individuals including Ajaj Salameh Ayyad Abouhalima the Blind Sheikh and Ramzi Yousef for crimes related to the World Trade Center bombing and other plots An unfortunate consequence of this superb investigative and prosecutorial effort was that it created an impression that the law enforcement system was well equipped to cope with terrorism Neither President Clinton his principal advisers the Congress nor the news media felt prompted until later to press the question of whether the procedures that put the Blind Sheikh and Ramzi Yousef behind bars would really protect Americans against the new virus of which these individuals were just the first symptoms Third the successful use of the legal system to address the first World Trade Center bombing had the side effect of obscuring the need to examine the character and extent of the new threat facing the United States The trials did not bring the Bin Ladin network to the attention of the public and policymakers The FBI assembled and the U S Attorney s office put forward some evidence showing that the men in the dock were not the only plotters Materials taken from Ajaj indicated that the plot or plots were hatched at or near the Khaldan camp a terrorist training camp on the Afghanistan Pakistan border Ajaj had left Texas in April 1992 to go there to learn how to construct bombs He had met Ramzi Yousef in Pakistan where they discussed bombing targets in the United States and assembled a terrorist kit that included bomb making manuals operations guidance videotapes advocating terrorist action against the United States and false identification documents Yousef was captured in Pakistan following the discovery by police in the Philippines in January 1995 of the Manila air plot which envisioned placing bombs on board a dozen trans Pacific airliners and setting them off simultaneously Khalid Sheikh Mohammed Yousef s uncle then located in Qatar was a fellow plotter of Yousef s in the Manila air plot and had also wired him some money prior to the Trade Center bombing The U S Attorney obtained an indictment against KSM in January 1996 but an official in the government of Qatar probably warned him about it Khalid Sheikh Mohammed evaded capture and stayed at large to play a central part in the 9 11 attacks 10 The law enforcement process is concerned with proving the guilt of persons apprehended and charged Investigators and prosecutors could not present all the evidence of possible involvement of individuals other than those charged although they continued to pursue such investigations planning or hoping for later prosecutions The process was meant by its nature to mark for the public the events as finished case solved justice done It was not designed to ask if the events might be harbingers of worse to come Nor did it allow for aggregating and analyzing facts to see if they could provide clues to terrorist tactics more generally methods of entry and finance and mode of operation inside the United States Fourth although the bombing heightened awareness of a new terrorist danger successful prosecutions contributed to widespread underestimation of the threat The government s attorneys stressed the seriousness of the crimes and put forward evidence of Yousef s technical ingenuity Yet the public image that persisted was not of clever Yousef but of stupid Salameh going back again and again to reclaim his 400 truck rental deposit ADAPTATION AND NONADAPTATION IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY Legal processes were the primary method for responding to these early manifestations of a new type of terrorism Our overview of U S capabilities for dealing with it thus begins with the nation s vast complex of law enforcement agencies The Justice Department and the FBI At the federal level much law enforcement activity is concentrated in the Department of Justice For countering terrorism the dominant agency under Justice is the Federal Bureau of Investigation The FBI does not have a general grant of authority but instead works under specific statutory authorizations Most of its work is done in local offices called field offices There are 56 of them each covering a specified geographic area and each quite separate from all others Prior to 9 11 the special agent in charge was in general free to set his or her office s priorities and assign personnel accordingly The office s priorities were driven by two primary concerns First performance in the Bureau was generally measured against statistics such as numbers of arrests indictments prosecutions and convictions Counterterrorism and counterintelligence work often involving lengthy intelligence investigations that might never have positive or quantifiable results was not career enhancing Most agents who reached management ranks had little counterterrorism experience Second priorities were driven at the local level by the field offices whose concerns centered on traditional crimes such as white collar offenses and those pertaining to drugs and gangs Individual field offices made choices to serve local priorities not national priorities The Bureau also operates under an office of origin system To avoid duplication and possible conflicts the FBI designates a single office to be in charge of an entire investigation Because the New York Field Office indicted Bin Ladin prior to the East Africa bombings it became the office of origin for all Bin Ladin cases including the East Africa bombings and later the attack on the USS Cole Most of the FBI s institutional knowledge on Bin Ladin and al Qaeda resided there This office worked closely with the U S Attorney for the Southern District of New York to identify arrest prosecute and convict many of the perpetrators of the attacks and plots Field offices other than the specified office of origin were often reluctant to spend much energy on matters over which they had no control and for which they received no credit The FBI s domestic intelligence gathering dates from the 1930s With World War II looming President Franklin D Roosevelt ordered FBI Director J Edgar Hoover to investigate foreign and foreign inspired subversion Communist Nazi and Japanese Hoover added investigation of possible espionage sabotage or subversion to the duties of field offices After the war foreign intelligence duties were assigned to the newly established Central Intelligence Agency Hoover jealously guarded the FBI s domestic portfolio against all rivals Hoover felt he was accountable only to the president and the FBI s domestic intelligence activities kept growing In the 1960s the FBI was receiving significant assistance within the United States from the CIA and from Army Intelligence The legal basis for some of this assistance was dubious Decades of encouragement to perform as a domestic intelligence agency abruptly ended in the 1970s Two years after Hoover s death in 1972 congresCOUNTERTERRORISM sional and news media investigations of the Watergate scandals of the Nixon administration expanded into general investigations of foreign and domestic intelligence by the Church and Pike committees They disclosed domestic intelligence efforts which included a covert action program that operated from 1956 to 1971 against domestic organizations and eventually domestic dissidents The FBI had spied on a wide range of political figures especially individuals whom Hoover wanted to discredit notably the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr and had authorized unlawful wiretaps and surveillance The shock registered in public opinion polls where the percentage of Americans declaring a highly favorable view of the FBI dropped from 84 percent to 37 percent The FBI s Domestic Intelligence Division was dissolved In 1976 Attorney General Edward Levi adopted domestic security guidelines to regulate intelligence collection in the United States and to deflect calls for even stronger regulation In 1983 Attorney General William French Smith revised the Levi guidelines to encourage closer investigation of potential terrorism He also loosened the rules governing authorization for investigations and their duration Still his guidelines like Levi s took account of the reality that suspicion of terrorism like suspicion of subversion could lead to making individuals targets for investigation more because of their beliefs than because of their acts Smith s guidelines also took account of the reality that potential terrorists were often members of extremist religious organizations and that investigation of terrorism could cross the line separating state and church In 1986 Congress authorized the FBI to investigate terrorist attacks against Americans that occur outside the United States Three years later it added authority for the FBI to make arrests abroad without consent from the host country Meanwhile a task force headed by Vice President George H W Bush had endorsed a concept already urged by Director of Central Intelligence William Casey a Counterterrorist Center where the FBI the CIA and other organizations could work together on international terrorism While it was distinctly a CIA entity the FBI detailed officials to work at the Center and obtained leads that helped in the capture of persons wanted for trial in the United States The strengths that the FBI brought to counterterrorism were nowhere more brilliantly on display than in the case of Pan American Flight 103 bound from London to New York which blew up over Lockerbie Scotland in December 1988 killing 270 people Initial evidence pointed to the government of Syria and later Iran The Counterterrorist Center reserved judgment on the perpetrators of the attack Meanwhile FBI technicians working with U K security services gathered and analyzed the widely scattered fragments of the airliner In 1991 with the help of the Counterterrorist Center they identified one small fragment as part of a timing device to the technicians as distinctive as DNA It was a Libyan device Together with other evidence the FBI put together a case pointing conclusively to the Libyan government Eventually Libya acknowledged its responsibility Pan Am 103 became a cautionary tale against rushing to judgment in attributing responsibility for a terrorist act It also showed again how given a case to solve the FBI remained capable of extraordinary investigative success FBI Organization and Priorities In 1993 President Clinton chose Louis Freeh as the Director of the Bureau Freeh who would remain Director until June 2001 believed that the FBI s work should be done primarily by the field offices To emphasize this view he cut headquarters staff and decentralized operations The special agents in charge gained power influence and independence Freeh recognized terrorism as a major threat He increased the number of legal attach offices abroad focusing in particular on the Middle East He also urged agents not to wait for terrorist acts to occur before taking action In his first budget request to Congress after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing he stated that merely solving this type of crime is not enough it is equally important that the FBI thwart terrorism before such acts can be perpetrated Within headquarters he created a Counterterrorism Division that would complement the Counterterrorist Center at the CIA and arranged for exchanges of senior FBI and CIA counterterrorism officials He pressed for more cooperation between legal attach s and CIA stations abroad Freeh s efforts did not however translate into a significant shift of resources to counterterrorism FBI Justice and Office of Management and Budget officials said that FBI leadership seemed unwilling to shift resources to terrorism from other areas such as violent crime and drug enforcement other FBI officials blamed Congress and the OMB for a lack of political will and failure to understand the FBI s counterterrorism resource needs In addition Freeh did not impose his views on the field offices With a few notable exceptions the field offices did not apply significant resources to terrorism and often reprogrammed funds for other priorities In 1998 the FBI issued a five year strategic plan led by its deputy director Robert Bear Bryant For the first time the FBI designated national and economic security including counterterrorism as its top priority Dale Watson who would later become the head of the new Counterterrorism Division said that after the East Africa bombings the light came on that cultural change had to occur within the FBI The plan mandated a stronger intelligence collection effort It called for a nationwide automated system to facilitate information collection analysis and dissemination It envisioned the creation of a professional intelligence cadre of experienced and trained agents and analysts If successfully implemented this would have been a major step toward addressing terrorism systematically rather than as individual unrelated cases But the plan did not succeed First the plan did not obtain the necessary human resources Despite desCOUNTERTERRORISM ignating national and economic security as its top priority in 1998 the FBI did not shift human resources accordingly Although the FBI s counterterrorism budget tripled during the mid 1990s FBI counterterrorism spending remained fairly constant between fiscal years 1998 and 2001 In 2000 there were still twice as many agents devoted to drug enforcement as to counterterrorism Second the new division intended to strengthen the FBI s strategic analysis capability faltered It received insufficient resources and faced resistance from senior managers in the FBI s operational divisions The new division was supposed to identify trends in terrorist activity determine what the FBI did not know and ultimately drive collection efforts However the FBI had little appreciation for the role of analysis Analysts continued to be used primarily in a tactical fashion providing support for existing cases Compounding the problem was the FBI s tradition of hiring analysts from within instead of recruiting individuals with the relevant educational background and expertise Moreover analysts had difficulty getting access to the FBI and intelligence community information they were expected to analyze The poor state of the FBI s information systems meant that such access depended in large part on an analyst s personal relationships with individuals in the operational units or squads where the information resided For all of these reasons prior to 9 11 relatively few strategic analytic reports about counterterrorism had been completed Indeed the FBI had never completed an assessment of the overall terrorist threat to the U S homeland Third the FBI did not have an effective intelligence collection effort Collection of intelligence from human sources was limited and agents were inadequately trained Only three days of a 16 week agents course were devoted to counterintelligence and counterterrorism and most subsequent training was received on the job The FBI did not have an adequate mechanism for validating source reporting nor did it have a system for adequately tracking and sharing source reporting either internally or externally The FBI did not dedicate sufficient resources to the surveillance and translation needs of counterterrorism agents It lacked sufficient translators proficient in Arabic and other key languages resulting in a significant backlog of untranslated intercepts Finally the FBI s information systems were woefully inadequate The FBI lacked the ability to know what it knew there was no effective mechanism for capturing or sharing its institutional knowledge FBI agents did create records of interviews and other investigative efforts but there were no reports officers to condense the information into meaningful intelligence that could be retrieved and disseminated In 1999 the FBI created separate Counterterrorism and Counterintelligence divisions Dale Watson the first head of the new Counterterrorism Division recognized the urgent need to increase the FBI s counterterrorism capability His plan called MAXCAP 05 was unveiled in 2000 it set the goal of bringing the Bureau to its maximum feasible capacity in counterterrorism by 2005 Field executives told Watson that they did not have the analysts linguists or technically trained experts to carry out the strategy In a report provided to Director Robert Mueller in September 2001 one year after Watson presented his plan to field executives almost every FBI field office was assessed to be operating below maximum capacity The report stated that the goal to prevent terrorism requires a dramatic shift in emphasis from a reactive capability to highly functioning intelligence capability which provides not only leads and operational support but clear strategic analysis and direction Legal Constraints on the FBI and the Wall The FBI had different tools for law enforcement and intelligence For criminal matters it could apply for and use traditional criminal warrants For intelligence matters involving international terrorism however the rules were different For many years the attorney general could authorize surveillance of foreign powers and agents of foreign powers without any court review but in 1978 Congress passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act 29This law regulated intelligence collection directed at foreign powers and agents of foreign powers in the United States In addition to requiring court review of proposed surveillance and later physical searches the 1978 act was interpreted by the courts to require that a search be approved only if its primary purpose was to obtain foreign intelligence information In other words the authorities of the FISA law could not be used to circumvent traditional criminal warrant requirements The Justice Department interpreted these rulings as saying that criminal prosecutors could be briefed on FISA information but could not direct or control its collection Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s Justice prosecutors had informal arrangements for obtaining information gathered in the FISA process the understanding being that they would not improperly exploit that process for their criminal cases Whether the FBI shared with prosecutors information pertinent to possible criminal investigations was left solely to the judgment of the FBI But the prosecution of Aldrich Ames for espionage in 1994 revived concerns about the prosecutors role in intelligence investigations The Department of Justice s Office of Intelligence Policy and Review OIPR is responsible for reviewing and presenting all FISA applications to the FISA Court It worried that because of the numerous prior consultations between FBI agents and prosecutors the judge might rule that the FISA warrants had been misused If that had happened Ames might have escaped conviction Richard Scruggs the acting head of OIPR complained to Attorney General Janet Reno about the lack of information sharing controls On his own he began imposing informationsharing procedures for FISA material The Office of Intelligence Policy and Review became the gatekeeper for the flow of FISA information to criminal prosecutors In July 1995 Attorney General Reno issued formal procedures aimed at managing information sharing between Justice Department prosecutors and the FBI They were developed in a working group led by the Justice Department s Executive Office of National Security overseen by Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick These procedures while requiring the sharing of intelligence information with prosecutors regulated the manner in which such information could be shared from the intelligence side of the house to the criminal side These procedures were almost immediately misunderstood and misapplied As a result there was far less information sharing and coordination between the FBI and the Criminal Division in practice than was allowed under the department s procedures Over time the procedures came to be referred to as the wall The term the wall is misleading however because several factors led to a series of barriers to information sharing that developed The Office of Intelligence Policy and Review became the sole gatekeeper for passing information to the Criminal Division Though Attorney General Reno s procedures did not include such a provision the Office assumed the role anyway arguing that its position reflected the concerns of Judge Royce Lamberth then chief judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court The Office threatened that if it could not regulate the flow of information to criminal prosecutors it would no longer present the FBI s warrant requests to the FISA Court The information flow withered The 1995 procedures dealt only with sharing between agents and criminal prosecutors not between two kinds of FBI agents those working on intelligence matters and those working on criminal matters But pressure from the Office of Intelligence Policy Review FBI leadership and the FISA Court built barriers between agents even agents serving on the same squads FBI Deputy Director Bryant reinforced the Office s caution by informing agents that too much information sharing could be a career stopper Agents in the field began to believe incorrectly that no FISA information could be shared with agents working on criminal investigations This perception evolved into the still more exaggerated belief that the FBI could not share any intelligence information with criminal investigators even if no FISA procedures had been used Thus relevant information from the National Security Agency and the CIA often failed to make its way to criminal investigators Separate reviews in 1999 2000 and 2001 concluded independently that information sharing was not occurring and that the intent of the 1995 procedures was ignored routinely We will describe some of the unfortunate consequences of these accumulated institutional beliefs and practices in chapter 8 There were other legal limitations Both prosecutors and FBI agents argued that they were barred by court rules from sharing grand jury information even though the prohibition applied only to that small fraction that had been presented to a grand jury and even that prohibition had exceptions But as interpreted by FBI field offices this prohibition could conceivably apply to much of the information unearthed in an investigation There were also restrictions arising from executive order on the commingling of domestic information with foreign intelligence Finally the NSA began putting caveats on its Bin Ladin related reports that required prior approval before sharing their contents with criminal investigators and prosecutors These developments further blocked the arteries of information sharing Other Law Enforcement Agencies The Justice Department is much more than the FBI It also has a U S Marshals Service almost 4 000 strong on 9 11 and especially expert in tracking fugitives with much local police knowledge The department s Drug Enforcement Administration had as of 2001 more than 4 500 agents There were a number of occasions when DEA agents were able to introduce sources to the FBI or CIA for counterterrorism use The Immigration and Naturalization Service INS with its 9 000 Border Patrol agents 4 500 inspectors and 2 000 immigration special agents had perhaps the greatest potential to develop an expanded role in counterterrorism However the INS was focused on the formidable challenges posed by illegal entry over the southwest border criminal aliens and a growing backlog in the applications for naturalizing immigrants The White House the Justice Department and above all the Congress reinforced these concerns In addition when Doris Meissner became INS Commissioner in 1993 she found an agency seriously hampered by outdated technology and insufficient human resources Border Patrol agents were still using manual typewriters inspectors at ports of entry were using a paper watchlist the asylum and other benefits systems did not effectively deter fraudulent applicants Commissioner Meissner responded in 1993 to the World Trade Center bombing by providing seed money to the State Department s Consular Affairs Bureau to automate its terrorist watchlist used by consular officers and border inspectors The INS assigned an individual in a new lookout unit to work with the State Department in watchlisting suspected terrorists and with the intelligence community and the FBI in determining how to deal with them when they appeared at ports of entry By 1998 97 suspected terrorists had been denied admission at U S ports of entry because of the watchlist How to conduct deportation cases against aliens who were suspected terrorists caused significant debate The INS had immigration law expertise and authority to bring the cases but the FBI possessed the classified information sometimes needed as evidence and information sharing conflicts resulted New laws in 1996 authorized the use of classified evidence in removal hearings but the INS removed only a handful of the aliens with links to terrorist activity none identified as associated with al Qaeda using classified evidence Midlevel INS employees proposed comprehensive counterterrorism proCOUNTERTERRORISM posals to management in 1986 1995 and 1997 No action was taken on them In 1997 a National Security Unit was set up to handle alerts track potential terrorist cases for possible immigration enforcement action and work with the rest of the Justice Department It focused on the FBI s priorities of Hezbollah and Hamas and began to examine how immigration laws could be brought to bear on terrorism For instance it sought unsuccessfully to require that CIA security checks be completed before naturalization applications were approved Policy questions such as whether resident alien status should be revoked upon the person s conviction of a terrorist crime were not addressed Congress with the support of the Clinton administration doubled the number of Border Patrol agents required along the border with Mexico to one agent every quarter mile by 1999 It rejected efforts to bring additional resources to bear in the north The border with Canada had one agent for every 13 25 miles Despite examples of terrorists entering from Canada awareness of terrorist activity in Canada and its more lenient immigration laws and an inspector general s report recommending that the Border Patrol develop a northern border strategy the only positive step was that the number of Border Patrol agents was not cut any further Inspectors at the ports of entry were not asked to focus on terrorists Inspectors told us they were not even aware that when they checked the names of incoming passengers against the automated watchlist they were checking in part for terrorists In general border inspectors also did not have the information they needed to make fact based determinations of admissibility The INS initiated but failed to bring to completion two efforts that would have provided inspectors with information relevant to counterterrorism a proposed system to track foreign student visa compliance and a program to establish a way of tracking travelers entry to and exit from the United States In 1996 a new law enabled the INS to enter into agreements with state and local law enforcement agencies through which the INS provided training and the local agencies exercised immigration enforcement authority Terrorist watchlists were not available to them Mayors in cities with large immigrant populations sometimes imposed limits on city employee cooperation with federal immigration agents A large population lives outside the legal framework Fraudulent documents could be easily obtained Congress kept the number of INS agents static in the face of the overwhelming problem The chief vehicle for INS and for state and local participation in law enforcement was the Joint Terrorism Task Force JTTF first tried out in New York City in 1980 in response to a spate of incidents involving domestic terrorist organizations This task force was managed by the New York Field Office of the FBI and its existence provided an opportunity to exchange information and as happened after the first World Trade Center bombing to enlist local officers as well as other agency representatives as partners in the FBI investigation The FBI expanded the number of JTTFs throughout the 1990s and by 9 11 there were 34 While useful the JTTFs had limitations They set priorities in accordance with regional and field office concerns and most were not fully staffed Many state and local entities believed they had little to gain from having a full time representative on a JTTF Other federal law enforcement resources also not seriously enlisted for counterterrorism were to be found in the Treasury Department Treasury housed the Secret Service the Customs Service and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms Given the Secret Service s mission to protect the president and other high officials its agents did become involved with those of the FBI whenever terrorist assassination plots were rumored The Customs Service deployed agents at all points of entry into the United States Its agents worked alongside INS agents and the two groups sometimes cooperated In the winter of 1999 2000 as will be detailed in chapter 6 questioning by an especially alert Customs inspector led to the arrest of an al Qaeda terrorist whose apparent mission was to bomb Los Angeles International Airport The Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms was used on occasion by the FBI as a resource The ATF s laboratories and analysis were critical to the investigation of the February 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center and the April 1995 bombing of the Alfred P Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City Before 9 11 with the exception of one portion of the FBI very little of the sprawling U S law enforcement community was engaged in countering terrorism Moreover law enforcement could be effective only after specific individuals were identified a plot had formed or an attack had already occurred Responsible individuals had to be located apprehended and transported back to a U S court for prosecution As FBI agents emphasized to us the FBI and the Justice Department do not have cruise missiles They declare war by indicting someone They took on the lead role in addressing terrorism because they were asked to do so AND IN THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION The Federal Aviation Administration FAA within the Department of Transportation had been vested by Congress with the sometimes conflicting mandate of regulating the safety and security of U S civil aviation while also promoting the civil aviation industry The FAA had a security mission to protect the users of commercial air transportation against terrorism and other criminal acts In the years before 9 11 the FAA perceived sabotage as a greater threat to aviation than hijacking First no domestic hijacking had occurred in a decade Second the commercial aviation system was perceived as more vulnerable to explosives than to weapons such as firearms Finally explosives were perceived as deadlier than hijacking and therefore of greater consequence In 1996 a presidential commission on aviation safety and security chaired by Vice President Al Gore reinforced the prevailing concern about sabotage and explosives on aircraft The Gore Commission also flagged as a new danger the possibility of attack by surface to air missiles Its 1997 final report did not discuss the possibility of suicide hijackings The FAA set and enforced aviation security rules which airlines and airports were required to implement The rules were supposed to produce a layered system of defense This meant that the failure of any one layer of security would not be fatal because additional layers would provide backup security But each layer relevant to hijackings intelligence passenger prescreening checkpoint screening and onboard security was seriously flawed prior to 9 11 Taken together they did not stop any of the 9 11 hijackers from getting on board four different aircraft at three different airports The FAA s policy was to use intelligence to identify both specific plots and general threats to civil aviation security so that the agency could develop and deploy appropriate countermeasures The FAA s 40 person intelligence unit was supposed to receive a broad range of intelligence data from the FBI CIA and other agencies so that it could make assessments about the threat to aviation But the large volume of data contained little pertaining to the presence and activities of terrorists in the United States For example information on the FBI s effort in 1998 to assess the potential use of flight training by terrorists and the Phoenix electronic communication of 2001 warning of radical Middle Easterners attending flight school were not passed to FAA headquarters Several top FAA intelligence officials called the domestic threat picture a serious blind spot Moreover the FAA s intelligence unit did not receive much attention from the agency s leadership Neither Administrator Jane Garvey nor her deputy routinely reviewed daily intelligence and what they did see was screened for them She was unaware of a great amount of hijacking threat information from her own intelligence unit which in turn was not deeply involved in the agency s policymaking process Historically decisive security action took place only after a disaster had occurred or a specific plot had been discovered The next aviation security layer was passenger prescreening The FAA directed air carriers not to fly individuals known to pose a direct threat to civil aviation But as of 9 11 the FAA s no fly list contained the names of just 12 terrorist suspects including 9 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed even though government watchlists contained the names of many thousands of known and suspected terrorists This astonishing mismatch existed despite the Gore Commission s having called on the FBI and CIA four years earlier to provide terrorist watchlists to improve prescreening The longtime chief of the FAA s civil aviation security division testified that he was not even aware of the State Department sTIPOFF list of known and suspected terrorists some 60 000 before 9 11 until he heard it mentioned during the Commission s January 26 2004 public hearing The FAA had access to some TIPOFF data but apparently found it too difficult to use The second part of prescreening called on the air carriers to implement an FAA approved computerized algorithm known as CAPPS for Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System designed to identify passengers whose profile suggested they might pose more than a minimal risk to aircraft Although the algorithm included hijacker profile data at that time only passengers checking bags were eligible to be selected by CAPPS for additional scrutiny Selection entailed only having one s checked baggage screened for explosives or held off the airplane until one had boarded Primarily because of concern regarding potential discrimination and the impact on passenger throughput selectees were no longer required to undergo extraordinary screening of their carry on baggage as had been the case before the system was computerized in 1997 55 This policy change also reflected the perception that nonsuicide sabotage was the primary threat to civil aviation Checkpoint screening was considered the most important and obvious layer of security Walk through metal detectors and X ray machines operated by trained screeners were employed to stop prohibited items Numerous government reports indicated that checkpoints performed poorly often failing to detect even obvious FAA test items Many deadly and dangerous items did not set off metal detectors or were hard to distinguish in an X ray machine from innocent everyday items While FAA rules did not expressly prohibit knives with blades under 4 inches long the airlines checkpoint operations guide which was developed in cooperation with the FAA explicitly permitted them The FAA s basis for this policy was 1 the agency did not consider such items to be menacing 2 most local laws did not prohibit individuals from carrying such knives and 3 such knives would have been difficult to detect unless the sensitivity of metal detectors had been greatly increased A proposal to ban knives altogether in 1993 had been rejected because small cutting implements were difficult to detect and the number of innocent alarms would have increased significantly exacerbating congestion problems at checkpoints Several years prior to 9 11 an FAA requirement for screeners to conduct continuous and random hand searches of carry on luggage at checkpoints had been replaced by explosive trace detection or had simply become ignored by the air carriers Therefore secondary screening of individuals and their carry on bags to identify weapons other than bombs was nonexistent except for passengers who triggered the metal detectors Even when small knives were detected by secondary screening they were usually returned to the traveler Reportedly the 9 11 hijackers were instructed to use items that would be undetectable by airport checkpoints In the pre 9 11 security system the air carriers played a major role As the Inspector General of the Department ofTransportation told us there were great pressures from the air carriers to control security costs and to limit the impact of security requirements on aviation operations so that the industry could concentrate on its primary mission of moving passengers and aircraft T hose counterpressures in turn manifested themselves as significant weaknesses in security A longtime FAA security official described the air carriers approach to security regulation as decry deny and delay and told us that while the air carriers had seen the enlightened hand of self interest with respect to safety they hadn t seen it in the security arena The final layer security on board commercial aircraft was not designed to counter suicide hijackings The FAA approved Common Strategy had been elaborated over decades of experience with scores of hijackings beginning in the 1960s It taught flight crews that the best way to deal with hijackers was to accommodate their demands get the plane to land safely and then let law enforcement or the military handle the situation According to the FAA the record had shown that the longer a hijacking persisted the more likely it was to end peacefully The strategy operated on the fundamental assumption that hijackers issue negotiable demands most often for asylum or the release of prisoners and that as one FAA official put it suicide wasn t in the game plan of hijackers FAA training material provided no guidance for flight crews should violence occur This prevailing Common Strategy of cooperation and nonconfrontation meant that even a hardened cockpit door would have made little difference in a hijacking As the chairman of the Security Committee of the Air Line Pilots Association observed when proposals were made in early 2001 to install reinforced cockpit doors in commercial aircraft Even if you make a vault out of the door if they have a noose around my flight attendant s neck I m going to open the door Prior to 9 11 FAA regulations mandated that cockpit doors permit ready access into and out of the cockpit in the event of an emergency Even so rules implemented in the 1960s required air crews to keep the cockpit door closed and locked in flight This requirement was not always observed or vigorously enforced As for law enforcement there were only 33 armed and trained federal air marshals as of 9 11 They were not deployed on U S domestic flights except when in transit to provide security on international departures This policy reflected the FAA s view that domestic hijacking was in check a view held confidently as no terrorist had hijacked a U S commercial aircraft anywhere in the world since 1986 In the absence of any recent aviation security incident and without specific and credible evidence of a plot directed at civil aviation the FAA s leadership focused elsewhere including on operational concerns and the ever present issue of safety FAA Administrator Garvey recalled that every day in 2001 was like the day before Thanksgiving Heeding calls for improved air service Congress concentrated its efforts on a passenger bill of rights to improve capacity efficiency and customer satisfaction in the aviation system There was no focus on terrorism AND IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY The National Security Act of 1947 created the position of Director of Central Intelligence DCI Independent from the departments of Defense State Justice and other policy departments the DCI heads the U S intelligence community and provides intelligence to federal entities The sole element of the intelligence community independent from a cabinet agency is the CIA As an independent agency it collects analyzes and disseminates intelligence from all sources The CIA s number one customer is the president of the United States who also has the authority to direct it to conduct covert operations Although covert actions represent a very small fraction of the Agency s entire budget these operations have at times been controversial and over time have dominated the public s perception of the CIA The DCI is confirmed by the Senate but is not technically a member of the president s cabinet The director s power under federal law over the loose confederated intelligence community is limited He or she states the community s priorities and coordinates development of intelligence agency budget requests for submission to Congress This responsibility gives many the false impression that the DCI has line authority over the heads of these agencies and has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises Neither is true In fact the DCI s real authority has been directly proportional to his personal closeness to the president which has waxed and waned over the years and to others in government especially the secretary of defense Intelligence agencies under the Department of Defense account for approximately 80 percent of all U S spending for intelligence including some that supports a national customer base and some that supports specific Defense Department or military service needs As they are housed in the Defense Department these agencies are keenly attentive to the military s strategic and tactical requirements One of the intelligence agencies in Defense with a national customer base is the National Security Agency which intercepts and analyzes foreign communications and breaks codes The NSA also creates codes and ciphers to protect government information Another is the recently renamed National Geospatial Intelligence Agency NGA which provides and analyzes imagery and produces a wide array of products including maps navigation tools and surveillance intelligence A third such agency in Defense is the National Reconnaissance Office It develops procures launches and maintains in orbit information gathering satellites that serve other government agencies The Defense Intelligence Agency supports the secretary of defense Joint Chiefs of Staff and military field commanders It does some collection through human sources as well as some technical intelligence collection The Army Navy Air Force and Marine Corps have their own intelligence components that collect information help them decide what weapons to acquire and serve the tactical intelligence needs of their respective services In addition to those from the Department of Defense other elements in the intelligence community include the national security parts of the FBI the Bureau of Intelligence and Research in the State Department the intelligence component of the Treasury Department the Energy Department s Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence the former of which through leveraging the expertise of the national laboratory system has special competence in nuclear weapons the Office of Intelligence of the Coast Guard and today the Directorate of Intelligence Analysis and Infrastructure Protection in the Department of Homeland Security The National Security Agency The National Security Agency s intercepts of terrorist communications often set off alarms elsewhere in the government Often too its intercepts are conclusive elements in the analyst s jigsaw puzzle NSA engineers build technical systems to break ciphers and to make sense of today s complex signals environment Its analysts listen to conversations between foreigners not meant for them They also perform traffic analysis studying technical communications systems and codes as well as foreign organizational structures including those of terrorist organizations Cold War adversaries used very hierarchical familiar and predictable military command and control methods With globalization and the telecommunications revolution and with loosely affiliated but networked adversaries using commercial devices and encryption the technical impediments to signals collection grew at a geometric rate At the same time the end of the Cold War and the resultant cuts in national security funding forced intelligence agencies to cut systems and seek economies of scale Modern adversaries are skilled users of communications technologies The NSA s challenges and its opportunities increased exponentially in volume variety and velocity The law requires the NSA to not deliberately collect data on U S citizens or on persons in the United States without a warrant based on foreign intelligence requirements Also the NSA was supposed to let the FBI know of any indication of crime espionage or terrorist enterprise so that the FBI could obtain the appropriate warrant Later in this story we will learn that while the NSA had the technical capability to report on communications with suspected terrorist facilities in the Middle East the NSA did not seek FISA Court warrants to collect communications between individuals in the United States and foreign countries because it believed that this was an FBI role It also did not want to be viewed as targeting persons in the United States and possibly violating laws that governed NSA s collection of foreign intelligence An almost obsessive protection of sources and methods by the NSA and its focus on foreign intelligence and its avoidance of anything domestic would as will be seen be important elements in the story of 9 11 Technology as an Intelligence Asset and Liability The application of newly developed scientific technology to the mission of U S war fighters and national security decisionmakers is one of the great success stories of the twentieth century It did not happen by accident Recent wars have been waged and won decisively by brave men and women using advanced technology that was developed authorized and paid for by conscientious and diligent executive and legislative branch leaders many years earlier The challenge of technology however is a daunting one It is expensive sometimes fails and often can create problems as well as solve them Some of the advanced technologies that gave us insight into the closed off territories of the Soviet Union during the Cold War are of limited use in identifying and tracking individual terrorists Terrorists in turn have benefited from this same rapid development of communication technologies They simply could buy off the shelf and harvest the products of a 3 trillion a year telecommunications industry They could acquire without great expense communication devices that were varied global instantaneous complex and encrypted The emergence of the World Wide Web has given terrorists a much easier means of acquiring information and exercising command and control over their operations The operational leader of the 9 11 conspiracy Mohamed Atta went online from Hamburg Germany to research U S flight schools Targets of intelligence collection have become more sophisticated These changes have made surveillance and threat warning more difficult Despite the problems that technology creates Americans love affair with it leads them to also regard it as the solution But technology produces its best results when an organization has the doctrine structure and incentives to exploit it For example even the best information technology will not improve information sharing so long as the intelligence agencies personnel and security systems reward protecting information rather than disseminating it The CIA The CIA is a descendant of the Office of Strategic Services OSS which President Roosevelt created early in World War II after having first thought the FBI might take that role The father of the OSS was William J Wild Bill Donovan a Wall Street lawyer He recruited into the OSS others like himself well traveled well connected well to do professional men and women An innovation of Donovan s whose legacy remains part of U S intelligence today was the establishment of a Research and Analysis Branch There large numbers of scholars from U S universities pored over accounts from spies communications intercepted by the armed forces transcripts of radio broadcasts and publications of all types and prepared reports on economic political and social conditions in foreign theaters of operation At the end of World War II to Donovan s disappointment President Harry Truman dissolved the Office of Strategic Services Four months later the President directed that all Federal foreign intelligence activities be planned developed and coordinated so as to assure the most effective accomplishment of the intelligence mission related to the national security under a National Intelligence Authority consisting of the secretaries of State War and the Navy and a personal representative of the president This body was to be assisted by a Central Intelligence Group made up of persons detailed from the departments of each of the members and headed by a Director of Central Intelligence Subsequently President Truman agreed to the National Security Act of 1947 which among other things established the Central Intelligence Agency under the Director of Central Intelligence Lobbying by the FBI combined with fears of creating a U S Gestapo led to the FBI s being assigned responsibility for internal security functions and counterespionage The CIA was specifically accorded no police subpoena or law enforcement powers or internal security functions This structure built in tensions between the CIA and the Defense Department s intelligence agencies and between the CIA and the FBI Clandestine and Covert Action With this history the CIA brought to the era of 9 11 many attributes of an elite organization viewing itself as serving on the nation s front lines to engage America s enemies Officers in its Clandestine Service under what became the Directorate of Operations fanned out into stations abroad Each chief of station was a very important person in the organization given the additional title of the DCI s representative in that country He occasionally she was governed by an operating directive that listed operational priorities issued by the relevant regional division of the Directorate constrained by centrally determined allocations of resources Because the conduct of espionage was a high risk activity decisions on the clandestine targeting recruitment handling and termination of secret sources and the dissemination of collected information required Washington s approval and action But in this decentralized system analogous in some ways to the culture of the FBI field offices in the United States everyone in the Directorate of Operations presumed that it was the job of headquarters to support the field rather than manage field activities In the 1960s the CIA suffered exposure of its botched effort to land Cuban exiles at the Bay of Pigs The Vietnam War brought on more criticism A prominent feature of the Watergate era was investigations of the CIA by committees headed by Frank Church in the Senate and Otis Pike in the House They published evidence that the CIA had secretly planned to assassinate Fidel Castro and other foreign leaders The President had not taken plain responsibility for these judgments CIA officials had taken most of the blame saying they had done so in order to preserve the President s plausible deniability After the Watergate era Congress established oversight committees to ensure that the CIA did not undertake covert action contrary to basic American law Case officers in the CIA s Clandestine Service interpreted legislation such as the Hughes Ryan Amendment requiring that the president approve and report to Congress any covert action as sending a message to them that covert action often leads to trouble and can severely damage one s career Controversies surrounding Central American covert action programs in the mid 1980s led to the indictment of several senior officers of the Clandestine Service During the 1990s tension sometimes arose as it did in the effort against al Qaeda between policymakers who wanted the CIA to undertake more aggressive covert action and wary CIA leaders who counseled prudence and making sure that the legal basis and presidential authorization for their actions were undeniably clear The Clandestine Service felt the impact of the post Cold War peace dividend with cuts beginning in 1992 As the number of officers declined and overseas facilities were closed the DCI and his managers responded to developing crises in the Balkans or in Africa by surging or taking officers from across the service to use on the immediate problem In many cases the surge officers had little familiarity with the new issues Inevitably some parts of the world and some collection targets were not fully covered or not covered at all This strategy also placed great emphasis on close relations with foreign liaison services whose help was needed to gain information that the United States itself did not have the capacity to collect The nadir for the Clandestine Service was in 1995 when only 25 trainees became new officers In 1998 the DCI was able to persuade the administration and the Congress to endorse a long range rebuilding program It takes five to seven years of training language study and experience to bring a recruit up to full performance Analysis The CIA s Directorate of Intelligence retained some of its original character of a university gone to war Its men and women tended to judge one another by the quantity and quality of their publications in this case classified publications Apart from their own peers they looked for approval and guidance to policymakers During the 1990s and today particular value is attached to having a contribution included in one of the classified daily newspapers the Senior Executive Intelligence Brief or better still selected for inclusion in the President s Daily Brief The CIA had been created to wage the Cold War Its steady focus on one or two primary adversaries decade after decade had at least one positive effect it created an environment in which managers and analysts could safely invest time and resources in basic research detailed and reflective Payoffs might not be immediate But when they wrote their estimates even in brief papers they could draw on a deep base of knowledge When the Cold War ended those investments could not easily be reallocated to new enemies The cultural effects ran even deeper In a more fluid international environment with uncertain changing goals and interests intelligence managers no longer felt they could afford such a patient strategic approach to long term accumulation of intellectual capital A university culture with its versions of books and articles was giving way to the culture of the newsroom During the 1990s the rise of round the clock news shows and the Internet reinforced pressure on analysts to pass along fresh reports to policymakers at an ever faster pace trying to add context or supplement what their customers were receiving from the media Weaknesses in all source and strategic analysis were highlighted by a panel chaired by Admiral David Jeremiah that critiqued the intelligence community s failure to foresee the nuclear weapons tests by India and Pakistan in 1998 as well as by a 1999 panel chaired by Donald Rumsfeld that discussed the community s limited ability to assess the ballistic missile threat to the United States Both reports called attention to the dispersal of effort on too many priorities the declining attention to the craft of strategic analysis and security rules that prevented adequate sharing of information Another Cold War craft had been an elaborate set of methods for warning against surprise attack but that too had faded in analyzing new dangers like terrorism Security Another set of experiences that would affect the capacity of the CIA to cope with the new terrorism traced back to the early Cold War when the Agency developed a concern bordering on paranoia about penetration by the Soviet KGB James Jesus Angleton who headed counterintelligence in the CIA until the early 1970s became obsessed with the belief that the Agency harbored one or more Soviet moles Although the pendulum swung back after Angleton s forced retirement it did not go very far Instances of actual Soviet penetration kept apprehensions high Then in the early 1990s came the Aldrich Ames espionage case which intensely embarrassed the CIA Though obviously unreliable Ames had been protected and promoted by fellow officers while he paid his bills by selling to the Soviet Union the names of U S operatives and agents a number of whom died as a result The concern about security vastly complicated information sharing Information was compartmented in order to protect it against exposure to skilled and technologically sophisticated adversaries There were therefore numerous restrictions on handling information and a deep suspicion about sending information over newfangled electronic systems like email to other agencies of the U S government Security concerns also increased the difficulty of recruiting officers qualified for counterterrorism Very few American colleges or universities offered programs in Middle Eastern languages or Islamic studies The total number of undergraduate degrees granted in Arabic in all U S colleges and universities in 2002 was six Many who had traveled much outside the United States could expect a very long wait for initial clearance Anyone who was foreign born or had numerous relatives abroad was well advised not even to apply With budgets for the CIA shrinking after the end of the Cold War it was not surprising that with some notable exceptions new hires in the Clandestine Service tended to have qualifications similar to those of serving officers that is they were suited for traditional agent recruitment or for exploiting liaison relationships with foreign services but were not equipped to seek or use assets inside the terrorist network Early Counterterrorism Efforts In the 1970s and 1980s terrorism had been tied to regional conflicts mainly in the Middle East The majority of terrorist groups either were sponsored by governments or like the Palestine Liberation Organization were militants trying to create governments In the mid 1980s on the basis of a report from a task force headed by Vice President George Bush and after terrorist attacks at airports in Rome and Athens the DCI created a Counterterrorist Center to unify activities across the Directorate of Operations and the Directorate of Intelligence The Counterterrorist Center had representation from the FBI and other agencies In the formal table of organization it reported to the DCI but in fact most of the Center s chiefs belonged to the Clandestine Service and usually looked for guidance to the head of the Directorate of Operations The Center stimulated and coordinated collection of information by CIA stations compiled the results and passed selected reports to appropriate stations the Directorate of Intelligence analysts other parts of the intelligence community or to policymakers The Center protected its bureaucratic turf The Director of Central Intelligence had once had a national intelligence officer for terrorism to coordinate analysis that office was abolished in the late 1980s and its duties absorbed in part by the Counterterrorist Center Though analysts assigned to the Center produced a large number of papers the focus was support to operations A CIA inspector general s report in 1994 criticized the Center s capacity to provide warning of terrorist attacks Subsequent chapters will raise the issue of whether despite tremendous talent energy and dedication the intelligence community failed to do enough in coping with the challenge from Bin Ladin and al Qaeda Confronted with such questions managers in the intelligence community often responded that they had meager resources with which to work Cuts in national security expenditures at the end of the Cold War led to budget cuts in the national foreign intelligence program from fiscal years 1990 to 1996 and essentially flat budgets from fiscal years 1996 to 2000 except for the so called Gingrich supplemental to the FY1999 budget and two later smaller supplementals These cuts compounded the difficulties of the intelligence agencies Policymakers were asking them to move into the digitized future to fight against computer to computer communications and modern communication systems while maintaining capability against older systems such as high frequency radios and ultra high and very high frequency line of sight systems that work like old style television antennas Also demand for imagery increased dramatically following the success of the 1991 Gulf War Both these developments in turn placed a premium on planning the next generation of satellite systems the cost of which put great pressure on the rest of the intelligence budget As a result intelligence agencies experienced staff reductions affecting both operators and analysts Yet at least for the CIA part of the burden in tackling terrorism arose from the background we have described an organization capable of attracting extraordinarily motivated people but institutionally averse to risk with its capacity for covert action atrophied predisposed to restrict the distribution of information having difficulty assimilating new types of personnel and accustomed to presenting descriptive reportage of the latest intelligence The CIA to put it another way needed significant change in order to get maximum effect in counterterrorism President Clinton appointed George Tenet as DCI in 1997 and by all accounts terrorism was a priority for him But Tenet s own assessment when questioned by the Commission was that in 2004 the CIA s clandestine service was still at least five years away from being fully ready to play its counterterrorism role And while Tenet was clearly the leader of the CIA the intelligence community s confederated structure left open the question of who really was in charge of the entire U S intelligence effort 3 5 AND IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT The State Department The Commission asked Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage in 2004 why the State Department had so long pursued what seemed and ultimately proved to be a hopeless effort to persuade the Taliban regime in Afghanistan to deport Bin Ladin Armitage replied We do what the State Department does we don t go out and fly bombers we don t do things like that we do our part in these things Fifty years earlier the person in Armitage s position would not have spoken of the Department of State as having such a limited role Until the late 1950s the department dominated the processes of advising the president and Congress on U S relations with the rest of the world The National Security Council was created in 1947 largely as a result of lobbying from the Pentagon for a forum where the military could object if they thought the State Department was setting national objectives that the United States did not have the wherewithal to pursue The State Department retained primacy until the 1960s when the Kennedy and Johnson administrations turned instead to Robert McNamara s Defense Department where a mini state department was created to analyze foreign policy issues President Richard Nixon then concentrated policy planning and policy coordination in a powerful National Security Council staff overseen by Henry Kissinger In later years individual secretaries of state were important figures but the department s role continued to erode State came into the 1990s overmatched by the resources of other departments and with little support for its budget either in the Congress or in the president s Office of Management and Budget Like the FBI and the CIA s Directorate of Operations the State Department had a tradition of emphasizing service in the field over service in Washington Even ambassadors however often found host governments not only making connections with the U S government through their own missions in Washington but working through the CIA station or a Defense attach Increasingly the embassies themselves were overshadowed by powerful regional commanders in chief reporting to the Pentagon Counterterrorism In the 1960s and 1970s the State Department managed counterterrorism policy It was the official channel for communication with the governments presumed to be behind the terrorists Moreover since terrorist incidents of this period usually ended in negotiations an ambassador or other embassy official was the logical person to represent U S interests Keeping U S diplomatic efforts against terrorism coherent was a recurring challenge In 1976 at the direction of Congress the department elevated its coordinator for combating terrorism to the rank equivalent to an assistant secretary of state As an ambassador at large this official sought to increase the visibility of counterterrorism matters within the department and to help integrate U S policy implementation among government agencies The prolonged crisis of 1979 1981 when 53 Americans were held hostage at the U S embassy in Tehran ended the State Department leadership in counterterrorism President Carter s assertive national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski took charge and the coordination function remained thereafter in the White House President Reagan s second secretary of state George Shultz advocated active U S efforts to combat terrorism often recommending the use of military force Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger opposed Shultz who made little headCOUNTERTERRORISM way against Weinberger or even within his own department Though Shultz elevated the status and visibility of counterterrorism coordination by appointing as coordinator first L Paul Bremer and then Robert Oakley both senior career ambassadors of high standing in the Foreign Service the department continued to be dominated by regional bureaus for which terrorism was not a first order concern Secretaries of state after Shultz took less personal interest in the problem Only congressional opposition prevented President Clinton s first secretary of state Warren Christopher from merging terrorism into a new bureau that would have also dealt with narcotics and crime The coordinator under Secretary Madeleine Albright told the Commission that his job was seen as a minor one within the department Although the description of his status has been disputed and Secretary Albright strongly supported the August 1998 strikes against Bin Ladin the role played by the Department of State in counterterrorism was often cautionary before 9 11 This was a reflection of the reality that counterterrorism priorities nested within broader foreign policy aims of the U S government State Department consular officers around the world it should not be forgotten were constantly challenged by the problem of terrorism for they handled visas for travel to the United States After it was discovered that Abdel Rahman the Blind Sheikh had come and gone almost at will State initiated significant reforms to its watchlist and visa processing policies In 1993 Congress passed legislation allowing State to retain visa processing fees for border security those fees were then used by the department to fully automate the terrorist watchlist By the late 1990s State had created a worldwide real time electronic database of visa law enforcement and watchlist information the core of the post 9 11 border screening systems Still as will be seen later the system had many holes The Department of Defense The Department of Defense is the behemoth among federal agencies With an annual budget larger than the gross domestic product of Russia it is an empire The Defense Department is part civilian part military The civilian secretary of defense has ultimate control under the president Among the uniformed military the top official is the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who is supported by a Joint Staff divided into standard military staff compartments J 2 intelligence J 3 operations and so on Because of the necessary and demanding focus on the differing mission of each service and their long and proud traditions the Army Navy Air Force and Marine Corps have often fought ferociously over roles and missions in war fighting and over budgets and posts of leadership Two developments diminished this competition The first was the passage by Congress in 1986 of the Goldwater Nichols Act which among other things mandated that promotion to high rank required some period of duty with a different service or with a joint i e multiservice command This had strong and immediate effects loosening the loyalties of senior officers to their separate services and causing them to think more broadly about the military establishment as a whole However it also may have lessened the diversity of military advice and options presented to the president The Goldwater Nichols example is seen by some as having lessons applicable to lessening competition and increasing cooperation in other parts of the federal bureaucracy particularly the law enforcement and intelligence communities The second related development was a significant transfer of planning and command responsibilities from the service chiefs and their staffs to the joint and unified commands outside of Washington especially those for Strategic Forces and for four regions Europe the Pacific the Center and the South Posts in these commands became prized assignments for ambitious officers and the voices of their five commanders in chief became as influential as those of the service chiefs Counterterrorism The Pentagon first became concerned about terrorism as a result of hostage taking in the 1970s In June 1976 Palestinian terrorists seized an Air France plane and landed it at Entebbe in Uganda holding 105 Israelis and other Jews as hostages A special Israeli commando force stormed the plane killed all the terrorists and rescued all but one of the hostages In October 1977 a West German special force dealt similarly with a Lufthansa plane sitting on a tarmac in Mogadishu every terrorist was killed and every hostage brought back safely The White House members of Congress and the news media asked the Pentagon whether the United States was prepared for similar action The answer was no The Army immediately set about creating the Delta Force one of whose missions was hostage rescue The first test for the new force did not go well It came in April 1980 during the Iranian hostage crisis when Navy helicopters with Marine pilots flew to a site known as Desert One some 200 miles southeast of Tehran to rendezvous with Air Force planes carrying Delta Force commandos and fresh fuel Mild sandstorms disabled three of the helicopters and the commander ordered the mission aborted But foul ups on the ground resulted in the loss of eight aircraft five airmen and three marines Remembered as Desert One this failure remained vivid for members of the armed forces It also contributed to the later Goldwater Nichols reforms In 1983 came Hezbollah s massacre of the Marines in Beirut President Reagan quickly withdrew U S forces from Lebanon a reversal later routinely cited by jihadists as evidence of U S weakness A detailed investigation produced a list of new procedures that would become customary for forces deployed abroad They involved a number of defensive measures including caution not only about strange cars and trucks but also about unknown aircraft overhead Force protection became a significant claim on the time and resources of the Department of Defense A decade later the military establishment had another experience that evoked both Desert One and the withdrawal from Beirut The first President Bush had authorized the use of U S military forces to ensure humanitarian relief in war torn Somalia Tribal factions interfered with the supply missions By the autumn of 1993 U S commanders concluded that the main source of trouble was a warlord Mohammed Farrah Aidid An Army special force launched a raid on Mogadishu to capture him In the course of a long night two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down 73 Americans were wounded 18 were killed and the world s television screens showed images of an American corpse dragged through the streets by exultant Somalis Under pressure from Congress President Clinton soon ordered the withdrawal of U S forces Black Hawk down joined Desert One as a symbol among Americans in uniform code phrases used to evoke the risks of daring exploits without maximum preparation overwhelming force and a well defined mission In 1995 1996 the Defense Department began to invest effort in planning how to handle the possibility of a domestic terrorist incident involving weapons of mass destruction WMD The idea of a domestic command for homeland defense began to be discussed in 1997 and in 1999 the Joint Chiefs developed a concept for the establishment of a domestic Unified Command Congress killed the idea Instead the Department established the Joint Forces Command located at Norfolk Virginia making it responsible for military response to domestic emergencies both natural and man made Pursuant to the Nunn Lugar Domenici Domestic Preparedness Program the Defense Department began in 1997 to train first responders in 120 of the nation s largest cities As a key part of its efforts Defense created National Guard WMD Civil Support Teams to respond in the event of a WMD terrorist incident A total of 32 such National Guard teams were authorized by fiscal year 2001 Under the command of state governors they provided support to civilian agencies to assess the nature of the attack offer medical and technical advice and coordinate state and local responses The Department of Defense like the Department of State had a coordinator who represented the department on the interagency committee concerned with counterterrorism By the end of President Clinton s first term this official had become the assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low intensity conflict The experience of the 1980s had suggested to the military establishment that if it were to have a role in counterterrorism it would be a traditional military role to act against state sponsors of terrorism And the military had what seemed an excellent example of how to do it In 1986 a bomb went off at a disco in Berlin killing two American soldiers Intelligence clearly linked the bombing to Libya s Colonel Muammar Qadhafi President Reagan ordered air strikes against Libya The operation was not cost free the United States lost two planes Evidence accumulated later including the 1988 bombing of Pan Am 103 clearly showed that the operation did not curb Qadhafi s interest in terrorism However it was seen at the time as a success The lesson then taken from Libya was that terrorism could be stopped by the use of U S air power that inflicted pain on the authors or sponsors of terrorist acts This lesson was applied using Tomahawk missiles early in the Clinton administration George H W Bush was scheduled to visit Kuwait to be honored for his rescue of that country in the Gulf War of 1991 Kuwaiti security services warned Washington that Iraqi agents were planning to assassinate the former president President Clinton not only ordered precautions to protect Bush but asked about options for a reprisal against Iraq The Pentagon proposed 12 targets for Tomahawk missiles Debate in the White House and at the CIA about possible collateral damage pared the list down to three then to one Iraqi intelligence headquarters in central Baghdad The attack was made at night to minimize civilian casualties Twenty three missiles were fired Other than one civilian casualty the operation seemed completely successful the intelligence headquarters was demolished No further intelligence came in about terrorist acts planned by Iraq The 1986 attack in Libya and the 1993 attack on Iraq symbolized for the military establishment effective use of military power for counterterrorism limited retaliation with air power aimed at deterrence What remained was the hard question of how deterrence could be effective when the adversary was a loose transnational network AND IN THE WHITE HOUSE Because coping with terrorism was not and is not the sole province of any component of the U S government some coordinating mechanism is necessary When terrorism was not a prominent issue the State Department could perform this role When the Iranian hostage crisis developed this procedure went by the board National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski took charge of crisis management The Reagan administration continued and formalized the practice of having presidential staff coordinate counterterrorism After the killing of the marines in Beirut President Reagan signed National Security Directive 138 calling for a shift from passive to active defense measures and reprogramming or adding new resources to effect the shift It directed the State Department to intensify efforts to achieve cooperation of other governments and the CIA to intensify use of liaison and other intelligence capabilities and also to develop plans and capability to preempt groups and individuals planning strikes against U S interests Speaking to the American Bar Association in July 1985 the President characterized terrorism as an act of war and declared There can be no place on earth left where it is safe for these monsters to rest to train or practice their cruel and deadly skills We must act together or unilaterally if necessary to ensure that terrorists have no sanctuary anywhere The air strikes against Libya were one manifestation of this strategy Through most of President Reagan s second term the coordination of counterterrorism was overseen by a high level interagency committee chaired by the deputy national security adviser But the Reagan administration closed with a major scandal that cast a cloud over the notion that the White House should guide counterterrorism President Reagan was concerned because Hezbollah was taking Americans hostage and periodically killing them He was also constrained by a bill he signed into law that made it illegal to ship military aid to anticommunist Contra guerrillas in Nicaragua whom he strongly supported His national security adviser Robert McFarlane and McFarlane s deputy Admiral John Poindexter thought the hostage problem might be solved and the U S position in the Middle East improved if the United States quietly negotiated with Iran about exchanging hostages for modest quantities of arms Shultz and Weinberger united for once opposed McFarlane and Poindexter A staffer for McFarlane and Poindexter Marine Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North developed a scheme to trade U S arms for hostages and divert the proceeds to the Contras to get around U S law He may have had encouragement from Director of Central Intelligence William Casey When the facts were revealed in 1986 and 1987 it appeared to be the 1970s all over again a massive abuse of covert action Now instead of stories about poisoned cigars and Mafia hit men Americans heard testimony about a secret visit to Tehran by McFarlane using an assumed name and bearing a chocolate cake decorated with icing depicting a key An investigation by a special counsel resulted in the indictment of McFarlane Poindexter North and ten others including several high ranking officers from the CIA s Clandestine Service The investigations spotlighted the importance of accountability and official responsibility for faithful execution of laws For the story of 9 11 the significance of the Iran Contra affair was that it made parts of the bureaucracy reflexively skeptical about any operating directive from the White House As the national security advisor s function expanded the procedures and structure of the advisor s staff conventionally called the National Security Council staff became more formal The advisor developed recommendations for presidential directives differently labeled by each president For President Clinton they were to be Presidential Decision Directives for President George W Bush National Security Policy Directives These documents and many others requiring approval by the president worked their way through interagency committees usually composed of departmental representatives at the assistant secretary level or just below it The NSC staff had senior directors who would sit on these interagency committees often as chair to facilitate agreement and to represent the wider interests of the national security advisor When President Clinton took office he decided right away to coordinate counterterrorism from the White House On January 25 1993 Mir Amal Kansi an Islamic extremist from Pakistan shot and killed two CIA employees at the main highway entrance to CIA headquarters in Virginia Kansi drove away and was captured abroad much later Only a month afterward came the World Trade Center bombing and a few weeks after that the Iraqi plot against former President Bush President Clinton s first national security advisor Anthony Lake had retained from the Bush administration the staffer who dealt with crime narcotics and terrorism a portfolio often known as drugs and thugs the veteran civil servant Richard Clarke President Clinton and Lake turned to Clarke to do the staff work for them in coordinating counterterrorism Before long he would chair a midlevel interagency committee eventually titled the Counterterrorism Security Group CSG We will later tell of Clarke s evolution as adviser on and in time manager of the U S counterterrorist effort When explaining the missile strike against Iraq provoked by the plot to kill President Bush President Clinton stated From the first days of our Revolution America s security has depended on the clarity of the message Don t tread on us A firm and commensurate response was essential to protect our sovereignty to send a message to those who engage in state sponsored terrorism to deter further violence against our people and to affirm the expectation of civilized behavior among nations In his State of the Union message in January 1995 President Clinton promised comprehensive legislation to strengthen our hand in combating terrorists whether they strike at home or abroad In February he sent Congress proposals to extend federal criminal jurisdiction to make it easier to deport terrorists and to act against terrorist fund raising In early May he submitted a bundle of strong amendments The interval had seen the news from Tokyo in March that a doomsday cult Aum Shinrikyo had released sarin nerve gas in a subway killing 12 and injuring thousands The sect had extensive properties and laboratories in Japan and offices worldwide including one in New York Neither the FBI nor the CIA had ever heard of it In April had come the bombing of the Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City immediate suspicions that it had been the work of Islamists turned out to be wrong and the bombers proved to be American antigovernment extremists named Timothy Mc Veigh and Terry Nichols President Clinton proposed to amend his earlier proposals by increasing wiretap and electronic surveillance authority for the FBI requiring that explosives carry traceable taggants and providing substantial new money not only for the FBI and CIA but also for local police President Clinton issued a classified directive in June 1995 Presidential Decision Directive 39 which said that the United States should deter defeat and respond vigorously to all terrorist attacks on our territory and against our citizens The directive called terrorism both a matter of national security and a crime and it assigned responsibilities to various agencies Alarmed by the incident in Tokyo President Clinton made it the very highest priority for his own staff and for all agencies to prepare to detect and respond to terrorism that involved chemical biological or nuclear weapons During 1995 and 1996 President Clinton devoted considerable time to seeking cooperation from other nations in denying sanctuary to terrorists He proposed significantly larger budgets for the FBI with much of the increase designated for counterterrorism For the CIA he essentially stopped cutting allocations and supported requests for supplemental funds for counterterrorism When announcing his new national security team after being reelected in 1996 President Clinton mentioned terrorism first in a list of several challenges facing the country In 1998 after Bin Ladin s fatwa and other alarms President Clinton accepted a proposal from his national security advisor Samuel Sandy Berger and gave Clarke a new position as national coordinator for security infrastructure protection and counterterrorism He issued two Presidential Decision Directives numbers 62 and 63 that built on the assignments to agencies that had been made in Presidential Decision Directive 39 laid out ten program areas for counterterrorism and enhanced at least on paper Clarke s authority to police these assignments Because of concerns especially on the part of Attorney General Reno this new authority was defined in precise and limiting language Clarke was only to provide advice regarding budgets and to coordinate the development of interagency agreed guidelines for action Clarke also was awarded a seat on the cabinet level Principals Committee when it met on his issues a highly unusual step for a White House staffer His interagency body the CSG ordinarily reported to the Deputies Committee of subcabinet officials unless Berger asked them to report directly to the principals The complementary directive number 63 defined the elements of the nation s critical infrastructure and considered ways to protect it Taken together the two directives basically left the Justice Department and the FBI in charge at home and left terrorism abroad to the CIA the State Department and other agencies under Clarke s and Berger s coordinating hands Explaining the new arrangement and his concerns in another commencement speech this time at the Naval Academy in May 1998 the President said First we will use our new integrated approach to intensify the fight against all forms of terrorism to capture terrorists no matter where they hide to work with other nations to eliminate terrorist sanctuaries overseas to respond rapidly and effectively to protect Americans from terrorism at home and abroad Second we will launch a comprehensive plan to detect deter and defend against attacks on our critical infrastructures our power systems water supplies police fire and medical services air traffic control financial services telephone systems and computer networks Third we will undertake a concerted effort to prevent the spread and use of biological weapons and to protect our people in the event these terrible weapons are ever unleashed by a rogue state a terrorist group or an international criminal organization Finally we must do more to protect our civilian population from biological weapons Clearly the President s concern about terrorism had steadily risen That heightened worry would become even more obvious early in 1999 when he addressed the National Academy of Sciences and presented his most somber account yet of what could happen if the United States were hit unprepared by terrorists wielding either weapons of mass destruction or potent cyberweapons AND IN THE CONGRESS Since the beginning of the Republic few debates have been as hotly contested as the one over executive versus legislative powers At the Constitutional Convention the founders sought to create a strong executive but check its powers They left those powers sufficiently ambiguous so that room was left for Congress and the president to struggle over the direction of the nation s security and foreign policies The most serious question has centered on whether or not the president needs congressional authorization to wage war The current status of that debate seems to have settled into a recognition that a president can deploy military forces for small and limited operations but needs at least congressional support if not explicit authorization for large and more open ended military operations This calculus becomes important in this story as both President Clinton and President Bush chose not to seek a declaration of war on Bin Ladin after he had declared and begun to wage war on us a declaration that they did not acknowledge publicly Not until after 9 11 was a congressional authorization sought The most substantial change in national security oversight in Congress took place following World War II The Congressional Reorganization Act of 1946 created the modern Armed Services committees that have become so powerful today One especially noteworthy innovation was the creation of the Joint House Senate Atomic Energy Committee which is credited by many with the development of our nuclear deterrent capability and was also criticized for wielding too much power relative to the executive branch Ironically this committee was eliminated in the 1970s as Congress was undertaking the next most important reform of oversight in response to the Church and Pike investigations into abuses of power In 1977 the House and Senate created select committees to exercise oversight of the executive branch s conduct of intelligence operations The Intelligence Committees The House and Senate select committees on intelligence share some important characteristics They have limited authorities They do not have exclusive authority over intelligence agencies Appropriations are ultimately determined by the Appropriations committees The Armed Services committees exercise jurisdiction over the intelligence agencies within the Department of Defense and in the case of the Senate over the Central Intelligence Agency One consequence is that the rise and fall of intelligence budgets are tied directly to trends in defense spending The president is required by law to ensure the congressional Intelligence committees are kept fully and currently informed of the intelligence activities of the United States The committees allow the CIA to some extent to withhold information in order to protect sources methods and operations The CIA must bring presidentially authorized covert action Findings and Memoranda of Notification to the Intelligence committees and it must detail its failures The committees conduct their most important work in closed hearings or briefings in which security over classified material can be maintained Members of the Intelligence committees serve for a limited time a restriction imposed by each chamber Many members believe these limits prevent committee members from developing the necessary expertise to conduct effective oversight Secrecy while necessary can also harm oversight The overall budget of the intelligence community is classified as are most of its activities Thus the Intelligence committees cannot take advantage of democracy s best oversight mechanism public disclosure This makes them significantly different from other congressional oversight committees which are often spurred into action by the work of investigative journalists and watchdog organizations Adjusting to the Post Cold War Era The unexpected and rapid end of the Cold War in 1991 created trauma in the foreign policy and national security community both in and out of government While some criticized the intelligence community for failing to forecast the collapse of the Soviet Union and used this argument to propose drastic cuts in intelligence agencies most recognized that the good news of being relieved of the substantial burden of maintaining a security structure to meet the Soviet challenge was accompanied by the bad news of increased insecurity In many directions the community faced threats and intelligence challenges that it was largely unprepared to meet So did the intelligence oversight committees New digitized technologies and the demand for imagery and continued capability against older systems meant the need to spend more on satellite systems at the expense of human efforts In addition denial and deception became more effective as targets learned from public sources what our intelligence agencies were doing There were comprehensive reform proposals of the intelligence community such as those offered by Senators Boren and McCurdy That said Congress still took too little action to address institutional weaknesses With the Cold War over and the intelligence community roiled by the Ames spy scandal a presidential commission chaired first by former secretary of defense Les Aspin and later by former secretary of defense Harold Brown examined the intelligence community s future After it issued recommendations addressing the DCI s lack of personnel and budget authority over the intelligence community the Intelligence committees in 1996 introduced implementing legislation to remedy these problems The Department of Defense and its congressional authorizing committees rose in opposition to the proposed changes The President and DCI did not actively support these changes Relatively small changes made in 1996 gave the DCI consultative authority and created a new deputy for management and assistant DCIs for collection and analysis These reforms occurred only after the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence took the unprecedented step of threatening to bring down the defense authorization bill Indeed rather than increasing the DCI s authorities over national intelligence the 1990s witnessed movement in the opposite direction through for example the transfer of the CIA s imaging analysis capability to the new imagery and mapping agency created within the Department of Defense Congress Adjusts Congress as a whole like the executive branch adjusted slowly to the rise of transnational terrorism as a threat to national security In particular the growing threat and capabilities of Bin Ladin were not understood in Congress As the most representative branch of the federal government Congress closely tracks trends in what public opinion and the electorate identify as key issues In the years before September 11 terrorism seldom registered as important To the extent that terrorism did break through and engage the attention of the Congress as a whole it would briefly command attention after a specific incident and then return to a lower rung on the public policy agenda Several points about Congress are worth noting First Congress always has a strong orientation toward domestic affairs It usually takes on foreign policy and national security issues after threats are identified and articulated by the administration In the absence of such a detailed and repeated articulation national security tends not to rise very high on the list of congressional priorities Presidents are selective in their use of political capital for international issues In the decade before 9 11 presidential discussion of and congressional and public attention to foreign affairs and national security were dominated by other issues among them Haiti Bosnia Russia China Somalia Kosovo NATO enlargement the Middle East peace process missile defense and globalization Terrorism infrequently took center stage and when it did the context was often terrorists tactics a chemical biological nuclear or computer threat not terrorist organizations Second Congress tends to follow the overall lead of the president on budget issues with respect to national security matters There are often sharp arguments about individual programs and internal priorities but by and large the overall funding authorized and appropriated by the Congress comes out close to the president s request This tendency was certainly illustrated by the downward trends in spending on defense intelligence and foreign affairs in the first part of the 1990s The White House to be sure read the political signals coming from Capitol Hill but the Congress largely acceded to the executive branch s funding requests In the second half of the decade Congress appropriated some 98 percent of what the administration requested for intelligence programs Apart from the Gingrich supplemental of 1 5 billion for overall intelligence programs in fiscal year 1999 the key decisions on overall allocation of resources for national security issues in the decade before 9 11 including counterterrorism funding were made in the president s Office of Management and Budget Third Congress did not reorganize itself after the end of the Cold War to address new threats Recommendations by the Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress were implemented in part in the House of Representatives after the 1994 elections but there was no reorganization of national security functions The Senate undertook no appreciable changes Traditional issues foreign policy defense intelligence continued to be handled by committees whose structure remained largely unaltered while issues such as transnational terrorism fell between the cracks Terrorism came under the jurisdiction of at least 14 different committees in the House alone and budget and oversight functions in the House and Senate concerning terrorism were also splintered badly among committees Little effort was made to consider an integrated policy toward terrorism which might range from identifying the threat to addressing vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure and the piecemeal approach in the Congress contributed to the problems of the executive branch in formulating such a policy Fourth the oversight function of Congress has diminished over time In recent years traditional review of the administration of programs and the implementation of laws has been replaced by a focus on personal investigations possible scandals and issues designed to generate media attention The unglamorous but essential work of oversight has been neglected and few members past or present believe it is performed well DCI Tenet told us We ran from threat to threat to threat T here was not a system in place to say You got to go back and do this and this and this Not just the DCI but the entire executive branch needed help from Congress in addressing the questions of counterterrorism strategy and policy looking past day to day concerns Members of Congress however also found their time spent on such everyday matters or in looking back to investigate mistakes and often missed the big questions as did the executive branch Staff tended as well to focus on parochial considerations seeking to add or cut funding for individual often small programs instead of emphasizing comprehensive oversight projects Fifth on certain issues other priorities pointed Congress in a direction that was unhelpful in meeting the threats that were emerging in the months leading up to 9 11 Committees with oversight responsibility for aviation focused overwhelmingly on airport congestion and the economic health of the airlines not aviation security Committees with responsibility for the INS focused on the Southwest border not on terrorists Justice Department officials told us that committees with responsibility for the FBI tightly restricted appropriations for improvements in information technology in part because of concerns about the FBI s ability to manage such projects Committees responsible for South Asia spent the decade of the 1990s imposing sanctions on Pakistan leaving presidents with little leverage to alter Pakistan s policies before 9 11 Committees with responsibility for the Defense Department paid little heed to developing military responses to terrorism and stymied intelligence reform All committees found themselves swamped in the minutiae of the budget process with little time for consideration of longer term questions or what many members past and present told us was the proper conduct of oversight Each of these trends contributed to what can only be described as Congress s slowness and inadequacy in treating the issue of terrorism in the years before 9 11 The legislative branch adjusted little and did not restructure itself to address changing threats Its attention to terrorism was episodic and splintered across several committees Congress gave little guidance to executive branch agencies did not reform them in any significant way and did not systematically perform oversight to identify address and attempt to resolve the many problems in national security and domestic agencies that became apparent in the aftermath of 9 11 Although individual representatives and senators took significant steps the overall level of attention in the Congress to the terrorist threat was low We examined the number of hearings on terrorism from January 1998 to September 2001 The Senate Armed Services Committee held nine four related to the attack on the USS Cole The House Armed Services Committee also held nine six of them by a special oversight panel on terrorism The Senate Foreign Relations Committee and its House counterpart both held four The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in addition to its annual worldwide threat hearing held eight its House counterpart held perhaps two exclusively devoted to counterterrorism plus the briefings by its terrorist working group The Senate and House intelligence panels did not raise public and congressional attention on Bin Ladin and al Qaeda prior to the joint inquiry into the attacks of September 11 perhaps in part because of the classified nature of their work Yet in the context of committees that each hold scores of hearings every year on issues in their jurisdiction this list is not impressive Terrorism was a second or third order priority within the committees of Congress responsible for national security In fact Congress had a distinct tendency to push questions of emerging national security threats off its own plate leaving them for others to consider Congress asked outside commissions to do the work that arguably was at the heart of its own oversight responsibilities Beginning in 1999 the reports of these commissions made scores of recommendations to address terrorism and homeland security but drew little attention from Congress Most of their impact came after 9 11 4 RESPONSES TO AL QAEDA S INITIAL ASSAULTS BEFORE THE BOMBINGS IN KENYA AND TANZANIA Although the 1995 National Intelligence Estimate had warned of a new type of terrorism many officials continued to think of terrorists as agents of states Saudi Hezbollah acting for Iran against Khobar Towers or as domestic criminals Timothy Mc Veigh in Oklahoma City As we pointed out in chapter 3 the White House is not a natural locus for program management Hence government efforts to cope with terrorism were essentially the work of individual agencies President Bill Clinton s counterterrorism Presidential Decision Directives in 1995 no 39 and May 1998 no 62 reiterated that terrorism was a national security problem not just a law enforcement issue They reinforced the authority of the National Security Council NSC to coordinate domestic as well as foreign counterterrorism efforts through Richard Clarke and his interagency Counterterrorism Security Group CSG Spotlighting new concerns about unconventional attacks these directives assigned tasks to lead agencies but did not differentiate types of terrorist threats Thus while Clarke might prod or push agencies to act what actually happened was usually decided at the State Department the Pentagon the CIA or the Justice Department The efforts of these agencies were sometimes energetic and sometimes effective Terrorist plots were disrupted and individual terrorists were captured But the United States did not before 9 11 adopt as a clear strategic objective the elimination of al Qaeda Early Efforts against Bin Ladin Until 1996 hardly anyone in the U S government understood that Usama Bin Ladin was an inspirer and organizer of the new terrorism In 1993 the CIA noted that he had paid for the training of some Egyptian terrorists in Sudan The State Department detected his money in aid to the Yemeni terrorists who set a bomb in an attempt to kill U S troops in Aden in 1992 State Department sources even saw suspicious links with Omar Abdel Rahman the Blind Sheikh in the New York area commenting that Bin Ladin seemed committed to financing Jihads against anti Islamic regimes worldwide After the department designated Sudan a state sponsor of terrorism in 1993 it put Bin Ladin on its TIPOFF watchlist a move that might have prevented his getting a visa had he tried to enter the United States As late as 1997 however even the CIA s Counterterrorist Center continued to describe him as an extremist financier In 1996 the CIA set up a special unit of a dozen officers to analyze intelligence on and plan operations against Bin Ladin David Cohen the head of the CIA s Directorate of Operations wanted to test the idea of having a virtual station a station based at headquarters but collecting and operating against a subject much as stations in the field focus on a country Taking his cue from National Security Advisor Anthony Lake who expressed special interest in terrorist finance Cohen formed his virtual station as a terrorist financial links unit He had trouble getting any Directorate of Operations officer to run it he finally recruited a former analyst who was then running the Islamic Extremist Branch of the Counterterrorist Center This officer who was especially knowledgeable about Afghanistan had noticed a recent stream of reports about Bin Ladin and something called al Qaeda and suggested to Cohen that the station focus on this one individual Cohen agreed Thus was born the Bin Ladin unit In May 1996 Bin Ladin left Sudan for Afghanistan A few months later as the Bin Ladin unit was gearing up Jamal Ahmed al Fadl walked into a U S embassy in Africa established his bona fides as a former senior employee of Bin Ladin and provided a major breakthrough of intelligence on the creation character direction and intentions of al Qaeda Corroborating evidence came from another walk in source at a different U S embassy More confirmation was supplied later that year by intelligence and other sources including material gathered by FBI agents and Kenyan police from an al Qaeda cell in Nairobi By 1997 officers in the Bin Ladin unit recognized that Bin Ladin was more than just a financier They learned that al Qaeda had a military committee that was planning operations against U S interests worldwide and was actively trying to obtain nuclear material Analysts assigned to the station looked at the information it had gathered and found connections everywhere including links to the attacks on U S troops in Aden and Somalia in 1992 and 1993 and to the Manila air plot in the Philippines in 1994 1995 The Bin Ladin station was already working on plans for offensive operations against Bin Ladin These plans were directed at both physical assets and sources of finance In the end plans to identify and attack Bin Ladin s money sources did not go forward In late 1995 when Bin Ladin was still in Sudan the State Department and the CIA learned that Sudanese officials were discussing with the Saudi government the possibility of expelling Bin Ladin U S Ambassador Timothy Carney encouraged the Sudanese to pursue this course The Saudis however did not want Bin Ladin giving as their reason their revocation of his citizenship Sudan s minister of defense Fatih Erwa has claimed that Sudan offered to hand Bin Ladin over to the United States The Commission has found no credible evidence that this was so Ambassador Carney had instructions only to push the Sudanese to expel Bin Ladin Ambassador Carney had no legal basis to ask for more from the Sudanese since at the time there was no indictment outstanding The chief of the Bin Ladin station whom we will call Mike saw Bin Ladin s move to Afghanistan as a stroke of luck Though the CIA had virtually abandoned Afghanistan after the Soviet withdrawal case officers had reestablished old contacts while tracking down Mir Amal Kansi the Pakistani gunman who had murdered two CIA employees in January 1993 These contacts contributed to intelligence about Bin Ladin s local movements business activities and security and living arrangements and helped provide evidence that he was spending large amounts of money to help the Taliban The chief of the Counterterrorist Center whom we will call Jeff told Director George Tenet that the CIA s intelligence assets were near to providing real time information about Bin Ladin s activities and travels in Afghanistan One of the contacts was a group associated with particular tribes among Afghanistan s ethnic Pashtun community By the fall of 1997 the Bin Ladin unit had roughed out a plan for these Afghan tribals to capture Bin Ladin and hand him over for trial either in the United States or in an Arab country In early 1998 the cabinet level Principals Committee apparently gave the concept its blessing On their own separate track getting information but not direction from the CIA the FBI s New York Field Office and the U S Attorney for the Southern District of New York were preparing to ask a grand jury to indict Bin Ladin The Counterterrorist Center knew that this was happening The eventual charge conspiring to attack U S defense installations was finally issued from the grand jury in June 1998 as a sealed indictment The indictment was publicly disclosed in November of that year When Bin Ladin moved to Afghanistan in May 1996 he became a subject of interest to the State Department s South Asia bureau At the time as one diplomat told us South Asia was seen in the department and the government generally as a low priority In 1997 as Madeleine Albright was beginning her tenure as secretary of state an NSC policy review concluded that the United States should pay more attention not just to India but also to Pakistan and Afghanistan With regard to Afghanistan another diplomat said the United States at the time had no policy In the State Department concerns about India Pakistan tensions often crowded out attention to Afghanistan or Bin Ladin Aware of instability and RESPONSES TO AL QAEDA S INITIAL ASSAULTS 111 growing Islamic extremism in Pakistan State Department officials worried most about an arms race and possible war between Pakistan and India After May 1998 when both countries surprised the United States by testing nuclear weapons these dangers became daily first order concerns of the State Department In Afghanistan the State Department tried to end the civil war that had continued since the Soviets withdrawal The South Asia bureau believed it might have a carrot for Afghanistan s warring factions in a project by the Union Oil Company of California UNOCAL to build a pipeline across the country While there was probably never much chance of the pipeline actually being built the Afghan desk hoped that the prospect of shared pipeline profits might lure faction leaders to a conference table U S diplomats did not favor the Taliban over the rival factions Despite growing concerns U S diplomats were willing at the time as one official said to give the Taliban a chance Though Secretary Albright made no secret of thinking the Taliban despicable the U S ambassador to the United Nations Bill Richardson led a delegation to South Asia including Afghanistan in April 1998 No U S official of such rank had been to Kabul in decades Ambassador Richardson went primarily to urge negotiations to end the civil war In view of Bin Ladin s recent public call for all Muslims to kill Americans Richardson asked the Taliban to expel Bin Ladin They answered that they did not know his whereabouts In any case the Taliban said Bin Ladin was not a threat to the United States In sum in late 1997 and the spring of 1998 the lead U S agencies each pursued their own efforts against Bin Ladin The CIA s Counterterrorist Center was developing a plan to capture and remove him from Afghanistan Parts of the Justice Department were moving toward indicting Bin Ladin making possible a criminal trial in a New York court Meanwhile the State Department was focused more on lessening Indo Pakistani nuclear tensions ending the Afghan civil war and ameliorating the Taliban s human rights abuses than on driving out Bin Ladin Another key actor Marine General Anthony Zinni the commander in chief of the U S Central Command shared the State Department s view The CIA Develops a Capture Plan Initially the DCI s Counterterrorist Center and its Bin Ladin unit considered a plan to ambush Bin Ladin when he traveled between Kandahar the Taliban capital where he sometimes stayed the night and his primary residence at the time Tarnak Farms After the Afghan tribals reported that they had tried such an ambush and failed the Center gave up on it despite suspicions that the tribals story might be fiction Thereafter the capture plan focused on a nighttime raid on Tarnak Farms A compound of about 80 concrete or mud brick buildings surrounded by a 10 foot wall Tarnak Farms was located in an isolated desert area on the outskirts of the Kandahar airport CIA officers were able to map the entire site identifying the houses that belonged to Bin Ladin s wives and the one where Bin Ladin himself was most likely to sleep Working with the tribals they drew up plans for the raid They ran two complete rehearsals in the United States during the fall of 1997 By early 1998 planners at the Counterterrorist Center were ready to come back to the White House to seek formal approval Tenet apparently walked National Security Advisor Sandy Berger through the basic plan on February 13 One group of tribals would subdue the guards enter Tarnak Farms stealthily grab Bin Ladin take him to a desert site outside Kandahar and turn him over to a second group This second group of tribals would take him to a desert landing zone already tested in the 1997 Kansi capture From there a CIA plane would take him to New York an Arab capital or wherever he was to be arraigned Briefing papers prepared by the Counterterrorist Center acknowledged that hitches might develop People might be killed and Bin Ladin s supporters might retaliate perhaps taking U S citizens in Kandahar hostage But the briefing papers also noted that there was risk in not acting Sooner or later they said Bin Ladin will attack U S interests perhaps using WMD weapons of mass destruction Clarke s Counterterrorism Security Group reviewed the capture plan for Berger Noting that the plan was in a very early stage of development the NSC staff then told the CIA planners to go ahead and among other things start drafting any legal documents that might be required to authorize the covert action The CSG apparently stressed that the raid should target Bin Ladin himself not the whole compound The CIA planners conducted their third complete rehearsal in March and they again briefed the CSG Clarke wrote Berger on March 7 that he saw the operation as somewhat embryonic and the CIA as months away from doing anything Mike thought the capture plan was the perfect operation It required minimum infrastructure The plan had now been modified so that the tribals would keep Bin Ladin in a hiding place for up to a month before turning him over to the United States thereby increasing the chances of keeping the U S hand out of sight Mike trusted the information from the Afghan network it had been corroborated by other means he told us The lead CIA officer in the field Gary Schroen also had confidence in the tribals In a May 6 cable to CIA headquarters he pronounced their planning almost as professional and detailed as would be done by any U S military special operations element He and the other officers who had worked through the plan with the tribals judged it about as good as it can be By that Schroen explained he meant that the chance of capturing or killing Bin Ladin was about 40 percent Although the tribals thought they could pull off the raid if the operation were approved by headquarters and the policymakers Schroen wrote there was going to be a point when we step back and keep our fingers crossed that the tribals prove as good and as lucky as they think they will be Military officers reviewed the capture plan and according to Mike found no showstoppers The commander of Delta Force felt uncomfortable with having the tribals hold Bin Ladin captive for so long and the commander of Joint Special Operations Forces Lieutenant General Michael Canavan was worried about the safety of the tribals inside Tarnak Farms General Canavan said he had actually thought the operation too complicated for the CIA out of their league and an effort to get results on the cheap But a senior Joint Staff officer described the plan as generally not too much different than we might have come up with ourselves No one in the Pentagon so far as we know advised the CIA or the White House not to proceed In Washington Berger expressed doubt about the dependability of the tribals In his meeting with Tenet Berger focused most however on the question of what was to be done with Bin Ladin if he were actually captured He worried that the hard evidence against Bin Ladin was still skimpy and that there was a danger of snatching him and bringing him to the United States only to see him acquitted On May 18 CIA s managers reviewed a draft Memorandum of Notification MON a legal document authorizing the capture operation A 1986 presidential finding had authorized worldwide covert action against terrorism and probably provided adequate authority But mindful of the old rogue elephant charge senior CIA managers may have wanted something on paper to show that they were not acting on their own Discussion of this memorandum brought to the surface an unease about paramilitary covert action that had become ingrained at least among some CIA senior managers James Pavitt the assistant head of the Directorate of Operations expressed concern that people might get killed it appears he thought the operation had at least a slight flavor of a plan for an assassination Moreover he calculated that it would cost several million dollars He was not prepared to take that money out of hide and he did not want to go to all the necessary congressional committees to get special money Despite Pavitt s misgivings the CIA leadership cleared the draft memorandum and sent it on to the National Security Council Counterterrorist Center officers briefed Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh telling them that the operation had about a 30 percent chance of success The Center s chief Jeff joined John O Neill the head of the FBI s New York Field Office in briefing Mary Jo White the U S Attorney for the Southern District of New York and her staff Though Jeff also used the 30 percent success figure he warned that someone would surely be killed in the operation White s impression from the New York briefing was that the chances of capturing Bin Ladin alive were nil From May 20 to 24 the CIA ran a final graded rehearsal of the operation spread over three time zones even bringing in personnel from the region The FBI also participated The rehearsal went well The Counterterrorist Center planned to brief cabinet level principals and their deputies the following week giving June 23 as the date for the raid with Bin Ladin to be brought out of Afghanistan no later than July 23 On May 20 Director Tenet discussed the high risk of the operation with Berger and his deputies warning that people might be killed including Bin Ladin Success was to be defined as the exfiltration of Bin Ladin out of Afghanistan A meeting of principals was scheduled for May 29 to decide whether the operation should go ahead The principals did not meet On May 29 Jeff informed Mike that he had just met with Tenet Pavitt and the chief of the Directorate s Near Eastern Division The decision was made not to go ahead with the operation Mike cabled the field that he had been directed to stand down on the operation for the time being He had been told he wrote that cabinet level officials thought the risk of civilian casualties collateral damage was too high They were concerned about the tribals safety and had worried that the purpose and nature of the operation would be subject to unavoidable misinterpretation and misrepresentation and probably recriminations in the event that Bin Ladin despite our best intentions and efforts did not survive Impressions vary as to who actually decided not to proceed with the operation Clarke told us that the CSG saw the plan as flawed He was said to have described it to a colleague on the NSC staff as half assed and predicted that the principals would not approve it Jeff thought the decision had been made at the cabinet level Pavitt thought that it was Berger s doing though perhaps on Tenet s advice Tenet told us that given the recommendation of his chief operations officers he alone had decided to turn off the operation He had simply informed Berger who had not pushed back Berger s recollection was similar He said the plan was never presented to the White House for a decision The CIA s senior management clearly did not think the plan would work Tenet s deputy director of operations wrote to Berger a few weeks later that the CIA assessed the tribals ability to capture Bin Ladin and deliver him to U S officials as low But working level CIA officers were disappointed Before it was canceled Schroen described it as the best plan we are going to come up with to capture Bin Ladin while he is in Afghanistan and bring him to justice No capture plan before 9 11 ever again attained the same level of detail and preparation The tribals reported readiness to act diminished And Bin Ladin s security precautions and defenses became more elaborate and formidable At this time 9 11 was more than three years away It was the duty of Tenet and the CIA leadership to balance the risks of inaction against jeopardizing the lives of their operatives and agents And they had reason to worry about failure millions of dollars down the drain a shoot out that could be seen as an assassination and if there were repercussions in Pakistan perhaps a coup The decisions of the U S government in May 1998 were made as Berger has put RESPONSES TO AL QAEDA S INITIAL ASSAULTS 115 it from the vantage point of the driver looking through a muddy windshield moving forward not through a clean rearview mirror Looking for Other Options The Counterterrorist Center continued to track Bin Ladin and to contemplate covert action The most hopeful possibility seemed now to lie in diplomacy but not diplomacy managed by the Department of State which focused primarily on India Pakistan nuclear tensions during the summer of 1998 The CIA learned in the spring of 1998 that the Saudi government had quietly disrupted Bin Ladin cells in its country that were planning to attack U S forces with shoulder fired missiles They had arrested scores of individuals with no publicity When thanking the Saudis Director Tenet took advantage of the opening to ask them to help against Bin Ladin The response was encouraging enough that President Clinton made Tenet his informal personal representative to work with the Saudis on terrorism and Tenet visited Riyadh in May and again in early June Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah who had taken charge from the ailing King Fahd promised Tenet an all out secret effort to persuade the Taliban to expel Bin Ladin so that he could be sent to the United States or to another country for trial The Kingdom s emissary would be its intelligence chief Prince Turki bin Faisal Vice President Al Gore later added his thanks to those of Tenet both making clear that they spoke with President Clinton s blessing Tenet reported that it was imperative to get an indictment against Bin Ladin The New York grand jury issued its sealed indictment a few days later on June 10 Tenet also recommended that no action be taken on other U S options such as the covert action plan Prince Turki followed up in meetings during the summer with Mullah Omar and other Taliban leaders Apparently employing a mixture of possible incentives and threats Turki received a commitment that Bin Ladin would be expelled but Mullah Omar did not make good on this promise On August 5 Clarke chaired a CSG meeting on Bin Ladin In the discussion of what might be done the note taker wrote there was a dearth of bright ideas around the table despite a consensus that the government ought to pursue every avenue it can to address the problem CRISIS AUGUST 1998 On August 7 1998 National Security Advisor Berger woke President Clinton with a phone call at 5 35 A M to tell him of the almost simultaneous bombings of the U S embassies in Nairobi Kenya and Dar es Salaam Tanzania Suspicion quickly focused on Bin Ladin Unusually good intelligence chiefly from the yearlong monitoring of al Qaeda s cell in Nairobi soon firmly fixed responsibility on him and his associates Debate about what to do settled very soon on one option Tomahawk cruise missiles Months earlier after cancellation of the covert capture operation Clarke had prodded the Pentagon to explore possibilities for military action On June 2 General Hugh Shelton the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had directed General Zinni at Central Command to develop a plan which he had submitted during the first week of July Zinni s planners surely considered the two previous times the United States had used force to respond to terrorism the 1986 strike on Libya and the 1993 strike against Iraq They proposed firing Tomahawks against eight terrorist camps in Afghanistan including Bin Ladin s compound at Tarnak Farms After the embassy attacks the Pentagon offered this plan to the White House The day after the embassy bombings Tenet brought to a principals meeting intelligence that terrorist leaders were expected to gather at a camp near Khowst Afghanistan to plan future attacks According to Berger Tenet said that several hundred would attend including Bin Ladin The CIA described the area as effectively a military cantonment away from civilian population centers and overwhelmingly populated by jihadists Clarke remembered sitting next to Tenet in a White House meeting asking Tenet You thinking what I m thinking and his nodding yes The principals quickly reached a consensus on attacking the gathering The strike s purpose was to kill Bin Ladin and his chief lieutenants Berger put in place a tightly compartmented process designed to keep all planning secret On August 11 General Zinni received orders to prepare detailed plans for strikes against the sites in Afghanistan The Pentagon briefed President Clinton about these plans on August 12 and 14 Though the principals hoped that the missiles would hit Bin Ladin NSC staff recommended the strike whether or not there was firm evidence that the commanders were at the facilities Considerable debate went to the question of whether to strike targets outside of Afghanistan including two facilities in Sudan One was a tannery believed to belong to Bin Ladin The other was al Shifa a Khartoum pharmaceutical plant which intelligence reports said was manufacturing a precursor ingredient for nerve gas with Bin Ladin s financial support The argument for hitting the tannery was that it could hurt Bin Ladin financially The argument for hitting al Shifa was that it would lessen the chance of Bin Ladin s having nerve gas for a later attack Ever since March 1995 American officials had had in the backs of their minds Aum Shinrikyo s release of sarin nerve gas in the Tokyo subway President Clinton himself had expressed great concern about chemical and biological terrorism in the United States Bin Ladin had reportedly been heard to speak of wanting a Hiroshima and at least 10 000 casualties The CIA reported RESPONSES TO AL QAEDA S INITIAL ASSAULTS 117 that a soil sample from the vicinity of the al Shifa plant had tested positive for EMPTA a precursor chemical for VX a nerve gas whose lone use was for mass killing Two days before the embassy bombings Clarke s staff wrote that Bin Ladin has invested in and almost certainly has access to VX produced at a plant in Sudan Senior State Department officials believed that they had received a similar verdict independently though they and Clarke s staff were probably relying on the same report Mary McCarthy the NSC senior director responsible for intelligence programs initially cautioned Berger that the bottom line was that we will need much better intelligence on this facility before we seriously consider any options She added that the link between Bin Ladin and al Shifa was rather uncertain at this point Berger has told us that he thought about what might happen if the decision went against hitting al Shifa and nerve gas was used in a New York subway two weeks later By the early hours of the morning of August 20 President Clinton and all his principal advisers had agreed to strike Bin Ladin camps in Afghanistan near Khowst as well as hitting al Shifa The President took the Sudanese tannery off the target list because he saw little point in killing uninvolved people without doing significant harm to Bin Ladin The principal with the most qualms regarding al Shifa was Attorney General Reno She expressed concern about attacking two Muslim countries at the same time Looking back she said that she felt the premise kept shifting Later on August 20 Navy vessels in the Arabian Sea fired their cruise missiles Though most of them hit their intended targets neither Bin Ladin nor any other terrorist leader was killed Berger told us that an after action review by Director Tenet concluded that the strikes had killed 20 30 people in the camps but probably missed Bin Ladin by a few hours Since the missiles headed for Afghanistan had had to cross Pakistan the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs was sent to meet with Pakistan s army chief of staff to assure him the missiles were not coming from India Officials in Washington speculated that one or another Pakistani official might have sent a warning to the Taliban or Bin Ladin The air strikes marked the climax of an intense 48 hour period in which Berger notified congressional leaders the principals called their foreign counterparts and President Clinton flew back from his vacation on Martha s Vineyard to address the nation from the Oval Office The President spoke to the congressional leadership from Air Force One and he called British Prime Minister Tony Blair Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak from the White House House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott initially supported the President The next month Gingrich s office dismissed the cruise missile attacks as pinpricks At the time President Clinton was embroiled in the Lewinsky scandal which continued to consume public attention for the rest of that year and the first months of 1999 As it happened a popular 1997 movie Wag the Dog features a president who fakes a war to distract public attention from a domestic scandal Some Republicans in Congress raised questions about the timing of the strikes Berger was particularly rankled by an editorial in the Economist that said that only the future would tell whether the U S missile strikes had created 10 000 new fanatics where there would have been none Much public commentary turned immediately to scalding criticism that the action was too aggressive The Sudanese denied that al Shifa produced nerve gas and they allowed journalists to visit what was left of a seemingly harmless facility President Clinton Vice President Gore Berger Tenet and Clarke insisted to us that their judgment was right pointing to the soil sample evidence No independent evidence has emerged to corroborate the CIA s assessment Everyone involved in the decision had of course been aware of President Clinton s problems He told them to ignore them Berger recalled the President saying to him that they were going to get crap either way so they should do the right thing All his aides testified to us that they based their advice solely on national security considerations We have found no reason to question their statements The failure of the strikes the wag the dog slur the intense partisanship of the period and the nature of the al Shifa evidence likely had a cumulative effect on future decisions about the use of force against Bin Ladin Berger told us that he did not feel any sense of constraint The period after the August 1998 embassy bombings was critical in shaping U S policy toward Bin Ladin Although more Americans had been killed in the 1996 KhobarTowers attack and many more in Beirut in 1983 the overall loss of life rivaled the worst attacks in memory More ominous perhaps was the demonstration of an operational capability to coordinate two nearly simultaneous attacks on U S embassies in different countries Despite the availability of information that al Qaeda was a global network in 1998 policymakers knew little about the organization The reams of new information that the CIA s Bin Ladin unit had been developing since 1996 had not been pulled together and synthesized for the rest of the government Indeed analysts in the unit felt that they were viewed as alarmists even within the CIA A National Intelligence Estimate on terrorism in 1997 had only briefly mentioned Bin Ladin and no subsequent national estimate would authoritatively evaluate the terrorism danger until after 9 11 Policymakers knew there was a dangerous individual Usama Bin Ladin whom they had been trying to capture and bring to trial Documents at the time referred to Bin Ladin and his associates or Bin Ladin and his network They did not emphasize the existence of a structured worldwide organization gearing up to train thousands of potential terrorists In the critical days and weeks after the August 1998 attacks senior policymakers in the Clinton administration had to reevaluate the threat posed by Bin RESPONSES TO AL QAEDA S INITIAL ASSAULTS 119 Ladin Was this just a new and especially venomous version of the ordinary terrorist threat America had lived with for decades or was it radically new posing a danger beyond any yet experienced Even after the embassy attacks Bin Ladin had been responsible for the deaths of fewer than 50 Americans most of them overseas An NSC staffer working for Richard Clarke told us the threat was seen as one that could cause hundreds of casualties not thousands Even officials who acknowledge a vital threat intellectually may not be ready to act on such beliefs at great cost or at high risk Therefore the government experts who believed that Bin Ladin and his network posed such a novel danger needed a way to win broad support for their views or at least spotlight the areas of dispute The Presidential Daily Brief and the similar more widely circulated daily reports for high officials consisting mainly of brief reports of intelligence news without much analysis or context did not provide such a vehicle The national intelligence estimate has often played this role and is sometimes controversial for this very reason It played no role in judging the threat posed by al Qaeda either in 1998 or later In the late summer and fall of 1998 the U S government also was worrying about the deployment of military power in two other ongoing conflicts After years of war in the Balkans the United States had finally committed itself to significant military intervention in 1995 1996 Already maintaining a NATO led peacekeeping force in Bosnia U S officials were beginning to consider major combat operations against Serbia to protect Muslim civilians in Kosovo from ethnic cleansing Air strikes were threatened in October 1998 a full scale NATO bombing campaign against Serbia was launched in March 1999 In addition the Clinton administration was facing the possibility of major combat operations against Iraq Since 1996 the UN inspections regime had been increasingly obstructed by Saddam Hussein The United States was threatening to attack unless unfettered inspections could resume The Clinton administration eventually launched a large scale set of air strikes against Iraq Operation Desert Fox in December 1998 These military commitments became the context in which the Clinton administration had to consider opening another front of military engagement against a new terrorist threat based in Afghanistan A Follow On Campaign Clarke hoped the August 1998 missile strikes would mark the beginning of a sustained campaign against Bin Ladin Clarke was as he later admitted obsessed with Bin Ladin and the embassy bombings gave him new scope for pursuing his obsession Terrorism had moved high up among the President s concerns and Clarke s position had elevated accordingly The CSG unlike most standing interagency committees did not have to report through the Deputies Committee Although such a reporting relationship had been prescribed in the May 1998 presidential directive after expressions of concern by Attorney General Reno among others that directive contained an exception that permitted the CSG to report directly to the principals if Berger so elected In practice the CSG often reported not even to the full Principals Committee but instead to the so called Small Group formed by Berger consisting only of those principals cleared to know about the most sensitive issues connected with counterterrorism activities concerning Bin Ladin or the Khobar Towers investigation For this inner cabinet Clarke drew up what he called Political Military Plan Delenda The Latin delenda meaning that something must be destroyed evoked the famous Roman vow to destroy its rival Carthage The overall goal of Clarke s paper was to immediately eliminate any significant threat to Americans from the Bin Ladin network 57The paper called for diplomacy to deny Bin Ladin sanctuary covert action to disrupt terrorist activities but above all to capture Bin Ladin and his deputies and bring them to trial efforts to dry up Bin Ladin s money supply and preparation for follow on military action The status of the document was and remained uncertain It was never formally adopted by the principals and participants in the Small Group now have little or no recollection of it It did however guide Clarke s efforts The military component of Clarke s plan was its most fully articulated element He envisioned an ongoing campaign of strikes against Bin Ladin s bases in Afghanistan or elsewhere whenever target information was ripe Acknowledging that individual targets might not have much value he cautioned Berger not to expect ever again to have an assembly of terrorist leaders in his sights But he argued that rolling attacks might persuade the Taliban to hand over Bin Ladin and in any case would show that the action in August was not a oneoff event It would show that the United States was committed to a relentless effort to take down Bin Ladin s network Members of the Small Group found themselves unpersuaded of the merits of rolling attacks Defense Secretary William Cohen told us Bin Ladin s training camps were primitive built with rope ladders General Shelton called them jungle gym camps Neither thought them worthwhile targets for very expensive missiles President Clinton and Berger also worried about the Economist s point that attacks that missed Bin Ladin could enhance his stature and win him new recruits After the United States launched air attacks against Iraq at the end of 1998 and against Serbia in 1999 in each case provoking worldwide criticism Deputy National Security Advisor James Steinberg added the argument that attacks in Afghanistan offered little benefit lots of blowback against a bomb happy U S During the last week of August 1998 officials began considering possible follow on strikes According to Clarke President Clinton was inclined to launch further strikes sooner rather than later On August 27 Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Walter Slocombe advised Secretary Cohen that the availRESPONSES TO AL QAEDA S INITIAL ASSAULTS 121 able targets were not promising The experience of the previous week he wrote has only confirmed the importance of defining a clearly articulated rationale for military action that was effective as well as justified But Slocombe worried that simply striking some of these available targets did not add up to an effective strategy Defense officials at a lower level in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict tried to meet Slocombe s objections They developed a plan that unlike Clarke s called not for particular strikes but instead for a broad change in national strategy and in the institutional approach of the Department of Defense implying a possible need for large scale operations across the whole spectrum of U S military capabilities It urged the department to become a lead agency in driving a national counterterrorism strategy forward to champion a national effort to take up the gauntlet that international terrorists have thrown at our feet The authors expressed concern that we have not fundamentally altered our philosophy or our approach even though the terrorist threat had grown They outlined an eight part strategy to be more proactive and aggressive The future they warned might bring horrific attacks in which case we will have no choice nor unfortunately will we have a plan The assistant secretary Allen Holmes took the paper to Slocombe s chief deputy Jan Lodal but it went no further Its lead author recalls being told by Holmes that Lodal thought it was too aggressive Holmes cannot recall what was said and Lodal cannot remember the episode or the paper at all DIPLOMACY After the August missile strikes diplomatic options to press the Taliban seemed no more promising than military options The United States had issued a formal warning to the Taliban and also to Sudan that they would be held directly responsible for any attacks on Americans wherever they occurred carried out by the Bin Ladin network as long as they continued to provide sanctuary to it For a brief moment it had seemed as if the August strikes might have shocked the Taliban into thinking of giving up Bin Ladin On August 22 the reclusive Mullah Omar told a working level State Department official that the strikes were counterproductive but added that he would be open to a dialogue with the United States on Bin Ladin s presence in Afghanistan Meeting in Islamabad with William Milam the U S ambassador to Pakistan Taliban delegates said it was against their culture to expel someone seeking sanctuary but asked what would happen to Bin Ladin should he be sent to Saudi Arabia Yet in September 1998 when the Saudi emissary Prince Turki asked Mullah Omar whether he would keep his earlier promise to expel Bin Ladin the Taliban leader said no Both sides shouted at each other with Mullah Omar denouncing the Saudi government Riyadh then suspended its diplomatic relations with the Taliban regime Saudi Arabia Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates were the only countries that recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan Crown Prince Abdullah told President Clinton and Vice President Gore about this when he visited Washington in late September His account confirmed reports that the U S government had received independently Other efforts with the Saudi government centered on improving intelligence sharing and permitting U S agents to interrogate prisoners in Saudi custody The history of such cooperation in 1997 and 1998 had been strained Several officials told us in particular that the United States could not get direct access to an important al Qaeda financial official Madani al Tayyib who had been detained by the Saudi government in 1997 67Though U S officials repeatedly raised the issue the Saudis provided limited information In his September 1998 meeting with Crown Prince Abdullah Vice President Gore while thanking the Saudi government for their responsiveness renewed the request for direct U S access to Tayyib The United States never obtained this access An NSC staff led working group on terrorist finances asked the CIA in November 1998 to push again for access to Tayyib and to see if it is possible to elaborate further on the ties between Usama bin Ladin and prominent individuals in Saudi Arabia including especially the Bin Ladin family One result was two NSC led interagency trips to Persian Gulf states in 1999 and 2000 During these trips the NSC Treasury and intelligence representatives spoke with Saudi officials and later interviewed members of the Bin Ladin family about Usama s inheritance The Saudis and the Bin Ladin family eventually helped in this particular effort and U S officials ultimately learned that Bin Ladin was not financing al Qaeda out of a personal inheritance But Clarke was frustrated about how little the Agency knew complaining to Berger that four years after we first asked CIA to track down Bin Ladin s finances and two years after the creation of the CIA s Bin Ladin unit the Agency said it could only guess at how much aid Bin Ladin gave to terrorist groups what were the main sources of his budget or how he moved his money The other diplomatic route to get at Bin Ladin in Afghanistan ran through Islamabad In the summer before the embassy bombings the State Department had been heavily focused on rising tensions between India and Pakistan and did not aggressively challenge Pakistan on Afghanistan and Bin Ladin But State Department counterterrorism officials wanted a stronger position the department s acting counterterrorism coordinator advised Secretary Albright to designate Pakistan as a state sponsor of terrorism noting that despite high level Pakistani assurances the country s military intelligence service continued activities in support of international terrorism by supporting attacks on civilian targets in Kashmir This recommendation was opposed by the State Department s South Asia bureau which was concerned that it would damage already RESPONSES TO AL QAEDA S INITIAL ASSAULTS 123 sensitive relations with Pakistan in the wake of the May 1998 nuclear tests by both Pakistan and India Secretary Albright rejected the recommendation on August 5 1998 just two days before the embassy bombings She told us that in general putting the Pakistanis on the terrorist list would eliminate any influence the United States had over them In October an NSC counterterrorism official noted that Pakistan s pro Taliban military intelligence service had been training Kashmiri jihadists in one of the camps hit by U S missiles leading to the death of Pakistanis After flying to Nairobi and bringing home the coffins of the American dead Secretary Albright increased the department s focus on counterterrorism According to Ambassador Milam the bombings were a wake up call and he soon found himself spending 45 to 50 percent of his time working the Taliban Bin Ladin portfolio But Pakistan s military intelligence service known as the ISID Inter Services Intelligence Directorate was the Taliban s primary patron which made progress difficult Additional pressure on the Pakistanis beyond demands to press theTaliban on Bin Ladin seemed unattractive to most officials of the State Department Congressional sanctions punishing Pakistan for possessing nuclear arms prevented the administration from offering incentives to Islamabad In the words of Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott Washington s Pakistan policy was stick heavy Talbott felt that the only remaining sticks were additional sanctions that would have bankrupted the Pakistanis a dangerous move that could have brought total chaos to a nuclear armed country with a significant number of Islamic radicals The Saudi government which had a long and close relationship with Pakistan and provided it oil on generous terms was already pressing Sharif with regard to the Taliban and Bin Ladin A senior State Department official concluded that Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah put a tremendous amount of heat on the Pakistani prime minister during the prince s October 1998 visit to Pakistan The State Department urged President Clinton to engage the Pakistanis Accepting this advice President Clinton invited Sharif to Washington where they talked mostly about India but also discussed Bin Ladin After Sharif went home the President called him and raised the Bin Ladin subject again This effort elicited from Sharif a promise to talk with the Taliban Mullah Omar s position showed no sign of softening One intelligence report passed to Berger by the NSC staff quoted Bin Ladin as saying that Mullah Omar had given him a completely free hand to act in any country though asking that he not claim responsibility for attacks in Pakistan or Saudi Arabia Bin Ladin was described as grabbing his beard and saying emotionally By Allah by God the Americans will still be amazed The so called United States will suffer the same fate as the Russians Their state will collapse too Debate in the State Department intensified after December 1998 when Michael Sheehan became counterterrorism coordinator A onetime special forces officer he had worked with Albright when she was ambassador to the United Nations and had served on the NSC staff with Clarke He shared Clarke s obsession with terrorism and had little hesitation about locking horns with the regional bureaus Through every available channel he repeated the earlier warning to the Taliban of the possible dire consequences including military strikes if Bin Ladin remained their guest and conducted additional attacks Within the department he argued for designating the Taliban regime a state sponsor of terrorism This was technically difficult to do for calling it a state would be tantamount to diplomatic recognition which the United States had thus far withheld But Sheehan urged the use of any available weapon against the Taliban He told us that he thought he was regarded in the department as a one note Johnny nutcase In early 1999 the State Department s counterterrorism office proposed a comprehensive diplomatic strategy for all states involved in the Afghanistan problem including Pakistan It specified both carrots and hard hitting sticks among them certifying Pakistan as uncooperative on terrorism Albright said the original carrots and sticks listed in a decision paper for principals may not have been used as described on paper but added that they were used in other ways or in varying degrees But the paper s author Ambassador Sheehan was frustrated and complained to us that the original plan had been watered down to the point that nothing was then done with it The cautiousness of the South Asia bureau was reinforced when in May 1999 Pakistani troops were discovered to have infiltrated into an especially mountainous area of Kashmir A limited war began between India and Pakistan euphemistically called the Kargil crisis as India tried to drive the Pakistani forces out Patience with Pakistan was wearing thin inside both the State Department and the NSC Bruce Riedel the NSC staff member responsible for Pakistan wrote Berger that Islamabad was behaving as a rogue state in two areas backing Taliban UBL terror and provoking war with India Discussion within the Clinton administration on Afghanistan then concentrated on two main alternatives The first championed by Riedel and Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth was to undertake a major diplomatic effort to end the Afghan civil war and install a national unity government The second favored by Sheehan Clarke and the CIA called for labeling the Taliban a terrorist group and ultimately funneling secret aid to its chief foe the Northern Alliance This dispute would go back and forth throughout 1999 and ultimately become entangled with debate about enlisting the Northern Alliance as an ally for covert action Another diplomatic option may have been available nurturing Afghan exile groups as a possible moderate governing alternative to theTaliban In late 1999 Washington provided some support for talks among the leaders of exile Afghan groups including the ousted Rome based King Zahir Shah and Hamid Karzai about bolstering anti Taliban forces inside Afghanistan and linking the RESPONSES TO AL QAEDA S INITIAL ASSAULTS 125 Northern Alliance with Pashtun groups One U S diplomat later told us that the exile groups were not ready to move forward and that coordinating fractious groups residing in Bonn Rome and Cyprus proved extremely difficult Frustrated by the Taliban s resistance two senior State Department officials suggested asking the Saudis to offer the Taliban 250 million for Bin Ladin Clarke opposed having the United States facilitate a huge grant to a regime as heinous as the Taliban and suggested that the idea might not seem attractive to either Secretary Albright or First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton both critics of the Taliban s record on women s rights The proposal seems to have quietly died Within the State Department some officials delayed Sheehan and Clarke s push either to designateTaliban controlled Afghanistan as a state sponsor of terrorism or to designate the regime as a foreign terrorist organization thereby avoiding the issue of whether to recognize the Taliban as Afghanistan s government Sheehan and Clarke prevailed in July 1999 when President Clinton issued an executive order effectively declaring the Taliban regime a state sponsor of terrorism In October a UN Security Council Resolution championed by the United States added economic and travel sanctions With UN sanctions set to come into effect in November Clarke wrote Berger that the Taliban appear to be up to something Mullah Omar had shuffled his cabinet and hinted at Bin Ladin s possible departure Clarke s staff thought his most likely destination would be Somalia Chechnya seemed less appealing with Russia on the offensive Clarke commented that Iraq and Libya had previously discussed hosting Bin Ladin though he and his staff had their doubts that Bin Ladin would trust secular Arab dictators such as Saddam Hussein or Muammar Qadhafi Clarke also raised the remote possibility of Yemen which offered vast uncontrolled spaces In November the CSG discussed whether the sanctions had rattled the Taliban who seemed to be looking for a face saving way out of the Bin Ladin issue In fact none of the outside pressure had any visible effect on Mullah Omar who was unconcerned about commerce with the outside world Omar had virtually no diplomatic contact with the West since he refused to meet with non Muslims The United States learned that at the end of 1999 theTaliban Council of Ministers unanimously reaffirmed that their regime would stick by Bin Ladin Relations between Bin Ladin and theTaliban leadership were sometimes tense but the foundation was deep and personal Indeed Mullah Omar had executed at least one subordinate who opposed his pro Bin Ladin policy The United States would try tougher sanctions in 2000 Working with Russia a country involved in an ongoing campaign against Chechen separatists some of whom received support from Bin Ladin the United States persuaded the United Nations to adopt Security Council Resolution 1333 which included an embargo on arms shipments to the Taliban in December 2000 The aim of the resolution was to hit the Taliban where it was most sensitive on the battlefield against the Northern Alliance and criminalize giving them arms and providing military advisers which Pakistan had been doing Yet the passage of the resolution had no visible effect on Omar nor did it halt the flow of Pakistani military assistance to the Taliban U S authorities had continued to try to get cooperation from Pakistan in pressing the Taliban to stop sheltering Bin Ladin President Clinton contacted Sharif again in June 1999 partly to discuss the crisis with India but also to urge Sharif in the strongest way I can to persuade the Taliban to expel Bin Ladin The President suggested that Pakistan use its control over oil supplies to the Taliban and over Afghan imports through Karachi Sharif suggested instead that Pakistani forces might try to capture Bin Ladin themselves Though no one in Washington thought this was likely to happen President Clinton gave the idea his blessing The President met with Sharif in Washington in early July Though the meeting s main purpose was to seal the Pakistani prime minister s decision to withdraw from the Kargil confrontation in Kashmir President Clinton complained about Pakistan s failure to take effective action with respect to the Taliban and Bin Ladin Sharif came back to his earlier proposal and won approval for U S assistance in training a Pakistani special forces team for an operation against Bin Ladin Then in October 1999 Sharif was deposed by General Pervez Musharraf and the plan was terminated At first the Clinton administration hoped that Musharraf s coup might create an opening for action on Bin Ladin A career military officer Musharraf was thought to have the political strength to confront and influence the Pakistani military intelligence service which supported the Taliban Berger speculated that the new government might use Bin Ladin to buy concessions from Washington but neither side ever developed such an initiative By late 1999 more than a year after the embassy bombings diplomacy with Pakistan like the efforts with the Taliban had according to Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering borne little fruit COVERT ACTION As part of the response to the embassy bombings President Clinton signed a Memorandum of Notification authorizing the CIA to let its tribal assets use force to capture Bin Ladin and his associates CIA officers told the tribals that the plan to capture Bin Ladin which had been turned off three months earlier was back on The memorandum also authorized the CIA to attack Bin Ladin in other ways Also an executive order froze financial holdings that could be linked to Bin Ladin The counterterrorism staff at CIA thought it was gaining a better understanding of Bin Ladin and his network In preparation for briefing the Senate RESPONSES TO AL QAEDA S INITIAL ASSAULTS 127 Select Committee on Intelligence on September 2 Tenet was told that the intelligence community knew more about Bin Ladin s network than about any other top tier terrorist organization The CIA was using this knowledge to disrupt a number of Bin Ladin associated cells Working with Albanian authorities CIA operatives had raided an al Qaeda forgery operation and another terrorist cell in Tirana These operations may have disrupted a planned attack on the U S embassy in Tirana and did lead to the rendition of a number of al Qaeda related terrorist operatives After the embassy bombings there were arrests in Azerbaijan Italy and Britain Several terrorists were sent to an Arab country The CIA described working with FBI operatives to prevent a planned attack on the U S embassy in Uganda and a number of suspects were arrested On September 16 Abu Hajer one of Bin Ladin s deputies in Sudan and the head of his computer operations and weapons procurement was arrested in Germany He was the most important Bin Ladin lieutenant captured thus far Clarke commented to Berger with satisfaction that August and September had brought the greatest number of terrorist arrests in a short period of time that we have ever arranged facilitated Given the President s August Memorandum of Notification the CIA had already been working on new plans for using the Afghan tribals to capture Bin Ladin During September and October the tribals claimed to have tried at least four times to ambush Bin Ladin Senior CIA officials doubted whether any of these ambush attempts had actually occurred But the tribals did seem to have success in reporting where Bin Ladin was This information was more useful than it had been in the past since the August missile strikes Bin Ladin had taken to moving his sleeping place frequently and unpredictably and had added new bodyguards Worst of all al Qaeda s senior leadership had stopped using a particular means of communication almost immediately after a leak to the Washington Times This made it much more difficult for the National Security Agency to intercept his conversations But since the tribals seemed to know where Bin Ladin was or would be an alternative to capturing Bin Ladin would be to mark his location and call in another round of missile strikes On November 3 the Small Group met to discuss these problems among other topics Preparing Director Tenet for a Small Group meeting in mid November the Counterterrorist Center stressed At this point we cannot predict when or if a capture operation will be executed by our assets U S counterterrorism officials also worried about possible domestic attacks Several intelligence reports some of dubious sourcing mentioned Washington as a possible target On October 26 Clarke s CSG took the unusual step of holding a meeting dedicated to trying to evaluate the threat of a terrorist attack in the United States by the Usama bin Ladin network 107The CSG members were urged to be as creative as possible in their thinking about preventing a Bin Ladin attack on U S territory Participants noted that while the FBI had been given additional resources for such efforts both it and the CIA were having problems exploiting leads by tracing U S telephone numbers and translating documents obtained in cell disruptions abroad The Justice Department reported that the current guidelines from the Attorney General gave sufficient legal authority for domestic investigation and surveillance Though intelligence gave no clear indication of what might be afoot some intelligence reports mentioned chemical weapons pointing toward work at a camp in southern Afghanistan called Derunta On November 4 1998 the U S Attorney s Office for the Southern District of New York unsealed its indictment of Bin Ladin charging him with conspiracy to attack U S defense installations The indictment also charged that al Qaeda had allied itself with Sudan Iran and Hezbollah The original sealed indictment had added that al Qaeda had reached an understanding with the government of Iraq that al Qaeda would not work against that government and that on particular projects specifically including weapons development al Qaeda would work cooperatively with the Government of Iraq This passage led Clarke who for years had read intelligence reports on Iraqi Sudanese cooperation on chemical weapons to speculate to Berger that a large Iraqi presence at chemical facilities in Khartoum was probably a direct result of the Iraq Al Qida agreement Clarke added that VX precursor traces found near al Shifa were the exact formula used by Iraq 110This language about al Qaeda s understanding with Iraq had been dropped however when a superseding indictment was filed in November 1998 On Friday December 4 1998 the CIA included an article in the Presidential Daily Brief describing intelligence received from a friendly government about a threatened hijacking in the United States This article was declassified at our request The following is the text of an item from the Presidential Daily Brief received by President William J Clinton on December 4 1998 Redacted material is indicated in brackets SUBJECT Bin Ladin Preparing to Hijack US Aircraft and Other Attacks 1 Reporting suggests Bin Ladin and his allies are preparing for attacks in the US including an aircraft hijacking to obtain the release of Shaykh Umar Abd al Rahman Ramzi Yousef and Muhammad Sadiq Awda One source quoted a senior member of the Gama at al Islamiyya IG saying that as of late October the IG had completed planning for RESPONSES TO AL QAEDA S INITIAL ASSAULTS 129 an operation in the US on behalf of Bin Ladin but that the operation was on hold A senior Bin Ladin operative from Saudi Arabia was to visit IG counterparts in the US soon thereafter to discuss options perhaps including an aircraft hijacking IG leader Islambuli in late September was planning to hijack a US airliner during the next couple of weeks to free Abd al Rahman and the other prisoners according to what may be a different source The same source late last month said that Bin Ladin might implement plans to hijack US aircraft before the beginning of Ramadan on 20 December and that two members of the operational team had evaded security checks during a recent trial run at an unidentified New York airport 2 Some members of the Bin Ladin network have received hijack training according to various sources but no group directly tied to Bin Ladin s al Qa ida organization has ever carried out an aircraft hijacking Bin Ladin could be weighing other types of operations against US aircraft According to the IG in October obtained SA 7 missiles and intended to move them from Yemen into Saudi Arabia to shoot down an Egyptian plane or if unsuccessful a US military or civilian aircraft A in October told us that unspecified extremist elements in Yemen had acquired SA 7s 3 indicate the Bin Ladin organization or its allies are moving closer to implementing anti US attacks at unspecified locations but we do not know whether they are related to attacks on aircraft A Bin Ladin associate in Sudan late last month told a colleague in Kandahar that he had shipped a group of containers to Afghanistan Bin Ladin associates also talked about the movement of containers to Afghanistan before the East Africa bombings In other Bin Ladin associates last month discussed picking up a package in Malaysia One told his colleague in Malaysia that they were in the ninth month of pregnancy An alleged Bin Ladin supporter in Yemen late last month remarked to his mother that he planned to work in commerce from abroad and said his impending marriage which would take place soon would be a surprise Commerce and marriage often are codewords for terrorist attacks The same day Clarke convened a meeting of his CSG to discuss both the hijacking concern and the antiaircraft missile threat To address the hijacking warning the group agreed that New York airports should go to maximum security starting that weekend They agreed to boost security at other East coast airports The CIA agreed to distribute versions of the report to the FBI and FAA to pass to the New York Police Department and the airlines The FAA issued a security directive on December 8 with specific requirements for more intensive air carrier screening of passengers and more oversight of the screening process at all three New York City area airports The intelligence community could learn little about the source of the information Later in December and again in early January 1999 more information arrived from the same source reporting that the planned hijacking had been stalled because two of the operatives who were sketchily described had been arrested near Washington D C or New York After investigation the FBI could find no information to support the hijack threat nor could it verify any arrests like those described in the report The FAA alert at the New York area airports ended on January 31 1999 On December 17 the day after the United States and Britain began their Desert Fox bombing campaign against Iraq the Small Group convened to discuss intelligence suggesting imminent Bin Ladin attacks on the U S embassies in Qatar and Ethiopia The next day Director Tenet sent a memo to the President the cabinet and senior officials throughout the government describing reports that Bin Ladin planned to attack U S targets very soon possibly over the next few days before Ramadan celebrations began Tenet said he was greatly concerned With alarms sounding members of the Small Group considered ideas about how to respond to or prevent such attacks Generals Shelton and Zinni came up with military options Special Operations Forces were later told that they might be ordered to attempt very high risk in and out raids either in Khartoum to capture a senior Bin Ladin operative known as Abu Hafs the Mauritanian who appeared to be engineering some of the plots or in Kandahar to capture Bin Ladin himself Shelton told us that such operations are not risk free invoking the memory of the 1993 Black Hawk down fiasco in Mogadishu The CIA reported on December 18 that Bin Ladin might be traveling to Kandahar and could be targeted there with cruise missiles Vessels with Tomahawk cruise missiles were on station in the Arabian Sea and could fire within a few hours of receiving target data On December 20 intelligence indicated Bin Ladin would be spending the night at the Haji Habash house part of the governor s residence in Kandahar The chief of the Bin Ladin unit Mike told us that he promptly briefed Tenet and his deputy John Gordon From the field the CIA s Gary Schroen advised Hit him tonight we may not get another chance An urgent teleconference of principals was arranged The principals considered a cruise missile strike to try to kill Bin Ladin One issue they discussed was the potential collateral damage the number of innocent bystanders who would be killed or wounded General Zinni predicted a number well over 200 and was concerned about damage to a nearby mosque The senior intelligence officer on the Joint Staff apparently made a different calculation estimating half as much collateral damage and not predicting damage to the mosque By the end of the meeting the principals decided against recommending to the President that he order a strike A few weeks later in January 1999 Clarke wrote that the principals had thought the intelligence only half reliable and had worried about killing or injuring perhaps 300 people Tenet said he remembered doubts about the reliability of the source and concern about hitting the nearby mosque Mike remembered Tenet telling him that the military was concerned that a few hours had passed since the last sighting of Bin Ladin and that this persuaded everyone that the chance of failure was too great Some lower level officials were angry Mike reported to Schroen that he had been unable to sleep after this decision I m sure we ll regret not acting last night he wrote criticizing the principals for worrying that some stray shrapnel might hit the Habash mosque and offend Muslims He commented that they had not shown comparable sensitivity when deciding to bomb Muslims in Iraq The principals he said were obsessed with trying to get others Saudis Pakistanis Afghan tribals to do what we won t do Schroen was disappointed too We should have done it last night he wrote We may well come to regret the decision not to go ahead The Joint Staff s deputy director for operations agreed even though he told us that later intelligence appeared to show that Bin Ladin had left his quarters before the strike would have occurred Missing Bin Ladin he said would have caused us a hell of a problem but it was a shot we should have taken and we would have had to pay the price The principals began considering other more aggressive covert alternatives using the tribals CIA officers suggested that the tribals would prefer to try a raid rather than a roadside ambush because they would have better control it would be less dangerous and it played more to their skills and experience But everyone knew that if the tribals were to conduct such a raid guns would be blazing The current Memorandum of Notification instructed the CIA to capture Bin Ladin and to use lethal force only in self defense Work now began on a new memorandum that would give the tribals more latitude The intention was to say that they could use lethal force if the attempted capture seemed impossible to complete successfully Early drafts of this highly sensitive document emphasized that it authorized only a capture operation The tribals were to be paid only if they captured Bin Ladin not if they killed him Officials throughout the government approved this draft But on December 21 the day after principals decided not to launch the cruise missile strike against Kandahar the CIA s leaders urged strengthening the language to allow the tribals to be paid whether Bin Ladin was captured or killed Berger and Tenet then worked together to take this line of thought even further They finally agreed as Berger reported to President Clinton that an extraordinary step was necessary The new memorandum would allow the killing of Bin Ladin if the CIA and the tribals judged that capture was not feasible a judgment it already seemed clear they had reached The Justice Department lawyer who worked on the draft told us that what was envisioned was a group of tribals assaulting a location leading to a shoot out Bin Ladin and others would be captured if possible but probably would be killed The administration s position was that under the law of armed conflict killing a person who posed an imminent threat to the United States would be an act of self defense not an assassination On Christmas Eve 1998 Berger sent a final draft to President Clinton with an explanatory memo The President approved the document Because the White House considered this operation highly sensitive only a tiny number of people knew about this Memorandum of Notification Berger arranged for the NSC s legal adviser to inform Albright Cohen Shelton and Reno None was allowed to keep a copy Congressional leaders were briefed as required by law Attorney General Reno had sent a letter to the President expressing her concern she warned of possible retaliation including the targeting of U S officials She did not pose any legal objection A copy of the final document along with the carefully crafted instructions that were to be sent to the tribals was given to Tenet A message from Tenet to CIA field agents directed them to communicate to the tribals the instructions authorized by the President the United States preferred that Bin Ladin and his lieutenants be captured but if a successful capture operation was not feasible the tribals were permitted to kill them The instructions added that the tribals must avoid killing others unnecessarily and must not kill or abuse Bin Ladin or his lieutenants if they surrendered Finally the tribals would not be paid if this set of requirements was not met The field officer passed these instructions to the tribals word for word But he prefaced the directions with a message From the American President down to the average man in the street we want him Bin Ladin stopped If the tribals captured Bin Ladin the officer assured them that he would receive a fair trial under U S law and be treated humanely The CIA officer reported that the tribals said they fully understand the contents implications and the spirit of the message and that that their response was We will try our best to capture Bin Ladin alive and will have no intention of killing or harming him on purpose The tribals explained that they wanted to prove that their standards of behavior were more civilized than those of Bin Ladin and his band of terrorists In an additional note addressed to Schroen the tribals noted that if they were to adopt Bin Ladin s ethics we would have finished the job long before RESPONSES TO AL QAEDA S INITIAL ASSAULTS 133 but they had been limited by their abilities and by our beliefs and laws we have to respect Schroen and Mike were impressed by the tribals reaction Schroen cabled that the tribals were not in it for the money but as an investment in the future of Afghanistan Mike agreed that the tribals reluctance to kill was not a showstopper From our view he wrote that seems in character and fair enough Policymakers in the Clinton administration including the President and his national security advisor told us that the President s intent regarding covert action against Bin Ladin was clear he wanted him dead This intent was never well communicated or understood within the CIA Tenet told the Commission that except in one specific case discussed later the CIA was authorized to kill Bin Ladin only in the context of a capture operation CIA senior managers operators and lawyers confirmed this understanding We always talked about how much easier it would have been to kill him a former chief of the Bin Ladin unit said In February 1999 another draft Memorandum of Notification went to President Clinton It asked him to allow the CIA to give exactly the same guidance to the Northern Alliance as had just been given to the tribals they could kill Bin Ladin if a successful capture operation was not feasible On this occasion however President Clinton crossed out key language he had approved in December and inserted more ambiguous language No one we interviewed could shed light on why the President did this President Clinton told the Commission that he had no recollection of why he rewrote the language Later in 1999 when legal authority was needed for enlisting still other collaborators and for covering a wider set of contingencies the lawyers returned to the language used in August 1998 which authorized force only in the context of a capture operation Given the closely held character of the document approved in December 1998 and the subsequent return to the earlier language it is possible to understand how the former White House officials and the CIA officials might disagree as to whether the CIA was ever authorized by the President to kill Bin Ladin The dispute turned out to be somewhat academic as the limits of available legal authority were not tested Clarke commented to Berger that despite expanded authority for CIA s sources to engage in direct action they have shown no inclination to do so He added that it was his impression that the CIA thought the tribals unlikely to act against Bin Ladin and hence relying on them was unrealistic Events seemed to bear him out since the tribals did not stage an attack on Bin Ladin or his associates during 1999 The tribals remained active collectors of intelligence however providing good but not predictive information about Bin Ladin s whereabouts The CIA also tried to improve its intelligence reporting on Bin Ladin by what Tenet s assistant director for collection the indefatigable Charles Allen called an allout all agency seven days a week effort The effort might have had an effect On January 12 1999 Clarke wrote Berger that the CIA s confidence in the tribals reporting had increased It was now higher than it had been on December 20 In February 1999 Allen proposed flying a U 2 mission over Afghanistan to build a baseline of intelligence outside the areas where the tribals had coverage Clarke was nervous about such a mission because he continued to fear that Bin Ladin might leave for someplace less accessible He wrote Deputy National Security Advisor Donald Kerrick that one reliable source reported Bin Ladin s having met with Iraqi officials who may have offered him asylum Other intelligence sources said that some Taliban leaders though not Mullah Omar had urged Bin Ladin to go to Iraq If Bin Ladin actually moved to Iraq wrote Clarke his network would be at Saddam Hussein s service and it would be virtually impossible to find him Better to get Bin Ladin in Afghanistan Clarke declared Berger suggested sending one U 2 flight but Clarke opposed even this It would require Pakistani approval he wrote and Pak istan s intel ligence service is in bed with Bin Ladin and would warn him that the United States was getting ready for a bombing campaign Armed with that knowledge old wily Usama will likely boogie to Baghdad 135Though told also by Bruce Riedel of the NSC staff that Saddam Hussein wanted Bin Ladin in Baghdad Berger conditionally authorized a single U 2 flight Allen meanwhile had found other ways of getting the information he wanted So the U 2 flight never occurred SEARCHING FOR FRESH OPTIONS Boots on the Ground Starting on the day the August 1998 strikes were launched General Shelton had issued a planning order to prepare follow on strikes and think beyond just using cruise missiles The initial strikes had been called Operation Infinite Reach The follow on plans were given the code name Operation Infinite Resolve At the time any actual military action in Afghanistan would have been carried out by General Zinni s Central Command This command was therefore the locus for most military planning Zinni was even less enthusiastic than Cohen and Shelton about follow on cruise missile strikes He knew that the Tomahawks did not always hit their targets After the August 20 strikes President Clinton had had to call Pakistani Prime Minister Sharif to apologize for a wayward missile that had killed several people in a Pakistani village Sharif had been understanding while commenting on American overkill Zinni feared that Bin Ladin would in the future locate himself in cities where U S missiles could kill thousands of Afghans He worried also lest Pakistani authorities not get adequate warning think the missiles came from India RESPONSES TO AL QAEDA S INITIAL ASSAULTS 135 and do something that everyone would later regret Discussing potential repercussions in the region of his military responsibility Zinni said It was easy to take the shot from Washington and walk away from it We had to live there Zinni s distinct preference would have been to build up counterterrorism capabilities in neighboring countries such as Uzbekistan But he told us that he could not drum up much interest in or money for such a purpose from Washington partly he thought because these countries had dictatorial governments After the decision in which fear of collateral damage was an important factor not to use cruise missiles against Kandahar in December 1998 Shelton and officers in the Pentagon developed plans for using an AC 130 gunship instead of cruise missile strikes Designed specifically for the special forces the version of the AC 130 known as Spooky can fly in fast or from high altitude undetected by radar guided to its zone by extraordinarily complex electronics it is capable of rapidly firing precision guided 25 40 and 105 mm projectiles Because this system could target more precisely than a salvo of cruise missiles it had a much lower risk of causing collateral damage After giving Clarke a briefing and being encouraged to proceed Shelton formally directed Zinni and General Peter Schoomaker who headed the Special Operations Command to develop plans for an AC 130 mission against Bin Ladin s headquarters and infrastructure in Afghanistan The Joint Staff prepared a decision paper for deployment of the Special Operations aircraft Though Berger and Clarke continued to indicate interest in this option the AC 130s were never deployed Clarke wrote at the time that Zinni opposed their use and John Maher the Joint Staff s deputy director of operations agreed that this was Zinni s position Zinni himself does not recall blocking the option He told us that he understood the Special Operations Command had never thought the intelligence good enough to justify actually moving AC 130s into position Schoomaker says on the contrary that he thought the AC 130 option feasible The most likely explanation for the two generals differing recollections is that both of them thought serious preparation for any such operations would require a long term redeployment of Special Operations forces to the Middle East or South Asia The AC 130s would need bases because the aircraft s unrefueled range was only a little over 2 000 miles They needed search and rescue backup which would have still less range Thus an AC 130 deployment had to be embedded in a wider political and military concept involving Pakistan or other neighboring countries to address issues relating to basing and overflight No one ever put such an initiative on the table Zinni therefore cautioned about simply ordering up AC 130 deployments for a quick strike Schoomaker planned for what he saw as a practical strike option and the underlying issues were not fully engaged The Joint Staff decision paper was never turned into an interagency policy paper The same was true for the option of using ground units from the Special Operations Command Within the command some officers such as Schoomaker wanted the mission of putting boots on the ground to get at Bin Ladin and al Qaeda At the time Special Operations was designated as a supporting command not a supported command that is it supported a theater commander and did not prepare its own plans for dealing with al Qaeda Schoomaker proposed to Shelton and Cohen that Special Operations become a supported command but the proposal was not adopted Had it been accepted he says he would have taken on the al Qaeda mission instead of deferring to Zinni Lieutenant General William Boykin the current deputy under secretary of defense for intelligence and a founding member of Delta Force told us that opportunities were missed because of an unwillingness to take risks and a lack of vision and understanding President Clinton relied on the advice of General Shelton who informed him that without intelligence on Bin Ladin s location a commando raid s chance of failure was high Shelton told President Clinton he would go forward with boots on the ground if the President ordered him to do so however he had to ensure that the President was completely aware of the large logistical problems inherent in a military operation The Special Operations plans were apparently conceived as another quick strike option an option to insert forces after the United States received actionable intelligence President Clinton told the Commission that if we had had really good intelligence about where Usama Bin Ladin was I would have done it Zinni and Schoomaker did make preparations for possible very high risk in and out operations to capture or kill terrorists Cohen told the Commission that the notion of putting military personnel on the ground without some reasonable certitude that Bin Ladin was in a particular location would have resulted in the mission s failure and the loss of life in a fruitless effort None of these officials was aware of the ambitious plan developed months earlier by lower level Defense officials In our interviews some military officers repeatedly invoked the analogy of Desert One and the failed 1980 hostage rescue mission in Iran They were dubious about a quick strike approach to using Special Operations Forces which they thought complicated and risky Such efforts would have required bases in the region but all the options were unappealing Pro Taliban elements of Pakistan s military might warn Bin Ladin or his associates of pending operations With nearby basing options limited an alternative was to fly from ships in the Arabian Sea or from land bases in the Persian Gulf as was done after 9 11 Such operations would then have to be supported from long distances overflying the airspace of nations that might not have been supportive or aware of U S efforts However if these hurdles were addressed and if the military could then operate regularly in the region for a long period perhaps clandestinely it might RESPONSES TO AL QAEDA S INITIAL ASSAULTS 137 attempt to gather intelligence and wait for an opportunity One Special Operations commander said his view of actionable intelligence was that if you give me the action I will give you the intelligence But this course would still be risky in light both of the difficulties already mentioned and of the danger that U S operations might fail disastrously We have found no evidence that such a long term political military approach for using Special Operations Forces in the region was proposed to or analyzed by the Small Group even though such capability had been honed for at least a decade within the Defense Department Therefore the debate looked to some like bold proposals from civilians meeting hypercaution from the military Clarke saw it this way Of the military he said to us They were very very very reluctant But from another perspective poorly informed proposals for bold action were pitted against experienced professional judgment That was how Secretary of Defense Cohen viewed it He said to us I would have to place my judgment call in terms of do I believe that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs former commander of Special Forces command is in a better position to make a judgment on the feasibility of this than perhaps Mr Clarke Beyond a large scale political military commitment to build up a covert or clandestine capability using American personnel on the ground either military or CIA there was a still larger option that could have been considered invading Afghanistan itself Every official we questioned about the possibility of an invasion of Afghanistan said that it was almost unthinkable absent a provocation such as 9 11 because of poor prospects for cooperation from Pakistan and other nations and because they believed the public would not support it Cruise missiles were and would remain the only military option on the table The Desert Camp February 1999 Early in 1999 the CIA received reporting that Bin Ladin was spending much of his time at one of several camps in the Afghan desert south of Kandahar At the beginning of February Bin Ladin was reportedly located in the vicinity of the Sheikh Ali camp a desert hunting camp being used by visitors from a Gulf state Public sources have stated that these visitors were from the United Arab Emirates Reporting from the CIA s assets provided a detailed description of the hunting camp including its size location resources and security as well as of Bin Ladin s smaller adjacent camp Because this was not in an urban area missiles launched against it would have less risk of causing collateral damage On February 8 the military began to ready itself for a possible strike The next day national technical intelligence confirmed the location and description of the larger camp and showed the nearby presence of an official aircraft of the United Arab Emirates But the location of Bin Ladin s quarters could not be pinned down so precisely The CIA did its best to answer a host of questions about the larger camp and its residents and about Bin Ladin s daily schedule and routines to support military contingency planning According to reporting from the tribals Bin Ladin regularly went from his adjacent camp to the larger camp where he visited the Emiratis the tribals expected him to be at the hunting camp for such a visit at least until midmorning on February 11 Clarke wrote to Berger s deputy on February 10 that the military was then doing targeting work to hit the main camp with cruise missiles and should be in position to strike the following morning Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert appears to have been briefed on the situation No strike was launched By February 12 Bin Ladin had apparently moved on and the immediate strike plans became moot According to CIA and Defense officials policymakers were concerned about the danger that a strike would kill an Emirati prince or other senior officials who might be with Bin Ladin or close by Clarke told us the strike was called off after consultations with Director Tenet because the intelligence was dubious and it seemed to Clarke as if the CIA was presenting an option to attack America s best counterterrorism ally in the Gulf The lead CIA official in the field Gary Schroen felt that the intelligence reporting in this case was very reliable the Bin Ladin unit chief Mike agreed Schroen believes today that this was a lost opportunity to kill Bin Ladin before 9 11 Even after Bin Ladin s departure from the area CIA officers hoped he might return seeing the camp as a magnet that could draw him for as long as it was still set up The military maintained readiness for another strike opportunity On March 7 1999 Clarke called a UAE official to express his concerns about possible associations between Emirati officials and Bin Ladin Clarke later wrote in a memorandum of this conversation that the call had been approved at an interagency meeting and cleared with the CIA When the former Bin Ladin unit chief found out about Clarke s call he questioned CIA officials who denied having given such a clearance Imagery confirmed that less than a week after Clarke s phone call the camp was hurriedly dismantled and the site was deserted CIA officers including Deputy Director for Operations Pavitt were irate Mike thought the dismantling of the camp erased a possible site for targeting Bin Ladin The United Arab Emirates was becoming both a valued counterterrorism ally of the United States and a persistent counterterrorism problem From 1999 through early 2001 the United States and President Clinton personally pressed the UAE one of the Taliban s only travel and financial outlets to the outside world to break off its ties and enforce sanctions especially those relating to flights to and from Afghanistan These efforts achieved little before 9 11 In July 1999 UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Hamdan bin Zayid threatened to break relations with the Taliban over Bin Ladin The Taliban did not take him seriously however Bin Zayid later told an American diploRESPONSES TO AL QAEDA S INITIAL ASSAULTS 139 mat that the UAE valued its relations with the Taliban because the Afghan radicals offered a counterbalance to Iranian dangers in the region but he also noted that the UAE did not want to upset the United States Looking for New Partners Although not all CIA officers had lost faith in the tribals capabilities many judged them to be good reporters few believed they would carry out an ambush of Bin Ladin The chief of the Counterterrorist Center compared relying on the tribals to playing the lottery He and his associates supported by Clarke pressed for developing a partnership with the Northern Alliance even though doing so might bring the United States squarely behind one side in Afghanistan s long running civil war The Northern Alliance was dominated by Tajiks and drew its strength mainly from the northern and eastern parts of Afghanistan In contrast Taliban members came principally from Afghanistan s most numerous ethnic group the Pashtuns who are concentrated in the southern part of the country extending into the North West Frontier and Baluchistan provinces of Pakistan Because of the Taliban s behavior and its association with Pakistan the Northern Alliance had been able at various times to obtain assistance from Russia Iran and India The alliance s leader was Afghanistan s most renowned military commander Ahmed Shah Massoud Reflective and charismatic he had been one of the true heroes of the war against the Soviets But his bands had been charged with more than one massacre and the Northern Alliance was widely thought to finance itself in part through trade in heroin Nor had Massoud shown much aptitude for governing except as a ruthless warlord Nevertheless Tenet told us Massoud seemed the most interesting possible new ally against Bin Ladin In February 1999 Tenet sought President Clinton s authorization to enlist Massoud and his forces as partners In response to this request the President signed the Memorandum of Notification whose language he personally altered Tenet says he saw no significance in the President s changes So far as he was concerned it was the language of August 1998 expressing a preference for capture but accepting the possibility that Bin Ladin could not be brought out alive We were plowing the same ground Tenet said CIA officers described Massoud s reaction when he heard that the United States wanted him to capture and not kill Bin Ladin One characterized Massoud s body language as a wince Schroen recalled Massoud s response as You guys are crazy you haven t changed a bit In Schroen s opinion the capture proviso inhibited Massoud and his forces from going after Bin Ladin but did not completely stop them The idea however was a long shot Bin Ladin s usual base of activity was near Kandahar far from the front lines ofTaliban operations against the Northern Alliance Kandahar May 1999 It was in Kandahar that perhaps the last and most likely the best opportunity arose for targeting Bin Ladin with cruise missiles before 9 11 In May 1999 CIA assets in Afghanistan reported on Bin Ladin s location in and around Kandahar over the course of five days and nights The reporting was very detailed and came from several sources If this intelligence was not actionable working level officials said at the time and today it was hard for them to imagine how any intelligence on Bin Ladin in Afghanistan would meet the standard Communications were good and the cruise missiles were ready This was in our strike zone a senior military officer said It was a fat pitch a home run He expected the missiles to fly When the decision came back that they should stand down not shoot the officer said we all just slumped He told us he knew of no one at the Pentagon or the CIA who thought it was a bad gamble Bin Ladin should have been a dead man that night he said Working level CIA officials agreed While there was a conflicting intelligence report about Bin Ladin s whereabouts the experts discounted it At the time CIA working level officials were told by their managers that the strikes were not ordered because the military doubted the intelligence and worried about collateral damage Replying to a frustrated colleague in the field the Bin Ladin unit chief wrote having a chance to get Bin Ladin three times in 36 hours and foregoing the chance each time has made me a bit angry T he DCI finds himself alone at the table with the other princip als basically saying we ll go along with your decision Mr Director and implicitly saying that the Agency will hang alone if the attack doesn t get Bin Ladin But the military officer quoted earlier recalled that the Pentagon had been willing to act He told us that Clarke informed him and others that Tenet assessed the chance of the intelligence being accurate as 50 50 This officer believed that Tenet s assessment was the key to the decision Tenet told us he does not remember any details about this episode except that the intelligence came from a single uncorroborated source and that there was a risk of collateral damage The story is further complicated by Tenet s absence from the critical principals meeting on this strike he was apparently out of town his deputy John Gordon was representing the CIA Gordon recalled having presented the intelligence in a positive light with appropriate caveats but stating that this intelligence was about as good as it could get Berger remembered only that in all such cases the call had been Tenet s Berger felt sure that Tenet was eager to get Bin Ladin In his view Tenet did his job responsibly George would call and say We just don t have it Berger said The decision not to strike in May 1999 may now seem hard to understand In fairness we note two points First in December 1998 the principals wariness about ordering a strike appears to have been vindicated Bin Ladin left his room unexpectedly and if a strike had been ordered he would not have been RESPONSES TO AL QAEDA S INITIAL ASSAULTS 141 hit Second the administration and the CIA in particular was in the midst of intense scrutiny and criticism in May 1999 because faulty intelligence had just led the United States to mistakenly bomb the Chinese embassy in Belgrade during the NATO war against Serbia This episode may have made officials more cautious than might otherwise have been the case From May 1999 until September 2001 policymakers did not again actively consider a missile strike against Bin Ladin The principals did give some further consideration in 1999 to more general strikes reviving Clarke s Delenda notion of hitting camps and infrastructure to disrupt al Qaeda s organization In the first months of 1999 the Joint Staff had developed broader target lists to undertake a focused campaign against the infrastructure of Bin Ladin s network and to hit Taliban government sites as well General Shelton told us that the Taliban targets were easier to hit and more substantial Part of the context for considering broader strikes in the summer of 1999 was renewed worry about Bin Ladin s ambitions to acquire weapons of mass destruction In May and June the U S government received a flurry of ominous reports including more information about chemical weapons training or development at the Derunta camp and possible attempts to amass nuclear material at Herat By late June U S and other intelligence services had concluded that al Qaeda was in pre attack mode perhaps again involving Abu Hafs the Mauritanian On June 25 at Clarke s request Berger convened the Small Group in his office to discuss the alert Bin Ladin s WMD programs and his location Should we pre empt by attacking UBL facilities Clarke urged Berger to ask his colleagues In his handwritten notes on the meeting paper Berger jotted down the presence of 7 to 11 families in the Tarnak Farms facility which could mean 60 65 casualties Berger noted the possible slight impact on Bin Ladin and added if he responds we re blamed The NSC staff raised the option of waiting until after a terrorist attack and then retaliating including possible strikes on the Taliban But Clarke observed that Bin Ladin would probably empty his camps after an attack The military route seemed to have reached a dead end In December 1999 Clarke urged Berger to ask the principals to ask themselves Why have there been no real options lately for direct US military action 185There are no notes recording whether the question was discussed or if it was how it was answered Reports of possible attacks by Bin Ladin kept coming in throughout 1999 They included a threat to blow up the FBI building in Washington D C In September the CSG reviewed a possible threat to a flight out of Los Angeles or New York These warnings came amid dozens of others that flooded in With military and diplomatic options practically exhausted by the summer of 1999 the U S government seemed to be back where it had been in the summer of 1998 relying on the CIA to find some other option That picture also seemed discouraging Several disruptions and renditions aimed against the broader al Qaeda network had succeeded But covert action efforts in Afghanistan had not been fruitful In mid 1999 new leaders arrived at the Counterterrorist Center and the Bin Ladin unit The new director of CTC replacing Jeff was Cofer Black The new head of the section that included the Bin Ladin unit was Richard Black Richard and their colleagues began working on a new operational strategy for attacking al Qaeda their starting point was to get better intelligence relying more on the CIA s own sources and less on the tribals In July 1999 President Clinton authorized the CIA to work with several governments to capture Bin Ladin and extended the scope of efforts to Bin Ladin s principal lieutenants The President reportedly also authorized a covert action under carefully limited circumstances which if successful would have resulted in Bin Ladin s death Attorney General Reno again expressed concerns on policy grounds She was worried about the danger of retaliation The CIA also developed the short lived effort to work with a Pakistani team that we discussed earlier and an initiative to work with Uzbekistan The Uzbeks needed basic equipment and training No action could be expected before March 2000 at the earliest In fall 1999 DCI Tenet unveiled the CIA s new Bin Ladin strategy It was called simply the Plan The Plan proposed continuing disruption and rendition operations worldwide It announced a program for hiring and training better officers with counterterrorism skills recruiting more assets and trying to penetrate al Qaeda s ranks The Plan aimed to close gaps in technical intelligence collection signal and imagery as well In addition the CIA would increase contacts with the Northern Alliance rebels fighting the Taliban With a new operational strategy the CIA evaluated its capture options None scored high marks The CIA had no confidence in the Pakistani effort In the event that Bin Ladin traveled to the Kandahar region in southern Afghanistan the tribal network there was unlikely to attack a heavily guarded Bin Ladin the Counterterrorist Center rated the chance of success at less than 10 percent To the northwest the Uzbeks might be ready for a cross border sortie in six months their chance of success was also rated at less than 10 percent In the northeast were Massoud s Northern Alliance forces perhaps the CIA s best option In late October a group of officers from the Counterterrorist Center flew into the Panjshir Valley to meet up with Massoud a hazardous journey in rickety helicopters that would be repeated several times in the future Massoud appeared committed to helping the United States collect intelligence on Bin Ladin s activities and whereabouts and agreed to try to capture him if the opportunity arose The Bin Ladin unit was satisfied that its reporting on Bin Ladin would now have a second source But it also knew that Massoud would act against Bin Ladin only if his own interests and those of the RESPONSES TO AL QAEDA S INITIAL ASSAULTS 143 United States intersected By early December the CIA rated this possibility at less than 15 percent Finally the CIA considered the possibility of putting U S personnel on the ground in Afghanistan The CIA had been discussing this option with Special Operations Command and found enthusiasm on the working level but reluctance at higher levels CIA saw a 95 percent chance of Special Operations Command forces capturing Bin Ladin if deployed but less than a 5 percent chance of such a deployment Sending CIA officers into Afghanistan was to be considered if the gain clearly outweighs the risk but at this time no such gains presented themselves to warrant the risk As mentioned earlier such a protracted deployment of U S Special Operations Forces into Afghanistan perhaps as part of a team joined to a deployment of the CIA s own officers would have required a major policy initiative probably combined with efforts to secure the support of at least one or two neighboring countries to make a long term commitment establish a durable presence on the ground and be prepared to accept the associated risks and costs Such a military plan was never developed for interagency consideration before 9 11 As 1999 came to a close the CIA had a new strategic plan in place for capturing Bin Ladin but no option was rated as having more than a 15 percent chance of achieving that objective
