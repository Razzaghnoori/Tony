Remember In Adultery and Boredom Jacob Weisberg cites a poll in which 85 percent of the respondents said that Mayor Giuliani s affair would not affect their vote Another 7 percent said the affair made them less likely to vote for Giuliani So are the remaining 8 percent more likely to vote for Giuliani because of his affair If so it could mean that male adulterers are now a voting bloc that must be courted John Raley San Francisco Radical Chic Paul Berman seems to suggest in The Refractory Ones that the case of Timothy McVeigh is somehow analogous to the trial of Sacco Vanzetti in that a misunderstood radical faction was descended upon by a bigoted majority that then executed the sacrificial lambs While the comparison between the modern day Patriot movement to which McVeigh belongs and the turn of the century anarchist movement is worth making the contrasts rather than similarities are what stand out For starters there has been no public outcry to ban or do away with the Patriots as there was with the anarchists Certainly there has been no public self examination to consider the implications of the movement Rather the opposite has occurred The mass media in general have covered the rise of the Patriots only spottily rushing to report the daily incidents the movement inspires and doing little to examine its sources When after the Oklahoma City disaster President Clinton asked for the nation to deal with the voices of hate that inspire the Patriots to action there was no attempt to actually do so Rather every talk show host on the radio it seemed scurried to proclaim his or her innocence Not me I didn t do it The truth is there are many of us whose gasoline rhetoric has fueled the Patriots bonfires of paranoia And we still have not stopped throwing it about with glee Secondly the Patriot movement is at the opposite end of the political spectrum With its roots in white supremacy and McCarthyism the movement really represents the rise of a genuine American bred fascism which as Berman points out is precisely what the anarchists had organized to combat I d wager that Sacco and Vanzetti would be disgusted to be included in the company of McVeigh Finally while Sacco and Vanzetti probably were innocent of the murder of a single policeman McVeigh has practically confessed to killing 168 people and maiming 500 more And while the families of those victims have generally cheered his route to the executioner the public at large has been strangely mute on McVeigh s fate They seem to have been much more preoccupied with a certain black football player s murder trial Berman s main point is worth making Executions exist not for the actual pursuit of justice but rather for wreaking vengeance However he should consider the fact that this very mentality an eye for an eye is a large part of what drives the Patriot movement and as McVeigh himself has recently suggested this is what drove him to fill a Ryder truck with explosives that he then set off Sacco and Vanzetti may have been sacrificial lambs but McVeigh appears to be reaping the fruits of his own belief system It may be a sickening view but there is something appropriately symmetrical about it David Neiwert Seattle Poll Position William Saletan s comments in Centrists vs Progressives are more definitive than most other observations about patently obvious things in society But they don t change the obsession idea mongers and contemporary media have with polling As a matter of fact instead of focusing on polling s farcical contributions to an enlightened society he conveys the notion that polling is would be credible without the manipulations subtle or otherwise The universal credibility problem with polling is that wordsmithing and mathematics don t mix and never will Tom DeLuca Upper Arlington Ohio Nothing in Commons Daniel Akst s Passive Aggressive on the evils of index investing threatens to mislead Slate s audience of successful investors and policy wonks There is no commons problem in index investing It is true that markets are efficient because securities research and that index investors invest without doing research or paying others to do research But as more people invest without doing research i e as markets become less efficient then the returns to research will increase and money will shift away from indexing In the commons problem there is no reason not to overgraze if your neighbor is overgrazing as well In a securities market if your neighbors overgraze i e engage in index investing at times when the market is relatively inefficient you can fleece them This index investing question is a subset of what seemed to be a paradox in the efficient market hypothesis securities research is both necessary for market efficiency
