 But enough about us what do you think of Slate As we noted in this space three weeks ago the average Slate reader is intelligent discerning politically involved culturally aware and physically attractive Also of course skeptical of cant and immune to flattery But we d like to know even more about you Do you consume vast quantities of alcohol Do you drive expensive cars and trade them in often Are you by any chance in the market for a Boeing jet fighter A Ralph Lauren undershirt A good book A carton of milk How many times a week do you have sex Would you be willing to pay for it Say 19 95 Or are you one of those people who think that sex like Web sites ought to always be free Are you in short the kind of reader advertisers are looking for Please say yes Actually what we mainly want to know about is you and Slate how often you read it in what form what you like and don t like about it and so on Toward that end we have composed an online reader survey Our e mail delivery readers will receive their own version We would be grateful if you took a few minutes to fill it out Thanks very much Go to survey Warning Do not read this book review Also Monday we post a review by James J Cramer of The Microsoft Way by Randall E Stross a big new book about the well known Seattle based coffee uh we mean software company Slate s official editorial position about Microsoft is of course scrupulously neutral We believe Microsoft is a marvelous flowering of the American entrepreneurial spirit a boon to all mankind a splendid example of employer benevolence at its finest an institution beyond legitimate criticism of any sort with a damned fine tuna tostada every Thursday in the cafeteria But beyond that we take no view It is unfortunate therefore that we were tricked into publishing the highly biased opinions of Mr Cramer a man of no discernible qualifications whatsoever beyond extensive experience in both business and journalism a brilliant track record on Wall Street and a lively writing style that is When we showed Cramer s review to Bill Gates not because it concerns Microsoft of course but because he insists on reading every word of Slate before publication in an admirable effort to improve his vocabulary his reaction was swift Have it killed he observed reflectively We said You mean Have him killed Gates shrieked No you fools What kind of person do you take me for Kill the piece Kill the piece But by that time the review had already been loaded into Slate s doomsday server a device designed to ensure that this magazine continues to be propagated into cyberspace in the event of a nuclear war Once loaded an article cannot be retrieved There was nothing we could do Honest Bill Listen and learn If you haven t done so yet check out the new format for our Dispatches Dialogues and the Slate Diary It s part of our continuing effort to make Slate more user friendly Many readers however were quick to tell us they regarded one particular change a reduction in the type size of Dispatches Dialogues anything but friendly A sample I m as frumpy as David Brinkley because Shearer s dispatches are posted in print that s too goddamned small Honestly we were only trying to help Smaller type means more words per screen and therefore less scrolling Especially helpful or so we thought in consuming Harry Shearer s hilarious but epic O J trial dispatches The smaller type also we thought enhanced the e mail look and feel of the feature But the readers were clear The type was not clear that is So we re back to the normal point size in a more legible typeface Times New Roman to boot Readers were also clear in their responses to last week s query about saving space in the print out edition by removing the links discussion at the end of each piece By an overwhelming margin those who responded prefer to learn about Internet links even when they re not reading Slate online So we ll continue as before Your wish is our command Another party heard from The Fray now has more than 15 000 registered participants One of them last week was Cliff Jackson the Arkansas lawyer who is Captain Ahab to Bill Clinton s White Whale and the orchestrator of Paula Jones lawsuit His Frayhandle is Mugwumps To read what he has to say type this address after you ve registered www slate com The fray main asp thread 111 Jackson has some choice words for Susan Estrich who has been engaged in a lively dialogue with Stuart Taylor Jr about Jones and Anita Hill Feel free to enter The Fray and talk back
