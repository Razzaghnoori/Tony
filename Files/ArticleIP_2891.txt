 Theme Party For most of this century it s been a routine British sneer that Americans have no sense of irony Bob Dole s poll numbers may finally be proving the Brits right Dole has run the most ironic postmodern presidential campaign ever seen starting with his campaign theme song the only conceivable purpose of which is to serve as an ironic negation of everything campaign themes are meant to do is a takeoff on the 60s hit I m a Soul Man and its most immediate quality is that it s so un Dole It s a parodic campaign song Dole obviously has never heard of it any more than he s heard of Tupac Shakur or those other gangsta rappers his advisers periodically call on him to denounce Then again considering that 98 percent of all pop songs are gender neutral though Pat Buchanan toyed with You Can t Get a Man With a Gun the number seems to have been especially picked for the blithe insouciance it shows toward the Dole campaign s gender gap What do they do for a second chorus I m a Dole Chick More ironic is that the song is an exquisite musicalization of the candidate s most frequently cited defect his campaign s lack of any central theme Dole Man isn t about anything at all You can t blame Dole for having trouble staying on message when the only message of his song is that you should stand around twitching I m a Dole Man Na na na na na na I m a Dole Man Na na na na Repeat until fade Sam Dave sang the song back in the 60s and Sam gave the campaign permission to use it I forget how Dole voted on the 1976 revisions to Title 17 of the U S Code but it clearly never registered with him that in pop songs copyright belongs to the copyright holder in this case the recording company not to the recording artists One of the song s writers objected to Dole Man the recording company backed him up and Sam s permission proved to be irrelevant So much for Dole s line that though he may not have a lot of fancy words he s a legislator and knows how things work Compare all that with Clinton in 92 who went on the stump to a that suited him perfectly Yes that s a cruel thing to say about anybody but the point is that it was a plausible soundtrack to his campaign Don t stopThinking about tomorrow Don t stopIt ll soon be here This quatrain distills brilliantly both the vapidity and ruthless single mindedness of the Clinton administration We can t say we weren t warned For a campaign song that s pithy you have to go back to 1931 and the satirical musical Of Thee I Sing in which John P Wintergreen campaigns for the White House with a powerful slogan A Vote for Wintergreen Is a Vote for Wintergreen and a by the Gershwins of just four lines Wintergreen for president Wintergreen for president He s the man the people choose Loves the Irish and the Jews Unfortunately the strategy wasn t so successful the second time around In the sequel Let Em Eat Cake 1933 John P Wintergreen runs for re election and is defeated by John P Tweedledee with his He s the man the country seeks Loves the Turks and the Greeks Ira Gershwin was much better at spoof campaign songs than the real thing In the 50s he reworked It Ain t Necessarily So for Adlai Stevenson and included the first sung reference to a vice presidential candidate L il Nixon was small but oh my His office expenses were high as well as Love Is Sweeping the Country also from Of Thee I Sing Adlai s sweeping the country He will be the next prez We ll be leaningOn words with meaning For he means every word he says It s funny how hard it is to find anything to sing about Most presidential elections in the republic s history have had specially commissioned themes Teddy Come Back Wilson That s All Franklin D Roosevelt s Back Again Nixon s the One But it wouldn t have made any difference if they d been Wilson s the One Theodore Roosevelt s Back Again Franklin That s All and Nixon Come Back As if to concede the John P Wintergreen John P Tweedledee interchangeability most campaigns eventually settled for an INSERT NAME OF CANDIDATE HERE approach shoehorning their man into the handiest existing song In 1988 I asked Sammy Cahn if he d been pressed into service Funny you should mention that he said but I got a call from some friends in Boston who are backing a fellow called Dukakis So I wrote My Kind of Guy Dukakis Is A bit tricky to rhyme Dukakis is Sure said Sammy but there s always a way around When Kennedy asked me if he could use I realized his name didn t fit any part of the tune Where can you put it Just what makes the little old ant Think he ll move a rubber tree plant Ev ryone knows an antCan t Move a rubber tree plant But he s got high hopes So instead of that I spelled it out K E double N E D YJack s the nation s favorite guy Ev ryone wants to back Jack JackJack is on the right track And he s got high hopes When I subsequently encountered Dukakis it seemed highly unlikely that he could be Cahn s or many other folks kind of guy and of course he wasn t particularly Cahn was simply plying his trade I m a songwriter and I play straight down the middle Sinatra asked me to do a lyric for Spiro Agnew so I did Amazingly the guy who wrote Call Me Irresponsible and All the Way insisted that the song he wrote to mark Ed Meese s first year as Attorney General was one of his best lyrics ever Perhaps one day the Dick Morrises and Ed Rollinses will find it easier to pick candidates who already have the names of popular songs Watching the shamelessly bogus populist Lamar Lamar Alexander walking across New Hampshire accompanied by campaign workers in immaculately pressed plaid shirts they d clearly changed into in the men s room at Manchester airport you began to wonder if the candidate himself wasn t just Lamar Schmoe who d changed his name just so he could use Alexander s Ragtime Band as his theme song Should all else fail the candidate can always resort to the theme from which on the basis of no scientific evidence is credited with mystical powers to transform any flagging campaign Bob Dole has been using it in his post Dole Man phase In 1980 facing similar difficulties Ted Kennedy switched from Aaron Copland s Fanfare for the Common Man too high toned to Gonna Fly Now the theme from Rocky Ted as the plucky little underdog As we all know he swept to a fantastic victory that November
