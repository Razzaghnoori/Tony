                okay you first   all right um  well basically i think we uh probably pay more out in taxes than we should uh we dont see the sort of feedback that we need from it            um i think the government waste a lot of the money um and spends it on purposes that that the government really shouldnt be spending it on um i dont think that its effectively used   yeah i i agree i dont think its uh effectively used um as far as the amount um   so      im never really sure about the amount because theres so much that needs to happen in this country that isnt happening and that not that the government necessarily should be the agent through which its accomplished but theres a lot of things that are crying out for somebody to do something with and the last fifty years everybody looked to the government for that sort of thing primarily   umhum right   and uh i i agree with you that things are just not used effectively      yeah i think   and we you know people dont want to live within their means weve got huge deficits that doesnt appear to you know nobodys talking about the deficit at all on the current campaigns at all      umhum    right right             and i was amazed in the State of the Union address and Bush i dont think mentioned the D word once the whole time it was amazing and it kept he keeps coming with these spending plans and im like okay where is the money coming from            exactly exactly i mean it they keep on thinking that you know its okay to borrow against the future indefinitely um and they dont realize that once they create these programs   yeah    umhum      you well they have such a hard time killing off a program yeah once once it starts receiving funding it its like yanking wisdom teeth to try and get it uh   right    yeah             killed you know even when and you know i dont know a lot of the things i think the federal government does uh it does very poorly um im kind of a states right person and i think that a lot of of what the federal government could do could be handled uh more efficiently uh on a state level   umhum    umhum   uh you know state to state because the states i think have a better idea of where where they need to spend the money for the kind of population that they have um        and i think the federal government is just too far removed from the the specific situation   yeah yeah   um you know i mean there there are some things that our taxes need to be spent on um at a federal level like national uh defense and uh you know common rule making and things like that      umhum   but i think a lot of it could be handed over to the states you know especially things like welfare and and you know food stamps that kind of programs um so      yeah yeah    and round most of those are state administered arent they      um yes and no um a lot of it you know the states get like matching funds or you know they they get a certain amount of funds that they get to do with as they please but um      umhum    okay      why you know why doesnt the state take in the revenue directly then you know uh kind of eliminating some of those bureaucracy that goes on   right right    right if if yeah it sounds sounds very good and i but i wonder about states like Mississippi and Louisiana that always tend to have and Arkansas and Arkansas significantly with Clinton running but it        states that always seem to have really poor educational systems um and just generally a very very poor economy i mean Louisiana was picking up for a while with the energy boom in the seventies but still their economy never really got off the ground and you know it it i dont know i dont live in Louisiana or any of those states and i dont ever think that i will but so its really none of my business but its like something you know i i its   umhum            i dont know it seems like somehow not enough is being done to educate people there and things like that to to be able to participate with yeah the rest of us in the in the world its just pre elitist but        you know the the rest of us in the country at least      yes oh yeah i agree exactly um   and then i yeah i know theres plenty of people in California here who dont have enough education either i mean you know thats always the a major political football problem in any state the education system      umhum    oh yeah yeah i well i think were seeing a major decline um but      yeah      um im im not sure how that relates directly to taxation um   yeah thats true thats true             uh trying to stay on the topic here         yeah well i dont think it really matters anyway because it you know theyll what they want is natural conversations and i think the topic just to kind of give us a boost in that direction      right    yeah   but getting back to taxes um currently i think the the current system we got isnt really           it it isnt taxing the rich enough essentially um it i think that   hum      people people dont have an idea that the whole were all in this together and in the eighties that wasnt the common theme the common theme was you know get rich quick for a lot of   umhum    right
