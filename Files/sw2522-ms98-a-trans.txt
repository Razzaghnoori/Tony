                okay uh       i think maybe that we could do better with the budget if we didnt buy so much stuff overseas   well i dont know how much that would do for the budget though i mean that has helped the economy as a whole you know American jobs and all but   well then maybe they wouldnt have to take so many taxes out and stuff like that well   yeah if we bought more American stuff i guess thats more American taxes well i guess you know its like your own home budget you know you can either earn more money or you can uh spend less and you know just like you and i have to make choices like that i think the government has to do it too   well i agree i think thats what im trying to say   yeah the question is which which  excuse me thats my little girl which one should they do   spend less i think we  well i think we give too much money away   to   other countries yeah   to other countries   we dont ever get anything from anybody when were having to fight to get money to help us with this war we were just in   well thats thats the thats because were supposed to be the rich ones with all the money to give away   right well its not true though were not anymore   were still we are still the biggest ones as you know as far as how much money weve got in the whole country were still bigger than anybody else   we cant even take care of the people that are hungry and homeless here   yeah thats thats an important thing weve got weve got a lot of people who are getting money the from the government for this that and the other thing   uh i mean   and uh it would probably help if we could figure out how to get them to put money back into the system instead you know you take someone on welfare and you give them a job and theyre paying income taxes all of a sudden youve changed it around and its going in the other direction   but see right right now were having a hard time finding people jobs   yeah   if youre a TI worker you how well you know are you are you a TI worker yeah so am i  so we know you know that times are really tough right now and yet were still sending money here and there i just know it     yes i am umhum   you know its just crazy   yeah   and more and more people without i have several friends without jobs now that in this last riff went out looking for jobs and jobs are really hard to come by now really hard to come by   yeah yeah thats what i dont understand   and thats scary   yeah you wonder you know when is it going to happen to me   thats right its already happened to me once but i was lucky   yeah umhum   and i got to stay in TI but you know not everybodys that lucky anymore   yeah   and theyre and i dont know the welfare system is just so abused   well i i i dont think the problem so much is abuse i think the problem is is just the government is trying to do too much um i mean who where does it say that the governments supposed to be the one to take care of all of the people that are homeless or hungry or et cetera et cetera and and where does it say that that if someone is short that they can go to the government and and get a handout   well i know but then okay but thats here but then other countries are doing it to us   yeah   their when their people are hungry and all theyre asking us for handouts so why shouldnt our own people be able to ask for a handout   umhum yeah   i mean i think we should take care of our own things right here in our own country and then if we have anything left over to share with other countries then maybe we should consider sharing   umhum   but i just dont i think were and then they keep raising the taxes boy ill tell you what i barely make ends meet and they raise taxes and   uhhuh   wages arent going up that much and its hard   no theyre not yeah   i mean you know especially if youre alone its on one salary its terribly hard to pay the bills and pay your house payment and a car payment and insurance is ridiculous   yeah yeah   you know  and   you know i think you know ive got a fairly decent job here at TI but uh when i think of you you go to the the grocery store and you see someone working as a cashier and you think you you know how much a cashier makes and you go how do these people get by   not very much they   because i know how hard it is for me to get by   yep its hard its really hard i   yeah   well uh no i dont know i guess if we had the answers wed       we could save the country but   we could go run for office   yeah  well they all say great things when they run for office   umhum well the thing is um you know whos really in charge of deciding how the money gets spent and and its you know its not the president the president just suggests it the ones who actually you know debate it and decide it is the is the Congress and you know what the Congress is out for theyre theyre going to do whatever it takes to make their voters happy which means bring more jobs and more federal spending to their little area and uh uh and that means every Congressman is sitting there working for money going to his area nobodys working on less money going to his area or on anybody elses area and if you just if you just looked at how much Congress spends on itself its ridiculous   yeah i know that you know and then they cut their defense i im not sure if that was such a great idea that cut us really bad i just i hated to see that     well now the thing is yeah theyre cutting defense which is you know there are people out there working for defense contractors who are losing money but i dont i dont mind because i think you know government is not there to give me a job Government the defense is there to defend our country and they do it for whatever you know they spend whatever money they need to to do that but i dont want them to to break the budget just so that i can have a job i would rather have the the government stable so that i can go get a good job with someone whos not working you know not making defense stuff   well yeah yeah i do but i still hated to see it  i mean one of the reasons i voted for Bush was because   if you know what i mean yeah   Reagan was so defense conscious and we were doing so well and i thought well Bush is going to just carry right on  he didnt  was i surprised i uh   umhum well he didnt have much choice really   well i dont know   yeah but but defense is not the biggest part of the federal budget either the biggest part of the budget are things like Medicare and Social Security and uh   but those are things that we we really need i hate to see the old people that dont have anybody and hey you know there are  people out there that have no family or and they really depend on their Medicare   well umhum yeah umhum   and their Social Security and maybe theyre in a nursing home somewhere and they cut some of this stuff and what happens to them   yeah yeah well you know how fast your TI medical insurance has been going up right   yeah   well just think the federal governments insurance bill has Medicare and thats been going through the roof and thats why federal you know thats thats the biggest increase in federal spending right there   so whats the answer     think we need to figure out a way to uh to make medical care cheaper why is this stuff so expensive why is the cost going up so incredibly fast you know because its its coming out of my paycheck its coming out of your paycheck and its coming out of our taxes too   yes yeah   why why is these hospitals making so much money   isnt it England that has it all state run or something   oh theres a whole lot of countries in Europe that do that Sweden Denmark Norway   but they what is it is it free to the people to people or how do they work that   its its free for everybody     in the state or the country   everybody in the country like i i lived in Denmark for a couple of years   uhhuh   and medical care there is free you just go and say i want your help and theyll help you theres couple of things though first of all its not as high a quality as we expect here because its paid for by the government instead of by us and second um your taxes are a lot higher   oh okay   an awful lot higher were talking fifty percent something like that   so they are paying for it okay well the way i you know it was talked about   they are paying for it and and the and the just the quality of care is not as good either   well then thats not the answer   there has got to be a middle ground i think Canadas got a good answer but i dont know many details about it   yeah what do they do   its its some sort of government program ive heard a lot of people say good things about it but i just dont know the details on it   oh okay i dont know i dont know if anything will ever happen to to change change change things i i guess its going to have to change   well somethings going to have to change but you look at the Congress and you look how many of them get reelected and theyre the ones that have got to make the changes i mean i dont see anything changing because youve got the same old people in there   and the other thing that concerns me terribly is automobile insurance now i dont know how much longer im going to be able to afford it at all   yeah   its eating me alive because i i might be almost fifty but im single and i dont think and this companys that just because and i own my own home and i have a garage  and because im single theres companies that wont take me no matter how old you are   single yeah   they wont take you because they say youre a risk you go out and party i said i dont even drink i mean i dont even go out but they wont take you i mean i was turned down this year   hum   by an agent who represented im not sure of the companies he represented but i was told because youre single they absolutely wont take you i said that is thats prejudicial thats terrible whats going to happen if they all start doing this   umhum yeah umhum whats really terrible is they can do this to you you know and you dont really have that much of a choice as to whether or not you take it because the government government says if youre going to drive a car youve got to have the insurance   but yet theyre not helping us with the companies   theyre theyre not helping you uh be able to afford the insurance that theyre making you buy   thats right
