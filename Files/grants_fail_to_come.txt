 Legal Aid forced to raise rates Hoped for grants fail to come through for busy firm Mon June 10 2002 By TIM GURRISTER Standard Examiner staff OGDEN For most lawyers full waiting rooms and appointments booked out to mid July would equate to a lucrative law practice But Frank Smith drives a 6 year old car with 140 000 miles on it and paying his senior paralegal minimum wage the last few months has put him in the red Hoped for federal grants haven t come through so he s had to raise his rates As of last week he charges 50 an hour minimum instead of 25 for the services of his yearling Northern Utah Legal Aid Foundation That s in a lawyer s market where fees range in the 150 to 250 an hour range in the Ogden area and up to 400 an hour in the Salt Lake area Smith s one lawyer foundation basically helps the folks who have too much money to qualify for the federally funded Utah Legal Services but not enough money to afford a lawyer Public interest law It s public interest law Smith said I wouldn t be doing it if I didn t enjoy it You can take a case just on its merits It s very personally satisfying to do good legal work without having to worry about getting paid That s a luxury lawyers don t usually have Smith headed the Ogden office of Utah Legal Services for nine years leaving about a year ago over a dispute with management in Salt Lake The departure left him free to open his own discount law shop at 2485 Grant Ave His work in progress as he calls it mirrors the no fee legal services guidelines He uses the same federal poverty guidelines to determine his hourly rate which tops out at 87 50 A big part of Smith s clientele comes from referrals from his old job His client base is all referrals since he doesn t advertise If he did advertise his volunteer 45 hours a week office manager Jody Smith no relation says she might kill him Swimming upstream We re swimming upstream big time here she said The office opens at 9 a m and rarely closes before 6 p m with 7 30 the norm and 9 p m not unusual We close when we get to close she said And then he Frank will come in on Saturdays and Sundays to catch up on paperwork My husband Bob is totally supportive or I couldn t do this Pro bono help needed With the 80 000 in grant funds he was trying for Smith had thought of hiring a lawyer and paying Jody Frank Smith won t say it but Jody will mention her disappointment at how few lawyers volunteer to help the foundation by taking some cases pro bono without fee We get a lot of that she said noting that so far only Lavar Bud Stark is pitching in I have not asked other attorneys to handle cases so I haven t been turned down Frank Smith said So I can t say I m disappointed Not yet He s planning to take a formal proposal to one of the monthly meetings of the Weber County Bar Association this summer He ll be asking all the lawyers who refer penniless clients to him to set up a fee schedule like his so he can refer his overflow to them One of the most recent local lawyers to pledge as Jody Smith calls it is Kent Snider He s fabulous Snider says of Frank Smith He s too modest There s a huge need he s trying to fill It s endemic to the entire profession Snider said Basically if you re rich you can hire lawyers and if you re poor you can have one appointed Anything in between you re screwed Basically the general public can t afford appropriate legal services Family law a priority The biggest part of the foundation s work is family law divorce custody child support etc In the midst of his custody fight Chris Barboza Ogden heard about Smith from the friend of a friend two months ago If someone trusts their children with an attorney I ve got to get that attorney he said He d used up 900 on his prior attorney a lot of it blown on four failed attempts to get his exwife served with adoption papers She died before that could happen while hospitalized with a chronic ailment I couldn t get anything done with the other lawyer without more money It was kind of a little miracle that I got hold of Frank Barboza said He didn t sit there rubbing his head wondering what to do like these other lawyers He just said It looks like a tough fight Let s get it on and went right to work Praise for Smith An Ogden man who has been in a custody fight with his ex wife for more than two years over visitation of a 3 year old daughter in Sanpete County he hasn t seen since she was 8 months old also had praise for Smith The man s experience had left him bitter about the legal system since he wasn t able to retain a lawyer A lawyer of any kind would help otherwise they assume you re a deadbeat the man said Smith was able to hook him up with a pro bono lawyer in Sanpete County unable to take the case himself since his range of practice is from Logan to Bountiful He s a good guy He s trying to help a lot of people but he s overwhelmed the Ogden father said Frank was referred to me by the guy who was referred to me by another guy You wonder what you re going to be when you grow up lawyer Smith said Hopefully along the way you find something you enjoy This type of law suits me I don t know why Who knows I just get personal satisfaction out of this
