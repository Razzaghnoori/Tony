                            Individuals within a wild population show remarkably little morphological variation        given the amount of environmental variation they encounter during development and the        amount of genetic variation within the population This phenotypic constancy led to the        proposal that individuals were somehow buffered or canalized against genetic and        environmental variation Waddington  Clearly such a mechanism would have important        evolutionary consequences because natural selection acts upon phenotypic variation within        a population canalization first appears to reduce the evolvability of the trait upon which        it is acting Gibson and Wagner  However canalization also reduces the effects of        new mutations which may be deleterious potentially allowing individuals to store this        genetic variation without suffering the consequences If canalization breaks down due to        genetic or environmental circumstances then the stored genetic variation will be released        providing an additional substrate for natural selection In this way individuals could        potentially undergo large rapid phenotypic changes        Experiments in both         Drosophila and         Arabidopsis have suggested that Hsp heat shock protein  a        member of a family of proteins expressed at high temperatures heat shock may be an        excellent candidate for bringing about canalization Rutherford and Lindquist         Queitsch et al  Several features of Hsp suggest that it is an evolutionary buffer        capable of hiding and then releasing genetic variation  individuals heterozygous for        mutations in         Hsp the gene encoding Hsp show increased levels of morphological        abnormalities  individuals treated with a pharmacological inhibitor of Hsp show        severe morphological abnormalities  the normal function of Hsp is to stabilise the        tertiary structure of signal transduction molecules involved in developmental pathways and         this function may be compromised by environmental factors eg heat shock                    Gene Networks Generate Canalization        Hsp may not however be uniquely placed to act as an evolutionary buffer producing        canalization Recent theoretical work has suggested that canalization may be an emergent        property of complex gene networks and may not require specific mechanisms of protein        stabilisation and environmental coupling such as those provided by Hsp Siegal and        Bergman  Siegal and Bergman  proposed that when a network is compromised by        knocking out one of several genes buffering may be lost or compromised releasing        variation that was hidden in the intact network To test this Bergman and Siegal         used numerical simulations of a complex network of ten genes in which each gene is capable        of influencing the expression of other genes as well as itself Figure A This network        essentially defines the genotype of the individuals within the population and the amount        of gene expression at equilibrium defines the phenotype Comparison of populations founded        by either wildtype individuals or those with a single gene knockout revealed much higher        levels of phenotypic variation in populations derived from the knockouts        Thus populations derived from knockouts express phenotypic variation that was not        expressed by the wildtype network suggesting that any of the genes within the network may        buffer genetic variation This suggests that at least one aspect of generating evolutionary        buffering is not unique to Hsp But can genes that unlike Hsp are not conditional        upon the environment act as evolutionary buffers To test this Bergman and Siegal         simulated a gene network that incorporated a mutation process in which single genes may be        knocked out and then at a later time restored The simulated populations were allowed        to evolve whilst being selected for an optimum phenotype ie the populations were        exposed to an environment in which a particular phenotype was optimal A new optimum        phenotype was then specified in which the expression of three of the ten network genes        changed from on to off or vice versa ie there was a shift in the environmental        conditions favouring a different phenotype Populations evolving with the mutation process        reached the new optimum before populations without the mutation process Thus the        knockout mutations were clearly beneficial because they sped up adaptation to a new        phenotypic optimum by releasing hidden genetic variation thereby providing a new substrate        upon which natural selection may act Yet these mutations were not coupled to the new        environment suggesting that the release of the hidden genetic variation does not have to        be linked to an environmental change in order to be beneficial        The simulations described by Bergman and Siegal  suggest that the key properties        of an evolutionary buffer the ability to store and then release genetic variation in        response to environmental or genetic change are not unique to Hsp Indeed the        simulations suggest that evolutionary buffering may be a widespread property of gene        networks They also suggest that the hidden genetic variation does not have to be revealed        by an environmental change but can be produced by a gene knockout These results may go        some way to explain the original observation by Waddington  of phenotypic constancy        yet many questions remain Stearns  One of the major outstanding questions must be        whether it is possible to verify these results experimentally Bergman and Siegal         used data from the yeast         Sacchromyces cerevisiae  in which each gene may be knocked        out in turn and the expression of the remaining genes determined to demonstrate that        their simulations also had application to biological gene networks Using these data they        showed that knockouts show greater variability in gene expression than wildtype yeast        suggesting that buffering has been disrupted                    Ion Channels as Evolutionary Buffers        Given the results of Bergman and Siegal  it should be possible to find gene        networks in which the elimination of single genes reveals variation in gene expression and        hence in phenotype One class of gene network that may conform to the structure outlined by        Bergman and Siegal  is that of the gene networks regulating ion channel expression in        neurons Neurons contain an array of voltagedependent Na         and K         channels as well as numerous Cl          Ca          and voltageindependent leak channels The electrical properties of        a single neuron are dependent though not exclusively upon the suite of ion channels        expressed within that neuron The properties of a neural network which generates        behaviour are determined both by the intrinsic expression patterns of ion channels within        neurons and the connectivity between neurons The nervous system develops as an interaction        between experience and genetically programmed events One mechanism by which this        interaction is achieved is ion channel compensation Turrigiano  individual neurons        can change their sensitivity to inputs by altering the relative proportion of ion channels        enabling them to maintain stable properties in the face of changing experience Turrigiano        et al  Brickley et al  Maclean et al  Niven et al a Figure        B        Many studies of ion channel knockouts show relatively little change in overall        neuronal activity although predictions based upon pharmacological blockade of the ion        channels suggest there should be a more severe phenotypic change Marder and Prinz         Subsequent work has shown that the loss of an ion channel may often be compensated by a        change in the expression of other ion channels For example the neurons upon which I work        are         Drosophila photoreceptors In these neurons loss of the one        particular ion channel leads to compensatory changes in other ion channels linked to the        activity of the neuron to restore the ability to process visual information Niven et al        a b However these changes do not restore the original phenotype completely and        the compensated photoreceptors still show a reduced ability to process visual information        In many neurons it appears that the intracellular Ca         concentration acts as an internal sensor of neural activity Marder        and Prinz  Ca          along with other second messengers may influence the expression of        genes encoding ion channels allowing their expression to be coupled to neural activity        Berridge  Figure B and C Additionally activityindependent mechanisms of ion        channel compensation have been described in which the expression of one ion channel is        linked to the expression of other opposing ion channels within a neuron Maclean et al         These two systems of activitydependent and activityindependent ion channel        compensation bear a close resemblance to the gene network simulated by Bergman and Siegal         in which each gene regulates its own expression and that of other network genes        It is possible therefore that the networks of genes regulating ion channel expression        may act as evolutionary buffers The relationship between neural activity and the network        of ion channel encoding genes may stabilise the neural activity in relation to both the        genetic and environmental variation The stabilisation of neural activity may have        consequences for the generation of adaptive behaviour which is constructed from neural        activity It is possible that ion channels could canalize the evolution of the nervous        system by reducing behavioural variation and therefore removing the substrate on which        natural selection may act For example changes in voltagedependent Na         channel properties such as the activation voltage may be compensated        for by regulating the expression of other ion channels Knockout of one of these        compensating ion channels may reveal the change in voltagedependent Na         channel properties resulting in a shift in the output of the neuron        This hypothesis has several testable predictions For example knocking out an ion        channel should increase the variation in the activity of particular neurons among        individuals in a population This variation in neural activity may produce an effect on the        behaviour of the whole organism        Studying canalization in ion channel gene networks may have significant advantages over        studying developmental gene networks because it is relatively straightforward to measure        the amounts of ion channels expressed in single identified neurons to alter the expression        of individual ion channels and to relate these alterations to behaviour I am currently        pursuing the impact of ion channel compensation in         Drosophila photoreceptors Niven et al a b c In        this system changes in ion channel expression produce changes in the coding of visual        information which may lead to behavioural differences The possible role of ion channel        compensation in canalizing the evolution of the nervous system may have important        implications not just for understanding this system but also for understanding the        contribution of ion channel compensation to the function of the nervous system and its        evolution
