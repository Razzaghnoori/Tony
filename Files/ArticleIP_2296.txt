 Here s an Idea Talk to a Democratic pollster or consultant these days and you re likely to hear a lament about the shortage of politically potent ideas Looking toward the midterm election in 1998 President Clinton and his party have no rabble rousing answer to the Republican promise of sweeping tax overhaul Sure they can point out that the most familiar conservative proposal Dick Armey s Flat Tax is a hoax It would produce a huge revenue shortfall for the government and or a big tax hike for the middle class But you can t beat a horse with no horse Republicans have on their side populist ire against the IRS lobbyists lawyers and accountants And filing your return on a postcard or not having to file one at all is a pretty appealing notion In fact there s a perfect Democratic answer to Armey s tax reform It s called tax reform good tax reform The shared idea of both kinds of tax reform is cleaning the Augean stables of the tax code You make everyone s life simpler and you get lower rates by getting rid of loopholes and making the law neutral among different kinds of income you promote economic efficiency Resources go where the invisible hand directs them not where they can get the most favorable tax treatment Under the reform championed by Bill Bradley which passed in 1986 the corporate rate dropped from 48 percent to 34 percent For individuals 14 brackets and a top rate of 50 percent shrank into three brackets and a top rate of 28 percent But the 1986 tax reform has been gradually undone by three intervening budget bills in 90 93 and 97 Preferences have crept back in shelters are returning see Slate s do it yourself tax shelter and figuring out your taxes is more complicated than ever Yet for some reason the only major politician who has tried to latch onto the issue is Richard Gephardt Gephardt who was a sponsor of tax reform in the 1980s the original bill was known as Bradley Gephardt has proposed to do it again He points out that higher tax rates for higher incomes aren t what make the tax code complicated You can get 99 percent of the flat tax s simplicity without giving up the principle of progressivity Gephardt s version of tax reform would make the code more progressive A basic rate of 10 percent would cover 75 percent of taxpayers Four other rates ranging up to 34 percent would cover the rest Gephardt would get rid of all deductions except those for home mortgage interest charitable contributions and state and local taxes Some version of this idea ought to be a natural for Clinton As he made clear in an interview with the New York Times last week he s fishing around for a tax proposal to include in his January State of the Union address Unfortunately the reports trickling out suggest that he is likely to suggest some modest tinkering a small tax rebate paid for by possible future budget surpluses or more targeted incentives to promote the right kind of investment Clinton seems to have no interest in bold and sweeping tax reform Why not The most common explanations you hear are 1 Dick Gephardt 2 Bob Rubin and 3 the interest groups The Gephardt theory is based on political rivalry Clinton and Al Gore don t want to be accused of copyright infringement Under the most Machiavellian theory the election of a Democratic Congress in 1998 would be bad for Gore since he would have to run against Speaker Gephardt in 2000 This supposedly makes Clinton want to avoid excessively good ideas until after the midterm election The Rubin theory is that the Treasury secretary has persuaded everyone to let well enough alone With the economy swimming along so nicely why meddle The last theory the most malignant is that the Democrats are too much in the thrall of interest groups and fat cat campaign contributors to assault their cherished tax preferences None of these explanations fully adds up In politics plagiarism is not only legal but also often effective If Gore and Gephardt were both for tax reform Gephardt would lose his best issue I thought of it first is a pretty weak line in a debate The Rubin argument may have a little more substance Tinkering with the tax code is always hazardous When lobbyists see the hood open they all come running with their monkey wrenches you never know what may get fixed But that s a better argument against the grab bag of breaks that Clinton is likely to propose which will encourage special pleading than it is against sweeping reform The power of moneyed interests doesn t explain much either All the industries that benefit most from tax loopholes real estate oil and gas finance give much more money to Republicans Only the unions worried about the deduction for employer paid health care cut much sway with Democrats A better explanation for the failure to jump aboard tax reform is the wider political predicament of liberals In the present climate it is nearly impossible to spend money on new spending programs But it is sometimes possible to disguise spending programs as tax breaks Of course a dollar of government revenue lost to an investment tax credit is a dollar added to the national debt as surely as a dollar spent on food stamps In fact the cost is usually higher since indirect incentives tend to be less efficient than direct expenditures But Republicans tolerate government by incentive so Democrats rely on it A clean tax code would foreclose this dodge Since he was a governor Bill Clinton has recognized the tax code as an excellent hiding place for social policy If he has any appreciation of the economic value of tax neutrality or of the political appeal of simplicity he has never shown it In the 1992 campaign Clinton proposed not only higher rates on the rich and a new business tax to support worker training but also augmented research and development credits a long term capital gains exclusion and various other bounties intended to support education and the environment Although Clinton s 1993 budget plan indisputably strengthened the economy by reducing the budget deficit it truly undid tax reform It turned four rates into six and created a powerful bias in favor of capital gains vs ordinary income In 1997 Clinton drove dozens of nails into the coffin The bill he signed created six different capital gains rates two kinds of IRAs and so on Many of these were actually Republican initiatives pushed by the very politicians out there denouncing the complex tax code and demanding a flat no loopholes system The president obviously isn t an economic purist But you still have to wonder how such a smart policy wonk can fail to be bothered by the perversities and complications of the tax code The only other explanation is something we learned about Clinton during all that Whitewater business Hillary does the taxes
