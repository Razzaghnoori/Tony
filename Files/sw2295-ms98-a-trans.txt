 all right well on this subject i really hadn t had to deal with putting someone in there yet but my mother s always been administrator of a nursing home so i ve always been involved you know in one uh huh how do you feel about them i mean since you ve kind of been close to that well i ve yes well i can kind of see both sides you know i really can um nursing homes to me i i would personally be the last resort you know i really you know if i had to put someone in there uh huh well i ve had a touch of experience my um dad had emphysema and got to the point where mother couldn t take care of him yeah if it s a have to thing yeah i yeah and uh she put him in but he wasn t there very long before he died but uh huh um i guess um the one time that i saw him there you know as far as the surroundings that seemed okay uh huh but um we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted to give him some medication to sort of you know keep him real out of it all the time and that s always kind of bothered me yeah uh huh yeah well i kind of think that s true too i guess because it s so under staffed you know um hum that s like everything else though i have a sister in law who runs a nursing home but i ve never actually been there and i know that she s the kind of person who wouldn t allow you know a lot of the horror things to take place that you hear about uh huh yeah yes but yeah but still i m sure there are you know aspects to it that aren t really desirable yeah yeah i know because i ve always well my sister s involved in one also and i really think they really do a wonderful job but still there s those little things that happens you know there really is which i think it s a wonderful place you know if it comes to that yeah you know if you just can t take care of them any more well sometimes you don t have any other alternative after all family and friends are usually well family s tied up with uh huh that s it yeah uh huh their own lives and things and usually working and other things yeah yeah yeah but i think when the time comes i i hope to have the time to really look around you know and pick one that i really think my mother would be happy at it s hard to yes um hum i think that s important too in fact there s a not just i do too outside s awful deceiving sometimes yes you know there s one uh close to where my mother is but in order to get in you have to be able to um walk in on your own in other words you can t be in you know too bad a shape to start out with but then if you deteriorate um yeah yeah they have a separate section for those who need care you know all the time cares yeah yeah but it s always well and they have a long waiting list too so there s always this feeling of well golly gee you know you ve got to be able to walk in the door so you can t wait until you re too bad off off yeah but then you don t want to go do that when you don t have to because like uh you have to give up your automobile or whatever to oh um hum and everything you worked for so hard for all your life yeah yeah and if you re still capable of driving and doing those things then you feel like well gee i m you know i m isolating myself here for no reason at the moment uh huh uh huh so it s kind of a that s a hard one but it is a very nice nursing home now there is some really nice ones there s also you know some private ones you know um hum but of course i would never be able to afford to put my parents in something like that you know that s way out of my reach yeah that s the problem the expense of it all is and uh what i another thing i hate to see is when someone has a small amount of money and they go into one of these places and they just eat it all up immediately uh huh yeah oh yeah yeah but those who don t have money can go in and get the same care uh huh the very same yeah yeah you know so i don t like that aspect yeah but i there s i think there s ways around it though that you know like they could put it in one of their children s names or something yeah you know but still a lot of them doesn t feel comfortable doing that you know it s their money this is that s right you know that s how i feel about it anyway well yeah i ve talked to my mother about that several times lately and i i said i want you to have control of your own business yes yeah but you know what if yeah my mother s seventy now so naturally she s retired but she s still on her own i mean you know yeah yeah my mother s uh seventy five and still has her own home and everything yeah i think that s wonderful i really do just as long as they can and then on the other hand i ve seen some people go into the nursing home and just so happy you know yeah that s true they have a lot of people around to do things with some of those places have wonderful activities and things uh huh they re not lonely you know lots of stuff going on and they ll take them places and oh yes uh huh yeah so i don t know it s not all bad but i guess once you get ill then you know you really no have some problems if you can t get around and do things around yeah but i really don t know what the other solution would be you know i really don t no But no when the time comes i m really hopefully we ll really look around before i decide on one for my parents um hum really do because i have been raised in one you know so there s lot of things i know to look for yeah and i don t think they d want to go where they used to work either you know i really don t it really would yes yeah that might be kind of tough huh yes and like like i said my sister s still in it and i really don t think my mother want to be there either oh well it s been nice talking to you and i guess we d better get back to work huh all right bye bye well you too okay bye
