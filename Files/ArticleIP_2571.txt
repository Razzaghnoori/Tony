 An Exercise in Microwaveconomics After I started living alone many people recommended that I get a microwave oven That I was told would make it easy for me to prepare a meal for myself and save me a lot of time So earlier this year during the post Christmas sales I bought one Ever since I have been wondering how to figure out what it does for me how to do a cost benefit analysis The timesaving business is very tricky For example a frozen chicken potpie would require 60 minutes to thaw and heat in a conventional oven but can be fixed up in 12 minutes in the microwave There s a saving of 48 minutes But the saving is for my kitchen appliances not for me If I use the conventional oven I am not going to spend 60 minutes of my time over it standing next to the oven and waiting for it to finish its job I might spend a few minutes say five putting the potpie in the oven Then while waiting for the cooking to finish I have 55 minutes for myself to read the paper write the Great American Novel or do whatever it is I do with my time Paradoxically the timesaving is more real the smaller the amount of time to be saved For example it takes 12 minutes to heat a frozen pizza in the conventional oven and only four minutes to do it in the microwave The eight extra minutes that I spend waiting for the conventional oven to finish are too few for me to use outside the kitchen If I use the conventional method I am likely to spend eight more minutes in the kitchen than if I use the microwave So by using the microwave I gain eight minutes outside the kitchen What is the value to me of those eight minutes I suppose the conventional answer is to divide my annual earned income by the number of minutes I spend working and so arrive at the income I could gain by having another minute at my disposal In my case this would be a difficult calculation The time I spend working is not only the time I spend sitting at my word processor and writing these essays It also includes all the time I spend musing about these essays while in the shower or on the bus or trying to fall asleep and I have no idea how much time that is in a year Anyway the eight minutes I don t spend in the kitchen will probably not be used to earn more income It will probably be used to lie down listening to music On the other hand the eight minutes I would have had to spend in the kitchen if I didn t have a microwave need not have been entirely valueless I could have listened to music or simply mused about an essay like this one or about something else The basic fact is that at my advanced age the best use of time is staying alive Still the time spent outside the kitchen is probably more valuable than the time spent in the kitchen Thus one benefit of the microwave is the excess of the value of the time spent outside the kitchen over the value of the time spent in the kitchen If I bake two pizzas a week and save eight minutes per pizza that adds up to an excess value of almost 14 hours a year spent outside the kitchen There is for me at least another benefit That is the pleasure of owning operating and observing a high tech instrument That pleasure is independent of any service delivered it is the pure enjoyment of the miracle of technology I first observed this with television It fascinated me like it did many others of my generation even though almost everything we saw on it was terrible We were fascinated by the fact that it worked at all To a large extent the Internet is like that We enjoy surfing the Net just because it is so amazing not because what we learn on it is so valuable There is some of the same satisfaction in watching a microwave at work What is the cost of acquiring these benefits My microwave cost 150 If it lasts for 10 years and the interest I could earn on my money is 5 percent when I bought it I was facing a cost of about 19 a year But once I have bought the microwave the cost of keeping it is much less One of the basic lessons of economics is Bygones are forever bygones What I paid for it is a bygone Now the cost of keeping it depends on what I could sell it for The nuisance of trying to sell it would probably make that not worth my while The best alternative would be to give it to some charitable organization such as the Salvation Army Suppose I give it to them and can take a charitable deduction of 100 That might reduce my taxes by around 50 The cost of keeping my microwave rather than giving it away is the sacrifice of about 6 50 a year plus the sacrifice of the good feeling of having performed a charitable act This costs me 6 50 a year rather than 5 because by not giving away the microwave I am foregoing not only the 50 but also the interest I would have earned on the 50 for 10 years Then as this calculation might be summarized in the microeconomics textbook Value per hour of time spent outside the kitchen X Value per hour of time spent in the kitchen Y Value of the satisfaction of having given a 100 gift to charity Z Annual value of the satisfaction of owning and operating this amazing instrument W Monetary cost of keeping the microwave for a year 6 50 Number of hours per year of release from the kitchen as a result of using the microwave 14 The question is whether X minus Y times 14 plus W exceeds 6 50 plus Z Of course I can t answer this question because I can t measure W X Y or Z in dollars or any other quantity that is common to them all I leave out the further complication of the cost of electricity for the microwave compared with the cost of gas for the oven I live in an apartment building where most of these costs are borne by about 200 other families just as I share in their costs That is what economists call an externality Nevertheless despite all these imponderables I do make a decision I decide to keep and use the microwave In the end if you ask me why I bought a microwave why I keep it and why I use it I can t give a better answer than I like it This is of course an exceedingly trivial case of decision making But much of life is like that personal life business life government life Perhaps it is most like that in government We cannot compare the incomparables and weigh the imponderables We do what we like and when we stop liking it we change As an economist I am bound to insist that economics has its value There are cases especially in business where costs and benefits can be measured in the same units dollars and directly compared Even where that is not true the differences between costs and benefits may be so large that fine calculations are unnecessary Anyway the habit of trying to compare costs and benefits is useful if one does not insist on trying to apply it where it doesn t work After all it was an economist J M Clark who warned against an irrational passion for dispassionate rationality
