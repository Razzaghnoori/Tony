                            When the SARS epidemic showed the first signs of waning the World Health Organization        proclaimed that the turnaround was a testament to the efficient response of health systems        worldwide and justified its decisive action in issuing a global alert        That swift response was partly due to infectious disease experts being able to use        models of disease spread even though SARS was a newly emerging disease to help plan their        next move In fact epidemiologists have used mathematical models to predict and understand        the dynamics of infectious diseases for more than  years The emergence of diseases such        as Ebola SARS and West Nile virus and multidrugresistant malariaas well as the        potential for diseases to be introduced by bioterrorismhas attached even greater        importance to this management tool        Models are used to provide information on such infections and predict the effect of        alternative courses of action In this months         PLoS Medicine  Helen Wearing and colleagues suggest however that many        offtheshelf models are inappropriate for making quantitative predictions because        substantial biases have been introduced by two important yet largely ignored assumptions        The authors warn that if such biases are not corrected health authorities risk making        overly optimistic health policy decisions        They begin with the SEIR class of models in which the host population is classified        according to infectious status ie individuals are susceptible exposed infectious or        recovered This model assumes that the rate of leaving the exposed or infectious class is        constant irrespective of the time already spent in that class Although mathematically        convenient this assumption gives rise to exponentially distributed latent incubation and        infectious periods which is epidemiologically unrealistic for most infections say the        authors who suggest instead that it would more sensible to specify the probability of        leaving a class as a function of the time spent within the class Hence initially the        chance of leaving the class is small but then increases as the mean infectiousincubation        period is reached This assumption would give a more realistic distribution of incubation        and infectious periods        The authors also note another issue that has received surprisingly little attention in        infectious disease models namely the influence of incubation and infectious period        distributions on the invasion dynamics of an infection into a largely susceptible        populationdespite its obvious application to emerging infections and possible deliberate        exposure        The impact of these differences on models could translate into potentially important        public health concerns say the authors They tested their theory by using analytical        methods to show that first ignoring the incubation period or second assuming        exponentially distributed incubation and infectious periods when including the incubation        period always resulted in underestimating the basic reproductive ratio of an infection        from outbreak data They then illustrated these points by fitting epidemic models to data        from an influenza outbreak Their results suggested that within a strict management        setting epidemiological details could make a crucial difference        Although previous studies have shown the importance of using realistic distributions of        incubation and infectious periods in endemic disease models few studies have considered        the effects associated with making predictions for an emerging disease Discrepancies        between estimates of reproductive ratio from exponentially distributed and        gammadistributed fits confirm the need to have precise distributions of incubation and        infectious periods Although such data are available from post hoc analyses of epidemics        they are lacking for novel emerging infections The key point is that uncertainty about        these distributions should be incorporated into models when making quantitative        predictions        The take home message is that when developing models for public health use policy        makers need to pay attention to the intrinsic assumptions within classical models The        authors note that while some practitioners are using their approach most applied        epidemiological studies still use models that incorporate exponentially distributed        incubation and infectious periods the authors hope their work will point to the next steps        in delivering quantitatively accurate epidemiological models
