 Eastern Europe Eight years after the Berlin Wall s collapse how meaningful are the political and economic differences that once divided Eastern and Western Europe Herewith a primer on the transition to democracy and capitalism in the old Soviet bloc and former Soviet Republics Statistics gauging economic change since communism s collapse are deceptive All countries initially foundered Only since 1993 with the onset of widespread privatization of economic activity have most of them grown However even post 1993 averages compiled by the U S Agency for International Development from international lending agency data may be misleading in evaluating economic success Take Albania which averaged 8 4 percent growth during this period and attribute much perhaps all of its measured growth to a massive Ponzi scheme which collapsed this winter bringing down the entire Albanian economy Central Europe Czech Republic 2 7 percent growth measured for all countries as average annual GDP change since 1993 75 percent private sector share of GDP in 1996 Democracy strong free elections successful transfer of power free media Despite economic growth and the lowest unemployment in Eastern Europe

populated section of Romania Poland 5 25 percent growth 60 percent private Democracy strong free elections successful transfer of power no state run media It is considered Eastern Europe s greatest economic success Poland s government privatized more cautiously than Hungary s or the Czech Republic s Western fears about the 1995 election of ex party apparatchik Aleksander Kwasniewski as president displacing Lech Walesa who calls him the red spider have been allayed by Kwasniewski s support for further privatization and his enthusiasm for NATO expansion This summer Poland Hungary and the Czech Republic will probably be invited to join the alliance Amid much protest from the right wing Kwasniewski s government restored the legal rights to abortion and divorce removed by the Walesa government Romania 4 7 percent growth 50 percent private Democracy relatively weak free and fair elections state controlled media Communist Party boss ostensibly a social democrat Ion Iliescu ruled between a mob
