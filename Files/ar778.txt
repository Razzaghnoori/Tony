 Introduction Tumor necrosis factor TNF has been implicated in the development and pathogenicity of infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders such as septic shock arthritis and hypotension 1 2 3 4 It plays a pivotal role in the inflammatory cascade and together with IL 1 and IL 6 has been shown to mediate the acute phase response 5 6 Confirmation of its significance in disease comes from the success of clinical trials using anti TNF therapy to treat rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn s disease 7 8 9 10 Bacterial lipopolysaccharide LPS or endotoxin is found only in Gram negative bacterial cell walls it can on its own induce the acute inflammatory response and the clinical characteristics associated with sepsis After administration of LPS TNF and other inflammatory mediators are released 11 12 Infusion of TNF initiates an inflammatory process leading to a phenotype that is indistinguishable from bacterial sepsis 13 14 Recent work on tristetraprolin TTP has provided a new perspective on the regulation of TNF biosynthesis TTP also referred to as NuP475 TIS11 or GOS24 is a member of the family of zinc finger proteins that was originally identified through genetic screens designed to identify immediate early response genes 15 16 17 18 TTP was shown to be an unusually proline rich protein with a predicted molecular weight of 33 6 kDa Its name derives from the presence of three PPPPG amino acid repeats that are conserved across species There are two Cys Cys Cys His CCCH zinc fingers which are responsible for RNA binding 17 19 There are no studies of the subcellular localization or the regulation of expression of native TTP in freshly isolated cells or tissue Transfection studies using nonhematopoietic cell lines or prolonged cell culture have suggested that TTP is found in both cytoplasm and the nucleus 20 21 22 23 24 A deficiency of TTP is associated with a profound proinflammatory phenotype TTP deficient mice exhibit cachexia with dermatitis medullary and extramedullary hyperplasia erosive polyarthritis and autoimmunity with autoantibodies 25 This phenotype is similar to that observed in mice that overexpress TNF 26 In agreement with these data TTP deficient mice were shown to overproduce TNF and weekly injections of a neutralizing antibody to TNF eliminated the predominant features of this phenotype In addition mice with the double deletion of TTP and TNF receptor TNFR 1 do not manifest the aggressive inflammation observed in TTP deficient mice In contrast mice deficient in TTP and TNFR 2 show a more severe phenotype suggesting a protective role for this receptor 27 The increase in TNF biosynthesis in TTP deficient mice is associated with increased mRNA stability 23 TTP binds to the AU rich element ARE in the 3 untranslated region of TNF mRNA which regulates TNF mRNA turnover in vivo 28 The interaction between TTP TNF and the ARE promotes the turnover of TNF mRNA TTP also regulates the stability of GM CSF granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor mRNA through the ARE and therefore TTP deficiency is associated with increased production of GM CSF and with myeloid hyperplasia This is not a TNF dependent effect since the phenotype is not affected by the removal of either TNFR 1 or 2 or by the addition of TNF antibody 27 Recent studies have suggested a potential interaction between TTP and both IL 3 and IL 8 via the ARE in their mRNA 29 30 All studies of TTP expression to date have relied on transfected cells and cell lines there have been no studies on the localization of expression of human TTP or on its regulation in vivo or in freshly isolated normal cells To examine the kinetic relation between TNF production and TTP expression in models of septic shock we developed an intracellular flow cytometric assay By this method expression of TTP was determined in peripheral blood leukocytes after the response to in vitro stimulation with LPS TTP was initially upregulated in all the cells in response to LPS as shown by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy The contribution of TNF to this LPS induced upregulation was confirmed using a humanized monoclonal antibody to TNF The kinetics of TTP production was also examined in four individuals infused with LPS After in vivo exposure to LPS the initial rise in TTP expression correlated with the plasma TNF level We also observed secondary increases in some individuals without parallel increments in TNF These observations suggest that there are multiple factors involved in the regulation of TTP Materials and methods Generation of antihuman TTP polyclonal antibody A peptide corresponding to the C terminus amino acids 302 328 of human TTP was synthesized purified by HPLC and coupled to KLH keyhole limpet hemocyanin

peptide Specificity in Western blotting and flow cytometry was evaluated by detection of exogenous TTP in transfected 293 cells and by blocking this activity with peptide 24 Generation of TTP vector

NY USA was used in conjunction with an iris setting of 2 5 which allowed for detection of optical sections of the fluorescence image that were approximately 0 5 m thick Representative images were selected from the slices though the center of the cells after sectioning through the entire cell LPS infusion Consenting volunteers were given an intravenous bolus of endotoxin in accordance with a protocol approved by the Institutional and Scientific Review Boards of the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center and Norris Cotton Cancer Center Lebanon NH USA One month before admission and again just before admission the volunteers physical wellbeing and health were assessed and current medications were noted The infusion was conducted in the intensive care unit at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center with continuous supervision for the first 12 hours Blood pressure heart rate and body temperature were evaluated throughout this period Clinical Center reference endotoxin CCRE lot O 133 derived from E coli United States Pharmacopeia Convention Inc Rockville MD USA 32 was injected intravenously at a dose of 4 ng kg Three consecutive baseline blood samples were taken at 15 10 and 5 min

sedimented in dextran extracellularly stained for CD14 and fixed with 1 formaldehyde The cells were stored overnight at 4 C and then stained for intracellular TTP A human TNF ELISA kit R D Systems Minneapolis MN USA was used to determine the concentration of TNF in plasma from peripheral blood in accordance with the manufacturer s instructions The TNF standard was made up as directed to read a maximum concentration of 1000 pg ml and a minimum of 15 6 pg ml Statistical analysis Analysis was by one way analysis of variance ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni adjustment all means comparison test using the Graphpad Prism version 3 00 for Windows Graphpad Software San Diego CA USA Results Optimization and specificity of the TTP polyclonal antibody To determine the optimal working concentration of the TTP antibody 293 cells transfected with TTP were fixed permeabilized and stained at various concentrations of antibody or IgG control There was a concentration dependent increase in fluorescence Fig 1a which was standardized using fluorescent microspheres in order to compare different experiments and cell types 31 The optimum concentration of antibody was determined to be 3 8 g per 5 10 5cells where the intensity curve began to flatten At higher concentrations the MESF value for the control sera increased concordantly indicating nonspecific binding Specificity of the TTP antibody was determined by blocking with the identical peptide sequence used to generate the polyclonal antibody In the presence of blocking TTP peptide at concentrations either 10 or 50 times the amount of TTP antibody used the detection of the TTP protein within the transfected cells was nearly eliminated Fig 1b Confocal sectioning of transfected 293 cells showed that the presence of TTP protein was primarily in the cytoplasmic fraction Fig 1c Z sections taken every 0 5 m through the cell showed little if any TTP within the nucleus In nontransfected 293 cells a small amount of TTP was detected by flow cytometry and confirmed by confocal microscopy Transfected 293 cells expressed nine times as much TTP as the untransfected cells at the optimal working concentration of antibody Preincubation of the nontransfected 293 cells with TTP peptide blocked the activity confirming its identity These results confirmed our previously published data in which Western blot analysis showed that TTP was localized in the cytoplasmic extract of 293 cells 24 Induction of TTP in the THP 1 cell line Since TNF biosynthesis in macrophages is rapidly triggered by treatment with LPS the effects of this endotoxin on TTP expression were examined THP 1 cells a human myelomonocytic cell line were incubated with and without LPS 0 1 g ml for up to 24 hours At representative time points a sample was removed and stained with either anti TTP or the IgG control as described in Materials and methods The addition of LPS rapidly increased the expression of TTP by THP 1 cells Fig 2a Increases in TTP were detectable 1 hour after stimulation and were still evident in the cytosol 4 hours after LPS treatment Analysis of the cells by confocal microscopy Fig 2b confirmed the upregulation and indicated that the TTP was expressed intracellularly relatively homogeneously but confined to the cytoplasm These data show that LPS stimulation rapidly increases human TTP protein expression in the cytoplasm The kinetics of induction by LPS parallels that seen with TTP mRNA in bone marrow derived murine macrophages 23 In vitroTTP induction with LPS in peripheral blood leukocytes Modulation of TTP expression by LPS was subsequently examined in normal peripheral leukocytes Whole blood from eight healthy volunteers was incubated at 37 C alone or with LPS 0 1 g ml for up to 24 hours At periodic time points a sample was taken and leukocytes were purified by dextran sedimentation fixed permeabilized and then stained with either anti TTP or control antibody In leukocytes constitutive expression of TTP ranged from approximately 9 10 3to 35 10 3MESF Monocytes constitutively expressed over three times as much TTP as either lymphocytes or neutrophils Table 1 Stimulation with LPS in vitro produced an increase in TTP expression in all leukocyte subpopulations This was maximal 2 hours after stimulation TTP levels increased to a higher maximal level in monocytes than in other leukocytes 8 5 10 3MESF Fig 3a Two color flow cytometry indicated that CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes expressed equivalent amounts of TTP data not shown The kinetics of TTP induction with LPS was consistent and monophasic in all leukocytes Fig 3i The change in TTP expression was greatest in neutrophils and least in lymphocytes Since lymphocytes lack Toll like receptor 4 and express little or no CD14 33 we conclude that the induction of TTP in these cells was occurring indirectly presumably through stimulation with TNF although other cytokines including IL 1 IL 6 and IL 8 could contribute to this response LPS induced TTP upregulation was confirmed in all cell types by confocal microscopy Analysis confirmed an increase in TTP in neutrophils 2 hours after stimulation Fig 3 Similar data were obtained for lymphocytes and monocytes data not shown Distribution in resting levels and after stimulation with LPS was primarily cytosolic which is in accord with our data for 293 and THP 1 cells Correlation of in vivoTTP production with TNF after LPS bolus To study the kinetics of TTP induction in vivo we infused 4 ng kg of clinical grade endotoxin at time 0 in four volunteers Blood was drawn before the infusion and at specified intervals afterwards and aliquots were analyzed for leukocyte cell counts TTP expression and plasma TNF levels The cell counts of all the leukocyte subpopulations in all the volunteers fell rapidly as seen 1 hour after infusion in all volunteers Fig 4a 4b 4c in concordance with published data 34 35 36 Beyond the 1 hour time point the neutrophil cell count increased reaching a peak at 12 hours It then decreased to baseline values at 24 hours Fig 4a Lymphocyte and monocyte data showed similar initial kinetics The lymphocyte and monocyte curves were biphasic peaking at 4 hours dropping to baseline at 12 hours and beginning a second increase at 48 hours Plasma TNF levels were analyzed throughout the study The circulating TNF level increased to a peak at 2 hours after infusion Fig 4d After 12 hours there was no detectable TNF in any of the four volunteers This monophasic peak was consistent with findings in other studies 37 Analysis of TTP expression in leukocyte populations before and after LPS infusion revealed a biphasic induction with an initial peak occurring within 4 hours and a second after 12 hours Fig 5a 5b 5c Baseline and maximum TTP expression in each cell type for each volunteer is presented in Table 2 The expression and initial upregulation of TTP in response to LPS in all leukocyte populations was consistent with the data found in vitro Neutrophils responded rapidly to LPS infusion reaching an initial peak within an hour of infusion although the average increase in the four volunteers appears to be moderate 50 Analysis of monocytic TTP showed an increase in expression peaking at 2 hours Fig 5b Lymphocyte TTP expression peaked at 4 hours which was later than the initial peak response of neutrophils and monocytes Fig 5c A second more dramatic rise which did not parallel changes in plasma TNF levels Fig 5d was observed 12 hours after infusion in all leukocyte populations TNF contribution in LPS induction of TTP The human in vivo studies described here show increases in circulating plasma TNF that preceded TTP induction in all the leukocyte types investigated This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that LPS mediates induction of TTP through the production of TNF However this hypothesis does not explain the second rise in TTP we observed in vivo which was not associated with TNF To examine this phenomena in more detail THP 1 cells were cultured with LPS or TNF in the presence of blocking TNF antibody The antibody sequesters TNF in the supernatant preventing its interaction with TNF receptors LPS induced greater TTP expression than TNF Fig 6a 6b When THP 1 cells were stimulated with LPS in the presence of the blocking TNF antibody the TTP response was reduced but not eliminated Fig 6a In fact the initial induction of TTP detectable during the first hour was unaffected suggesting that TNF was not solely responsible for the LPS induced rise In contrast TNF induction of TTP by THP 1 cells was completely blocked in the presence of the blocking TNF antibody Fig 6b Discussion This study is the first to evaluate the expression and regulation of endogenous human TTP in myeloid and lymphoid cells It is the first to examine the subcellular localization of native TTP protein in freshly isolated cells since all previous studies relied on prolonged cell culture or transfection overexpression approaches using cell lines 20 21 22 24 25 We show that endogenous human TTP is expressed in neutrophils lymphocytes and monocytes They are significant in their demonstration that native human TTP is totally cytoplasmic there was little evidence of nuclear localization in these studies an observation that is consistent with previous work with human TTP in which immunoblotting showed cytoplasmic localization 24 The discrepancy between our findings and findings of nuclear localization of TTP may be due to several factors 20 21 22 24 25 First most of those studies did not measure endogenous TTP but usually relied on transfection of cell lines perhaps resulting in mislocalization due to the presence of an epitope tag or overexpression 20 21 22 24 25 Second by definition those cells were largely cycling and thus were not representative of normal hematopoietic cells Third mouse or rat TTP was used in those studies 20 21 22 25 Although highly conserved it is possible that human TTP is subtly different from rodent TTP We think this unlikely as immunoprecipitation studies of bone marrow derived murine macrophages show murine TTP predominantly in the cytoplasmic fraction 23 This matter requires further analysis once improved antibodies to murine TTP are generated Our studies clearly showed human TTP in lymphocytes and neutrophils in addition to monocytes Early work by Carballo and colleagues 38 showed the importance of macrophages not lymphocytes in the development of the phenotype associated with TTP deficiency This highlights the importance of macrophages in the production of TNF supported by current hypotheses on the pivotal role of this cell type in TNF overproduction in autoimmune diseases 39 Thus our findings suggest that TTP serves an entirely different role in other leukocytes relative to their role in regulating cytokine production by macrophages and that TNF production is not simply regulated by TTP Despite these potential differences in the function of human TTP based on cell type our studies show a common pattern of induction by LPS in monocytes neutrophils and lymphocytes The upregulation of human TTP occurs rapidly within the first hour of stimulation This is consistent with murine data demonstrating that upregulation occurs within 30 min of LPS stimulation remaining high for 4 hours 23 Using confocal imaging we found TTP was primarily detected in the cytoplasmic fraction confirming our earlier immunoblotting studies 24 LPS stimulation of peripheral blood leukocytes in vitro revealed TTP induction kinetics analogous to that observed for THP 1 cells We used a whole blood assay since the cytokines produced after in vitro incubation with LPS are analogous to those produced after in vivo infusion providing an important model of sepsis 40 Baseline expression of TTP was higher in monocytes than in either lymphocytes or neutrophils Lymphocytes responded the least to LPS stimulation whereas monocytes responded the most Monocytes were not followed beyond 4 hours after stimulation with LPS because of the low numbers of cells retrieved probably due to upregulation of adhesion molecules ICAM 1 41 The induction of TTP expression by either LPS or TNF has not been studied in an in vivo system before In this study four human volunteers were infused with LPS and the subsequent changes in leukocyte cell count TTP expression in leukocyte subpopulations and levels of TNF were followed over a 72 hour period Although there was some individual variability in the overall kinetics basal levels and the initial induction of TTP by LPS were within the range observed in vitro Tables 1and 2 All cell types showed an increase in TTP expression within the first hour Interestingly TTP was induced by LPS in vivo more slowly after 4 hours vs 1 2 hours and to a lesser degree in the lymphocyte population than in neutrophils or monocytes The absence of LPS signal transducers CD14 Toll like receptor 4 on most lymphocytes relative to monocytes and neutrophils may account for this altered expression 42 43 Since lymphocytes express TNF receptors and TNF itself can induce TTP mRNA expression 38 these data are consistent with the interpretation that TTP induction in lymphocytes is transduced not by LPS binding but by TNF produced by monocytes and or neutrophils acting on lymphocytes The initial fall in leukocyte cell count observed in vivo is in accord with published data 34 35 36 The numbers of monocytes and neutrophils dropped within the first hour by approximately 98 and 76 respectively and of lymphocytes by 80 after 4 hours This decrease is consistent with data suggesting that the reduction in leukocytes results from a decrease in granulocytes and monocytes as they become activated migrating and adhering to vascular endothelium 44 This drop in cell numbers was followed by an increase in all leukocyte populations beginning at 12 hours and continuing through the 72 hour time point This raises the issue of whether the apparent changes in TTP expression were due in part to differential rates of margination by leukocyte subpopulations Since the levels of TTP induction seen in the first hour in vivo approximate those seen in vitro we believe that this induction reflects the increased synthesis and expression of TTP by all leukocyte subpopulations and is consistent with the kinetics of their mRNA induction 23 TTP and TNF are reportedly involved in a negative feedback loop in which increases in TNF concentration are associated with induction of TTP 23 In these studies LPS which induces the release of TNF 45 produced a rise in TTP within 4 hours of stimulation Although the initial rise in TTP in vivo paralleled a rapid and considerable increase in plasma TNF the second late increases in intracellular TTP did not reflect TNF levels This change may have been mediated by other cytokines IL 1 IL 8 whose levels have been shown to increase with kinetics that parallel this rise in TTP 40 46 47 Alternatively the late rise in cytoplasmic TTP may be due to release from the bone marrow of leukocytes that have high levels of TTP or an adaptive response to endotoxemia TNF overproduction mediates both sepsis and chronic inflammatory disorders such as RA Its production may be modulated at transcriptional post transcriptional and post translational levels 48 49 50 Many of the effects observed after LPS stimulation can be attributed to subsequent production of TNF Moreover infusion of TNF initiates inflammatory processes with a resulting phenotype that is indistinguishable from bacterial sepsis 13 14 We investigated the contribution of TNF in the LPS mediated induction of TTP in THP 1 cells using a blocking TNF antibody TNF induction of TTP expression was almost completely eliminated by incubation with the TNF inhibitor proving the direct effect of TNF on TTP induction LPS however induced much greater levels of TTP in THP 1 cells than TNF did In the presence of blocking TNF antibody LPS induction of TTP was initially unaffected but began to decline after 1 hour suggesting that LPS itself may mediate the initial increases in TTP and showing that the prolonged induction of TTP is dependent on TNF Conclusion We have shown through an intracellular staining assay that human TTP expression is modulated by LPS and TNF LPS induction of TTP was partly dependent on the production of TNF The ability of LPS to induce TTP independently of TNF may account for the earlier response observed in neutrophils and monocytes that have LPS signaling transduction molecules In contrast lymphocytes demonstrate a delayed and lower TTP response and are probably responding to TNF or other cytokines produced by myeloid cells In addition a second rise in TTP expression was observed in vivo which did not correlate with any detectable rise in TNF concentration implying that there are additional factors involved in the regulation of this intracellular protein TNF is a predominant proinflammatory cytokine particularly in sepsis and chronic inflammatory disorders suggesting that the role of its negative regulator TTP may be of functional importance in the development and pathogenesis of disease Investigating any potential abnormalities in expression or regulation may prove to be a valuable therapeutic intervention
