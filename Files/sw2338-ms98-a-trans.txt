 hi right oh me i m in favor of it you are yeah i thought i think if uh people like Charles Manson right the the heinous crimes uh even if it s one time offense yeah the the i mean people like that are crazy i did a study on it though when i was in high school it was one of these things we had to pick a topic to to investigate and at that time i don t think it s like that any more but at that time uh it was very unfair capital punishment was a lot more common and if you tended and it tended to be that if you were ignorant or if you were a foreigner or if you were black or any minority for that matter the chances your chances of of uh getting the death penalty were you know like hundreds of times greater than if you could just communicate well i mean you didn t have to be um you didn t even necessarily have to be white but if you could just communicate and you could come across in the court room with some kind of um you know sense about you then even if you did the exact same crime chances are you wouldn t get you d get life instead of the death penalty as a opposed to somebody who couldn t communicate well and at that time it just seemed so fair unfair that um i i felt like i couldn t uh um you know i just didn t agree with it yeah it s gotten so though that there are so many you know there are so many uh i don t know what you call it uh so many different things that you have to go through before they actually give the death penalty that i m not so sure it it seems a lot fairer than it used to be yeah well i know that that um like they can hold it off for years by uh i m trying to think of the word that you were um retrials and um right right i m forget i cannot think of that word right i know what you re saying um but yeah they there s you know there s always uh uh you know and and in a way you know i guess that s good i mean if you re going to if you re going to kill somebody you have to make sure they re guilty right yeah you know give them give them i mean you should give somebody every every chance even even if it seems obvious yeah um i don t know what the what the law is like in Texas i mean i certainly haven t heard anything any anything about somebody being executed or anything uh huh yeah well i think it s all uh i don t think they have uh execution here i don t i don t either i do know though it s easy to get put in jail for life yeah well you know the um there was something on TV last night about how one state what there was a newspaper in no it was a TV station TV station you did you see that yeah he s they re wanting to record a gas chamber i thought that was disgusting i mean well it might scare some people off of doing the crimes well yeah but you know there there are so many people who just get get their jollies off of watching that you know yeah i yeah i agree with you there too and that s what that s what really bothers me you know i m all for deterrents but i i think what s going to happen is it s going to turn it into a circus yeah well i ll agree with you there i don t agree with them showing it on television hard telling who would see it and no but i i do think that it would scare some people from doing things you know they ll think about this and say hey i don t think so right sure well where i could see it being very useful is for you know when if there s a first time offender part of his punishment is that he s got to see what you know what he s up against yeah you know what what you know what might happen but the you know for TV station you know that TV station isn t going to want to restrict how they use it and they re going to show it on the six o clock well probably not the six o clock news but they ll show it on the eleven o clock eleven o clock news and i don t you know i ve got a ten year old and you know she s she could very well be up at that time yeah you know when we re and that s just not the kind of thing for a ten year old i m not sure it s the kind of thing for a sixteen year old yeah that s i don t think it s the kind of thing for anybody i know i wouldn t be able to watch it right right and i m i m supposed to be an adult right and in fact i think it d be harmful if my if you know if my daughter or my any of my kids saw it so that has to be brought into the picture too you know you just can t blatantly say let s let s show it and and the the right people will see it and it ll deter them from committing a crime all lot of the wrong people are going to see it too and uh yeah well there s more wrong people that would see it than right people yeah yeah uh you know uh but i i i don t know i think i would say that if they put it where those first time offenders of uh your sex crimes and murderers uh show them what would happen right now my aunt had a thing when i was younger and uh you know i was working with her and she would say that they should uh for men who did sex crimes they should take off a piece of his body and the most important part to a man and inch by inch yeah right yeah my wife says that all the time yeah well that that would certainly do it that would stop them from wanting to no well i thought it was funny listening to her she s just a she s she s a little bit uh dingy when it comes to things but well she s vicious yeah well you know i i think that if if i felt like the the the system was was truly fair and and uh and that they would never make a mistake then you know but you hear you know you hear about people who are who are genuinely mistakenly accused of a crime and yeah like that Lionel something or another that black boy of they had a television program about him two hour movie yeah can t think of his name i can t i can t think either but he spent quite a few few quite a while in jail yeah right that s right and and it turns out he didn t do it yeah or you know and and it s easy you know and and you know let s face it not all policemen are honest and well you see that on television also that s right and and you know they can they ll take somebody who maybe is mentally retarded and then it s and they re under pressure to to solve a crime and some and the circumstances uh may be molded to blame somebody who didn t do it and especially if it s you know somebody who s mentally retarded who can t defend themselves very well and i d hate to see them get the ultimate punishment and it turns out it wasn t them yeah that s a problem with capital punishment though but when you got people that you know uh for some reason or another Charles Manson sticks in my brain right yeah yeah well he was a i seen him on an interview talking about how if he ever got out how many people he was going to kill yeah sheesh and uh that s a man that should be put to death and uh it it it just doesn t seem right that our tax money or somebody s tax money goes to keep him alive yeah you know he gets three meals a day and and he probably that s more than some of the people out here who are out and out honest right right that s right and he s probably living a lot better than some people who deserve a lot more and uh that does you know that does sort of you know but how you know it s just so hard it s just so hard to to be fair and uh yeah i guess i wouldn t i wouldn t mind if all of a sudden he didn t exist any more uh i uh i don t think anyone would miss him either no no uh i you know i i think the same thing about people like Saddam Hussein yeah you know you know the jeez you know they re just they re just the scum of the earth and uh i just hate the idea that my tax money might go to support somebody like that well as you can tell my two decided to come in here uh now where where where area where are you from what i m in Denison Denison oh okay every so often you get somebody who s in in uh California or or New York something yeah i got some guy from San Francisco one night yeah yeah uh no you is talking about Saddam Hussein yeah i think it would be wrong for us to kill him for the Americans to kill him i think you re right i don t think we re i think we re we d we d overstep our bounds if we went in and did that i think the though it s awfully tempting now if one of the Kurds i m sure you know who they are yep if they went in and got him he wouldn t be a martyr what s the word martyr martyr martyr martyr yeah yeah i could see the word in my head i just couldn t pronounce it yeah uh but if we did it oh man oh yeah the whole they d have him on a pedestal well right now we re in a delicate situation because we ve got this we ve for the first time we re sort of aligned with a lot of these Arab countries yeah that s what my husband keeps telling me see how you know um i m just now getting into the world politics and all that yeah uh i guess i just too young to understand this or something oh sure uh but uh it s complicated yeah well it s getting easier to understand though you know plus my husband he was in the Navy for ten years so he uh when it comes to the military he kind of knows what he s talking about oh right i don t put every a hundred percent stock into what he says but i ll listen and agree with what i think sounds right right right yeah there and you know he s got that delicate balance right there and we d just be overstepping our bounds i think if we walked in and sort of took over yeah well i think they uh the people there will take care of him now yeah i just can t imagine that they d let him rule any longer you know if if they had you know if they could do something about it i mean his own army is going to eventually turn on him because and and you see this has happened before in history you know that it just gets to a certain point where you re just not willing
