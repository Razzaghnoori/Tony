          Wayne ive uh feel very strongly about parents doing things with their children and making time available even sometimes when time isnt available how do you feel about it   well yeah i feel much the same way ive uh two kids right now one is two and a half and ones nine months and uh   yeah   that age of course everything you do theyre trying to learn to do and so uh its important for you to spend time doing the things that you want them to learn you know that that they need to learn at the age you know   yeah   reading and uh reading and playing nice with others and that sort of thing   yeah we went through this with our children and now with our grandchildren and ive always tried to do things with them uh like when youre at the little league helping out even though im not a good athlete myself i was able to help the coach in in just controlling the kids if nothing else and weve always uh oh tried to take our children and now now at this age our grandchildren to see and do things that otherwise they might not be able to i think thats just part of their overall educational process is to get out and see and do things   right uhhuh   yeah yeah so its uh we have uh lived several places around the the US and we have where weve lived weve taken them to see and do things of interest and of historical significance in the area like when we lived in Tennessee we we took them to Washington DC to see all the capitol and and things like that when they were small and that just uh it helps i think the children to when theyre learning in school to say well ive been there and ive seen that   right uhhuh   yeah yeah so uh thats the type   yeah it certainly does because uh you know the things in the books seem so dead to the kids and you know unless theyve actually been there or whatever because i remember our family well we went we went everywhere and uh uh seeing New England and uh being on Plymouth Rock and stuff like that was uh   yeah   really made the whole thing more uh visual and you could uh read the things in the history books and understand what they said when it was like we need food we need to raise food quickly because this this place gets very cold very soon   yes yeah   yeah       yeah weve uh gone through that uh i remember my parents didnt do all those type things and so i made a special effort with my children to do things like that and even now with my grandchildren i feel its a very important thing to be done   right because if uh kids dont look up to you or or cant cant feel they can spend time with you theyre going to find someone else and uh   yeah   you know nowadays theres a lot of people out there that you dont want your kid to emulating or whatever     yeah well i can remember one of the things im most proud of is uh when my son was i think it was in the sixth grade they had to write uh a little brief autobiography of themselves and about what they had done and what they wanted to do and i was very proud when my son wrote that he wanted to uh have a family and be able to help coach little league and do things like his dad had done with him       a real a real point of pride with me   yeah that is nice   yeah excuse me we sound like we both have colds   yeah well its um well its uh uh ten oclock here in Falls Church Virginia so that the only reason im home is because im home with a cold  and the wife says well you need something to do talk to the guy on the phone   oh oh oh well youre kind yeah well im sitting here on the ninth floor of an office building on the north side of Dallas Texas so were were kind of far apart here     yeah   weve uh this is a very interesting program i ive heard about here on this and when i signed up for it it uh looked like it could be uh make a real contribution in in participating and uh   right yeah im uh electrical engineer by trade   yeah   uh here in Virginia  likewise we uh we do some projects every now and then we like to get support from uh other other companies as well so   yeah yeah im an accountant presently working as a contractor liquidating a failed savings and loan  so you know trying to work myself out of a job  but its its been an interesting uh roughly oh nine months here and uh       oh   again this is our home area weve lived here about seventeen years and its uh we enjoy living here its where we originally started out and weve lived up north for a while in Chicago and over in Tennessee so wound up back about two hundred miles aware away from where we started out   yep     well uh thats about all i can think to talk about right now its been a pleasure talking with you   okay right byebye   thank you bye
