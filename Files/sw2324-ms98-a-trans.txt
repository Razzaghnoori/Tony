 okay okay um why do you think it um failed do you think we should adopt it no i don t like the metric system you don t i i i think the country is is um too ingrained in the inches and and just the general um background the history of our country has been inches and i don t think there s a big advantage in going to the metric system um hum it it s gonna disorient it and confuse a lot of people for years and years and there are going to be people who die because of it because they don t understand um you know simple things from the amount of medicine they should take to how fast they can drive and you know how far away something is and yeah it s it s not in our national consciousness to do it we ve always measured things in the English system yeah and you know everything you know our land is in acres our people aren t going to understand what an amount of something is right yeah i agree i agree with you i don t think we should either even though i know there are benefits to the metric system i don t think the benefits of the metric system outweigh the the disadvantages that would happen to the people of America yeah and also the um i don t know it seems almost like there s this it s a peer pressure thing is why we keep wanting to do it is so we ll look good to the other nations because i think they that s an area that the other nations especially Europe look down on us like oh we re just backward wayward children who still use this backward system who haven t really attained it yet and i feel it s just pride of why they keep trying to push it on us and it s like hey we re content with this no it s probably not as accurate probably you know intellectually doesn t it s not as sound intellectually but like you said i mean come on i had six years of college and i don t know the metric system and i don t care to learn it and i m not some kind of an idiot i just i mean it s yeah and it s easy to translate we have a computer for just about everything now and if it s necessary to translate back and forth between them it can be done yeah because i m a mechanical engineer and i ve had to work when i was designing packages for people i mean i had to to work both systems back and forth and it was not hard um hum and you get you can get a CAD CAM system that can take any design you want and you can push a button and it ll convert every measurement on there you know from one system to the other in seconds right there s a lot of people like you re educated i m educated my husband is but i mean a lot of people are flat not educated and if i have a hard time you know putting that into my life can we put that off on the other eighty percent of the population that doesn t have any college or i don t know how much of the you know but a large percentage probably over half of the rest of the population really yeah absolutely they don t have any college probably much at all and if we can t take it and use it easily well we how can you put that on like elderly people and oh yeah it s just you know just people that maybe just aren t blessed with as as much sharpness and mental mental acuity or or even have had the ability you know the chance to to go to college or to to to learn about it i think it s still good they do cover the system and i think it should still be taught in schools yeah yeah and they do i know now because i even when i was in elementary school years ago they were um hum you know we learned what a centimeter was and a decimeter and the various you know basically the other alternate forms of measurements and things like that right yeah and and that s acceptable yeah i think it failed too because like what you said of just you know hey this is ridiculous i think Americans have so much stress on them right now because yeah i mean if you look at the average family it s like man they barely have time to stop and get gas much less to try and figure out how much gas they re really getting and do all this and it s like i mean come on let s take the pressure off really yeah you know you need twenty gallons but do you need how many liters yeah and it s just like another thing the American family doesn t need any more pressure just leave them alone let them measure their green bean water in cups and leave them alone yeah yeah and it it just doesn t yeah it doesn t make that much difference in the average life in the scientific community and places where it s needed i don t know you know that s fine and the rest of the world i mean we are uh we if not we may not be the top i don t know if we re the top we re one of the superpowers of the world yeah uh huh that s it may be arrogant but i mean let them come to us that s kind of the way i feel about it we can convert and and if they don t like the way we do it just get off our don t worry about it and i think yeah it it s kind of like expecting expecting everyone to suddenly speak German right it is because it is another language yeah you know yeah and and instead of having the world speak German we found out that we can translate and that s what i think we ought to do with the metric system that s funny well that s good well i think we kept it at real good okay is that all we need to say yeah i it s been nice talking to you you too i think that was good that was the best one usually i get distracted off the topic you know what i mean okay yeah and we ll end up one man was telling me about his grandfather in Lithuania and we were talking about something totally income tax or something and i just all right anyway the i appreciate it have a good day well good talking to you bye bye
