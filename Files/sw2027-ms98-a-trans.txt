 okay um i don t know about you but where i am we have a like an extremely lax dress policy at work and it varies like everyday i mean from jeans one day to business suits the next were it s pretty bad but it s true you know they tend to try to be you know real lax and supposedly the policy is like you know we you know we hire these wonderful creative people and we don t want to smush their creativity you know we want to go ahead and let them do what ever they want and you know you really will see people in in jeans one day and business suits the next well i m kind of that way too i work in the legal department and where we are now what we re doing is some very big lawsuits that happen to have a heck of a lot of boxes of documents yeah and i get to toting around boxes of documents several times a day it always seems like i m doing that and i can t see getting dressed up and wearing heels and stuff when you have to carry you know boxes of documents around so if i m just gonna be there working in the litigation center and doing you know odds and ends and stuff with the boxes of documents i dress down but if we re going to have a meeting where we re having the attorneys come in or people from uh other party s attorneys and stuff then i normally dress up yeah and i ll wear a dress and hose and stuff yeah yeah you know we re kind of that way too i try to i m the same way you are i kind of try to judge from day to day i know you know where i am we work a lot with the customers and we have a lot of government folks come in all the time and um hum and you know if i know that they re gonna be there you know you you i try to really watch it and like you say you know really dress up and if i know they re not you know i i ve been doing a lot of reorganization you know the last couple of months the same way you are you know and it s just so it s just impossible to crawl down on the floor and dig through boxes in a dress you know it is so um hum that s right that s right a matter of fact i thought i had one funny story when um i was at TI the first year or so we were sent out to our record retention facility to look through two thousand boxes we had them in the warehouse and at that point it the warehouse was over across the road and it wasn t air conditioned uh and if we were there like in the middle of the summer it s unair conditioned it was dusty and dirty um there was like a fan at the very end of the row and that was it and so we didn t really know we weren t supposed to we thought TI dress code was just dress appropriate to your job we wore shorts we didn t know that was a big no no uh huh oh no and a supervisor from another area came up to us and you know this area where record retention is there s only a few people that work there and he should he knew who worked there he should have realized that we weren t regulars in the warehouse there uh huh and he came up to us and he just said who s your supervisor well he called our supervisor and our supervisor s supervisor and it went up all the way to the head of facilities complaining that we were wearing shorts oh no he didn t at least say to us did you know you re not supposed to do that that could have alleviated a big problem we ended up getting called out on it oh how awful sounds like Mister Power Hungry but you know just yesterday though i saw a girl in the spin out here at Lewisville that had on a pair of shorts yeah uh huh and i don t care you can call them split skirts and you can call them culottes all you want but these were shorts is all they were i mean i i don t care what else you call them you know if they re below the knee okay maybe you can call them split skirts if they re above the knee they turn into shorts you know and these weren t even really full ones i mean they had a problem out here with it last summer wearing these shorts that were you know the real wide full ones you know and because these weren t even those these were like um hum pretty short black and they were very dressy they were black velvet shorts and she had on black hose and black heels and she looked very very nice hum but you don t wear shorts to work you know i mean as far as i m concerned she was in violation and nobody says anything to them it s always been a big problem in Lewisville in the summertime you know if they just you know the management doesn t ever seem to want to take an um hum cut off you know that yeah no this is where we re going to draw the line this is shorts you know and and nobody will ever kind of take control and do that you know yeah hum so it always gets annoying because the rest of us are going well God we have a pair of those at home too it sure would be cool and comfortable to wear you know but well i ve seen some people try to just come in like over the weekend because they want to use the TexTeller machine and they have said no yeah uh yeah and then during the week you see these women in the you know just because you put on a pair of hose with them doesn t make them not shorts anymore you know yeah i mean i ve never seen them do it without hose i mean they always have hose on but still it s they re shorts i don t care what you say they re shorts you know well i think TI s dress code is pretty lax considering everything anyway you know i i know i didn t know that EDS has a very strict dress code i had a friend oh oh do they really definitely i had a friend who worked there for a year or so and they spell it out for men it s particular suits uh the pin stripe and the particular colors of shirts and wing wing tipped shoes oh it is definitely lined out oh my God women are not allowed to wear slacks she wears coordinated suits i could i couldn t afford to work there and a and a particular kind of shoe you know so high heel oh it is oh no spelled out when i was looking at her materials when she first started you know she had her benefits package and all that kind of stuff and it told about the dress code and it said uh huh these are the color pastel shirts you may wear or white shirts with this kind of stripe in it for the men and this kind of shoe and hair just this way yeah TI says no shorts and no halters you know that s it and EDS is very particular about this hair cuts i mean it was like you can t have you know such and such facial hair no beards you know and just really detailed wow i don t know that that would be a good environment to work in i mean i i see i i am more i don t know about anybody else and a lot of bosses may say i m nuts but i am more productive when i m in pants i i am i work faster i get things done faster than when i m in a dress and heels you know i it and it s weird but i it s i do i i can i can get so much more done if i m dressed comfortable you know well the uh the time we were there at the warehouse we felt really bad because we had uh another person coming from Washington our outside counsel and she was told that we were gonna be in a warehouse but she really didn t get the idea that we were in the warehouse part of the warehouse not the office to the warehouse but the warehouse right and she came with skirts just like she d be going into the office yeah and we d try we d try to say didn t you bring any pants or anything we re we re out here in the warehouse you know you you got your skid of you know that wooden pallet of boxes and you re gonna have to unload unload your skids look at the documents in the in the boxes and then repack your skid uh huh you can t do that in a skirt poor thing and she and she was so she was so hot and miserable you know in the skirt she finally tried to go buy you know a pair of pants but you know i mean it was just completely miserable for her oh yuck yeah that s terrible that s terrible gosh well i don t know i just figure you know yeah sometimes i worry about you know if i go in in pants and i never i never ever ever go in in a pair of jeans you know but i ll go in in pants i mean today i had on a pair of you know navy blue dress slacks and a and a like a peach colored top and you know not cruddy but not a dress either and sometimes i wonder if stuff like that would will hold you back you know if you don t dress in you know your dress for success business suits everyday if um hum you know if upper management doesn t notice that and remember that later on but you know i don t know if they do or not you know i see a lot of the managers and they re in jeans so you know some of our people in the legal department we have um assistants to the general counsel and it s funny because there s one that always wears a suit a matter of fact he s never seen without his jacket to the suit on buttoned really wow and then there s another one who s who s a little younger and a little more yuppyish and he s always kind of like in the khaki pants and you know a shirt and sometimes he wears the jacket to it uh huh yeah and some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes and then other ones tend to always wear a suit with a very starched cotton shirt so that s just you isn t that funny you know with the you know the little suspenders or something on so we that s great we ve kind of had a variety there but i think a lot of times it s it s mainly who they re going to meet with they re they re meeting with people that they know is gonna be dressed that way then that s how they are if there just gonna be meeting with TIers yeah like to talk about a patent kind of thing and the they re engineers that they re talking too they dress kind of like how the engineers are dressed and they re usually casual that s the way to do it i mean that s the smart way to do it it really is because your making you know if when they re meeting with the engineers who they know are going to be dressed down if they come in you know in a six hundred dollar three piece suit yeah it s gonna make the people they re meeting with feel very uncomfortable you know or it would me you know it s it s one of those slippery attorneys coming in here yeah yeah look at this slick guy i wonder what kind of money does he make uh huh i can see it now well it was good to talk to you it was really enjoyable yeah this is this is kind of a fun project i ve done i ve done some of the other speech programs but we ve never got to talk to another person it was always just talking to the computer so this is a little different it really is oh yuck yeah well it s kind of enjoyable i m really looking forward to it well thanks a lot bye bye yeah okay bye
