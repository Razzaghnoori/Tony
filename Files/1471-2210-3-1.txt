 Background Opioid ligands exhibit a variety of physiological activities and have been utilized extensively in medicine most prominently in the treatment of pain However at analgesic doses opioid receptor agonists or partial agonists can induce unwanted side effects such as ventilatory depression 1 2 and the development of physical tolerance and dependence 3 4 Thus the search for opioid ligands which possess analgesic effect and lack untoward effects has been a sought after goal of the medical community The overall hypothesis that drives the present work is that the ideal opioid analgesics that exhibit minimal side effects might be drugs that bind to more than one opioid receptor but differentially activate each of the opioid receptor types Such drugs would potentially act as a full agonist at a specific opioid receptor type while acting as partial agonists or antagonists at the other receptor types For example some investigators have suggested that opioid ligands with agonism at opioid receptors and antagonism at opioid receptors are potentially useful analgesics 5 6 7 In cases where the medicinal effect of a drug is mediated through the same opioid receptor type that also elicits the side effects the use of drugs with mixed activity could be most beneficial 7 In such a case interaction with one receptor could reverse the unwanted side effects associated with activation of the other receptor In order to test this hypothesis the activation profiles of a set of non selective opioid ligands need to be assessed in vitro followed by in vivo evaluation of analgesic and unwanted effects The completed data set can be used to determine the characteristics of ligands possessing analgesia in the absence of unwanted effects One of the steps in such an approach is presented here In order to clearly understand the activity of any ligand for mechanistic characterization or rational drug design it is essential that the ligands be tested in a well defined environment under identical experimental conditions Moreover the use of a transfected cell system in which a single receptor type is expressed is critical for these types of modelling Such tools were not available until recently when the three opioid receptor types were cloned We have previously characterized these ligands in cells expressing only opioid receptor 8 The present study was devised to characterize the activity of a set of opioid ligands in a cell line expressing only opioid receptors The ligands selected were chosen based on our previous data suggesting that they bind to all three opioid receptor types 9 Previous model tissue data 10 and in vivo data 11 had suggested that some of these drugs displayed differential activation profiles at each of the opioid receptor types Thus the present study was designed to achieve the following goals 1 to describe the activation profiles of a set of opioid ligands not previously defined in an isolated cell system expressing only opioid receptor and 2 to compare the efficacies of these drugs to the known highly efficacious receptor agonist fentanyl the common opioid analgesic morphine and to the endogenous opioid ligand endorphin In the present study we employed an HEK cell line stably expressing opioid receptors HEK to characterize the activation and binding profiles of fifteen opioid ligands These cells do not express endogenous opioid receptors and are easily transfected Furthermore they have previously been used to study opioid receptor activation 12 13 14 15 16 by measuring inhibition of forskolin stimulated cAMP production The results obtained from this study can serve to clarify the categorization of each of the ligands studied as an agonist weak partial agonist or antagonist at opioid receptors Moreover these results demonstrate that it is crucial to understand the interaction of each drug with a single receptor type at the molecular level in order to fully appreciate the mode of action of the drug in the body Results Activation assays Our results clearly characterize the ligands studied as agonists or antagonists at opioid receptors with respect to inhibition of adenyly cyclase Naltrexone SKF 10047 and WIN 44 441 were identified as antagonists These ligands exhibited little or no measurable inhibitory effect on forskolin stimulated cAMP production when used alone and were repeatedly able to block the inhibitory effect of 1 nM etorphine All other ligands studied showed agonism at opioid receptor with varying maximal effects or efficacies ranging from 29 71 Table 1 The rank order of efficacy of the ligands tested were fentanyl hydromorphone endorphin etorphine lofentanil butorphanol morphine nalbuphine nalorphine cyclazocine dezocine metazocine xorphanol The IC 50 of all ligands studied were between 1 10 nM with the exception of etorphine which was the most potent drug with an IC 50 of 0 3 nM morphine which was the least potent drug with an IC 50 of 12 nM and the endogenous ligand endorphin with IC 50 of 500 nM A low affinity is acceptable for an endogenous ligand that is released at very high concentrations at the site of action at the synaptic cleft The rank order of potency of the drugs studied were etorphine hydromorphone dezocine xorphanol nalorphine butorphanol lofentanil metazocine nalbuphine cyclazocine fentanyl morphine endorphin As can be seen the rank order of efficacy was not related to the rank order of potency In fact one of the most potent ligands xorphanol was the least efficacious Statistical analysis of the differences between the efficacies of different ligands was carried out to distinguish the full agonists from the partial agonists Based on these analyses there was no difference in the efficacy of butorphanol etorphine lofentanil or nalorphine compared to fentanyl or hydromorphone p 0 05 However morphine and nalbuphine both had efficacies that were less than fentanyl p 0 05 Both fentanyl and hydromorphone showed maximal efficacies that were not significantly different compared to that of the endogenous ligand endorphin P 0 05 thus categorizing them as full agonists compared to endorphin Finally the four weakest agonists cyclazocine dezocine metazocine and xorphanol all exhibited efficacies that showed statistically significant difference when compared to fentanyl p 0 01 and thus were categorized as partial agonists Figure 1represents the dose response curves of three agonists and one antagonist The least efficacious xorphanol Fig 1a and most efficacious fentanyl Fig 1b ligands are shown for comparison The dose response curve of nalbuphine that was previously described as an antagonist at opioid receptor is also shown Fig 1c in order to demonstrate the robustness of its agonistic effect at opioid receptor Finally a dose response curve of naltrexone as it fully blocked the effect of 1 nM etorphine is shown Fig 1d Binding assays A single clone of transfected HEK cells stably expressing approximately 3 pmoles of opioid receptors per mg of protein as measured by 3H DAMGO binding was propagated and used as a model for characterization of the binding profiles of a set of opioid ligands at opioid receptors This level of expression is not uncommon for transfected cell systems 17 18 although such receptor expression levels may appear higher than reported values from brain tissues The measured values from specific brain regions are average estimates over an entire tissue or region and not that of a single cell and the actual expression on a single cell in the brain is most likely much higher Furthermore these high levels of receptor expression have been measured in cell lines that were established from various neuronal tissues For example similar levels of expression have been measured for neuronal cells in culture SH SY5Y cells 19 or primary cultures of dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons 20 Thus the level of receptor expression in the cell line used in this study is comparable to that of cells expressing the opioid receptors in various regions of the nervous system Competition binding studies were carried out for the ligands that were shown to act as antagonists or weak partial agonists at opioid receptors to confirm that these agents were in fact capable of binding to opioid receptors with high affinity Competition binding studies indicated that the antagonists naltrexone SKF 10047 and WIN 44 441 had binding affinities K i in nanomolar range and the two weakest agonists xorphanol and cyclazocine bound the receptor with the highest affinities The rank order of affinities was determined to be cyclazocine xorphanol WIN 44 441 naltrexone SKF 10047 morphine This order was in agreement with the relative potencies of these drugs showing that cyclazocine and xorphanol had higher affinities and potencies compared to morphine although they were both less efficacious than morphine Discussion A well defined receptor expression system was used to characterize the activation profiles of a set of opioid ligands and to compare the efficacies and potencies of these ligands at opioid receptors The main advantage of using transfected HEK cells for this study is that these cells do not contain endogenous opioid receptors but express the G proteins necessary for the proper coupling of the transfected genes to the respective second messenger systems A well established method for assessing G protein activation by opioid receptors and characterizing activity of opioid ligands is measuring the extent of inhibition of forskolin stimulated adenylyl cyclase AC activity 12 13 14 21 22 23 Adenylyl cyclase has been implicated in playing a role in mediating the analgesic effect of opioid ligands through opioid receptors 24 25 26 27 28 Thus characterizing the ability of opioid ligands to inhibit cAMP production such as described in this report could be used as an index for assessing their activity as a correlate of their analgesic effects Moreover a simple well defined system such as the one used in this study can be very beneficial in describing the mode of action of each ligand at a specific receptor However it is understood that once applied to the whole animal in vivo the overall effect of the drug will be a composite of the effects of the drug on all receptor types interacting with it Furthermore the pharmacokinetic parameters such as metabolism tissue absorption and distribution of the drug will play a major role in the overall drug effect in vivo The present set of ligands exhibited a range of efficacies and potencies The most efficacious drug was fentanyl supporting previous in vivo studies describing fentanyl as a highly potent and efficacious analgesic drug 11 On the other hand xorphanol was identified as a highly potent ligand with the lowest efficacy in inhibiting cAMP production through opioid receptors Clinically xorphanol is a well tolerated orally active analgesic that provides effective pain relief but shows low physical dependence liability 29 30 It is possible that the low physical dependence liability of this drug is due to its partial agonism at opioid receptors The present study can offer some explanation for the existing in vivo data by providing information on the relative coupling efficacies of the tested ligands from a controlled system For example one study characterizing butorphanol 31 described this drug as a mild analgesic compared to morphine However in another study butorphanol was reported to be equipotent in its antinociceptive effect to that of morphine 32 In our assays we have observed that butorphanol and morphine are equally efficacious in inhibiting cAMP production although butorphanol is more potent than morphine in this assay Based on these two sets of results if the analgesic effect of butorphanol is mediated via opioid receptors through the inhibitory effect of these receptors on adenylyl cyclase the equal efficacy of morphine and butorphanol would support an equal antinociceptive effect of these two drugs Thus such results demonstrate that it is essential to describe the effect of ligands on specific receptor types in order to fully define the mode of action of each drug Our data clearly show that nalbuphine is a potent agonist at the opioid receptor with an efficacy similar to that of morphine thus agreeing with in vivo data showing that morphine and nalbuphine are equally potent as analgesics 33 However other reports have described nalbuphine as a mixed agonist antagonist with agonism at opioid receptors and antagonism at opioid receptors based on in vivo data 11 33 This categorization is likely due to the fact that nalbuphine has been shown to reduce the ventilatory depressant effect of other opioids while adding to their analgesic effect 33 Nalbuphine is also used clinically to reduce the opioid mediated side effects such as itching without completely reversing the analgesic effects of the full agonists 34 35 36 According to our data although nalbuphine is clearly a potent agonist at receptors its levels of agonism is significantly lower than the very efficacious drug fentanyl and the endogenous ligand endorphin Therefore if combined with a drug such as fentanyl or in the presence of an internal pool of endorphin nalbuphine can act as an antagonist in inhibiting adenylyl cyclase by opioid receptors Thus the net effect of the mixture of the two ligands at the level of the whole animal will be the combined effect This can explain the usefulness of drugs such as nalbuphine in reducing the side effects associated with the more potent opioid analgesics while not totally reversing the analgesic action of those ligands Comparing the efficacies of the ligands in this study to the endogenous ligand endorphin indicates that fentanyl etorphine lofentanil butorphanol and hydromorphone are all full agonists Thus in physiological pathways where inhibition of adenylyl cyclase mediates the activity of opioid receptors these drugs will act as agonists at opioid receptors Other ligands with efficacies significantly different from that of endorphin can act as agonists with different efficacies at opioid receptors when administered alone However in the presence of the endogenous ligand endorphin when released at the synapse or another full agonist a weaker agonist can potentially act as a competitive antagonist Conversely it is possible for ligands categorized and accepted as antagonists to act as agonists at opioid receptor if applied alone at high enough concentrations albeit with a very low efficacy This does not mean that when applied to the whole organism an analgesic effect of such a drug will be observed The reason is that the affinity efficacy dose and pharmacokinetic properties of the drug used will influence the ultimate effect seen in the organism as will the presence of other ligands in the system When drugs are used in combination the net effect will depend on the intrinsic characteristics efficacy and affinity of the two drugs relative to each other and their relative concentrations at the site of action Consequently it is important to have a clear understanding of the characteristics of each drug and the molecular changes that occur at the receptor following receptor drug interaction 37 Such knowledge will allow one to target a specific receptor population with the aim of attaining a certain physiological effect possibly by mixing two or more drugs or using a single drug that possesses different activation profiles at various receptors Conclusion In summary this is the first detailed comparative report of the inhibitory effect of a set of opioid ligands on the accumulation of cAMP in intact cells expressing opioid receptors The activation profiles of these ligands have been compared to that of the endogenous opioid ligand endorphin and the commonly used opioid analgesics morphine and fentanyl Moreover this report serves to clarify the activation profiles of many previously uncharacterised ligands in cells expressing only opioid receptors thus leading to a better understanding of the mechanism of action
