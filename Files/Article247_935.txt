 Idiot Box Lemming Chic Before delving into the coming week s programming I have to ask Why do they keep letting Bob Woodward appear on Larry King Live I understand he s a big name in journalism Watergate Washington Post yadda yadda yadda but the man should not be allowed on television His performance on election night last November and again after Tuesday s State of the Union Address was painful to behold He speaks preternaturally slowly as if operating underwater so that watching him in discussion with two or three fast on their feet political analysts is much like watching a valium addict trying to communicate with a roomful of meth heads That said on to less political TV fare First the bad news The awards season continues apace with this Sunday s broadcast of the 56th annual Golden Globe Awards NBC 8 PM The ad in TV Guide says it all As glamorous and unpredictable as the stars themselves Insipid and self absorbed would be more accurate You d be better entertained watching TNT s back to back showings of Dirty Dancing 7 PM 9 PM The Monday night scene is equally dismal unless you happen to care who s shagging whom on Melrose Like a confused lemming UPN is joining the animation frenzy with Dilbert 8 PM a new series based on the popular comic strip by Scott Adams Don t bother At its best Adams comic strip delivers clever sarcastic deadpan humor The series relies too much on characters shrieking and running about Granted I ve thus far seen only the pilot episode but the odds are against major improvement Dilbert the comic strip relies heavily on its final frame to deliver a hysterical twisted punch line a formula that does not translate well to television narrative For Monday s most disturbing offering turn to ABC for Celebrity Weddings In Style 8 PM A joint presentation with In Style magazine the hour long special is media synergy at its most vapid Meant to complement and hawk In Style s annual weddings issue featuring 19 celebrity couples Monday s show lets viewers bask in the warm nuptial day radiance of John Stamos and Rebecca Romijn Stamos Cindy Crawford Vivica A Fox Kathy Najimy and so on I m getting weepy just thinking about it Apparently ABC execs have designated this Monday as chick night because hot on the heels of the celebrity wedding gawking hour comes the MFTV movie My Last Love 9 PM As a general rule made for TV movies stink It may have something to do with the fact that three quarters of them are now filmed in Canada I don t know But they tend to fall into one of three dreary categories pathetic pseudo macho western e g Outlaw Justice CBS Sun 9 PM cheesy suspense thriller or nauseatingly gooey romance which is where My Last Love comes in Basic premise Dying from some unspecified form of cancer the fetching Susan Allen Nancy Travis quits her high powered law career and moves home to L A with her precocious 11 year old daughter Carson There Allen falls madly in love with a yummy young poet waiter Scott Bairstow who makes her last days worth living Throw in a couple of well intentioned overbearing grandparents tearful reminiscing about the poet waiter s dead sister and repeated shots of characters gazing soulfully out at the Pacific and you ve got the makings of a movie so overwrought it should only be shown on Lifetime The good viewing news this week is harder to come by in part because the networks are going heavy on the repeats There are however a number of top notch movie options Driving Miss Daisy UPN Sun 8 PM Star Wars Special Edition the 20th anniversary re edit of George Lucas 1977 mega hit TBS Sun 8 PM The Shawshank Redemption CBS Tue 8 PM The Sting TNT Tue 8 PM Stagecoach AMC Wed 8 PM and of course the Sunday night Porky s trilogy on FX Porky s at 6 PM Porky s II at 8 PM and Porky s Revenge at 11 PM Also noteworthy is the X Files conspiracy marathon on FX Mon Fri 8 PM It s an X phile s dream come true no L A vampires Indian werewolves or homicidal inbred hillbillies just 10 nights weekends excluded of biological experimentation government cover ups and little green men Regrettably viewers will also be subjected to behind the scenes interviews serving largely to feed the egos of the cast and crew But no viewing experience is perfect Finally if the media circus surrounding Bimbroglio makes you long for a kinder gentler era check out Pacific Blue USA Sun 8 PM Adding camp to an already silly show this week s episode features former small screen stars Erik Estrada CHiPs Adam West Batman Susan Olsen The Brady Bunch and Danny Bonaduce The Partridge Family Guaranteed groovy Michelle Cottle
