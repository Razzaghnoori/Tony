 Introduction The Golgi complex is an elaborate cytoplasmic organelle that has a prominent function in the processing transporting and sorting of intracellular proteins Autoantibodies directed against the Golgi complex were first identified in the serum of a Sj gren s syndrome patient with lymphoma 1 Subsequent reports described anti Golgi complex autoantibodies AGA in patients with systemic rheumatic diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus 2 rheumatoid arthritis 3 and Wegener s granulomatosis 4 Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation studies have shown that there was heterogeneity of reactivity among AGA 5 Within the past several years our laboratories and others have cloned and identified novel Golgi autoantigens golgins 6 This has been achieved primarily by expression cloning using human autoantibody probes The identified autoantigens referred to are golgin 160 GCP170 7 8 golgin 95 gm130 7 golgin 97 9 golgin 245 p230 10 11 12 giantin macrogolgin GCP372 13 14 and golgin 67 15 These proteins are characterized by predominant helical coiled coil domains except for N termini and C termini It has been reported that some golgins are localized to the cytoplasmic face of Golgi membranes 16 Functions of the golgins have been proposed in vesicular transport and in maintaining structural integrity of the Golgi complex 17 18 19 The potential implication is that these Golgi proteins may have common biochemical characteristics that may make them targets of autoimmune responses in certain disease states It is not clear why and how the immune system is able to recognize or target intracellular autoantigens One possible explanation is that they may be recognized as surface structures on cytoplasmic organelles that are released to the immune system in aberrant disease states associated with unregulated cell death apoptosis or necrosis resulting from injury or infection or defective clearance of dying cells A variety of autoantigens are cleaved into signature fragments during apoptosis and necrosis 20 Other cell death post translational modifications in autoantigens include hyperphosphorylation de ubiquitination methylation citrullination and transglutaminase crosslinking 21 22 The emerging view is that modified forms of autoantigens generated during cell death might stimulate autoantibody responses if presented to the immune system in a proinflammatory context 23 Since the fate of the Golgi complex during cell death has not been extensively explored we investigated whether the Golgi complex and associated autoantigens are altered during apoptosis and necrosis Using AGA as probes we observed that the Golgi complex undergoes dynamic changes during apoptosis distinct from those observed in necrosis Immunoblotting analysis showed distinct cleavage fragments of Golgi autoantigens generated during apoptosis and necrosis Since the cleaved Golgi autoantigen fragments are antigenic they may play a role in sustaining autoantibody production in autoimmune disease states Materials and methods Antibodies Human prototype serum containing highly specific antipolyADP ribose polymerase PARP antibody and AGA sera were obtained from the serum bank of the WM Keck Autoimmune Center The Scripps Research Institute CA USA Rabbit antibodies to Golgi autoantigens were produced in New Zealand White rabbits 7 9 10 Briefly recombinant human Golgi autoantigens were produced using the expression plasmid pET28 system in Escherichia coli Novagen Madison WI USA Recombinant golgin 160 amino acids 787 1348 GenBank accession number BAA23661 giantin amino acids 851 1496 GenBank accession number NP_004478 gm130 amino acids 370 990 GenBank accession number AAF65550 and golgin 97 amino acids 1 767 GenBank accession number AAB81549 proteins were purified by affinity nickel column chromatography They were then used to immunize one or two rabbits separately by subcutaneous injection of recombinant proteins in an equal volume of Freund s complete adjuvant After booster immunizations the immune sera were prepared and stored at 20 C The appearance and titers of antibodies were monitored by indirect immunofluorescence and immunoblotting analysis Induction of cell death Human Jurkat and HEp 2 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection Rockville MD USA and were cultured in RPMI 1640 and Dulbecco s modified Eagle s medium Life Technologies Rockville MD USA respectively containing 10 fetal bovine serum under standard conditions Induction of cell death was performed essentially as described elsewhere 20 with some modifications Apoptosis was induced in Jurkat T cells 10 6 ml by exposure to 1 M staurosporine STS ALEXIS San Diego CA USA for up to 4 hours Apoptosis in HEp 2 cells was induced by exposure to 2 M STS at 37 C for up to 6 hours Necrosis was induced in these cells by exposure to 10 M STS for up to 24 hours or by treatment with 0 1 hydrogen peroxide H 2 O 2 Fisher Scientific Pittsburgh PA USA for 3 hours Necrosis was quantified using the trypan blue exclusion assay which measures loss of cytoplasmic membrane integrity as described previously 20 24 At least 300 cells were counted in triplicate in three independent experiments In some experiments Jurkat cells were incubated for 1 hour in the presence of the pancaspase inhibitor benzylocarbonyl Val Ala Asp fluromethyl ketone zVAD fmk ALEXIS used at 100 M prior to addition of STS Treated and control cells and their extracts were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence and or immunoblotting analysis Spontaneous cell death prior to the experiments was minimized by maintaining exponential cell growth Cell viability was quantified by trypan blue exclusion analysis at the beginning of every experiment to ensure that cell cultures used in the experiments were healthy alive cells 95 Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy Indirect immunofluorescence was performed as reported previously 7 10 25 HEp 2 cells were grown on eight chamber vessel tissue culture slides Becton Dickinson Franklin Lakes NJ USA and treated with 2 or 10 M STS for up to 6 hours Cells were fixed by methanol and acetone 1 3 20 C for 2 min Sera containing AGA were used in dilutions of 1 200 to 1 10 000 The secondary antibodies were Alexa 488 conjugated goat anti rabbit IgG or anti human IgG reagents ALEXIS Cells were counterstained with 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole nuclear stain prior to immunofluorescence microscopy The estimation of the percentage of cells at each morphological stage described in the following for Golgi staining in apoptotic cells was obtained by scoring 300 500 cells in each experiment Immunoblotting analysis of cell lysates After incubation in the presence of cell death inducing reagents Jurkat cells were centrifuged at 200 g for 30 min followed by one wash at 1000 g for 10 min in PBS containing Complete Protease Inhibitor cocktail Roche Mannheim Germany Cell pellets 10 7 were then resuspended directly in lysis buffer containing 150 mM NaCl 1 mM MgCl 2 6H 2 O 80 mM Tris HCl and 0 1 NP 40 The lysates were passed several times sequentially through 18 gauge to 27 gauge needles to shear the DNA and protein concentrations in the lysates were determined by Protein DC Assay Kit Bio Rad Hercules CA USA to ensure equal loading of proteins in each SDS PAGE lane After determination of the protein concentration lysates were mixed with an equal volume of 2 gel sample buffer containing 6 sodium dodecyl sulfate 20 glycerol 10 mercaptoethanol 0 02 bromphenol blue and Complete Protease Inhibitor cocktail Lysates were stored at 80 C until use The equivalent of 1 5 g total lysate protein was loaded onto each lane of 10 SDS PAGE gels separated by electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a Semi Dry Trans Blot apparatus Bio Rad Immunoblotting was performed as described previously 7 10 24 using human anti PARP specific antibody 1 250 and AGA 1 250 Detection of bound antibodies was achieved using horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti human or anti rabbit IgG antibody CALTAG San Francisco CA USA used at 1 5000 dilution in combination with enhanced chemiluminescence Super Signal PIERCE Products Rockford IL USA Results Induction of apoptosis and necrosis in HEp 2 cells HEp 2 cells exposed to 2 and 10 M STS exhibited apoptotic like fragmentation into multiple round bodies after 6 hours of treatment Fig 1c 1d Interestingly cells exposed to 10 M STS showed a more pronounced loss of cytoplasmic membrane integrity Fig 1e indicating that this STS concentration drove cell death more rapidly into necrosis As control cells treated with levels of H 2 O 2 0 1 previously shown to provoke massive necrotic cell death 20 exhibited a characteristic necrotic morphology Fig 1b associated with rapid loss of cytoplasmic membrane Fig 1e Changes of the Golgi complex during apoptosis Changes in the Golgi complex during apoptosis were examined by immunostaining with AGA in HEp 2 cells treated with 2 M STS Apoptosis was defined by stereotypic morphological changes especially evident in the nucleus where the chromatin condenses and compacts and assumes a globular crescent shaped morphology 26 Figure 2shows a composite of four apoptotic stages provisionally called stages I IV Fig 2b 2c 2d 2e that are classified on the basis of progression of apoptotic nuclear change middle panels and corresponding staining for golgin 97 left panels About 50 60 of cells appeared unaffected after 2 hours of incubation in the presence of STS as evidenced by perinuclear Golgi staining identical to untreated cells Fig 2a Interestingly swelling of the Golgi complex with vesicular staining stage I was observed in 10 20 of cells and is most strikingly demonstrated in Fig 2b It is estimated that the area occupied by the swelled Golgi can be 5 10 times the normal size for Golgi complex in HEp 2 cells Slight changes in the shape of some nuclei were observed as shown in the middle panel but most cells with Golgi swelling exhibited no change in nuclear size and shape About 10 of cells appeared to be in stage II Fig 2c where there was elongation of the nucleus appearing kidney or crescent shaped middle panel A characteristic of stage II was that the Golgi complex was condensed at the concave or indented region of the crescentic nucleus right panel Stage III Fig 2d was seen in 3 5 of cells with defined nuclear fragmentation into two approximately equal fragments middle panel and golgin 97 primarily located at the cleavage zone between the two nuclear fragments right panel About 10 15 of the cells were considered to be at stage IV Fig 2e where their nuclei were fragmented into more than two pieces middle panel and golgin 97 staining appeared as vesicular structures This was the final stage when remnants of the Golgi complex could be detected Evaluation of cells after 6 hours of incubation with 2 M STS showed all four stages described data not shown At this time up to 50 of cells were in stage I 20 were in stage II 2 3 were in stage III and 25 of cells were in stage IV These data suggested that STS treated cells do not enter the apoptotic pathway at the same time which is consistent with the notion that apoptosis is a relatively asynchronous process Similar staining patterns to those seen with golgin 97 were observed when apoptotic HEp 2 cells were stained with antibodies to golgin 95 golgin 160 golgin 245 and giantin data not shown These results were also reproduced in HeLa S3 and mouse J774A 1 cells treated with 2 M STS data not shown The amount of Golgi swelling observed in stage I varied in different experiments but the characteristics for stages II IV were highly reproducible in all the experiments we have conducted Our observations of Golgi swelling during apoptosis are supported by previous studies For instance in neurons undergoing apoptosis morphologic changes were characterized by a highly ordered sequence of organelle abnormalities with swelling of endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi vesiculation that preceded most nuclear changes or mitochondrial disruption 27 28 Changes of the Golgi complex during necrosis In contrast to the Golgi swelling already described striking fragmentation of the Golgi complex was observed during necrosis in HEp 2 cells treated with 10 M STS Fig 2f As shown in Fig 1b 1e approximately 50 of cells treated with this STS concentration while initially showing apoptotic like fragmentation into multiple bodies gradually died by necrosis Figure 2fshows Golgi fragments clearly visible arrows in cells with condensed nuclei after 6 hours of treatment with 10 M STS Note the absence of nuclear fragmentation in these cells compared with apoptotic cells Fig 2e consistent with previous observations showing that necrotic nuclei exhibit condensation but not fragmentation 20 In this treatment designed to drive apoptotic cells more rapidly into necrosis changes in the Golgi complex similar to the four stages observed in apoptosis were not detected Similar results were also obtained for other Golgi autoantigens including golgin 160 giantin and golgin 95 data not shown No Golgi staining was observed in HEp 2 cells treated with 10 M STS for 24 hours or with 0 1 H 2 O 2 data not shown presumably due to the extensive cytoplasmic damage associated with necrosis These results suggested that the Golgi complex is affected differently in apoptosis and in necrosis prompting us to examine whether specific Golgi proteins are targeted for proteolysis in these modes of cell death Golgi autoantigens are cleaved during apoptosis and necrosis It is well established that specific intracellular autoantigens are cleaved into different fragments in Jurkat T cells and other cell types undergoing apoptosis and necrosis 20 Mancini et al reported that golgin 160 native protein 160 kDa was cleaved into a 140 kDa fragment during apoptosis 29 We therefore performed an immunoblotting analysis using extracts from Jurkat cells treated with apoptosis inducing reagent 1 M STS or necrosis inducing reagent 0 1 H 2 O 2 to investigate whether Golgi autoantigens are cleaved in the two major types of cell death PARP 110 kDa protein was selected as a positive control to monitor the cleavage of proteins during apoptosis and necrosis because its cleavage products in Jurkat cells undergoing apoptosis 89 kDa and undergoing necrosis 60 and 50 kDa are well established 20 24 30 Figure 3shows the results of immunoblotting analysis using antibodies to PARP and four Golgi autoantigens In cells treated with STS Fig 3 left or H 2 O 2 Fig 3 right PARP was cleaved into an 89 kDa polypeptide apoptotic fragments or 60 and 50 kDa polypeptides necrotic fragments respectively with complete degradation of native protein as previously described 24 Golgin 160 was cleaved into 140 and 80 kDa fragments in apoptotic cells consistent with published observations 29 In contrast to the apoptotic fragments a 70 kDa fragment was detected in necrotic cells Giantin was cleaved into three major apoptotic fragments 150 80 and 60 kDa and these fragments were clearly different from the 75 and 50 kDa fragments derived from necrosis Interestingly while apoptotic fragments of golgin 95 and golgin 97 were not detected necrotic fragments at 50 and 70 kDa were detected for both proteins A summary of the Golgi protein fragments generated during apoptosis and necrosis is presented in Table 1 Proteolysis of Golgi autoantigens induced by apoptosis is caspase dependent The caspase family of proteases plays a central role in apoptosis by participating in a cascade of cleavage events that result in the apoptotic phenotype 31 We investigated whether the proteolysis of Golgi autoantigens caused by treatment with STS was caspase dependent Jurkat cells were treated with 1 M STS for 4 hours after preincubation with the pan caspase inhibitor 100 M zVAD fmk The generation of proteolytic fragments from Golgi autoantigens was completely blocked in Jurkat cells pretreated with zVAD fmk Fig 4 indicating that cleavage of Golgi autoantigens during apoptosis is mediated by caspases Discussion Apoptotic changes of the Golgi complex Lane et al reported recently that the Golgi complex in HeLa cells is fragmented into scattered vesicles by caspases due to interference of Golgi reassembly and abnormalities of the 65 kDa stacking protein GRASP65 32 In the present report we describe characteristic changes of the Golgi complex during the progression of apoptosis It is not known whether the Golgi complex functions as a stress sensor involved in the regulation of apoptosis Mancini et al reported that caspase 2 was localized at the Golgi complex and generated a unique cleavage product of golgin 160 29 Furthermore these investigators proposed that the Golgi complex transduces proapoptotic signals 29 A precedent for this hypothesis was provided by Nakagawa et al who reported that caspase 12 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and mediates an endoplasmic reticulum specific apoptosis pathway 33 In the present study we have found that all Golgi autoantigens examined were cleaved in apoptosis in a caspase dependent manner as evidenced by studies showing that the pan caspase inhibitor zVAD fmk completely blocked the apoptotic fragmentation of these antigens Although the requirement for specific caspases was not examined here it is possible that caspases localized in the Golgi complex including caspase 2 transduce death signals during the early stages of apoptosis that are associated with fragmentation of specific Golgi proteins It has been reported that apoptotic death receptors such as CD95 34 tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand receptor 1 tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand receptor 2 35 and tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 36 are enriched in the Golgi complex prior to transport to the plasma membrane thus suggesting that the Golgi complex may play an important role in apoptotic signalling We now provide evidence for characteristic alterations in the Golgi complex corresponding to nuclear change during the progression of apoptosis Swelling of the Golgi complex was particularly detected in the early stages of apoptosis It could be speculated that apoptotic alterations of the Golgi complex may facilitate the transportation of death receptors from the Golgi complex to the plasma membrane and may amplify the apoptotic events once apoptosis was initiated Additional studies are needed to examine the precise function of the Golgi complex during apoptosis Role of apoptotic or necrotic fragments in autoantibody production Analysis of post translational modifications in intracellular autoantigens associated with apoptosis and necrosis should provide important insights into the possible role of cell death in the generation of potentially autoantigenic forms of cellular antigens Casciola Rosen and coworkers have proposed that modifications of autoantigens during cell death particularly proteolytic cleavage might be crucial for the generation of autoantibodies in autoimmune diseases 23 37 Unique proteolytic fragments of fodrin and type 3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor have been implicated in the generation of autoantibody responses in primary Sj gren s syndrome 38 39 Although direct evidence that autoantigen cleavage fragments produced during cell death elicit autoantibody responses is still scarce Pollard et al reported that immunization of B10 S mice H 2 s with a 19 kDa proteolytic cleavage fragment of fibrillarin derived from nonapoptotic cell death elicited antibodies that are comparable with human anti fibrillarin autoantibodies and those derived from mice exposed to mercury 40 In a study using human sera Greidinger et al reported that the recognition of apoptosis derived and oxidatively modified forms of the 70 kDa subunit of U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein autoantigen was associated with distinct disease manifestations 41 Furthermore Oriss et al demonstrated that a combination of antigen processing cells and a fragment of DNA topoisomerase I efficiently elicited autoreactive T cell proliferation whereas the full length topoisomerase I required additional stimulus of exogenous interleukin 2 42 These data point to a crucial role for fragments of autoantigens in the generation of autoantibody responses In the present study several Golgi autoantigens were detected cleaved into distinctive fragments during apoptosis and necrosis It has been speculated that these modified forms of autoantigens may have enhanced immunogenicity through exposure of immunocryptic epitopes that are not generated during antigen processing 21 23 37 43 These epitopes could trigger autoimmune responses if presented to the immune system under proinflammatory conditions 44 and they may be recognized as surface structures on cytoplasmic organelles that are released to the immune system in aberrant disease states Autoantibody responses could be amplified and maintained on repeated stimulation if the exposure of intracellular antigens to the immune system is associated with defective clearance of apoptotic cells prolonged necrosis primary or secondary T cell cytotoxicity associated with chronic infection or even antigen mutation or overexpression It would be important not only to assess the immunogenic potential of subcellular particles and proteolytic fragments released during cell death but also to continue investigating possible defects leading to aberrant apoptosis or phagocyte function and or aberrant antigen expression in systemic autoimmune diseases Kinetics of degradation of golgins and generation of apoptotic fragments Although only well defined apoptotic fragments of golgin 160 and giantin not of golgin 95 and golgin 97 were detected after 2 or 4 hours of incubation with STS total disappearance of intact proteins was detected with all Golgi autoantigens and complete blockage was observed in the presence of z VAD fmk These results suggested that there might be differences in the kinetics of degradation among the golgins with golgin 95 and golgin 97 perhaps being more sensitive to proteolysis and being targeted very early during apoptosis While the absence of apoptotic fragments for golgin 95 and golgin 97 suggests that total degradation of these proteins occurred without generation of intermediate protease resistant fragments it cannot be ruled out that the intact proteins were released from apoptotic cells or that their apoptotic fragments were not recognized by autoantibodies In the present study Jurkat cells were relatively sensitive to the treatment with STS such that the kinetics of degradation of different golgins relative to that of PARP could not be accurately differentiated Since HEp 2 cells grown as a monolayer were observed to be more resistant to apoptosis compared with Jurkat cells we used HEp 2 cells to investigate more precisely the relative kinetics of degradation for the native golgins during apoptosis An identical pattern of fragmentation was essentially observed for all the Golgi autoantigens examined except that the overall kinetics of native protein degradation was slower data not shown The integrity of native golgin 95 and golgin 97 in which apoptotic fragments were not detected was almost completely maintained at 12 hours after the addition of STS data not shown In contrast native golgin 160 and giantin were degraded into their respective fragments 12 hours after the addition of STS The processing of golgin 160 and giantin occurred as early as that for PARP suggesting that these proteins are cleaved during the onset of apoptosis data not shown Cleavage of golgin 160 and giantin may thus play a potentially important role in the early stages of apoptosis Although we did not determine which golgins are substrates for specific caspases further studies aimed at defining the caspases responsible for golgin cleavage the cleavage sites and the biological consequences of these cleavages should provide important insights into the possible role of some of the Golgi autoantigens in apoptosis Conclusion The present study has shown overall morphologic changes of the Golgi complex during apoptosis and necrosis with distinct fragmentation patterns of its associated autoantigens We propose that cleavage of golgin 160 and giantin may play a role in early events in apoptosis We also speculate that Golgi fragmentation in cell death might participate in sustaining autoantibody response to the Golgi complex in aberrant disease states characterized by unregulated cell death resulting from injury or infection or defective clearance of dying cells Abbreviations AGA anti Golgi complex autoantibodies H 2 O 2 hydrogen peroxide PARP polyADP ribose polymerase PBS phosphate buffered
