 Ralph Reed s Creed The devil can cite scripture for his purpose Ralph Reed generally prefers Ralph Waldo Emerson and Martin Luther King Jr our secular saints But the Christian Coalition s executive director makes an exception for one biblical passage a verse from Paul It appears in his book Active Faith in his op eds in interviews I have become all things to all people that I may by all means win some It is an apt motto for Reed a thoroughly political statement that defines a thoroughly political man Critics on the left blame Reed for infecting politics with religious fanaticism In fact Reed s achievement is exactly the opposite He s turned religious fanaticism into mere politics So it s fitting that Reed is embarking on a career as a political consultant a profession where everything is mere politics Last week Reed announced his resignation from Pat Robertson s organization which Reed has built into the Republican Party s most powerful interest group When he steps down Sept 1 the 35 year old Reed will move to Atlanta and open Century Strategies which will advise pro family pro life and pro free enterprise candidates The liberal view of Reed is that he s the Christian right s zealot in chief a devil with a cherub s face This is a misreading Reed s Christian faith is undoubtedly sincere but his real creed is Republican politics He s a political junkie who models himself after Lee Atwater As a teen ager he ran a direct mail campaign for student council As an undergraduate in the early 80s he became the College Republicans master strategist According to his pal Grover Norquist the president of the anti tax Americans for Tax Reform Reed once instructed young Republicans about the correct way to burn a Soviet flag during a pro Solidarity protest His tactical ruthlessness has defined the Christian Coalition I paint my face and travel at night he once said of his work at the coalition You don t know it s over until you re in a body bag You don t know until election night His books Active Faith and After the Revolution read as much like primers on power politics as religious right manifestos The strategy not the scripture thrills him And his strategy not his scripture revived the religious right In 1989 Robertson invited Reed to start an organization to expand the grassroots network from Robertson s 1988 presidential campaign Reed was an inspired choice He had enough principles to win religious conservatives trust but not enough to scare everyone else Reed recognized that the religious right had staggered in the mid 80s because it had 1 depended too much on national leaders and 2 alienated America with its red hot rhetoric To remedy the first problem Reed established hundreds of local chapters Slowly that network of activists took over school boards county commissions and state political parties Reed s more important contribution was to abandon the clear if ferocious principles that defined the 80s Moral Majority and replace them with a comforting fog of family values Reed hardly ever calls the movement religious He labels it pro family as if anyone is anti family He dumped the sodomite rhetoric and distanced himself from the religious right s loonies including his own boss Robertson prone to anti Semitic ravings and one world government paranoia He presented himself as the religious right s new face smiling civil conciliatory He ripped off Newt Gingrich s manifesto idea preparing a Contract With the American Family whose 10 points were poll tested to draw 60 percent plus approval ratings Reed continued to push the old standbys defunding the National Endowment for the Arts and stopping gay marriage But he added a classic right wing economic agenda an endorsement of free enterprise God s own economic policy apparently opposition to President Clinton s 1993 stimulus package and fervent support for tax cuts He even tried to quell the GOP s abortion controversy seeking to moderate if only a tiny bit the language of the 1996 GOP platform In short he s flattened the evangelical crusade of the old religious right into mainstream conservative politics Reed has also made overtures toward black churches home to America s most committed social conservatives The coalition raised 750 000 to rebuild burned black churches and is hosting a conference on racial reconciliation in Baltimore next week Reed feels passionately that white evangelicals must atone for their opposition to the civil rights movement Reed s political tactics occasionally annoy the ideologues of the religious right The Family Research Council s Gary Bauer and Eagle Forum s Phyllis Schlafly criticized him when he suggested softening the GOP platform Some evangelicals view Reed as a compromiser who ll bend a principle for a tactical victory Which of course he is Not that Christian conservatives have cause to complain Thanks to Reed the Christian Coalition now claims 1 9 million members 2 000 chapters nationwide and a 27 million a year budget The 33 million nonpartisan voter guides the coalition distributed in churches before Election Day in 1994 are credited with electing more than half of the freshman Republicans securing the GOP s congressional majority The coalition distributed 45 million guides in 1996 Christian right activists now exercise significant control over 31 state Republican parties they are estimated to comprise one fourth to one third of the GOP primary vote and to swing 5 10 points to Republicans in general elections Reed s departure will diminish the movement s influence The Federal Election Committee investigation of allegations of partisan campaigning by the coalition endangers its tax exempt status Robertson who has kept in Reed s shadow may emerge to embarrass the coalition He s well on his way The Associated Press reported this week that two airplanes bought by his Operation Blessing to fly aid to impoverished Zairians were used instead to service Robertson s Zairian diamond mines The Family Research Council s Bauer seems most likely to replace Reed as the religious right s spokesperson But he s much less politically savvy much less telegenic and much more ideological qualities that won t help the movement s reputation Reed on the other hand will see his credibility increase He no longer has to answer for the erratic Robertson He can drop the pretense that he s nonpartisan He stands to become the right s hottest consultant the GOP s answer to James Carville Republican consultants agree that conservative candidates in the South Southwest Midwest and Rocky Mountains will beg for Reed s talents and connections Reed will make a killing He earned about 200 000 from the Christian Coalition His future colleagues estimate that as a consultant he ll earn at least half a million dollars a year and perhaps as much as 3 million But consulting is a self effacing business and self effacement is one thing that Ralph Reed has shown no aptitude for He quotes himself in his books the sure sign of a towering ego He is relocating to his home state of Georgia He s got plenty of name recognition Democratic Sen Max Cleland barely won his 1996 election Don t be surprised if Sen Reed takes his place in 2002 God knows he s prepared for it
