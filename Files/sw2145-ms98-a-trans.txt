 you want to start well i guess i would first identify myself as middle aged and therefore having seen the last generation i guess it puts me in you know gives me a perspective on that yeah um i am quite positive on the things that i have seen happen recently relative to women in both in society and in the work place uh there s no doubt about the fact that when i first was first graduated from college the impression was that a woman s career would consist of a childbearing years and perhaps a return to the office but not necessarily uh now i think the change that i ve seen as much as anything is one where couples uh are more carefully planning their intention on how to share both share homemaking duties and also how women will uh have their children and then deliberately sort of plan how they go back to the work place and i guess that s a significant change that of i ve both participated in and and noticed i agree um the equality of uh the roles now between the sexes i guess has been dramatically demonstrated with this war especially compared with uh the Vietnam war and you see women going off to wars as well as men uh huh um i have wondered why they allowed or let you know both the father and mother go uh and the children are left without either parent now to me that s kind of a drawback but uh i guess it s a price you pay and i also wonder about the children that are being brought up in the uh uh day care centers wonder about them in what way well uh from what i understand there s been studies that uh these children are uh more rebellious uh they term it as more uh creative uh huh but uh that they uh are much more contentious so i i don t i i guess we ll have to see another generation to see what differences a child being brought up you know in in a uh kind of a uh community uh huh rather than a home i have not to be honest had much experience yeah with children in that situation i i guess one knows one s own storly and i know uh in my children s case it was one where uh pretty much up until the older of two was in uh let s see i guess basically starting junior high and the younger was in fifth grade when my wife reentered the work force uh huh um so i guess my experience is is just with what we did and and so they didn t really go through the child care route they were able to be home together so they yeah um and we never actually experienced that what in terms of changes relative to women in the work place and and potential changes over the the next generation or so i guess i anticipate um an increasing equality uh greater presence of women in management roles uh huh um i don t know whether there will be an increased amount of of surrogacy that we see i just don t know what do you mean um deliberate childbirth by surrogate mother oh yeah sort of rent a mom to be you know not to be crass about it but uh yeah that s strange uh whether one might conceive no pun intended of the possibility that there might be a kind of a deliberate uh um a nanny sort of a professional mother a person uh huh uh huh for instance that and i could you know i could envision a society where that would happen and make an interesting uh uh story or whatever i i don t think i have a philosophical problem with that in fact i think it sort of raises yeah nurturing and being a mother to what it ought to be which is a respected profession that s right that s right uh um i i don t have a other than than a reading and and male perspective on on the various on the biological urges involved relative to being a mother or not uh i know that that my sense is that i have very much an interest and had one in being a parent i i don t know that i uh felt myself necessarily encumbered with the necessity to have heirs uh huh uh i don t have boys that doesn t didn t bother me never has vision more women deliberately raising children either in surrogacy or or as a professional nanny nanny as you put it uh yeah maybe we ll see a growth in that where someone makes uh a career out of say taking care of five or six children as opposed to day care uh huh uh huh it would be a sort of day care but it would be more of a family setting right um i know that there are young people characterized i guess as being half my age so that by definition that means they re young uh that in my work place who are both of them earning rather decent professional salaries who probably would consider paying a woman uh eight or nine or ten thousand dollars a year to take care of their child i could easily envision that pardon to come in and live with them to come in and live with them or to put their child into a setting into a home setting where they would you know like they they would get leave at eight in the morning and and drop a two year old off in a home where you knew there were going to be four other kids and uh huh yeah and you were paying for really high quality care right uh i have acquaintances of mine where i know that they are paying figures on on the order of what i quoted to someone because that s what the experience they want and i would imagine if there are more of people like that with an opportunity that that s a possibility of a change that we could see in the next few years uh huh and then you might have more control over uh the the morals that they would be taught rather than in like a classroom or a day care center um hum um hum i know the day care centers are not cheap either you know they re i haven t ever really looked at them are you aware at all of of what they would what they cost uh well no i just know i know several single mothers who absolutely can t afford it they have to go with the a single uh what i mean a babysitter more more or less uh huh but i think it s like about sixty dollars a week for two children if i m not mistaken uh huh and you have to pay that whether you re on vacation you know and taking care of the children or if the children are at home at home sick uh huh i mean that is you know just a a rate that you have to pay and uh what do you envision for the next twenty years as far as women in American society uh i think i really don t have a vision that s okay too yeah i um i think that they will be more in the work place because uh the door s open uh huh and uh it s just human nature to walk through an open door so and i would be glad to see that i hope i don t see a lot more single moms but i it seems in my experience i m running across single women all the time i m i m noticing that too and and i notice the the a terming emerging called solo parents that i am very aware of yeah the number of solo mothers that that i encounter in the work place and that that is a little troublesome yeah yeah uh because the pressures on them are are rather rather formidable it s awful yeah uh and maybe that s a change we ll see maybe uh possibility the possibility of of women uh who deliberately say no we ll let the man will take care of the children perhaps in the event of a separation or whatever uh huh right so well i think we ve done it thank you very much it s been interesting well i think we re about done okay uh good bye you take care bye okay bye
