          you want to start   well i guess i would first identify myself as middle aged and therefore having seen the last generation i guess it puts me in you know gives me a perspective on that   yeah   um i  am quite positive on the things that i have seen happen recently relative to women in both in society and in the work place uh theres no doubt about the fact that when i first was first graduated from college the impression was that a womans career would consist of a childbearing years and perhaps a return to the office but not necessarily uh now i think the change that ive seen as much as anything is one where couples uh are more carefully planning their intention on how to share both share homemaking duties and also how women will uh have their children and then deliberately sort of plan how they go back to the work place and i guess thats a significant change that of ive both participated in and and noticed   i agree um the equality of uh the roles now between the sexes i guess has been dramatically demonstrated with this war especially compared with uh the Vietnam war and you see women going off to wars as well as men   uhhuh   um i have wondered why they allowed or let you know both the father and mother go uh and the children are left without either parent now to me thats kind of a drawback but uh i guess its a price you pay and i also wonder about the children that are being brought up in the uh uh day care centers   wonder about them in what way   well uh from what i understand theres been studies that uh these children are uh more rebellious uh they term it as more uh creative   uhhuh   but uh that they uh are much more contentious so i i dont i i guess well have to see another generation to see what differences a child being brought up you know in in a uh kind of a uh community   uhhuh   rather than a home   i have not to be honest had much experience   yeah   with children in that situation i i guess one knows ones own storly and i know uh in my childrens case it was one where uh pretty much up until the older of two was in uh lets see i guess basically starting junior high and the younger was in fifth grade when my wife reentered the work force   uhhuh   um   so i guess my experience is is just with what we did and and so they didnt really go through the child care route they were able to be home together   so they yeah   um and we never actually experienced that what in terms of changes relative to women in the work place and and potential changes over the the next generation or so i guess i anticipate um an increasing equality uh greater presence of women in management roles   uhhuh   um i dont know whether there will be an increased amount of of surrogacy that we see i just dont know   what do you mean   um deliberate childbirth by surrogate mother   oh yeah   sort of rent a mom to be you know not to be crass about it but uh   yeah thats strange   uh whether one might conceive  no pun intended of the possibility that there might be a kind of a deliberate uh um   a nanny sort of   a professional mother a person   uhhuh uhhuh   for instance that and i could you know i could envision a society where that would happen and make an interesting uh uh story or whatever i i dont think i have a philosophical problem with that in fact i think it sort of raises   yeah   nurturing and being a mother to what it ought to be which is a respected profession   thats right thats right   uh um i i dont have a other than than a reading and and male perspective on on the various on the biological urges involved relative to being a mother or not uh i know that that my sense is that i have very much an interest and had one in being a parent i i dont know that i uh felt myself necessarily encumbered with the necessity to have heirs   uhhuh   uh i dont have boys that doesnt didnt bother me never has vision more women deliberately raising children either in surrogacy or or as a professional nanny nanny as you put it uh   yeah   maybe well see a growth in that where someone makes uh a career out of say taking care of five or six children as opposed to day care   uhhuh uhhuh   it would be a sort of day care but it would be more of a family setting   right   um i know that there are young people characterized i guess as being half my age so that by definition that means theyre young uh that in my work place who are both of them earning rather decent professional salaries who probably would consider paying a woman uh eight or nine or ten thousand dollars a year to take care of their child i could easily envision that pardon   to come in and live with them to come in and live with them   or to put their child into a setting into a home setting where they would you know like they they would get leave at eight in the morning and and drop a two year old off in a home where you knew there were going to be four other kids and     uhhuh yeah   and you were paying for really high quality care   right   uh i have acquaintances of mine where i know that they are paying figures on on the order of what i quoted to someone because thats what the experience they want and i would imagine if there are more of people like that with an opportunity that thats a possibility of a change that we could see in the next few years   uhhuh and then you might have more control over uh the the morals that they would be taught rather than in like a classroom or a day care center   umhum umhum   i know the day care centers are not cheap either you know theyre   i havent ever really looked at them are you aware at all of of what they would what they cost   uh well no i just know i know several single mothers who absolutely cant afford it they have to go with the a single uh what i mean a babysitter more more or less   uhhuh   but i think its like about sixty dollars a week for two children if im not mistaken   uhhuh   and you have to pay that whether youre on vacation you know and taking care of the children or if the children are at home at home sick   uhhuh   i mean that is you know just a a rate that you have to pay and uh   what do you envision for the next twenty years as far as women in American society   uh i think i really dont have a vision     thats okay too   yeah i um i think that they will be more in the work place because uh the doors open   uhhuh   and uh its just human nature to walk through an open door so and i would be glad to see that i hope i dont see a lot more single moms but i it seems in my experience im running across single women all the time   im im noticing that too and and i notice the the a terming  emerging called solo parents that i am very aware of   yeah   the number of solo mothers that that i encounter in the work place and that that is a little troublesome   yeah yeah   uh because the pressures on them are are rather rather formidable   its awful yeah   uh and maybe thats a change well see maybe uh possibility the possibility of of women uh who deliberately say no well let the man will take care of the children perhaps in the event of a separation or whatever   uhhuh right   so   well i think weve done it  thank you very much its been interesting   well i think were about done okay uh good bye you take care bye   okay bye
