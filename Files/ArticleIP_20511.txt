 Please send your questions for publication to prudence slate com Dear Prudence I don t know if that was my son in law Dan Jacob hrumphing about in laws who won t visit but let s say it wasn t Still let me tell you my story I am a father in law who gets along nicely I thought with his daughter and her husband but who refuses to enter their apartment because they have hung a lewd picture of themselves er copulating in the living room They call it art I am sure but it is almost medical in its detail I like them I like their values but I just cannot stand to see that picture They must know how it can bother a father to see such a graphic representation even if the behavior is encouraged grandchildren bring them on I don t have to see it And if they don t know it they should I thought I was avoiding a confrontation but evidently not I guess I will tell them even if that wasn t Dan hrumphing Thank you Greg Garman Dear Greg Whether or not and his wife are your children these young people certainly march to a different drummer perhaps one who owns an adult bookstore Prudie is in your corner and she is blushing Art it may be but in such poor taste that one wonders what this young couple is thinking and where is their judgment Since you like your children but do not wish to see the image you describe by all means articulate your discomfort and suggest they throw a blanket over the art when you come to call or temporarily substitute a nice still life By the way this drama makes Prudie feel clairvoyant because she answered the young man who wrote that his in laws would not step foot in his home There is some little missing piece here The piece is that picture Prudie hopes your children outgrow their need to shock and that you can enjoy visits in each other s homes soon Prudie properly Dear Prudence I have a question about a man I recently started dating I am an attractive single woman and he has spent a fair amount of time getting to know me and taking me to nice dinners dancing etc We laugh and have great fun together and share many of the same interests He has kissed me and I feel that he is physically attracted to me My concern is that he seems to have nearly all the characteristics of most gay men that I know This man was born in Germany is wealthy educated well traveled so I don t know if he is exhibiting the lifestyles of the rich and famous European style or is gay First of all he has more clothes than any woman I know and loves to shop He doesn t like to watch sports He doesn t like violent movies just the sweet Disney ones He stays tanned and gets his hair colored HE DRIES FLOWERS He drops names of clubs and restaurants that he likes and a lot of them are frequented by the gay community I know this because my late brother was gay I know he is open minded and has gay friends so surely if he were gay or bisexual why would he hide it I don t want to come right out and ask him about his sexuality because if he hasn t come out then my asking him will not be answered honestly by him anyway I really like this man but my inner voice is telling me he must be gay Masculine Mystique From the Twin Cities Minn Dear Masc Your gentleman friend could be straight or gay but he is definitely effeminate He could be highly repressed he could want to use you as cover he could be in denial about being one of nature s bachelors he could see you as a soul mate or he could genuinely want to build a relationship with you Since you do not want to ask him outright which you may want to reconsider there is a piece of furniture that could go a long way toward answering your question It is called a bed If he shows no interest in going there with you that s a pretty strong indicator of where things are That you felt he was physically attracted to you from his kiss is something to consider Your task now is to decide if you wish to have him in your life as any of the following a bisexual partner a platonic friend or a straight though swishy companion Prudie empirically Dear Prudie I am often greeted with the salutation Hi how are you when I meet my patients in a crowded psychotherapy office waiting room used by many of us I learned quickly not to reply with Fine how are you Some people would launch into their troubled lives no sooner than the last word escaped my mouth At any rate now I have trained myself to answer with Fine or OK Would you advise on a more appropriate reply please Busted Confidence Dear Bust Your noncommittal response Fine or OK is just right in that it does not invite an answer In other words your one word reply is the perfect verbal package shrink wrapped as it were Prudie psychologically Dear Prudence I d appreciate your views on when it s time to settle down and when it s time to settle I m 31 no looker but reasonably attractive in good physical condition well educated and employed in a challenging position that pays well I regularly attend cultural events contribute to my community both monetarily and through volunteering and read voraciously Not surprisingly I would like to meet someone with similar characteristics When I actually do meet such a person I am not afraid to express my interest Unfortunately I find my interest is almost invariably unreciprocated Equally unfortunately I find the people expressing interest in me do not possess the qualities I seek in a partner I am quite comfortable as a single person but I would prefer to develop a personal relationship with someone who can share my interests and characteristics My question to you is at what point if ever does it make sense for someone to abandon wholly or partially his or her search for an ideal partner and settle for someone with a less than complete set of assets Settlement Minded in Our Nation s Capital Dear Set What a thoughtful problem to bring to Prudie You sound extremely desirable if not perfect but obviously something is wrong It might be useful to ask a good friend of either gender from whence your difficulty springs Explain that it would be an act of helpful friendship to be totally honest The idea of settling is an interesting one This probably depends on how badly you wish to be part of a couple Prudie s instinct is to tell you to wait for someone who does seem just right Prudie also understands your wish to make a life deux which is why she has rice marks herself from her various tries It was comforting to read that you are comfortable as a single person Until someone wonderful comes along Prudie hopes that to quote Mauriac you will revel in the pleasure of the unshared bed Prudie uncompromisingly Dear Prudence Surely I am not alone in my complaint weeknights and weekends if there is any kind of game on television my husband is watching it We have no children so I can t stick it to him that he s ignoring the little ones but I feel he is ignoring me and might better spend his time reading or socializing or going to different events What would you do Annoyed in Pound Ridge Dear Ann Prudie would make popcorn If women can have PMS why can t men have ESPN Your spouse sounds as though he s not particularly interested in doing other things so your best bet is to suggest something you d like to go do and ask if he s inclined to go with If not make your own fun go out with the girls start a project read a book If it s a no hoper and the darling jock continues to park himself in front of the tube get into the spirit of things Don t cook Order out In fact you could lay this blessing on him Domino Vobiscum The pizza guy s here Prudie
