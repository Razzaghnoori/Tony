 Groping Toward a New Liberalism With our reaction to the Monica Lewinsky episode we Americans have turned the concept of hypocrisy on its head The French philosopher Fran ois La Rochefoucauld famously praised hypocrisy as the socially useful homage that vice pays to virtue That of course is very French In the United States however it seems that virtue pays homage to vice Have we thought through the implications Americans in large numbers tell pollsters that we disapprove of adultery regularly attend church and would like to see the return of prayer to schools We claim nostalgia for 19 th century moral standards and propel the Book of Virtues to the top of the best seller list Yet almost 60 percent of us according to a New York Times CBS poll last week not only don t think it s our business whether President Clinton had sex with Monica Lewinsky but also would understand if he had lied about it even under oath Until now it has been assumed that the leader of an egalitarian society should at least in aspiration be better not just smarter and braver but more noble than other citizens Now we seem to be engaged in a rapid rewind of the morality tape zipping right through the age of Victoria to the time when the rules of droit du seigneur held sway Then the peasants and bourgeoisie were expected to live lives of probity while the king and his court whored and plundered as they pleased Can this really be us tugging our forelocks and mumbling That s OK boss you go ahead and have a good time we ll just wait out here in the hall and say a few prayers No that s not us Far more likely is that we still regard the president as a role model it s just that like him we prefer his new role We wish we had the protective coterie of government paid procurers and concealers that would let us get away with it That being so serious rethinking is in order before we invest further in public activities incongruent with the new dispensation Some corrections are easy and obvious Send prosecutor Starr off to Pepperdine and let him take all his pokings into S L swindles and FBI file invasions and election fund finagling with him Nobody cares about that other stuff either For a successful politician that s just doin what comes natcherly And let s quit picking on poor Army Sgt Maj Gene McKinney If it s OK for the commander in chief to hit on women in the office why should we prosecute a man so much farther down the military chain of command Sure his satisfied customer ratio seems to have been lower than Clinton s but is that any reason to put a man at risk of a lifetime in jail Let copulation thrive as King Lear would say And as the century ends let us grope our way toward a new liberalism Other changes in federal policy are needed urgently to support the implicit goals of the New Awakening For example we must obviously restore Welfare as We Knew It Here after all was a program Aid to Families with Dependent Children that judged by current lights must be rated one of the most successful social experiments of all time When AFDC rolls began climbing in the late 1960s fewer than 10 percent of American children were born out of wedlock By the time the welfare rolls peaked in 1993 that figure had risen to a gratifying 31 percent To be sure illegitimacy is not a perfect proxy for indiscriminate promiscuity although other indicators venereal disease incidence divorce rates etc track well with it Nor can AFDC take all the credit Other programs Medicaid Food Stamps housing aid special feeding and educational programs for unwed teens and so on certainly provided additional inducements for unguarded sexuality Some people e g our president manage to promiscuate pretty indiscriminately without the incentive of food stamps just as some minority citizens manage to get ahead without affirmative action But an extra incentive from the government surely helps And yet even now in a misguided appeal to a public that misunderstands its own core beliefs President Clinton is presiding over the dismantling of this forward looking program Welfare mothers are being pushed into the work force whence they will stagger home each night lacking the energy for romantic exploration Young men are being told to take responsibility for their sexual behavior and should they slip pay up on child support This threatens to undermine all President Clinton s good work in sending the message that one should get it whenever and however one can Oh and let s cut out all this huffing and puffing about Saddam Hussein He s got oil to sell and we ve got gas guzzlers to keep rolling Anyway by now he has surely squirreled away all that anthrax and poison gas where we ll never find it with bombs or inspectors Keeping all those planes ships and troops on alert is expensive It uses up money that would be much better spent on well tax cuts for all of us And while we re at it isn t it time to jettison all this anal retentive preoccupation with a balanced budget Is paying for what we get really the essential us Listen instead to the subtext of the president s recent acclaimed State of the Union message More spending More tax cuts This surely is where the Clinton sex policy and the Clinton social policy combine He wants us to feel his pleasure And we do
