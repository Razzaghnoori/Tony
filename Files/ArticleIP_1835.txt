 Steve Coz Once upon a time before O J that is supermarket tabloids were journalism s shame Respectable writers sneered at the tabs for their millions of lumpen readers their fabricated or worse purchased stories and their raffish British editors who behaved more like blackmailers than like scions of the Fourth Estate But now the editor of the National Enquirer Steve Coz has a Harvard degree cum laude no less and mainstream cachet In an age when celebrity worship is religion and populism is the dominant political ideology the tabs are pariahs no longer Since taking over as Enquirer editor in 1995 the 40 year old Coz has become the tab industry s first star editor as well as its first respected one In the spring Time named him one of the 25 Most Influential People of 1997 U S News profiled him admiringly soon after And until a couple of weeks ago Coz was considered the leading candidate for the editorship of the New York Daily News one of the most venerated of daily mainstream tabloids The American cult of celebrity has flourished since Walter Winchell and the tabs have been thriving since the early 70s but it s only in the last few years that other journalists have taken the supermarket rags seriously Coz deserves as much credit or blame for this as anyone Before becoming editor Coz directed the Enquirer s massive O J coverage At one point the Simpson case made the cover 21 weeks out of 27 The Enquirer s investigators far outclassed other reporters Thanks to lots of spadework and liberal payments to sources Coz s team tracked down the famous pictures of O J wearing Bruno Magli shoes the harrowing diary of Nicole Brown Simpson and the guy who sold O J a knife right before the murder The Los Angeles Times ran a 5 000 word paean to the Enquirer s feminist coverage and even the New York Times credited Coz s staff with breaking open the story The paper has been equally enterprising during Coz s tenure as editor In the midst of the 1996 presidential campaign it revealed that Bob Dole had had a mistress After the murder of Bill Cosby s son Ennis the Enquirer posted a 100 000 reward opened a phone tip line and fielded the call that led to a suspect s arrest It has covered the JonBenet Ramsey murder doggedly too The Coz vogue owes as much to his public posturing as it does to his investigative reporting Coz casts himself as the conscience of tabloid journalism if that s not an oxymoron When the Globe the Enquirer s hired an airline stewardess to seduce Frank Gifford on hidden camera Coz was shocked shocked He penned an op ed for the New York Times condemning the Globe for making news rather than covering it After Princess Diana s death Coz made the network TV rounds to denounce the paparazzi stalkarazzi and tout the Enquirer s refusal to buy crash scene photos We call on the rest of the press to join our ban on the photos If he gets any more high minded he s going to bang his head on the ceiling This righteousness lies at the heart of Coz s business strategy to make the Enquirer respectable Coz is trying to convince America that the Enquirer is more like People than it is like other tabloids His Enquirer he says abjures paparazzi photos inflammatory and misleading headlines and fabricated stories Coz is more likely to appear on a Sunday talk show round table than on a tabloid TV show He also gets a lot of mileage out of his Harvard degree and his preppy good looks two commodities that old school tabloid editors lacked The Harvard shtick is largely that Coz has spent his entire working life at the Enquirer Coz s grandstanding does reek of hypocrisy He denounced the stalking of Diana but the Enquirer s own cover story at the time of her death was Di Goes Sex Mad complete with snapshots of Diana and Dodi Fayed Coz criticizes the Gifford trap yet defends the similar way the Star the Enquirer s sister paper treated Dick Morris The Star paid Sherry Rowlands to lure Morris to a place where a hidden camera could film them Coz s distinction Morris was carrying on with Rowlands before the Star took pictures while Suzen Johnson didn t approach Gifford until after she had a Globe contract The Enquirer also pays for stories and sources an absolute no no in mainstream journalism and relies on gossip that would never make it past a regular newspaper editor And Coz s Enquirer still depends on sucker punch journalism It is far crueler than People ever would be Celebrities scoff at the claim that the Enquirer is kinder and gentler Coz s Enquirer has been sued frequently for defamation and invasion of privacy After Di s death George Clooney blamed Coz personally for encouraging celebrity stalking And according to gossip columnist Liz Smith three Hollywood superstars have hired private investigators to gather dirt on Coz and two other tabloid editors The misfortune of Coz s career may be that he is gunning for journalistic respectability at a time when journalistic respectability doesn t pay Americans are starving for tabloid style news and everyone wants to feed them Tabloid TV shows such as A Current Affair and Hard Copy have stolen tab papers market share So have reputable TV shows and magazines which now cover celebrity news with as much vigor as the tabs The best JonBenet story ran in Vanity Fair Time Newsweek and People worship stars fad diets and medical miracles almost as avidly as the Enquirer does These mainstream media are eating the tabs lunch The Enquirer s weekly circulation has fallen from 6 million copies in the 70s to 2 7 million today Coz believes he ll reverse this decline by taking or at least talking about the high road Don t count on it Consider the Globe As the respectable media have become sleazy the Globe has become sleazier While Coz preaches decorum the Globe has added more sensationalism more gore more nasty gossip The Enquirer s circulation is stagnant The Globe s circulation is rising fast
