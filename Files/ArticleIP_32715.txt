 Tina Across the Pond In the absence of any major international story to dominate the press newspapers around the world tended to focus Monday on domestic issues Holiday stories were big in Europe The Italian papers reported vast traffic congestion in the peninsula and 38 fatalities on the roads Both La Repubblica of Rome and La Stampa of Turin gave dramatic front page treatment to the heat wave in the United States describing its effects as a massacre Both papers quoted the pope as advocating vacations in monasteries and convents Corriere della Sera of Milan reported a row at the Salzburg Festival in Austria where the authorities have imposed a ban on under 16s attending an erotic edited version of Shakespeare s tragedies The 12 hour theatrical marathon in German is titled Schlachten Battles and is said to include scenes of masturbation and oral sex In Britain a flood of interviews with Tina Brown heralded the launch of her new Hearst Miramax monthly Talk In one article amid many cravenly anonymous predictions of disaster Michael Kinsley of Slate warned people not to bet on her failing In Monday s Guardian Talk s publisher Ron Galotti says You can never never underestimate the fundamental level of interest there is in Tina by which he presumably meant the opposite Brown herself said that during her last six months at The New Yorker she had begun to miss the theatricality of photography to be able to use pictures in ways that were really free and uninhibited and that she wanted to create a new form for a magazine without the institutional history of any publication before me or on my mind The piece described the first issue of Talk as more closely resembling a postmodern version of Life magazine or Paris Match than a Vanity Fair retread Brown said Talk was printed on thin paper to have a roll it up and put it in your pocket European feeling The Sunday Times of London said Talk has a strangely dated feel It said Brown wants to give Talk the feel of the best 1950s magazines such as McCalls and Look as well as Paris Match Those magazines have all been widely admired but it is a long time since they were considered at the forefront of the market In the Sunday Telegraph interviewer Helena de Bertodano said that her first meeting with Brown had been tense because a PR magnate an elderly man with a cut glass English accent had insisted on sitting in on their conversation but that Brown subsequently arranged a one on one meeting for the next day I m sorry about yesterday she said when they reconvened It was embarrassing I didn t expect it On the hostility she was said to have generated Brown said The dogs bark and the caravan moves on right That s just life at the top of the media world Brown acknowledged a link between her departure from The New Yorker last summer and the death of her mother from cancer six days beforehand S he kept telling me that I didn t have enough fun I think she was right and I just felt this job would be tremendous fun What if Talk fails It won t Brown said Already the commercial signs are such that it won t Asked where she sees herself in 10 years time she replied Sitting in a caf in Paris This is definitely the last big roll of the dice as far as I m concerned The Sunday Times led with Talk s first scoop its interview with Hillary Clinton blaming her husband s infidelities on a weakness caused by childhood abuse The same paper carried on its front page an interview with Bill Gates father who manages the William H Gates Foundation The paper said that according to Gates Sr the foundation will announce a number of new funding programs during the next three months that will go a long way toward its ultimate aim of becoming the largest private charity on Earth My son is going to have critics all his life because of his wealth Gates Sr said But I m optimistic now that we have put to rest any criticism on the basis of his not being sufficiently generous We ve pretty much drowned that out The Sunday Telegraph led with the news that the brain of Iris Murdoch the British novelist who died of Alzheimer s disease earlier this year is to be used by research hospitals to help find a cure for the disease Her widower Professor John Bayley said Murdoch long ago expressed a wish for her body to be given to science We were both happy about it in the days when she could be happy about anything he
