 A Philistine s Guide to Italy I just got back from honeymooning in Italy Before I went there I was a philistine Now I m a philistine who s been to Italy I did learn a few things Chiefly I learned that Italian guidebooks are designed for people who are interested in broadening themselves Here s a guide for the rest of us Art In the country the big attraction is villas which charge you a few thousand lire to admire their gardens and sculptures The gardens are half patio and half golf course Some sculptures depict the Count of So and So who used to own the villa Others memorialize his bad taste In cities most of the art is in museums and big churches called duomi The ceilings of the duomi are spectacular So are the floors My wife suggested that we model our bathroom floor after one of them The floors are checkered with marble slabs commemorating rich people The more money you give to the church the bigger your slab and the better your location Basically it works like the Republican National Committee Religion Most of the art in museums is religious The big theme is Jesus There are four kinds of Jesuses Baby Jesus Spurting Jesus Floating Jesus and Propeller Head Jesus Baby Jesus sits in Mary s lap He has adult features and expressions wholly inappropriate to an infant In some paintings he looks like Joe Pesci in others Don Rickles in others Christopher Walken The Uffizi Gallery in Florence has a Baby Jesus that s a dead ringer for Jeff Hornacek of the Utah Jazz Occasionally Baby Jesus suckles at Mary s breast Evidently the artists who painted Mary had never seen a naked woman Her breast starts around the collarbone and takes off like a torpedo Spurting Jesus hangs on the cross and spouts blood from a gash in his chest Lots and lots and lots of blood In the Dormitory of San Marco in Florence there s a whole row of monks cells each of which has a Spurting Jesus on the wall The monks were supposed to meditate on these paintings all day This can t have been helpful Maybe they meditated on whether the Jesus on the cross had a penis He seems to have had one when he was a baby but now bits of fabric are conveniently placed to obscure it Floating Jesus is my favorite He wears a white robe and hovers over the thieves who have just dug up his grave With one hand he makes Mr Spock s live long and prosper sign With the other he carries the flag of some Scandinavian country Propeller Head Jesus has a halo with a red cross in it that looks like a propeller This is the easiest way to identify Jesus Lots of guys in these paintings look like Jesus and they all have halos Sometimes one guy s halo blocks your view of the guy behind him My wife and I spent several minutes discussing a huge mural of the Last Supper before we realized that the guy we thought was Jesus was really Judas Very embarrassing We should have looked for the propeller What it s supposed to convey I don t know What it conveys to me is Hey Over here This one s Jesus I don t mean to be disrespectful to religion I loved the duomi and the little shrines nestled into odd corners of the hill towns But let s face it much of Christian history is bloody awful In San Gimignano there s a whole torture museum specializing in instruments of the Inquisition The skull crusher and rectal pear are particularly memorable The museum charges twice the admission fee that other museums charge and people pay it because basically we love cruelty The museum pretends to teach the lessons of man s inhumanity to man especially man s inhumanity to woman and visitors make the appropriate noises of disgust as they study each device But the truth is we re fascinated One exhibit presents the electric chair as a testament to American brutality I suppose I am a brute On the train to Venice packed into a compartment with several nice old Italian ladies I peered out the window at the sky stretching toward Yugoslavia and pronounced it excellent bombing weather Charming my wife replied coldly as she shrank into her seat D riving If you take the scenic back roads don t expect to notice the scenery You ll spend the whole trip with your eyes glued to the road and occasionally your rearview mirror in which a caravan of Italian drivers will be tailgating you You re too terrified to speed up because the road is narrow and winds sharply around hillsides They can t pass you for the same reason My advice is to take the bus The bus we took along Lake Como to Bellagio careened around dozens of bends any of which could have plunged us hundreds of feet into the lake At first I thought the drivers we passed on that road were nuts Then I saw the bikers They wore racing gear and refused to get out of our way Cars Americans build wide roads and new cities to fit big cars Italians build little cars to fit old cities and narrow roads In Siena the locals drive miniature three wheeled vans pickup trucks and even dump trucks designed to navigate the city s tiny medieval passageways Thanks to the proprietress of our hotel who climbed into the passenger seat and issued directions I maneuvered our Fiat Punto through a 7 foot wide stone maze up and down a series of alleys at harrowing right angles past scaffolding and cafe tables to the parking lot L anguage In preparation for our trip I spent months studying Italian soccer on television I mastered the words portiere goalkeeper colpo di testa header and quattro minuti di ricupero four minutes of injury time Italian is better known as the language of lovers of course which is one reason why people honeymoon there The other reason is that the words husband and wife are easier to practice in a foreign language Less than a week into our marriage we were touring Lake Como on a ferry when we cruised past a wedding party The captain tooted his horn and called out over a megaphone Vivano gli sposi Long live the bride and groom Everyone smiled and sighed The scene was perfectly scripted for a honeymoon What wasn t scripted for a honeymoon was our phrase book which included translations for Is your wife husband here I d like you to use a condom and You can t stay here tonight Part of the problem is that Italian makes everything sound like a sex act Menaggio Dongo Lemna Cadenabbia Faggeto Bellagio And those are just the towns along Lake Como Pigeons Italian piazzas are full of pigeons I hate pigeons They re slow stupid ugly and rude Not only do the Italians feed them they sell bags of birdseed to tourists who in turn feed the pigeons Naturally the pigeons hang out in the piazzas all day cooing and crapping and waiting to be fed Welfare for flying rats I was delighted to discover skyward prongs in the ledges of the Basilico San Marco in Venice designed to prevent pigeons from alighting there I also watched a boy in Lucca try to run over pigeons with his bike My only regret is that I passed up a chance to order roasted pigeon in Florence T ourists The affinity between pigeons and tourists makes sense The tourists too are slow stupid ugly and rude They set off flash bulbs in churches They thrust their fingers within an inch or two of priceless paintings pointing out the obvious Years ago the tourists took snapshots Now they make videotapes They videotape anything that moves and much that doesn t In San Gimignano I watched a man painstakingly videotape a door In Venice I watched tourists on a bridge videotape tourists on a boat who in turn were videotaping the tourists on the bridge Germans Italy is one of their favorite travel spots Somehow this makes me uncomfortable German travel particularly in Europe has never been good news Everyone has their ethnic hang up I suppose this is mine I don t know why Maybe it s that Holocaust thing Not that I hold it against all Germans In fact the hotel we stayed at in Bellagio was run by a nice German family Lovely people And I was becoming quite comfortable with the whole German atmosphere really right up until the Lufthansa flight attendant showed me how to place the mask securely over my nose and mouth and breathe deeply F ood The best advice I got before the trip was from my colleague Jacob Weisberg who said Order the beans If the waiter asks whether you want gas or no gas he s referring not to the beans but to the water which comes with or without bubbles The only bad food in Tuscany is the bread which provides all the blandness of matzot without the moral satisfaction The ice cream varies In San Gimignano it s outstanding In Lucca it s a rip off In Venice every vendor sells the same bad ice cream evidently at the behest of a conglomerate whose boats we saw unloading their sinister cargo at various docks In case you get homesick Venice now has four McDonald s with menus tastefully adapted for Italian sensibilities A McChicken is called a McChicken A Filet o Fish is called a Filet o Fish Cell phones In Venice we saw a man in a green suit and sunglasses prancing around a storefront gesticulating wildly and apparently arguing with himself Eventually we figured out that he was talking to a tiny phone in his ear People go out to eat with friends and spend the whole time yapping with somebody else on the phone In Siena a man and woman dined at the outdoor table next to ours They both wore wedding rings The man had brought his dog along His phone rang and he spent the rest of the meal in what sounded like a playful conversation with a child The woman just went on eating It doesn t add up If the guy wanted to talk to his kid why did he leave the kid at home If the kid was at home why was the dog at the restaurant If the woman was the guy s wife why was he ignoring her If she wasn t his wife why were they wearing rings If she was the kid s mom why didn t the guy hand her the phone I don t get it But then being a philistine is all about not getting it and never having to say you re sorry
