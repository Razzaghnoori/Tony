                     Matthew Purdie         Ive been asked to recount the story of how I first came to be going out with my present girlfriend who more than likely I will end up marrying in year and a half or so         Well the story goes something like this Late November early December dont remember which   I had a dream         I was marrying this one particular individual woman         And as I drove to school the next day with my best friend a guy Ive known longest in the world Jeffrey Mossier we discussed this dream I had         And we discussed it and he said Wow         And I said Jeffrey Im probably going to marry this girl         And well that was like nine years ago         Clears throat So you know we got to know each other a little better wed gone to school together since the seventh grade         And we started doing that flirting thing you know acting like boyfriend and girlfriend flirting doing this that and the other but nothing officially ever happened         So one day a band fruit day a very nasty day kinda funny I asked her out to a movie         It caught her a little bit off guard and she said Yes         And we went and saw one of the poorest movies Ive ever seen in my life Three Men and a Little Lady         Its the sequel to Three Men and a Baby                     Uhhuh                     Anyway we went and saw that movie both of us hated hated it and I think we may have actually hold held hands together in the last half of the movie         Didnt kiss         Then we went to BaskinRobbins and she got some Chocolate Gold Caramel Ribbon ice cream and I got Mint Chocolate Chip and we ate and we made a mess and I drove her home         And that was our first date and how we met                              So what happened after that                     Oh after that         All kinds of things                     Because obviously youre still dating her and its been five years                     We went to the prom together junior year         That was exciting         She was wearing this big huge green Cinderella dress that she wont allow me to mention any longer because she hates it now         And then I ended up giving her my high school class ring cheesy         And on November the first this is a good story playing Ultimate Frisbee with my buddies on Halloween Day and I dove to knock the Frisbee out of somebodys hand         I dove in front of them and as I dove in front him he grabbed the back of my shirt sent all my weight forward and I ended up landing on my thumb and my index finger of my left hand right hand and broke a couple of balls in my wrist         Had to wear a cast for five or six weeks and then another little cast for five or six weeks after that         Stinky hand because I couldnt wash it         Anyway the night afterwards November the first we had gone to a football game in Greensboro or Gastonia Ashbrook         And after the game was over we got back to school and we talked out in the parking lot for what seems to be forever         And I asked her if she wanted to wear it since I couldnt because it would you know the hand had the cast on it         Anyway she said Yeah sure and we giggled and laughed and then we went our separate ways and went home         So all senior year we went out about every Friday movies hanging out with friends doing whatever         And we had a very very we went to the prom together         Then sometime in June or July after we graduated we had a really long talk about what we were going to do because we were going to different colleges                     What schools were you going to                     I went to NC State University in Raleigh NC she went to Wake Forest University in WinstonSalem NC         And its only an hour hour and a half hour and  minutes drive depending on the traffic depending on how fast you fly above the road         But we had a talk about whether or not we wanted to continue dating or whether we wanted to break it off or whether we wanted to continue dating but allow the other to date other people while we were in college         And well the consensus was we should probably keep in touch but that we should give each free reign to to date other people         Well low and behold that never happened for either one of us         And we made it all through six years of college together discussing quite often whether or not we were going to end up marrying each other         And while she ended up taking a job in Atlanta which was a little bit further from Charlotte than WinstonSalem was and she wanted me to move down there         And well I hate the town         The towns too big for its own good         But I did try to get a job down there teaching         Didnt make her happy at all         But well weve gone through some little fights here and there about whether or not I wanted to be down in Atlanta and whether I really wanted to be with her and whether she really wanted to be with me if I didnt really want to follow her at all all the way down there         She thought that         But anyway she is probably going to move back here and we will probably get married and have kids and live the happily ever after Cinderella little story because I am Prince Charming and she is the Princess         What other story shall I tell                     If thats all you want to say thats fine
