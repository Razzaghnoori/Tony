 Night Class By Andrew Hudgins posted Wednesday April 22 To hear the poet read Night Class click He d pull a yellow clipping from his wallet and while you read it he stared in your face The other students scanned the clipping nodded smiled as best they could and gave it backto the pudgy sweaty boy who grinned at themexpectantly They complained and finallyI stopped him after class Uh Mister Kearny maybe you shouldn t uh share with your friendsabout shooting your father I didn t shoot him You didn t No sir I hit him with a bat See he was whipping on my mom againand whipping on me too and then one dayI just got tired of being whipped onand I hit him with my uncle s metal batand just kept hitting till he didn t move I didn t mean to kill him just make him stop His high voice trembled his eyes were fixed on mine I got my picture in the paper He reachedback toward his hip You want to see the clipping That clipping Mister Kearny that s the problem People get very nervous around somebodywho s killed somebody no matter why he killed them Now maybe that s unfair but if you thinkabout it I m sure you ll understand it s true He stared down the emptying hallat a few students heading to their cars their late jobs home Does that make sense to you The twin fire doors wheezed shut behind two girls His face deepened to a face I ve cometo think of on other faces as ancient accepting That makes sense to you now doesn t it I said a little sharply Yeah I guess He was whispering Good Peter I m glad Now don t forget the paper that s due Friday He pushed his way into the stairwell I waiteduntil I heard the outside door clank shutbefore I followed I wanted to be the onewhose leaving let the hall fall into silence silence which I have from talking learned to love But what when no one loved me have I donebut talk talk talk until I ve said like Peter the thing I shouldn t say or as tonight until I ve said exactly what I ve had to say And as I hurtled home past dark tires wailing I howled with every song on the radio screamed some teen age stranger s stupid words shrieked somebody else s rage somebody s lovetill I could bear my own voice and its silence
