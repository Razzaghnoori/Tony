                okay um do you have any advice for college im im im full of advice im still a graduate student so   uhhuh well having been there not too long ago and my wife having only recently completed a doctorate im fairly full of it of it myself uh   oh hum     the main point that i have about choosing where you want to go to school is that definitely you have to early on define what it is you want to do   yeah   or at least what area you want to be in uh i had the unpleasant experience of going through several schools that were very specialized i went through a number of them uh undergraduate schools   hm   before i found a a good school that was more general uh to give me time to make up my mind   oh thats interesting i went to a a liberal arts school actually at first and you werent really even um they didnt expect you to choose any sort of major or anything at all until you were in your second year and then you you know you had i think you had to pick it by the by the by the end of second you had to pick some sort of major but until then they didnt sort of force you they they sort of forced you to run around taking classes in everything until then certain requirements so that so that you had to sort of get a general feel for everything so it wasnt that specialized so that   thats wonderful im a great  proponent of liberal arts education for anybody   yeah yes   uh being an engineer now i believe in it even more strongly than i did before   umhum i was just on a committee recently actually sponsored by uh the American Association for the Advancement of Science trying to sort of you know where where they were just trying to figure out how to fit science and liberal arts together you know because there are people who are getting just wonderful science educations and not getting enough liberal arts and then the other way around as well people are getting just pure technical science educations and not getting very good liberal arts sorts of issues so   well thus far its working to my advantage uh the great gap historically has with engineers has been while they may have all this technical information they have no way of imparting it to except to another engineer   umhum   and i have the ability to listen to them and then translate that into something that non engineers can understand   well that must be helpful   well its a lot of fun at the moment   that could be very helpful yeah well i figure that that that thats probably the thing that i would most tell any parent you know to tell to tell their kids i think probably make sure the kid goes to a school where they can get sort of a general education and save specialization i guess for graduate school unless theyre sure they want early on they want to do something like engineering or something or they can   even at that i have a son that who is only nine at the moment but i see him very rapidly becoming the engineering personality and uh if he decides to pursue that im going to insist that he spend two years at a liberal arts college before ill even let him go to an engineering college and yes thatll add one year to his education experience   hum yeah but thats thats a good idea well where i am right now actually im at the University of Rochester and thats a pretty good engineering school i think i think we do some they have a pretty good engineering here they also have a program a fairly large liberal arts college as well a sort of a separate a separate you know college uh arts arts and sciences college um   yes it is   and i believe the engineers are sort of required to take classes in in in everything and i know people i do uh i do work in language processing and and and at least one person whos in my field started off as an engineer started off as an electrical electrical an electrical engineer student and then switched over at some point into language processing because he found that he enjoyed it more so they do force them people are forced to sort of take all different kinds of classes here which i think is wonderful   oh i agree uh i have the experience uh the last school that i went to was Mississippi State University which is historically an engineering and agricultural school   right   uh the typical land grant university every states got one   umhum   anyway it while it has both engineering and liberal arts the engineering students tend to cluster together you know theyre in classes together even when theyre outside of the engineering department   yes umhum   and they dont learn the communications they dont learn the thought processes of other fields of of endeavor its you know its kind of like   hum   if i were king for a day and got to and got to make one rule         my rule would be no one could get out of high school without an entire year of philosophy   um umhum that would be very good actually   and its thats not even true in our colleges   right you you dont need any philosophy at all in school umhum or some yeah or or or or some other thought provoking area you know very true we had uh when i went to undergraduate we had uh um went to Brandeis dont know if you know of it or not um we had uh uh a requirement freshman year of just humanities then you were given a choice of um you know there were ten or twelve or whatever fifteen or fifteen different courses that that you could take but they all centered they all came out of Philosophy English and Literature departments and they were they were they were a set of assigned readings everybody had to read you know for so the first year Humanities courses everyone had to read the Iliad and and and so forth and what they did though was they all approached it from   right   from very different you know so so they had you could have one class in the philosophy of something that that the philosophy of Greek mythology or something that actually approached this or um one literature you know or a literature a literature course or just all sorts of different perspectives on it and people got to choose pick and choose but but by the end everyone had a good sample of of of sort of how to think about these things non scientifically you know and and uh and that sort of forced them but i believe that that that that that that you one of the one of the best things to do at least for me in school was was i was sort of forced to take lots of different kinds of courses um i was forced to take i think you know some sort of art history course and you we all grumbled about it at first but then afterward we all wound up taking extra art history classes because it just seemed like something we we didnt totally know nothing about but just enjoyed very much doing and something i never would have done if i if if i wasnt forced to take it   yes i really i remember that experience   hum hum   that and uh extra music classes   yes umhum and that and that really is something that that i notice like uh i talk to a lot of my friends at schools that are more specialized and they dont have that they just you know they went in and took their courses that they were expected to take and that was all they never had some of the more fun classes i guess i feel a little more worldly now   well that will continue to grow even as you go beyond graduate school   yes im im im hoping im hoping   have have you gone straight through   yes i i graduated um college in eighty seven and i just went straight through um im finishing up next year so yeah i didnt i didnt take any break or anything yet  ive been trying actually in graduate school ive been trying to do the same thing take courses outside its completely outside my area and im finding that in graduate school its a lot harder because uh i just dont have the time anymore to sort of sit in a course that im not getting graded for whereas before i would just sign up for credit for it now i cant sign up for an art history course for credit necessarily so i have to try and go myself and i went for like two or three weeks and realized not enough time for the work unfortunately   thats true are you pursuing a Masters or a Doctorate   im pursuing a Doctorate in Psychology so im just wind up spending a lot of time doing that instead uh what else i i think i  oh   well let me let me encourage you to stop stop and experience life along the way   oh   i i first enrolled in college in nineteen sixty six   umhum   uh six years and a and a war later uh i got a degree an undergraduate degree and then fifteen years after that i got the first of a set of masters degrees and four years after that i got another masters degree   hum so you had real world experience in the middle there   oh yes      and that helped you think or that was   it certainly it certainly makes acceptance of different ideas a lot easier   umhum hum yeah im getting some of that um i have i have sort of some work experience yet my wife is not an academic at all my wife is sort of in the real world and i so i sort of hinge halfway out in the real world getting you know real world  especially she works in uh um she works in something i she she works for a temporary agency and and i and i never would have had shes the office supervisor i never would have had any ive ive learned much just sort of by watching her and her and her business as well so yeah so i i can see where that might be a   well vicarious learning is a wonderful thing uh you know it certainly means that we dont have to experience everything but experience is a wonderful teacher also   yeah thats my oh yeah yes agreed agreed well ill ill take that ill take that  and think that through a little bit um   my wife as as as i may have mentioned just finished a doctorate a couple of years ago and and she pursued her education along the lines that i did   yes umhum   with lots of break in between and she feels reasonably comfortable teaching now she has an awful lot of experience to draw on no longer is
