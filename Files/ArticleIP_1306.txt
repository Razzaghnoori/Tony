USA Today Praise goes to actors John Cusack Kevin Spacey and Alison Eastwood Clint s daughter for whom critics predict stardom See Sarah Kerr s review in Slate and the official site John Grisham s The Rainmaker Paramount Pictures Francis Ford Coppola s legal thriller is judged the best Grisham film to date as well as a modest comeback for the once great director Reviewers especially like Matt Damon who plays an idealist lawyer taking on a venal insurance company and also praise co stars Danny DeVito and Claire Danes Dissenters say the movie retains Grisham s shallow moralizing and is unworthy of
