 Stranger Than Parody Well if kids aren t going to learn smoking from television then where are they going to learn it It s not like parents are teaching them anymore what with their selfish two career lifestyles Speaking of kids and smoking did you see the New York Daily News today I m back in New York this week and one of my favorite things about returning here is the careful division of labor among the city s newspapers They seem to have a tacit understanding that the Times will supply the city with its news and the tabloids will supply those things that people actually want to read about One is never in danger of finding out about say the latest news from the Canadian prime minister in the Post Similarly one will never read about the latest exploits of Mr Sean Puffy Combs and Miss Jennifer Lopez in the Times Essay question How would each paper cover it should Mr Sean Puffy Combs ever bitch slap the Canadian prime minister I d imagine each would have to have a nut graf identifying one of the participants The Times Mr Combs is a hip hop producer and musician The Post Canada is a large country several hundred miles to the north of New York Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Affleck went there once In any case Page 1 of the Daily News is about herbal cigarettes tobacco free cigarettes that seem to be marketed at kids as a sort of on ramp to smoking What I love about it is the pack they chose to illustrate the story is something called Herbal Gold Cherry Flavor and it depicts a jolly leprechaun with a shamrock in one hand and a cigarette in the other It is so perfect so absurd that it s one of those increasingly common instances where real life defies parody Had you and I spent weeks trying to mock a cigarette company targeting kids we couldn t have come up with something so perfect This seems to be part of a larger trend of real life outpacing satire There is for instance the much remarked upon fact that Wag the Dog which I m sure seemed daring and bold when it was being filmed had become tepid and understated by the time it hit theaters Years ago I remember seeing an episode of The Critic in which Jay Sherman attended a Broadway musical based on The Hunchback of Notre Dame it seemed funny at the time but less so when Disney released a musical version of Hunchback of Notre Dame a few years later And remember how in The Player Richard E Grant keeps pitching a project called Habeas Corpus about a woman on Death Row who falls in love with her lawyer Ever see Last Dance Speaking of self parody have you seen the cover of the latest Brill s Content It features a giant close up of JonBenet Ramsey s head along with the following cover language Why does the three year old murder of a little girl continue to captivate the media Because there s fast cash to be made even if it means letting tabloid tactics and undisguised spin rule the story Not of course that Brill s Content would ever do something so exploitative as to plaster a dead child s image across the cover of its oh wait Never mind I can t wait for next month s issue of the magazine featuring a scantily clad model and the caption Why does Penthouse feature nude pictorials Because there s fast cash to be made even if it is degrading to women More pictures inside pages 65 to 78 Brill s has by the way been mysteriously silent on the AOL Time Warner merger Or at least its Web site has not a peep since the deal was announced Since we both work at Time Warner publications do you have any thoughts on being owned by AOL now I actually quite enjoy the new system they ve put in place in our lobby so that every time I enter the building a voice announces You ve Got Tim Best Tim
