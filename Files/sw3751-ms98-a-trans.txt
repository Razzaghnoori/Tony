   are you Bob    i am in Plano where are you   oh okay i am in Waco   is that right oh okay   yeah right down the street      oh credit cards my favorite subject   you mean you use credit cards   oh do i uh   i bet you used them all up over Christmas   yeah mostly over Christmas uh i get in a rut with credit cards cause they get me kind of in a vicious cycle where you use them a lot one month and then you have to use whatever money you have to pay those off     and then your are in debt   and so then you have no money  so you use a credit card    i understand that   so yeah uh i probably have one of every credit card there is      do you use them a lot   well uh it kind of comes and goes uh i use uh Citibank uh the Advantage one pretty much because you get   uhhuh   Advantage points for every dollar you spend and once a year i get a free airplane ride that way   oh   so as long as you pay it off every month it doesnt cost you anything   yeah yeah well that is a good idea   so that is what i   that through a Visa   yeah   uhhuh   yeah   huh   but uh i got all sorts of credit cards for my business that i use but uh   uhhuh   if i can get away with paying them off every month it is alright if i dont then it gets expensive   yeah yeah that is my problem i dont try and pay them off i pay like the minimum but i know  so i have got myself   well you shouldnt do that you you you never you you you never get out of the hole that way   exactly i have got that is why i have got myself with all this trouble now      but i pay most of them on time and everything it is just the i always have them      so it is kind of strange   kind of like the federal government right   oh yeah exactly like the government  in    never never get out of debt   in debt for   and any time you try to get out of debt the economy goes to pot because people are spending money right   yeah yeah      have they put the cap on the interest rates   so no   i didnt know if they actually did that or not i know they were  i know they were considering it   no just the people who dont need credit get the four and a half percent the rest of the uh and me we got to pay fourteen and eighteen percent so   uhhuh yeah      funny how that works isnt it    thou thou who doesnt need credit gets cheap credit   i would be interested to find out how many people or how much uh people use credit this year say in nineteen ninety two as opposed to nineteen ninety one even nineteen ninety i think i think it be amazing how much how many more people use it   well i think so because the   because of the economy yeah   thats right right you have got to use everything you have got just to stay where you are at   exactly   yeah   i would be very i would like to see some numbers on that i think that would be interesting   do you do you have any uh credit union or anything where you work or anything like that do you   yeah i have a credit union   we have a Master Card or Visa too   yeah they do uhhuh   you got that one   yes i do  yes i do a matter of fact    who who do you work for   uh i work for Channel six   oh   its its an NBC affiliate down here   yeah i do a lot of work down in Waco a lot of i call on a lot of my business is down there   oh really oh okay where do you work what is your   yeah i sell metal fabricating equipment and tooling and uh   oh okay   Tyme and Mercury and Tempco and

where Davis Iron Works is   you know you know uh Parker Machine Tool down there   uh   Bobby Parker   i dont think i have seen that one i am sure i pass by it or something but i am not sure   there is a place in Hewett called it is a new company called Prime Air that is in Hewett just around the corner from Davis Iron Works   huh Prime Air   yeah they make uh humidifiers and uh filters for air filtration stuff for you know hospitals homes something like that its a new kind   oh okay okay have you ever been to Marlin   uh yeah   i think it is Marlin or Mart they have uh uh a place i guess that would be similar to Prime Air it is called H G H or something like K G H or   oh really huh   i cant think of i cant think of the name but   i will have to stop in there i went i have gone through there uh my oldest son goes to AM and   uhhuh oh yeah   he is working on his Masters the Navy sent him there for his Masters mostly in Engineering so once and a while we go up six there rather than take forty five   uhhuh uhhuh yeah   that is about the last time i have been through Marlin and Mart   uhhuh oh i dont like that drive i make that drive sometimes we have stories out there but    there is always a state trooper down there you have got to drive careful   huh  oh really i know   between Mart and Marlin they will nail you if you go over sixty miles an hour   oh goodness they they
