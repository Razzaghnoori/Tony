 President Clinton concluded his summit with Russian President Boris Yeltsin and nearly everyone declared it a success 1 The two leaders agreed to reduce nuclear missile warheads 2 Yeltsin acquiesced to NATO expansion to Poland Hungary and the Czech Republic 3 Clinton accepted an expanded Russian role in the G 7 The half cynical view is that Russia hasn t made its peace with NATO expansion but is just too weak to stop it The completely cynical view is that there is no reason the United States should care about this distinction For a primer on NATO expansion see Slate s The Gist 3 24 Webster

in a last ditch attempt to salvage some part of the power he once held Analysts see no real future for him He is gradually dying of prostate cancer and has no leverage because his troops are getting whipped by rebels who are expected to roll through the capital sometime soon Instead of a military victory Mobutu now seems to be angling for some kind of coalition government playing off his chief political rival in the capital against the military leader of the rebel forces The general consensus is that the rebel leader holds all the aces For a backgrounder on Zaire see Slate s The Gist 3 24

Aviv who killed three bystanders and wounded dozens more The United States dampened criticism of Netanyahu s refusal to halt an inflammatory Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem and stepped up pressure on Arafat to crack down on Islamic extremists 3 24 The American Cancer Society recommended annual mammograms for women in their 40s This contradicts the National Cancer Institute advisory board s recent recommendation that the benefits to women in their 40s didn t necessarily justify the cost and that these women should decide for themselves whether to undergo the test The NCI under heavy political pressure is expected to reverse that recommendation this week The prevailing wisdom now is that the decide for yourself advice was too confusing and that women need to be told exactly what to do 3 24 The FBI may soon get its hands on a suspect in the Saudi air base bombing Canadian authorities have detained a Saudi citizen suspected of driving either the truck or the getaway car used in the bombing which killed 19 American soldiers and wounded 500 others U S investigators believe the man Hani Abdel Rahim Sayegh is a Shiite Muslim possibly connected to the Iran supported

136 better than a two thirds majority which means that opponents of the ban must once again depend on the Senate to sustain a presidential veto Despite all the hoopla over a pro choice advocate s confession that he had lied about the circumstances under which the procedure is generally used only five lawmakers switched their votes from no to yes See Slate s Abortion Apostate on the partial birth abortion debate 3 21 The tobacco industry suffered a potentially catastrophic defection The smallest of the major tobacco companies the Liggett Group agreed to a settlement with attorneys general from 22 states who had sued to recoup money spent on health care for smokers The media focused on Liggett s admissions of the obvious that cigarettes are addictive and cause cancer and heart disease and its agreement to pay the states a quarter of its relatively small pretax profits for the next 25 years The more important concessions however were 1 Liggett s admission that the industry had consciously marketed tobacco to minors which will increase congressional support for stiff regulation of the industry and 2 its release temporarily blocked by a North Carolina court of documents from strategy meetings among lawyers for the five biggest tobacco companies which industry critics believe will prove a conspiracy of deceit Also the tobacco executives who told Congress they didn t consider nicotine addictive might now be prosecuted for fraud and perjury As for Liggett s motive industry and financial analysts speculated that Liggett s CEO hoped to make the marginally profitable company a more attractive merger partner by eliminating its exposure to possibly huge jury awards 3 21 President Clinton nominated CIA Deputy Director George Tenet to become CIA director Tenet

note but weren t buying the martyrdom in Lake s case Their reactions 1 Lake had shown poor ethical judgment and would have been lousy at the CIA job anyway 2 He s a wimp for succumbing to a couple of right wing punks Sens Richard Shelby and James Inhofe 3 His martyr pose is pretentious and self serving 4 Nominee stoning is what the two party system and separation of powers are for 5 The Democrats are reaping what they sowed after torturing Robert Bork John Tower and Clarence Thomas 6 It s Clinton s fault for creating the foreign money scandal and thereby bringing suspicion and scrutiny on everything Lake did 7 Once again Clinton failed to go to the mat for a nominee in trouble 8 Labor Secretary nominee Alexis Herman who was closer to the fund raising mess will now be confirmed easily because the Senate is satisfied with having killed Lake 3 21 ABC News president David Westin is the latest star in the network news soap opera USA Today implied that Westin s predecessor the legendary Roone Arledge is being kicked upstairs because ABC is losing the ratings war to NBC The rap on Westin is that he s a lawyer and corporate boss who has no news experience The counter arguments are 1 neither did Arledge he came from the sports division and 2 Arledge will tutor Westin for a while The substantive issue at stake is hard news vs soft news Each network is accusing the others of going soft in pursuit of ratings Westin says he wants ABC to get back to hard news Instead the media are swarming over Westin s alleged relationship with ABC s PR chief Sherrie Rollins who not only was his
