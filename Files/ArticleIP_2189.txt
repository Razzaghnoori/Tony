 Search and Ye Shall Find Starting this week you can search Slate including The Compost our archive for specific words or phrases Use this feature to find articles by a particular author or a reference to a particular subject Slate Search is located on the Compost page but search results will include current articles within a day of their posting as well as older ones If Slate Search isn t available when you go to check it will be shortly The rules are pretty simple A search for Bill Gates or Bill Gates or Bill and Gates will find articles containing both the word bill and the word gates A search for Bill Gates in quotes will find articles containing the exact phrase bill gates The search is not case sensitive i e capitalization doesn t matter A few more pointers It is possible to search for words other than Bill Gates but that is not recommended and Slate cannot be held responsible for the result A search for Bill Gates will find only favorable references To find unfavorable references search somewhere else You Can Make the Slate 60 People make two justified complaints about our Slate 60 ranking of America s largest contributors to charity Indeed we make these complaints ourselves First the list is not a very accurate measure of sacrifice for good causes since it doesn t factor in a person s wealth or income In fact few if any members of the Slate 60 have had to suffer any diminution of their lifestyle as a consequence of having given away money Second the Slate 60 list does not attempt to weigh the merits of different charities Much of the money given away by the Slate 60 goes to finance new buildings at already wealthy universities We think these defects aren t fatal The Slate 60 list still serves to encourage and acknowledge extraordinary generosity by people who after all don t have to give the money away however painless that might be And ranking by size of gift provides a useful objective measure But we d also like to acknowledge extraordinary generosity by people for whom it hurts and to encourage more imaginative giving Therefore at the suggestion of occasional Slate contributor and Atlantic Monthly national correspondent Nicholas Lemann we invite nominations for a Supplemental 60 better name forthcoming let s hope E mail your suggestions to Slate s Washington editor Jodie T Allen at letters slate com She says she ll be looking for contributions that are innovative or at least interesting though not wacky and or wouldn t normally result in either the donor s name being inscribed in granite or his or her being honored at a glitzy dinner or other ceremony and or represent a significant sacrifice or effort by the donor and no or are likely to result in some tangible good recognizing that everyone won t agree with our or the donor s definition thereof The first challenge to potential nominees obviously is to parse the Boolean logic of these standards Would that Slate s new search engine were so sophisticated But Jodie points to the story this week of the woman who pledged anonymously 2 000 to each family in Grand Forks N D that was victimized by the Red River flood as an example of what we re looking for This woman s generosity could cost her 10 million And it may not even be tax deductible Michael Kinsley
