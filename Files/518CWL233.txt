 Dear Friend Thank you for your interest in futures for Children whose mission is to improve the well being of children by helping people help themselves One of the ways we achieve this mission is through our Friendship Program for American Indian children Enclosed is information that describes this program as well as our community education initiatives in over 20 American Indian Nation We invite you to participate in Futures for Children by sponsoring an American Indian child or by joining a Membership Circle to support our community education projects Futures for Children was founded over 30 years ago to provide unique solutions for positive and sustainable social change by placing children at the center of community decision making and action For example The people of Batavia on the Hopi Reservation in northern Arizona were motivated by their desire to rekindle traditional cultural values among younger generations when with the help of Futures for Children they decided to restore traditional terrace gardens at the edge of their village gardens that had been abandoned for decades During the reconstruction project elders took advantage of the opportunity not only to teach Hopi language and culture to their children but also to restore a sense of balance and spiritual integrity to their community Now as children tend their gardens they have a new appreciation of their relationship to the land their cultural heritage and their community In 80 reservation communities in the Southwest over 2 000 American Indian children participate in Futures Friendship Program building cross cultural ties with adult mentors from around the nation and Europe By means of supportive relationships developed through letters phone calls and visits children are encouraged by their sponsors to stay in school to be involved in their communities and to learn about the world beyond their reservations the relationship formed between a child and a sponsor often lasts a lifetime Futures for Children relies on the generosity of individuals like you by board policy we do not accept government or United Way funds Furthermore approximately 75 of our total income is expended directly on program activities Because of this and other factors Futures has earned an A rating from the American Institute of Philanthropy as well as the highest rating of the National Charities Information Bureau NCIB We appreciate your taking time to read about Futures for Children I hope you are inspired to become a Sponsor and or a Member Our staff would enjoy sharing additional information about our work and answering any questions you may have Please call us any time at 1 800 545 6843 Sincerely Jim West President and Chief Executive Officer
