 okay well uh i guess uh you re pretty aware that it s uh been uh a little warm for this time of year oh yeah it uh the humidity s a little higher it is this is muggy today like it wants to rain but it don t know what it wants to you know for this time of year uh huh you know about a month from now this wouldn t be so bad but uh boy for the end of March this is uh this is funny no really bad yeah funny weather but bad because that means it either means one or two things it s going to be a bad summer or a not too good summer and a worse winter next year oh jeez well that s a good way to look at it i always do that i got to do something like that with the weather well if you do that then you ll only be pleasantly surprised probably if it s anything but that that s right that s uh that s uh but uh i i guess the winter the winter wasn t that bad down here really no see that s it was a mild winter that s why i keep saying oh no yeah looking looking forward to a really bad summer and hot summer yeah i think it s going to be really hot this year well hopefully you know if it s humid now maybe it ll i remember last year it rained an awful lot or uh you know for the last couple of years it s rained an awful lot and maybe that ll help to defeat some of the heat yeah um hum and if uh if it rains a lot but uh but uh if it rains if it rains any more and gets really hot then we have this problem with mosquitoes oh yeah you re right yeah yeah i used to live in up north up in the upper midwest and uh see and we had had mosquito mosquito problems that s for sure well see i would prefer the cold i m from southern California oh really but see the heat out here ain t nothing well you know it s it s that easy to say but boy when it s forty below and you re shoveling snow and it s forty below it s uh no i don t want to get that cold now it uh that s just the bad thing you either you either have to take the take this kind of weather or uh or take the really really cold weather i don t think no i don t want to go no where up north no where does it go in any any where north of the Red River huh uh i don t even want to go anywhere yeah that s about it that s uh i that s what i ve heard people say is they ll never go north of the Red River again that s right it s too cold up there um hum and then last year that s when they really had that cold spell um hum you know it was like um record breaking below temperatures and stuff in Alaska where your gas your car was freezing while it was running you know the gas oil or the gas would turn to slush huh uh see i can t handle that yeah i i know what you mean because uh because you got to have like little oil heaters where they plug in the uh plug in uh your car um hum yeah and uh that s not good that s not good at all and uh no something happens then what well i guess the only thing to do is to hope that this is the worse that it gets this year yeah it s not that bad right now i just hope it don t get any worse yeah or if it if it does get worse it doesn t stay for very long that s about it i m just waiting because see it s tornado season oh that s right that s right because yes it is it s tornado season already already hit Oklahoma and probably right down here soon so um hum you see this is this is tornado weather boy people don t know it but when it gets hot like this yeah and you know like they re predicting the weather to be cold well when it gets cold real fast um hum um hum get a northerner through here there s your tornados that s right and so they re predicting this weekend probably drop something like thirty degrees i say huh uh see that ain t right that s right no no no it s uh but that s that s tornado season yeah and i guess i guess that s shows what they say about Dallas if you don t like the weather just just wait a day yeah it ll change on you wait a while it ll change that s right that s about like it is too because yesterday was really nice um hum uh huh and the wind was blowing but today is muggy but the wind is still blowing but you know i don t know the weather well anyway i guess that s about all i got to say about the uh the weather that s about it that s about all you can say about the weather okay talk about it but can t do anything about it uh okay that s right all righty thank you bye bye all right bye bye
