 Cuomo Family Values They thought I was being paranoid when I suggested the Clinton administration might alter its food stamp policy to help Hillary Clinton run for Senate against New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani Hey I thought I was being paranoid But within hours of that alarmist item which also suggested that Housing and Urban Development secretary Andrew Cuomo was gunning for Giuliani Cuomo had dramatically seized control of 60 million in federal homeless money earmarked for New York taking it away from the mayor Cuomo s rationale A federal judge had ruled that Giuliani acted with retaliatory intent in cutting funds to the advocacy group Housing Works which has criticized the mayor s AIDS policies But this rationale was self refuting Giuliani s retaliation had already been blocked by the judge who presumably has the power to correct any impropriety and restore the group s funding With the judge on Giuliani s case who needed Cuomo Unless of course the Democrats feared the judge s ruling would be overturned on appeal Meanwhile Cuomo was engaging in political retaliation at least as blatant as that of which Giuliani was accused We cannot allow federal funds to be politicized Cuomo actually declared as he politicized federal funds If HUD seized back control of its funds every time a mayor was sued by an advocacy group and lost in district court it would soon run out of mayors But New York is the only city HUD has done this to Cuomo s motive Dick Morris suggests in a recent column was not so much to embarrass Giuliani on the homeless issue as to bait him into an angry outburst If that was the strategy it partially worked Giuliani blasted HUD though he didn t come unhinged But this small victory for Hillary came at a cost of some embarrassment to Cuomo who now looks a little like a partisan thug and a disloyal thug at that since Giuliani risked his career to endorse Andrew s father Mario in the 1994 New York governor s race Question Has Andrew Cuomo really thought this through Does he really want to risk becoming known in his home state as a Shill for Hill Does he want to tie his career to hers subordinate the now venerable Cuomo political dynasty in New York to a newly cobbled up Clinton dynasty he ll have to live with for the next decade as Senator H Clinton plots her inevitable run for President Just a thought Andrew You might consult your father on this Actually through Andrew Cuomo s wife Kerry Kennedy Cuomo who announced her husband s homeless power play to cheers at a Democratic Christmas function the Clintons have succeeded in subordinating not one but two dynastic Democratic families to their own Note Kausfiles Y2K policy should be in place shortly
