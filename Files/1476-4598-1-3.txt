 Background Converging points of evidence implicate infection by high risk human papilloma virus HPV types as a critical etiologic factor in cervical tumorigenesis 1 Epidemiological and experimental data however show that only a small fraction of HPV infected cervical intraepithelial neoplastic CIN lesions progress to invasive cervical carcinoma CC 2 These findings suggest somatic genetic mutations play a critical role in the initiation and progression of CC Delineation of these genetic changes is crucial to understanding the molecular basis of CC A number of genetic changes have been identified so far in invasive CC However the precise mechanism of each of these genetic alterations in the multi step pathway of cervical tumor development is largely unknown The development of CC is preceded by distinct morphological changes from normal epithelium to carcinoma through low grade and high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions SILs The genetic basis of this progression is also poorly understood Cytogenetic and molecular genetic analyses have identified the short arm of chromosome 5 5p as frequently affected by duplications and deletions in a high proportion of CCs 3 4 5 6 These findings suggest the presence of positively regulated amplified oncogenes and negatively regulated tumor suppressor genes TSGs on this chromosomal arm Comparative genomic hybridization CGH a molecular cytogenetic method that identifies chromosomal gains and losses and loss of heterozygosity LOH studies have also demonstrated recurrent deletions on the 5p in precancerous lesions 7 8 9 10 Although these studies have identified 5p as a commonly affected region the precise site of deletion that harbor putative TSG is unknown because of the lack of systematic and detailed deletion mapping studies To further characterize the 5p region in CC we performed a high resolution deletion mapping in invasive cancer and found that 60 of patients exhibit LOH We identified two sites of minimal deletions at 5p15 3 and 5p15 2 15 3 spanning 5 5 cM and 7 cM genetic distance respectively We have also shown that the 5p15 region deletions occur in 16 of high grade CIN lesions Here we have identified two sites of candidate tumor suppressor genes and confirmed the previous reports that the 5p deletions occur in a small proportion of precancerous lesions Results Identification of two regions of minimal deletions at 5p15 2 p15 3 Analysis of LOH in 60 invasive CCs using 20 STRP markers mapped to 5p showed deletions in 36 of 60 60 tumors in at least one marker Table 1 Of the 36 tumors with LOH 17 47 2 had LOH at all the informative markers suggesting genetic monosomy of 5p Fig 1 The patterns of LOH in the remaining 19 tumors that exhibited regional losses on 5p were used to map the common deleted regions Fig 1 This has identified two minimal deletions at 5p15 3 and 5p15 2 15 3 Fig 1 Fig 2 All the tumors that defined the minimal deletions showed more than 60 reduction in signal intensity in the deleted alleles The distal 5p15 3 deletion spans the telomeric region encompassing D5S392 D5S678 and D5S417 markers in 32 tumors Although two tumors T 13 and T 49 showed deletions of terminal marker D5S392 alone at 0 cM genetic distance which is the distal most marker on 5p we considered the deletion boundaries defined by the proximal marker D5S417 in tumors T 6 and T 105 Fig 1 Fig 2 The second and proximal region of deletion spans 6 markers D5S406 GATA82H02 D5S1455 D5S2054 D5S635 and D5S676 and was deleted in 28 tumors The deletion boundaries were defined proximally by the tumors T 59 and T 66 while the distal boundary was identified by the tumors T 59 and T 114 Fig 1 Fig 2 All tumors that showed 5p deletions fell within the two defined regions of deletions while 25 tumors exhibited deletions at both regions Thus this analysis identified two discrete and closely mapped sites of minimal deletions at 5p15 3 and 5p15 2 15 3 which were restricted to 5 5 cM and 7 cM genetic distance respectively Gene expression analysis of candidate tumor suppressor genes in CC cell lines In an effort to identify the genes inactivated in the recurrent 5p deletions in CC we identified candidate genes with tumor suppressor function Three genes were identified at the terminal 5p15 3 deletion These include PDCD6 a protein that plays a role in T cell receptor FAS and glucocorticoid induced cell death 11 TERT a gene that encodes a reverse transcriptase component of telomerase dysfunction of which promotes chromosomal instability 12 and TRIP13 a thyroid hormone receptor interacting protein that binds with the human papillomavirus type 16 HPV16 E1 protein 13 We have identified POLS gene that encodes a DNA polymerase sigma and plays a role in DNA replication and sister chromatid cohesion at the proximal minimal deleted region 14 We performed a semi quantitative RT PCR analysis of all four genes PDCD6 TERT TRIP13 and POLS in eight CC cell lines and did not find evidence for lack of or down regulated expression compared to normal cervix Fig 3 5p deletions in relation to HPV 5p deletions did not show any significant differences with age at diagnosis and stage of the tumor data not shown Fifty eight 96 7 of the 60 tumors studied were positive for HPV DNA The remaining two tumors were HPV negative HPV 16 alone or in combination with other HPV types was found in 46 tumors while 12 tumors had other HPV types including HPV 18 5p LOH was found in 29 of 46 63 HPV 16 positive tumors while only 4 of 12 33 tumors with other HPV types had 5p LOH The two tumors that did not harbor HPV infection also had LOH at 5p These differences were found to be statistically not significant Chi square 4 93 p 0 10 However when the analysis was restricted to HPV16 harboring tumors it was found that the patients harboring HPV16 DNA alone had 5p LOH in 20 of 36 55 6 tumors while the patients infected with HPV16 in combination with other HPV types exhibited 9 of 10 90 LOH This difference was found to be statistically significant Chi square 8 75 p 0 05 5p deletions occur at low frequency in precancerous lesions To understand the role of 5p deletions in cervical cancer progression we evaluated LOH in 26 microdissected CIN specimens 25 high grade CINs and one low grade CIN using four STRP markers Table 2 Four of the 25 informative tumors had LOH at one or more markers One low grade CIN did not show LOH Thus deletions at 5p identified in high grade CINs suggest that these genetic alterations occur prior to development of invasive carcinoma Discussion Extensive genetic studies have documented frequent alterations affecting various chromosomal regions in CC LOH and CGH analyses have consistently shown frequent loss of genomic material in a number of chromosomal regions suggesting the presence of potential tumor suppressor genes at these sites 4 6 15 16 Of these chromosome 5p deletions have been noted to be very frequent in invasive CC 5 6 7 However the locations of exact regions of LOH are not known because of a lack of systematic and high resolution deletion mapping of the 5p region in CC We have previously identified that markers mapped to 5p15 regions are more frequently deleted 4 7 To further characterize the 5p deletions in CC we performed a high density LOH mapping in the present study We found high frequency of LOH and identified two minimal regions of deletions at 5p15 3 and 5p15 2 15 3 The 5p15 3 minimal deletion spans between 0 5 5 cM genetic distance Consistent with this pattern the markers D5S392 and D5S417 exhibited the highest frequency 53 8 and 53 6 respectively of LOH among all the tested loci The genomic size of the 5p15 3 deletion interval is approximately 3 2 Mb A database search has identified three candidate genes PDCD6 TERT and TRIP13 with suggestive tumor suppressor gene function The programmed cell death gene PDCD6 is a member of the family of intracellular Ca2 binding proteins and a part of the apoptotic machinery controlled by T cell receptor TCR Fas and glucocorticoid signals 11 17 TERT encodes a reverse transcriptase required for the replication of chromosome termini and plays a role in telomere elongation Although telomerase expression is a hallmark of cancer the mice lacking the RNA component of telomerase mTERC exhibit progressive telomere shortening and chromosomal instability associated with epithelial tumors 12 Consistent with the established role of this enzyme in cell immortalization and cancer pathogenesis 18 we did not find expression in normal cervix while it was abundantly present in all eight cell lines studied Fig 3 Recently it has been shown that the hTERT amplification and over expression is common in CC 19 TRIP13 thyroid receptor interacting protein 13 is a transcription factor that regulates expression of a variety of specific target genes including the human papillomavirus type 16 HPV16 E1 protein 13 Similar to TERT the TRIP13 also showed very low expression in normal cervix and highly elevated levels of expression in CC cell lines Fig 3 Presence of these genes at the 5p15 3 interval suggests that they may be target TSGs of these deletions in CC However expression analysis of these genes did not provide evidence of down regulation in CC cell lines The second site of minimal deletion at 5p15 2 15 3 between 10 7 and 17 7 cM genetic distance spans approximately 2 5 Mb genomic region A database search has identified POLS a topoisomerase related function protein 4 1 gene that encodes polymerase DNA directed sigma within the deleted region The yeast homolog TRF4 plays a critical role in chromosome segregation by coordinating between DNA replication and sister chromatid cohesion 14 Analysis of expression of this gene in CC cell lines did not show evidence of down regulation Although the genes tested so far showed no deregulated expression it remains to be seen whether any of these genes or the others mapped to the minimal deleted regions are targets of mutations in CC However the present study identified two discrete sites of deletions at 5p15 3 and 5p15 2 15 3 that harbor putative TSGs important in CC development providing a basis for their identification 5p deletions also have been reported in precursor CIN lesions with the frequencies between 14 7 and 42 7 8 9 10 We have previously shown in a different geographical population that 21 of CINs had 5p deletions Based on the follow up studies we suggested that 5p genetic deletions might identify high risk lesions for progression to invasive cancer 7 In a more recent study it was also shown that the 5p deletions were significantly more frequent in dysplasias that were recurrent compared to non recurrent dysplasias 9 These data therefore suggest that 5p genetic alterations occur early in cervical carcinogenesis and they may be critical to the development of invasive cancer Supporting previous reports in the present study we detected LOH at 5p15 in 16 of the high grade CINs Table 2 The role and mechanisms involved in high risk HPV induced genomic instability has been of a considerable speculation reviewed in ref 20 High risk HPV E6 and E7 gene expression can independently immortalize various human cell types in vitro The E6 gene interacts with p53 and an apoptotic protein BAK followed by its degradation which results in chromosomal instability and resistance to apoptosis 21 22 The E7 protein interacts with pRB followed by its degradation 23 The p53 and pRB proteins have been shown to play multiple roles in cell growth and in genomic integrity There have been contradictory reports on targeted 5p deletions in relation to HPV infection 5 24 Ku and co workers have shown that 5p deletions occur in significantly high proportion of CC infected with HPV 16 compared to low risk HPVtypes 5 Contradictory to this another study has shown that 5p deletions are independent of HPV16 and HPV18 infection 24 In the present study we did not find any significant differences in 5p LOH between patients harboring HPV16 and other HPV types However we found that patients harboring HPV16 in combination with other HPV types showed significant increase in 5p loss compared to patients harboring HPV16 alone These data therefore suggest that multiple high risk HPV infections may have synergistic effect in causing genomic instability Thus currently it is unclear the role of high risk HPV types in causing 5p genomic instability Further studies are needed to address this question Conclusions In summary the present study confirms our previous observations that genetic loss of 5p is a common feature of invasive CC Here we identified two common sites of deletions that harbor candidate tumor suppressor genes on this chromosomal arm and showed that multiple infection of high risk HPV types may cause targeted genomic instability at 5p In addition we have shown that the genetic deletions on 5p occur early during the development of CC in high grade CIN lesions Our identification of minimal deletions on 5p and LOH in CINs has several potential implications First it should facilitate the identification of the target genes of importance in cervical tumorigenesis Second it may provide critical genetic markers for identifying cervical intraepithelial neoplasias at high risk to progression Methods Tumor and normal tissues We analyzed 60 tumor biopsies consisting of previously untreated primary invasive CCs with the corresponding peripheral blood samples and 26 formalin fixed
