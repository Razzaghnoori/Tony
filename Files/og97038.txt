MAJOR RULE ISSUED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ENTITLED INDIVIDUAL MARKET HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM PORTABILITY FROM GROUP TO INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE FEDERAL RULES FOR ACCESS IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET STATE ALTERNATIVE MECHANISMS TO FEDERAL RULES RIN 0938 AH75 i Cost benefit analysis HHS in conjunction with the Departments of Labor and Treasury has prepared a combined economic impact analysis for this interim final rule and the interim final rule issued jointly by the three Departments and published the same day in the Federal Register concerning group market provisions because the effects of the reforms and burdens imposed overlap the same group of issuers 62 Fed Reg 16908 16920 For the portability from group to individual coverage under this rule HHS cites estimates formulated by the Congressional Budget Office which shows the initial yearly cost direct cost to the private sector to be 50 million with 45 000 people covered and 200 million by the fifth year with 150 000 people covered The analysis also discusses social welfare effects of the rule such as freeing people from job lock the inability to change jobs because of the possible loss of coverage ii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 U S C 603 605 607 and 609 Since the rule was issued as an interim final rule and not as a general notice of proposed rulemaking the rule is not subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act iii Agency actions relevant to sections 202 205 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 2 U S C 1532 1535 Since the rule was issued as an interim final rule and not as a general notice of proposed rulemaking the rule is not subject to the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 GAO OGC 97 38 iv Other relevant information or requirements under acts and executive orders Administrative Procedure Act 5 U S C 551 et seq Section 2792 of the Public Health Service Act 42 U S C 300gg 92 provides that the Secretary of HHS may promulgate any interim final rules determined to be appropriate to carry out the provisions of Part B of the act The Secretary has determined that there is good cause under section 553 b of the Administrative Procedure Act to not issue a notice of proposed rulemaking because it would be impracticable unnecessary or contrary to the public interest The Secretary has found that without prompt guidance some members of the regulated community would have difficulty complying with the requirements of the HIPAA and insured individuals will not understand the benefit to them of having a certificate of prior coverage to present upon entering the individual health insurance market However HHS is accepting comments on the interim final rule for a 90 day period for consideration in the development of the final rules to be issued implementing the HIPAA Paperwork Reduction Act 44 U S C 3501 3520 The interim final rule contains information collections subject to review and approval by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act HHS has requested emergency review of the collections because the collection of the information is needed before the expiration of the normal time limits of the act to assure guaranteeing availability of individual health insurance coverage to certain individuals with prior group coverage HHS is requesting that OMB provide a 30day comment period with OMB approval by June 1 1997 for a 180 day period During the 180 day period HHS will publish a notice in the Federal Register initiating a 60 day agency review and public comment period with submittal to OMB for review and an extension of the emergency approval to follow The notice contained in the preamble to the interim final rule complies with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act by explaining the need for the information the parties affected and the burden estimate related to the collection HHS estimates that the total annual responses will be 3 5 million in 1997 and 3 million in 1998 and 1999 with the total annual burden hours estimated to range from 335 000 to 586 000 hours in 1997 384 000 to 882 000 hours in 1998 and 377 000 to 882 000 in 1999 The total annual cost of complying with the information collection is estimated to range from 4 9 million to 6 8 million in 1997 5 1 million to 8 7 million in 1998 and 5 4 million to 8 7 million in 1999
