                            Dr Octopus the villain that terrorizes the city in the most recent film of the        popular         SpiderMan comic is the ultimate characterization of a brainmachine        interface BMI on the big screen In         SpiderMan  the brain is that of nuclear physicist Dr Otto Octavius        who dreams of harnessing nuclear fusion The machine is a harness of four mechanical arms        designed with tentaclelike flexibility gripping and vision capabilities and an        artificial intelligence module that gives them some autonomy The interface between the        machine and the brain is at the spinal cord level with an inhibitor chip to prevent the        artificial intelligence module in the mechanical arms from taking over Octaviuss brain        Controlling this mechanical device with his own thoughts Octavius is able to manipulate        hazardous materials during his fusion experiments However things go terribly wrong during        the exhibition of one of these experiments the mechanical arms fuse to Octaviuss body        while the inhibitor chip is disabled resulting in the machine gaining partial control of        his brain Unable to subvert the machine to his will and conscience Octavius together        with the BMI becomes the villainous Dr Octopus At the end of the movie in a flicker of        sanity and heroism Octavius dramatically sacrifices his life as the only way to terminate        the evil machine and save the world        Although Dr Octopus is a fictional character a figment of a vivid imagination        audiences are fascinated by the fact that he is a human BMI BMIs straddle the worlds of        fact and fiction While the entertainment industry has focused primarily on applications        for augmenting cognitive and sensorimotor function as seen in         Star Trek Firefox and many other sciencefiction scenarios the        scientific community has targeted clinical applications such as neuroprostheses for        restoring motor function after traumatic lesion of the central nervous system The current        BMI approach is based on the idea that a human user could enact voluntary motor intentions        through a direct interface between his brain and an artificial actuator in virtually the        same way that we see walk or grab an object with our own natural limbs Proficient brain        control of an external device or actuator should be achievable through training using any        combination of visual tactile or auditory feedback As a result of longterm use of the        BMI the brain should be able to incorporate or adapt to the artificial actuator as an        extension of its own body With these goals in mind the last five years have witnessed a        dramatic increase in BMIrelated studies in academic institutions around the world        Subjects have learned to utilize their brain activity for different purposes ranging from        electroencephalogram and electrocorticographicbased systems Wolpaw et al         Leuthardt et al  in which human subjects control computer cursors to        multielectrodebased systems in which nonhuman primates control the movements of cursors        and robots to perform different kinds of reaching and grasping tasks Serruya et al         Taylor et al  Carmena et al  Musallam et al         These examples of what could be called the first generation of BMIs have something in        common they have been exclusively controlled by neural signals Even with BMIs that use        neural activity recorded with invasive electrodes to yield higher bandwidth and thus allow        for the execution of more complex tasks it remains unclear whether the quality of the        signal will ever suffice for a patient to freely safely and effectively control a        prosthetic arm to perform daily tasks For instance the level of motor skill required for        dexterous finger manipulation is outstanding Planning paths and avoiding obstacles while        reaching and grasping in unconstrained environments requires similarly fine motor control        Thus realistic motion through a complex environment with a BMI is extremely challenging        and perhaps not feasible with the relatively low bandwidth  Hz of current BMIs Even        if significant improvements are made in the algorithms used to decode neural activity by        for example incorporating knowledge from neurophysiological experiments of how motor        signals that underlie movements are encoded in the brain current BMI bandwidth still may        not be sufficient to reach the performance level an injured patient would desire        What does this mean for secondgeneration BMIs We may find some inspiration in Dr        Octopus The fictional BMI in         SpiderMan  is innovative in the sense that it is a hybrid system that        incorporates both neuronal and artificial control signals It makes perfect sense to take        advantage of the fields of engineering control theory and artificial intelligence to        build better BMIspart brain and part robot In principle these hybrid BMIs would allow a        patient to accomplish a task more efficiently than those relying on neuronal signals alone        For example in a common task such as reaching for and grasping a glass of water a hybrid        BMI would be fed with both brain and machine control signals the intention of movement        would be decoded directly from neuronal signals leaving obstacle avoidance and grasping        stabilization to the artificial control module of the system Such a module would get        inputs from sensors embedded in the robot and would produce a control signal that would        fuse with the neuronal control signal to augment the final output command        What ratio of neuronal versus artificial signal would be needed for optimal control of a        BMI In the movie Octaviuss crisis is a severe unbalance in favor of machine control        Science fiction aside we see the more realistic potential problems of having a physical        device gaining autonomous control Technically this could be analyzed as too much gain in        the artificial control signal which in a realistic scenario would likely result in        oscillating behavior jerky grasping etc Hence safeguarding measures characterized in        the movie as the inhibitor chip in Octaviuss brain stem would be needed to avoid        dangerous situations when a chronic neuroprosthesis freely interacts with the real world        For both science and science fiction the question is the same Brain and machine which        one gets the power
