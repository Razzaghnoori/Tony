        go ahead what do you have to say on the subject     well i am a tax preparer myself so i do about five hundred income taxes a year in fact i even do television and radio shows here in the Dallas market uh regarding income taxes make sure every one pays the  right amount and i am convinced that uh most people try to humum cheat ever so slightly on their tax returns only because uh the way the IRS does things theyre not gonna give you any breaks i mean they they encourage you to cheat because if you should get audited theyre gonna get you for everything and and some more on top of that   and then theyre gonna tax you on that for or theyre gonna give you an interest on it i know somebody that it happened to     that thats right   no see believe it or not im one of these honest guys but i get to the point that last year we took a transfer and so therefore we had the boost in the income due to the transfer expenses when i sat down when we were through and i sat down with our accountant and we did it if im not presently working outside of the home if i return to work believe it or not with our state income tax our city income tax city we live in and city we work in       i would have lost and with social security i would have lost forty eight cents on every dollar that i earned   easily easily   and well easily just as you said and i sat down and thought about it and i should be in a pretty good position because i dont have little kids any more that i need sitters for or anything like that if i go to work it would be for our fun money and we realized that how it would distrupt disrupt our travel routine and things like that and my husband gets five weeks vacation and we said its not worth it im not working any more   yep   it just isnt worth it and you get frustrated and yet i dont know what the Texas uh the Texas rules are   well see well Texas we are a community property state so we have some a little bit different rules than you have in the separate property state such as uh where you in Ohio but   do you pay a state income income tax   we we do not have state income taxes yet but we see it on the horizon it hadnt hit here yet but we do have   you dont um they start with one percent and then they get you every two year   yeah but how much do you pay in sales tax   uh sales tax we pay seven percent   okay were at eight and a fourth right now   youre so youre higher but you get outoftowners on that then you get everyone on your state uh sales tax which is good   true true true   as uh the income tax whats not fair is paying in the city you live in right now were living where there is a reciprocity so if you do pay more in the city youre working you dont owe your city anything   no   and this year well my husbands actually keeping track of all his time out of the city of Cleveland so that we can get the difference because our city is a little bit less   but are you of the fact that when you prepare your tax return now obviously if you have an error in the IRSs favor theyre going to be very quick to come back to you and say hey you owe this much more tax   right   but if there is an error in your favor they do not come back to you and say oh you get a refund they   oh absolutely and much less they dont pay you an interest   yeah so you know if whats fair for the goose is good for the gander and unfortunately the IRS is saying you know we have screwed yall so many times thats why so many tax payers are starting to cheat more and more which is a shame but i think the IRS has brought it on themself because theyre not being very helpful to those who have made errors and i think if they would i think if they would come back and say hey look this is wrong this is the way it should be done were gonna give you some refunds and so forth and actually show an honest effort to be good on both sides of the fence we wanna collect as much tax we also wanna give back as much tax   right   i i think that youd have a better feeling and youd have a lot better tax returns being done   well and it is now to the point that it has gotten so um so complicated i can do ours in a normal year i have always done our income tax and ive done it with transfers and sale of property but this last time it was so involved that i just threw it all up and said forget it lets go see a CPA well   and yet if you went to visit five different CPAs youd get five different answers   thats what i understand uh this one seemed to do well and uh she did go over our last three or four years and she said i have to compliment you you have excelled she said i cannot find one thing to pull out that you havent already pulled and i said well i do keep records all year long as i go one on twice a month one on   i think uh you sound like one of the type of clients id love to have   well thats what she said i went in there and i had all my books and i said now what do you want to know and i keep every single thing as i write the checks twice a month i enter it uh in either donations wherever it goes i do keep good records and so therefore this time i did not like having to go to someone else because i said well ive got all everything   but
