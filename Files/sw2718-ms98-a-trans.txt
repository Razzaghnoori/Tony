        all right well how do you use credit cards Carol   scarily very very very seldom   yeah   only in dire emergencies in fact i leave them home   uhhuh is that from past experience bad experiences in the past or or just uh the fact that you dont want to be tempted   i have never uh ive used them but never to the extent of getting in debt like uh some people do   uhhuh   its just that since my money is tight right now i dont even give myself a tempting   uhhuh   because ive gotten them all paid off   yeah   so now i just wait   okay   before i use it but um like ill keep one minor one like Sears in my purse just for identification purposes   uhhuh   because i wont use it period   but like if youd take a trip or something   if ill use bank uh Visa   yeah yeah do you   but otherwise huhuh   do you order a lot of things over the phone or credit card orders never   never never   huh so uh like if you go to uh K WalMart or something you always pay in cash or with a check   umhum cash check   cash okay   very seldom do i even use cash   um so your money funnels directly into your checking account huh   umhum   okay   how about you   me i have a Discover card and i use that when when gas prices are the same whether you use cash or credit i usually use my Discover card and i can let my money sit in the bank for an extra because they pay in our credit union pays at the end of the month on your balance so i will let it sit and then draw interest from that and then ill pay my credit cards off in full every month so you know i have no finance charges as long as i pay off exactly on time which i do and also Discover card gives you a little bit of money back its not much but you know five or six bucks uh instead of writing a check for a large purchase if im disciplined enough i can uh like well uh like buying a suit if i spend like three hundred bucks you know ill get some of that back through the cash back program and also at the end of the month you know ill get my interest on that three hundred bucks that was sitting in my checking account that would be gone had i written a check and i do that sometimes but like when we go to the like uh id say its about fifty fifty writing a check or using the Discover card it just i dont know for some reason it just depend if its something small i dont want to write a uh use my credit card but thats the only one i have and and sometimes we order things through the mail like books and uh which is i just if they have a toll free number ill call it up and you know charge it to my credit card as as long as you know id make myself pay on time every time so theres no finance charge and its really you know like you said some people go off half wild and spend uh they think because theyve got a thousand dollar limit then you know theyve got to get that limit every month or something and uh they end up paying finance charges and they just and then theyll pay the minimum balance every month and then end up they may have got something on sale but all the interest you know they end up paying more than what they would have had they just paid cash for it   see thats exactly i didnt get in debt but what i did was one year oh i cant remember when five six must be eight nine years ago when i paid my taxes i realized that i had ran up so much on my credit card that i was paying interest that was ridiculous i mean sure it was the tax writeoff but   uhhuh   there was no sense to it   yeah   i mean there was no sense at all to it i was paying more interest on that card than the card was worth as far as i could tell   yeah   so at that point there we just stepped right on you know just saving all the way in and ill turn around like on my car ill borrow against my insurance which i pay five percent interest and buy my car that way   huh   and that works   wow   so i dont have to worry about it but i use uh override at uh Texin Credit Union so that i dont have to keep too much i keep enough balance in my checking account so i dont have to pay you know a service charge   what you override   and then i yeah   whats that mean   if i write a check real large itll go ahead and pull it out of my savings account   oh okay   so i dont have to you know worry about it one way of the other and i just keep that minimum balance in there   okay i see   so it just you know and i pretty much budget that way all the way around but as i said my moneys tight   yeah is that a free service that override   right now yeah   huh   theres no charge for it   huh   so i do it that way but i do as i said i keep the credit card in my purse for identification   yeah   when somebody wants identification one way or the other   its   but usually i wont put anything on that card unless its something i really unbelievably need otherwise i better have it somewhere else   right   because im like you im not going to have a balance on that thing because its too easy i know too many people that pay off that card well ive got this credit card well maybe id better use that one or something like that and im saying huhuh not me   yeah   its just its just so easy when uh okay i think a lot of its psychological you hand a piece of plastic and all you do is sign your name at least either with cash or with a check  you have to write out the amount so you actually see how much youre spending   well its like um the little piece of plastic for uh to get your money out or the credit union all you have to do is put it in the machine one way or the other   uhhuh   and like ill run down there like you know for vacation and things like that and ill leave it in there in savings account till the last day   yeah   and then ill put the card in and pull it out what i want but ill pull it out of savings because i dont keep any balance in the checking   uhhuh   but thats still thats easy enough as it is but i wouldnt use the machine to pay fifty cents or a dollar for it   oh yeah no kidding   i wont even go that far   i complain every time i i mean weve only had to do it twice since my wife and ive been married in nine months is use the machine that charges and it charges a buck and one time it was because the machine at TI was broken and we had to have cash so we had no choice but to go to the other place and the other one wa s just this weekend when we just we were leaving out of town and we had to you know just have some cash and so we used the automatic teller card but you know im very chintzy with my money i dont like to spend lose a dollar just because i use a machine or something its   um   senseless   but im like you if theres something really that i wanted ill write to them before ill put the credit card call in though i wont put it on the card unless i really ill take write them letter uh check for it   yeah thats   because it wastes too much time on the credit card and im kind of im leery about things going on my card because ive had you know had to go back and return something and it took so long to get it off and that was years ago   yeah   so im having real good luck with a credit card i mean it came off theres no problem but it just takes too much scares me   yeah   and like Tom Thumbs got uh credit card now they used for groceries   really   yeah over here in in Plano   their own Tom Thumb card   uhhuh       and you can charge your groceries on it   thats funny   and uh you can either charge your groceries on it you have a choice or you can write a check and they okayed it that way   uhhuh   so you dont have to keep going and get it you know credit check and things like that and theyll give you an extra twenty five dollars no charge or anything else like that but i wont even put that on the groceries   huh   because hey what happens if the clerk marks in an extra number or something like that and i dont check it   yeah yeah   no thank you i dont want anything going on my card you know in my checking account unless its i know about it   right   but do you like Discover card i hadnt heard too much about it   yeah it seems a lot more places are taking it now which when i first got it it was a problem with it i i said i dont want to use the credit card and i just carried it with me like you said for identification and sometimes when i would take it go on a trip you know it it was good to have a credit card because like if my car breaks down or something a  lot of states dont because i travel from Indiana to Texas and a lot of states wont take out of state checks like you know just some gas station out of the way   umhum   they want cash or a major card so i went ahead and got that and theres no fee no service fee for it plus they play pay you cash back at the end of the i think i earned probably eight or nine bucks last year which isnt very much but id just started to use it and and like i i had some major purchases i just was dumb and forgot to put on there like uh i wrote a check for my wifes wedding ring which was a lot of money and if i would have put it on the Discover card the money you know could have sat in the savings account or the checking account for an extra month and it also would have paid me probably you know eight or nine bucks back on uh the end of the year thing so i messed that up so i you know im still not in its not a good habit to use it but fortunately im not uh like some people not a spendthrift and i really have to think about my purchases and i know if i have money in the checking account to cover it then i ill use the Discover card you know to get a little more interest but uh yeah i im just very
