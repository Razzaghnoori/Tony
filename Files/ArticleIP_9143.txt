unbalanced and frothing David Plotz refers to Oklahoma Republicans as a top to bottom roster of kooks losers and terrors Is this responsible journalism Would you permit Democrats to be vilified in similar name calling Does this really elevate civil discourse in a country in which reasonable minds should be free to disagree Or is it just brain dead demagoguery Sometimes Slate appears to favor totalitarian intolerance of conservative thought Could you provide some basic instruction to your journalists on the left about minimum civility and respect for those with whom they disagree Tom Kerwin Vienna Va Plains Speaking Re the extraordinary and articulate article Give It Back to the Injuns If only we Oklahomans were less genially mediocre we d probably be more appreciative of your ability to slap the faces of so many different groups of Oklahomans all at the same time and in such a charming way I m a male Caucasian am not inclined to consider myself a religious or even a Christian person and am a 55 year old registered Democrat having switched parties in 1995 after having been a registered Republican all the years before and mainly because of the present influence of the so called religious right in the Republican Party So I m less genial than some of my Oklahoma kinfolk even if I share in the mediocrity you sweepingly attribute to those of us who live within this portion of the United States You are quick and apparently presume you have the status to give away and to disrespect at the same time Now had you not managed to be so sweepingly offensive to Native Americans too by your disrespectful use of the deprecatory term Injun your momma should spank your bottom and put a bar of Lifebuoy in your mouth you might at least have picked up a few admirers within these borders given the thesis implied by the title to your article Indeed many Native Americans would welcome a return of their land including that small piece of terrain that you presumably have sufficient mass to be able to occupy But as it is you come off as just another self appointed jerk who appears to write articles mainly for the pleasure of seeing his name and opinions in print instead of being a person who uses words to persuade rather than to malign As I said I m sometimes less genial than my fellow Oklahomans so I trust that you will not take these remarks as a reflection upon their general temperament Doug Loudenback Oklahoma City The Oklahoma Reich I live in Tulsa Okla and your story Give It Back to the Injuns hit the nail right on the head You should try being gay and living here It is kinda like being a Jew and living in Germany during the 1930s Scott Headrick Tulsa Okla Pregnant Logic From the Nov 23 Today s Papers The WP front covers a lawsuit in which a man is suing a woman for becoming pregnant against his will she had he says promised to take birth control pills The woman claims that she became pregnant accidentally That factual issue may be settled at trial but it seems that there is a larger legal issue well worth addressing Since court findings of paternity cost the imputed fathers eighteen years worth of support it seems only fair that women be held accountable for any promises they make about attempting to remain childless In the absence of that a woman s promise to take charge of birth control and then not doing so remains the only form of monetary fraud Today s Papers can think of that is not only not punished but is in fact regularly rewarded Grrr I m sure that by now hundreds of TP readers have written in to snarl at your reproductive tort theories I object to your logic for two reasons 1 Birth control methods do in fact fail on occasion Even vasectomies fail 2 Men who don t want their sexual partners to become pregnant are responsible for taking steps themselves to prevent pregnancy Sex without a condom is not an inalienable right of men Men who participate in creating an unwanted pregnancy should do a bit more than whine about how she was taking care of it That tone goes over better for chiding the guy who forgot to bring the beer to Sunday football As always though great column despite our difference of opinion in sexual politics Emily Culbertson Philadelphia Wake Us Up When It s Over Quit with the boring shtick will ya One guy is bored with the Starr hearings A Starr Is Boring and one gal is bored at the Microsoft trial Dispatch Is this Slate s new strategy to grab current and prospective readers I hope not because I m bored with their boredom Sure the hearing and the trial may be a bit slow but these writers are covering something important or else they wouldn t be there And if they are bored silly covering such events the traditional way they should get off their butts and try talking to someone different and exploring something new Patrick R McDonald West Hollywood Calif Address your e mail to the editors to letters slate com You must include your address and daytime phone
