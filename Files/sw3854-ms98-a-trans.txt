        do you use credit cards     convenience uh   it   i i use them for just uh everything mostly i confine my credit card to just one MasterCard   do you   but um i i carry it with me and clutch it tightly to my bosom at all times fortunately um uh i have a credit card well i have a two MasterCards one uh has a twenty dollar its a gold MasterCard and it uh have to pay a twenty dollar annual fee but as long as i i pay off every month   uhhuh   theres no interest charge   i see   but and we never carry over we pay off every month   what is the advantage then of a gold card because um you dont pay any interest if you have a regular MasterCard or Visa   well one thing is whenever we rent a car we dont have to pay um any extra insurance so that we uh my husbands uh family lives in New Hampshire and uh its about ninety miles from Hartford and ninety miles to Boston so uh as a general rule when he goes up there he rents a car so the times of the year that he rents a car more than pays the twenty dollar annual fee for having a gold card   i see i see we used to get the American Express card and stuff like that and then we just kind of got back to plain old MasterCard and Visa uh because we never really had any um benefit that we thought was worth the the price of the special card so   umhum   uh it may change you know if we do a lot of car rental which we dont do   umhum   or other types of services im sure therere some things that come along with the gold cards that are appealing and and uh ive just wondered what they were they havent been appealing to us so far   no uh unless theres some no i theres no uh unless theres some advantage theres not any point theres theres no prestige factor involved   yeah that you know i think that was my original appeal uh i was i was in my twenties and the American Express card really appeals to people on that basis of of you know youve arrived youve got this card     uhhuh   and uh you know it got to what fifty five dollars a year or something like that and my wife said well this is ridiculous why are we doing this and uh   oh dear yeah   so we stopped doing it and we refused to pay i dont know whether you know this but my wife discovered this we started to refuse to pay our banks uh an annual fee for the that for the Visa Visa and MasterCard  and they said fine well give it to you anyway   umhum yeah uhhuh   and we said you know   yeah   were uh were not interested in your card anymore and they said well wait a minute is is it the price and we said yeah so well we wont charge anymore  you know and they used to charge what eighteen dollars a year or something like that twelve dollars something like that   yeah uhhuh uhhuh yeah uhhuh   so theyre wonderful i mean i think credit cards are great we use it to get cash uh you know you can use it now in the Safeway out here in San Francisco and   um   its wonderful in that respect and were glad to have them we we   can can you buy groceries with it   yeah   uhhuh yeah   its great you know and it eventually what were gonna go to is nothing but these kinds of cards and itll be MasterCard Visa and and American Express i dont think the Discover cards gonna make it in the long term   umhum umhum   um you know we dont need too many cards and and the American Express will probably survive but itll have to become more like these other ones and become cheaper i think because the price will come down   yeah i think so too   i dont think its worth fifty five bucks a year   no its not   when you can use the the Visa or the MasterCard everywhere in the world and theyre pitching that in all their commercials i notice   yeah you really can and uh also um we travel abroad some and um it um you get MasterCards accepted everywhere and and you get the   yeah   a a good rate you get a better rate than you do uh cashing in travelers checks of course there are   yeah well now now thats interesting i can see why because then they get some sort of advantage in terms of the  conversion fee probably   yeah and and even uh converting your travelers checks at a bank they still charge you a fee   right   and uh   well it its gonna come that way and the reason its nice is because basically what it does is put you electronically in touch with your financial resources anywhere in the world and thats where were headed  the technology supports that nicely and uh it makes more sense than than that because you have a card and if you have insurance which we have had on the card you uh can have you can lose it stolen   umhum   and you dont get uh anything charged to you and thats great its just insurance were very responsible with our cards but nonetheless if we lost them   yeah umhum umhum yeah   itd be great to know we didnt have to pay five hundred dollars or whatever   yeah   um on the cards we look for the low rate we have USAA cards uh you know USAA   yeah we do too   yeah but but USAA is Dallas based and uh  thats a great thing for
