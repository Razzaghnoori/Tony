                    Background        This paper reports on the experience of four        Massachusetts companies that reduced their use of methylene        chloride in a variety of industrial processes in response        to increasing regulatory pressures Rather than utilize the        traditional control approaches delineated in environmental        and occupational health regulation such as pollution        control equipment or local exhaust ventilation that        facilitate the continued use of hazardous chemicals these        companies chose a source reduction approach Source        reduction also called pollution prevention includes        chemical substitution process modification and substitute        technologies that intervene in the industrial process        itself to eliminate or reduce hazards    In the        environmental protection field awareness of pollution        mediashifting eg protecting the air by filtering        contaminants through a filter that then becomes or collects        hazardous waste has given rise to support for pollution         prevention in place of endofpipe        controls In addition to private sector initiatives many        levels of government in industrialized countries have        established source reduction as a preferred environmental        policy and have dedicated resources to promote it Danish        law has since  prohibiting the use of hazardous        chemicals if safer substitutes are available    The        US Pollution Prevention Act of  and the         Massachusetts Toxics Use Reduction Act have helped to        mainstream source reduction in industrial production        practices in the United States            Source reduction activities motivated by environmental        protection goals have had a significant impact on the work        environment Many of the technological breakthroughs that        have occurred in chemistry process engineering and        industrial equipment in response to demand for reducing the        environmental impact of production have had the added        benefit of reducing workers hazardous chemical exposure           But while most industrial hygienists would state their        philosophical commitment to prevention at the source        source reduction strategies are not common in industrial        hygiene practice Indeed early industrial hygienists        maintained that source reduction was not a practical        approach nor even theoretically superior to local exhaust        ventilation from a prevention standpoint    This        latter view has been supported by an assumption that        control strategies that require changes to industrial        processes or products are inherently infeasible Thus        addon controls  ventilation systems and personal        protective equipment  have dominated hazard prevention        guidance and practice             The question of the feasibility of controls has        figured centrally in the regulation of toxic exposures in        the workplace in the US One of the last tasks assigned by        the US Congress to the nowdefunct Office of Technology        Assessment was a review of the US Occupational Safety and        Health Administrations OSHA procedures for determining        the feasibility of control strategies to limit worker        exposures to occupational hazards The reports authors        found that                The agencys demonstrations of        feasibility are often based on conservative assumptions        about what compliance responses will predominate across        affected industriesIn a good number of the cases that        the Office of Technology Assessment examined the actual        compliance response that was observed included advanced or        innovative control measures that had not been emphasized in        the rulemaking analysesOSHA devotes relatively little        attention to examining the potential of advanced        technologies or the prospect of regulationinduced        innovation to provide technologically and economically        superior options for hazard control Most attention does        appear to be placed on conventional control measures eg        increased ventilation and production enclosure rather        than on new technology ranging from sophisticated emissions        control devices to technologies capable of supporting basic        shifts in production processes including process        redesigns product reformulations and material        substitution            Evidence for the reports conclusions included industry        responses to the cotton dust standard with which industry        complied by modernizing equipment and processes at a        substantially reduced cost compared to those projected for        traditional control approaches and with tremendous        production benefits and the formaldehyde standard where        industry complied not by utilizing the OSHArecommended        ventilation and enclosure strategy but with a source        reduction strategy lowformaldehyde resins that had been        available at the time of the rulemaking        In  OSHA promulgated a new comprehensive methylene        chloride standard    This standard presented an        opportunity for innovative control approaches Methylene        chloride has been characterized as a potential occupational        carcinogen by OSHA US Environmental Protection Agency        and the International Agency for Research on Cancer             Occupational exposure to methylene chloride can        occur during its production and use as a paint stripper        cleaner degreaser adhesive thinner process solvent and        as an aerosol carrier With an odor threshold of around         mgm  parts per million or ppm methylene chloride        has poor warning properties and due to its volatility        concentrations may rapidly approach high levels in poorly        ventilated areas     Fatalities due to methylene        chloride vapor inhalation in furniture stripping operations        have been reported           OSHAs  methylene chloride standard is strict and        comprehensive it lowered the hour time weighted average        Permissible Exposure Limit for the chemical from  mgm        to  mgm  ppm to  ppm and required exposure        monitoring worker training engineering controls        designation of restricted areas spill and leak prevention        and medical surveillance OSHA demonstrated that the        proposed standard was technically and economically feasible        with standard engineering controls and asserted that        companies could comply with the new standard without        eliminating methylene chloride from industrial operations        A few substitutes for methylene chloride are briefly        described in the compliance guides that accompany the        standard but these guides focus on local exhaust        ventilation and work practices as the best ways to lower        exposure    In response to complaints about the        lowering of the Permissible Exposure Limit for methylene        chloride the agency replied OSHA has determined that the        final methylene chloride standard is feasible in all        affected industries without the need for substituting to        alternative chemicals It is not OSHAs intention to force        industries to abandon methylene chloride           But abandon methylene chloride is exactly what many        companies did    They had begun that process several        years before in response to environmental regulations that        restricted methylene chloride emissions to the ambient air        Methylene chloride is regulated as a Hazardous Air        Pollutant under the US Clean Air Act    Permits must        be secured to discharge it to the atmosphere and companies        must use Maximum Available Control Technology for specific        sources to prevent environmental contamination The        standard for vapor degreasers specifically recommends        against local exhaust ventilation because of its potential        role in generating emissions to the environment           Thus OSHAs primary recommendation for exposure control        contradicted the goals of environmental protection by        potentially increasing emissions of methylene chloride to        the environment        Additionally for many processes offtheshelf        technologies and chemistries were available to take        methylene chlorides place Probably in response to        increasing regulation chemical companies and equipment        manufacturers have brought forth a generous array of        methylene chloride source reduction strategies for its        chief uses including substitute chemistries mechanical and        equipment innovations and modernized processes See Table         Indeed it is one leading experts opinion that        effective substitute chemistries and technologies exist for        virtually every current application of methylene chloride        in industry Personal communication K Wolf Oct                 Despite the increased use of source reduction        techniques there have been few reports of how source        reduction process changes are undertaken in the real        world and their impact on the work environment           Research reports on hazard prevention strategies usually        involve a description of laboratory andor field tests of        ventilation or personal protective equipment designs While        such reports may include a reporting of before and after        air monitoring data almost nowhere can you read about the        process by which a prevention strategy was implemented nor        not and its complex impact Environmental case studies of        source reduction while more inclusive of contextual and        practical factors usually neglect to report on the impact        of the source reduction strategy on the work        environment        In the wake of increased environmental and occupational        health regulation of methylene chloride we recognized an        opportunity to systematically assess the issues related to        source reduction that are important to the occupational        health field by using a timely case study approach Our        goal in undertaking these case studies was not to test        hypotheses but to capture the total detailed phenomena of        source reduction for hazard prevention as manifested        specifically in these four cases of methylene chloride        source reduction for worker health hazard prevention We        were interested in information about the experiences and        perceptions of the people in the process as well as the        technical details Themes distilled from these case        descriptions could be used to generate hypotheses for        further study andor to guide prevention interventions        While we began our investigation with such questions as        would safer substitutes introduce new hazards Would        changes motivated by environmental goals improve the work        environment What is the evidence for source reductions        feasibility and effectiveness for worker protection  the        case study approach structures openended exploration        through observation and interrogation of key informants        The ability to discover important issues not preconceived        to provide rich descriptions to challenge employers stock        answers and to get at hows and whys of their actions        are some of the several utilities of the qualitative case        study approach as detailed below                    Methods        This study used qualitative research methods to        investigate and describe cases of source reduction for        hazard prevention The selection of these study subjects        was the result of a sampling approach that sought        informationrich cases available for indepth study in four        diverse industrial settings    Four companies large        and small in four different industrial sectors were        enrolled as cases The potential cases were initially        selected from the  companies that had reported their         use of methylene chloride under the Massachusetts Toxics        Use Reduction Act because they used more than  kg         lbs of the chemical in that year The list of        potential participants was further narrowed to include only        the  companies that had used methylene chloride in an        industrial process such as in cleaning or thinning and        not as a component in a product Telephone calls to each of        these companies resulted in a pool of six companies with        interest in participating Two of these six agreed to        participate nonparticipants cited a lack of time and        inability to give access to the facility as reasons for        refusal Two companies that had used methylene chloride        prior to  and that were participating in a        Demonstration Sites program sponsored by the Toxics Use        Reduction Institute at the University of Massachusetts        Lowell were approached and also agreed to participate In        order to achieve representation by small furniture        stripping companies two were invited to participate but        declined Thus criteria for inclusion were that a company        had used or was using methylene chloride in an industrial        process at the time of the study and they agreed to        participate in a scientific study and provide access and        information as necessary to that study Project resources        limited the study to four cases but we achieved our        sampling goal of including representation of at least one        prospective case a company still using methylene chloride        at the time of the study as well as four diverse        industrial sectors metal finishing electrical equipment        manufacture rubber products manufacture and vessel        cleaning services        The study protocol used to build the case studies        involved site visits telephone and inperson interviews        and review of companyprovided and public documentation        Data source triangulation or the use of multiple data        sources to provide more than one perspective on the        phenomenon under investigation was used to enhance the        depth of information about each case and internal validity           For example for two cases we were able to access        the documentation provided to the Toxic Use Reduction        Institute as part of the companies participation in the        Institutes Demonstration Site program and compare the        reporting of process and motivational factors between the        program documentation and that provided to us in        interviews The bulk of the qualitative data was collected        in indepth interviews with key informants where the        investigator used a semistructured openended interview        guide for all four companies    These interviews were        designed to capture informants perspectives on the        motivations processes and impacts related to their source        reduction experience Each interview was followed by a        guided tour of the industrial process that had used        methylene chloride This tour or site visit allowed for        additional informal questioning about the process As an        additional validation step for the most complex case  that        of the metal finishing company  we confirmed the        investigators findings and interpretations via a review of        the written case by the president of the company        CR conducted all the interviews and site visits and        interviews notes were taken by hand A description of the        surface cleaning test methods and methylene chloride        exposure assessment methods utilized in the metal finishing        company case are available upon request Institutional        Review Board approval for research involving human subjects        was sought and achieved for this study and all participants        signed informed consent forms        The components of the toxics use reduction        implementation strategy  options identification options        assessment implementation and evaluation  guided the        design of the prospective intervention study and the        evaluation of the retrospective cases Intracase analysis        proceeded in two steps first data was categorized into        each of the following analytic categories description of        the industrial processes involved the source reduction        approach and the steps each company took to accomplish the        change the companys motivations for the change and the        technical environmental health and safety and financial        assessment of the change and second the investigators        ascertained key lessons or salient findings from each        case Crosscase analysis included the summary of findings        by analytic categories and the culling of salient        commonalities differences and findings perceived as        useful for further study andor recommended        implementation        Case studies are widely used in the environmental field        to describe and promote pollution prevention approaches        see for example httpwwwpgemsorg Pollution        prevention case studies are usually descriptive focused on        technical details and written to persuade readers of the        value of the approach for that application Case studies        are also a particular mode of social science investigation        that is especially appropriate to intervention research In                Case Study Research Design and        Methods  Yin notes that case studies are the        preferred strategy when how or why questions are being        posed when the investigator has little control over        events and when the focus is on a contemporary phenomenon        within some reallife context    Additionally case        studies are especially useful when context is key to        understanding a particular phenomenon and we deem it useful        to understand that phenomenon  in this case source        reduction for hazard prevention  through its embodiment in        particular cases    The case studies in this paper        combine the pollution prevention and social science case        study models by providing descriptive technical details        and systematic analysis of each contextladen case                    Results                  Metal Finishing Company                      Background            This metal finishing company performs copper chrome            and nickel plating on aluminum brass and steel            fabricated parts on a jobordered basis Seventy            percent of the companys business comes from a            motorcycle manufacturer The company employs             production workers over three shifts                                Process and Source Reduction            All parts must be thoroughly cleaned before they can            be plated Lightly soiled parts are cleaned inline as            part of the plating line using acid and alkaline            waterbased cleaning processes Some types of            materials particularly small parts convoluted parts            or parts coated with heavy protective oils were            cleaned in a methylene chloride vapor degreaser before            they entered the plating line The company selected            methylene chloride because of its relatively high vapor            pressure requiring less heating to enter the vapor            phase and because it was less flammable than other            degreasing solvents In the early s in response            to the Clean Air Act requirements and in order to            decrease the volume of methylene chloride used to below            the state and federal reporting threshold of  kgyr             lby the degreasers refrigerated coils were            refurbished and work practices were introduced to            reduce emissions These work practices included using            the cooling coils beyond the time when the degreaser            was being used weekly monitoring of the coils            covering the degreaser when not in use and lowering            hoist speed to  meters per minute  ftmin to            reduce vapor dragout The unit is not fitted with            local exhaust ventilation            Total methylene chloride use declined by  between             and  at this company Three factors have            accounted for this dramatic reduction improved            controls on the degreaser that prevented losses and            therefore conserved new use the loss of two regular            plating orders that included parts that consistently            required methylene chloride degreasing and source            reduction process changes undertaken in conjunction            with this study In agreeing to work with the            investigators to further reduce the companys use of            methylene chloride the company president reported that            he was motivated by environmental regulations Clean            Air Act restrictions and Massachusetts Toxics Use            Reduction Act reporting requirements worker health            concerns and the opportunity to improve the overall            efficiency of the plating process by moving cleaning            operations inline with the other plating operations            thereby reducing labor costs and other production            inefficiencies            During the options identification phase of this            prospective source reduction study the investigator            and the company president determined that aqueous            cleaning might be an acceptable alternative to            methylene chloride cleaning because aqueous cleaning            was a proven technology that was frequently used in            place of vapor degreasing in other metal finishing            companies Additionally the company had experience            with aqueous cleaning in other applications and            anticipated that hydrocarbonbased substitute            degreasers would pose greater potential toxicity and            environmental problems Much of the work was already            being cleaned aqueously inline and as reported            above the company was eager to shift more of the work            inline The barrier to doing so was inadequate aqueous            cleaning effectiveness thus requiring methylene            chloride degreasing as a precleaner            In order to find the bestperforming cleaner for the            companys applications the investigators requested            that the company submit parts for a series of test            cleanings at the Toxics Use Reduction Institutes            Surface Cleaning Laboratory Following the laboratory            studies experimental cleaning runs were conducted at            the company to determine the feasibility of cleaning            more of the parts inline aqueously with the new            chemistry thereby avoiding the methylene chloride            degreasing precleaning step The company president            determined that these trials were successful and            quickly introduced the better performing substitute to            one of the production lines He then purchased a new            precleaning tank and began using the new cleaner on            the two remaining plating lines These actions            significantly reduced the use of the methylene chloride            degreaser most of the work pieces were no longer            diverted to solvent precleaning            Subsequent steps were consultation with the            companys chemical supplier for a less expensive            generic version of the new cleaner and tests of this            cleaner and determination of bath maintenance            schedules The company also consulted with their            hazardous waste hauler to determine any potential            additional costs for treatment of wastewater associated            with this process These costs were determined to be            acceptable The company president deemed the            substitution of the better performing lessexpensive            substitute chemistry successful At the conclusion of            the study  of the work formerly degreased with            methylene chloride was cleaned with water and an            alkaline cleaner In  at the beginning of this            study the company operated the methylene chloride            degreaser up to four hours a day five days a week for            a total of  hours a week At the conclusion of the            study two years later it was used twice a week for a            total of eight hours a week No additional steps are            planned to further reduce use of the methylene chloride            degreaser                                Technical environmental health and safety and            financial assessment            Technical and performance criteria dominated the            companys process for determining the acceptability of            the substitute Because the aqueous cleaners had few            reported health or safety hazards especially in their            diluted form Material Safety Data Sheets were the only            resources consulted by the company to gain information            about potential environmental health or safety            concerns Project staff undertook a more thorough            investigation but did not discover any concerns that            would lead us to recommend that the company avoid            certain products or processes associated with the new            chemistry Additionally financial concerns did not            figure prominently in the evaluation of the            alternatives the company president did not express            concern about costs within the scope of the proposed            project except to find a less expensive version of our            recommended cleaner However financial concerns            appeared to play a role in the companys decision to            continue use of the degreaser on a limited basis rather            than invest in alternative technology for the remaining            work that could not be cleaned inline with the            substitute            Workers are potentially overexposed to methylene            chloride compared to the OSHA Permissible Exposure            Limit of  mgm or  ppm when operating or            maintaining the degreaser Prior to the shifting of the            majority of the work to aqueous cleaning we conducted            one day of exposure monitoring following the OSHA            sampling method for methylene chloride            httpwwwoshaslcgovdtssltcmethodsorganicorgorghtml            The estimated timeweighted eighthour exposure for the            operator was  mgm  ppm In shifting much of            the precleaning work to inline aqueous cleaning the            company greatly reduced potential worker exposure to            methylene chloride Workers potentially may still be            exposed to methylene chloride while operating the            degreaser but the reduced schedule of use means that            they are less likely to be overexposed compared to the            Permissible Exposure Limit            What about the workers potential exposure to the            new aqueous cleaner The company selected an alkaline            liquid cleaner based on sodium metasilicate             Other ingredients include diethylene glycol nbutyl            ether  and sodium carbonate  It is used at a             dilution Because of its alkalinity repeated            exposure to this undiluted alkaline cleaner could have            health effects including skin eye and respiratory            irritation and burning However workers are unlikely            to have any more than brief exposure to the chemical in            its undiluted form In its dilute form the pH of the            solution would be slightly less caustic than the            concentrate but still would be potentially hazardous            as an irritant Workers wear chemical resistant gloves            and eye protection when handling the chemical and            while they may breathe in the water vapor above the            heated tanks they are unlikely to inhale the chemical            However no monitoring has been conducted to determine            the pH of this vapor The company president said that            workers had not complained about irritation The            potential hazards associated with the use of the            substitute chemical include acute irritation and burns            from accidental exposure due to spills or splashes It            is not expected that routine exposure under the            conditions described would result in potential            longterm irritation or other health effects                                    Rubber Products Company                      Background            This rubber products company employs as many as             people over three shifts and makes over  rubber            specialty products including windshield wipers copier            toner blades golf grips and respirator face pieces            Their manufacturing processes utilize  different            chemicals  of which are used in large quantities            Processes include mixing and curing of rubber spray            coating tumbling forming and adhesion of rubber and            metal parts            Since  the company has undertaken several            projects to reduce or eliminate organic solvent use            improve material dispensing reduce toxicity of inks            recycle and conserve water and electricity The            Director of Environmental Health and Safety has            championed these projects as well as an overall system            of reducing environmental impact through their ISO             program life cycle analysis and Design for the            Environment initiatives These projects are popular at            the company in part because they save an estimated             million a year USD The company is recognized as an            environmental leader                                Process and Source Reduction            Between  and  the company phased methylene            chloride out of their urethane mixing vessel and tool            cleaning operations and phased in two dropin            substitutes dibasic esters and polyethylene glycol In            the urethane mixing vessel operation following the            automated mixing and discharge of the urethane into a            bucket the system is automatically purged with a            solvent This solvent was methylene chloride the            company introduced dibasic esters as a substitute            While the operator is pouring the hot urethane from a            bucket onto a forming belt about  liters  oz of            dibasic esters are forced through the system and into a            waiting bucket The urethane is heated to C F            Thus the dibasic esters are emitted mostly as liquid            but also potentially as a component of a visible vapor            resulting from contact of the liquid with the            urethaneheated equipment About three batches are run            per hour            In the change from methylene chloride to dibasic            esters the total volume of the solvent used was            decreased through the rescheduling of batch jobs to            reduce the vessel cleaning frequency and through the            use of disposable and nonstick vessels that were            cleaned mechanically wiping and scraping rather than            chemically The company also used a vacuum distillation            system to reuse the dibasic esters and the company now            purchases less than  liters per year  galyr            This compares to the approximately  liters per            year  galyr of methylene chloride that the            company purchased when it used the chemical            In a second operation mixing tools used to make            urethane are soaked or agitated in buckets of dibasic            esters instead of methylene chloride and then soaked            and rinsed in a tank of hot polyethylene glycol The            company is investigating the substitution of liquid            sodium chloride salt as a cleaning agent in place of            the dibasic esterspolyethylene glycol process to            further the companys goals of toxics use reduction and            cost savings            Methylene chloride was targeted in the context of an            aggressive pollution prevention program in this            environmentallyconscious company The companys            motivations include creating a positive image with            customers limiting liability improving compliance            with regulations lowering insurance and accident            costs improving the companys image with employees and            thereby increasing loyalty furthering good community            and employee relations reducing waste and most            importantly saving money Methylene chloride was            eliminated in part because of worker health concerns            and in part because of its classification as a            Hazardous Air Pollutant under the Clean Air Act            Additionally the Environmental Health and Safety            Director described the loss of methylene chloride to            the environment as much as  metric tons per year or             US tons per year as money up the stack                                Technical environmental health and safety and            financial assessment            The company identified two potential dropin            substitutes for methylene chloride It selected dibasic            esters over nmethyl pyrrolidone because of superior            technical effectiveness The change was evaluated in a            companydesigned process that looked at perceived            environmental and worker health and safety impact and            costs Dibasic esters were determined to be acceptable            from the environmental and health and safety            perspective because they are also found in consumer            products The Environmental Health and Safety Director            commented If this is good for a consumer product it            should be good for our employees working with it as            well He suggested that there were few choices by the            end of a technical and initial environmental assessment            process Dibasic esters were ultimately selected            because they performed better than nmethyl pyrrolidone            and were deemed safer            Methylene chloride exposure study results were not            available but according to the company measured            methylene chloride exposure levels were an order of            magnitude below the standard which at the time would            have been a Permissible Exposure Limit of  mgm             ppm However had workers continued to use            methylene chloride to clean tools and to perform the            vessel cleaning tasks they would potentially have been            exposed above the new Permissible Exposure Limit of             mgm  ppm The vessel mixing and discharge rooms            were relatively small enclosed spaces and were            noticeably elevated in temperature These conditions            combined with the discharge of solvent at elevated            temperature following its trip through the hot            equipment would have created the potential for            overexposure This exposure would have been mitigated            by the slot ventilation on the equipment at the point            where the chemicals enter the bucket However other            tasks with potential for high exposure were            uncontrolled such as pouring solvent into the system            and pouring the used chemical into the recycling or            waste containers In the cleaning operations the            largely manual uncontrolled processes including            pouring stirring mechanical cleaning and emptying            contaminated methylene chloride into either waste            containers or the recycling distillation unit would            have contributed to potential overexposure            The substitutes have eliminated workers exposure to            methylene chloride The introduction of substitutes            with extremely low volatility has also reduced the            potential for inhalation of the substitute solvent in            these tasks The initiatives undertaken to minimize the            use of dibasic esters eg introducing nonstick            buckets also benefited workers by lessening their            potential exposure especially skin exposure Some            manual handling tasks persist postprocess change            including cleaning tools and equipment and pouring used            dibasic esters into the distillation unit Workers were            observed to be wearing cotton gloves Workers were            concerned that substitutes would make their jobs more            difficult but were satisfied with the change            ultimately The operator said that methylene chloride            had caused skin and eye irritation dibasic esters did            not and he was relieved to not have to worry as much            about the consequences of accidental splashes            Following the substitution the Environmental Health            and Safety Director conducted air sampling for dibasic            esters in response to requests from state environmental            authorities He was not successful in monitoring the            substance with an organic solvent sampling method and            concluded that due to the low volatility of dibasic            esters that there was no significant air            contamination Additionally he did an evaporation            study and found that after a week a beaker containing            dibasic esters had no significant change in weight            Thus losses in dibasic esters are largely unexplained            but may be due to spills binding with the urethane            andor vaporization of the product at high            temperatures Exposure to dibasic esters is not            considered to be a hazard by the company Because there            is no OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit the manufacturer            of the product provided a guideline occupational            exposure limit to the company upon request and the            company believes that occupational exposure to dibasic            esters is well within this guideline            Current knowledge of dibasic esters occupational            health effects would suggest that it is considerably            less harmful to workers than methylene chloride            However dibasic esters are potentially hazardous            chemicals and can cause skin eye and respiratory tract            irritation They are absorbed through the skin and            prolonged exposure can cause blurry vision dibasic            esters are metabolized to formic acid According to            the Material Safety Data Sheets for polyethylene            glycol there are little or no health effects            associated with exposure to the chemical The American            Industrial Hygiene Association has established a            Workplace Environmental Exposure Level of  mgm             hour TWA for polyethylene glycol    The very            low vapor pressure of dibasic esters and polyethylene            glycol would mitigate against inhalation            The costs of hazardous waste disposal raw material            and compliance related activities were a major            motivation for the elimination of methylene chloride            Dibasic esters are more expensive than methylene            chloride but a considerably lower volume of chemical            is purchased due to the process changes described above            and the lower volatility of the chemical The equipment            expenditures that were required during the substitution            were the remanufacture of equipment Orings that were            destroyed during technical evaluation of the substitute            and some new mixing tools The new mixing tools were            estimated to have cost a couple thousand dollars The            company manufactured the new Orings themselves The            distillation equipment had been purchased for methylene            chloride recycling All potential methylene chloride            compliancerelated costs were avoided While a complete            financial assessment has not been performed by the            company the company believed that considerable savings            had been generated by the project                                    Electrical Equipment Manufacturer                      Background            The third case is that of a company that makes            electrical and electronic capacitors for original            equipment manufacturers white good manufacturers            lighting manufacturers telecommunications and other            light manufacturing companies The company was founded            in  Due to environmental contamination the            company entered into a consent agreement with the EPA            to mothball its plant and relocated in  to a new            purposebuilt facility The company has             manufacturing employees over three shifts and             support staff            In  the company eliminated the position of            Environmental Health and Safety Manager and instead            moved health and safety functions to the human            resources department and environmental functions became            part of the facility managers responsibilities The            companys workermanagement health and safety committee            has responsibility for health and safety management            Additionally the company hires environmental and            industrial hygiene consultants for specific needs            Currently there is no Toxic Use Reduction Planning            Committee although one operated and was very active            during the tenure of the former Environmental Health            and Safety Manager                                Processes and Source Reduction            This company replaced methylene chloride in two            processes In the first nmethyl pyrrolidone was a            dropin substitution for methylene chloride as an            equipment cleaner Nmethyl pyrrolidone was identified            as a potential substitute by their chemical supplier            Similar to the operation described above in the rubber            products company a solvent is used to purge equipment            after the equipment completes a batch coating of small            capacitors with an epoxy coating Isopropyl alcohol is            preferentially used as a cleanup solvent but nmethyl            pyrrolidone is now also used as methylene chloride            was as a general cleanup solvent for tools and            equipment Nmethyl pyrrolidone is received in drums            and decanted into solvent safety cans squirt bottles            and paper cups            Methylene chloride also had been used to dilute an            adhesive used to seal the covers onto capacitor units            The adhesive also contained some methylene chloride            This process has always been a partially automated one            most covers can be automatically sprayed with adhesive            but in some cases workers had to manually apply the            thin layer of adhesive using a small oil can            applicator In both cases workers manually mixed            methylene chloride with adhesive for application The            company contacted the manufacturer of adhesive for            information about what substitute materials would work            with their product The company suggested a material            based on dichlorofluoroethane also known as Freon            b It is a hydrochlorofluorocarbon and is one of the            principal dropin substitutes for the banned            chlorofluorocarbons The company began purchasing this            chemical as a dropin substitute for methylene            chloride            Over the twoyear process to eliminate methylene            chloride from this operation the adhesive manufacturer            also eliminated methylene chloride from the adhesive by            substituting aromatic hydrocarbons xylene            Additionally the company made equipment changes that            increased the amount of this work that could be            automated and reduced the requirement for diluting the            adhesive for automated operations Thus the Freon is            currently only used for manual operations which are a            small part of the process Under pressure of the            scheduled phase out of the chemical under the Clean Air            Act the company was looking for ways to change their            equipment to eliminate the need for a diluent in manual            application of the sealant            Elimination of methylene chloride was motivated by            the toxics use reduction planning required by Toxics            Use Reduction Act and interest in a positive            environmental image There was no apparent health and            safety motivation for the reduction of use planning            and program activities for reduction and elimination of            methylene chloride occurred in  prior to the new            standard Methylene chloride was eliminated from            operations in                                 Technical environmental health and safety and            financial assessment            Evaluation consisted primarily of assessing the            technical performance of the substitutes The company            assumed that substitutes recommended by chemical            suppliers would be acceptable from an environmental and            health and safety perspective Material Safety Data            Sheets were reviewed by the former Environmental Health            and Safety Manager but not by the health and safety            committee There was no other apparent evaluation to            gauge impact on the production process environment or            health or safety conditions of the change Costs and            benefits were not assessed            Workers are no longer exposed to methylene chloride            at this company No methylene chloride exposure records            were available and the facility manager did not think            that any exposure monitoring had ever been done Given            methylene chlorides high volatility and the mostly            uncontrolled nature of the operations using methylene            chloride the old process would probably have resulted            in overexposure In the cleaning operation other than            decreased exposure due to reduced volatility of            nmethyl pyrrolidone exposure potential remained the            same as it had been when workers were using methylene            chloride for equipment purging and general clean up            Both tasks are uncontrolled manual processes and there            is the potential for skin exposure from splashes and            sprays and inhalation exposure due to vaporization of            bulk chemical from open containers Work practices            included throwing  liters  oz paper containers            full of contaminated nmethyl pyrrolidone into an open            garbage container            Nmethyl pyrrolidone exposure can cause acute and            chronic health effects in workers The US Air Force            has determined that it is not a potential substitute            for methylene chloride because of both potential worker            health and performance concerns     It is an eye            and skin irritant has a noxious odor and it has been            found to cause fetal death and fetal abnormalities in            rat studies    Nmethyl pyrrolidones vapor            pressure at room temperature is very low thus            minimizing the chance of exposure by inhalation            However skin adsorption is thought to be the main            route of exposure During the site visit a worker            doing the purging and cleaning operation was asked what            he thought of the change He noted that nmethyl            pyrrolidone was more irritating to the skin than            methylene chloride            In the sealant operation the mixing of the sealant            had occurred without local exhaust ventilation            although the manual and automatic application work area            was equipped with local exhaust ventilation The            potential for methylene chloride exposure during mixing            and decanting operations probably had been quite            significant The mixing area which was adjacent to the            process was uncontrolled and very messy Additionally            the work areaconveyer belt was also covered in the red            sealant material The process was not in operation            during the site visit so current work practices were            not observed The operators chemical resistant gloves            were sitting partially turned inside out on top of the            machine After the process changes manual operations            were performed far less often than they had when            methylene chloride was used            Freon b is quite volatile and can cause the            health effects of organic solvents plus the health            effects of chlorofluorocarbons cardiac arrhthmia            Because in both cases the operations were essentially            unchanged from the previous ones that used methylene            chloride there was no apparent impact on noise            ergonomics or safety It is possible that manual            material handling was decreased due to the decreased            volume of chemical used barrel loading and decanting            tasks became less frequent with the new chemicals            No financial accounting of the old process or the            new one was undertaken as part of the change The            facility manager noted that nmethyl pyrrolidone and            the Freon bbased chemistry were both more expensive            than methylene chloride Nmethyl pyrrolidone is            estimated to be almost four times as expensive as            methylene chloride on a per gallon basis However due            to the equipment and process changes and nmethyl            pyrrolidones lower volatility much less of the new            chemicals are used compared with methylene chloride            According to the facility manager the proposed            investment in equipment changes to facilitate the            sealant project required justification a song and            dance to the financial managers The company            ordinarily requires an month payback on capital            investments ie recover the cost of the investment            through savings or increased revenues within  months            and this project was presented as an additional cost            without monetized benefits As a result the project            was approved on environmental grounds rather than            financial ones The production manager perceived            nonquantified financial benefits of the change            including increased efficiency and flexibility and            reduced environmental compliance requirements                                    Vessel Cleaning                      Background            This vessel cleaning company employs  workers over            two shifts and does  million in business a year            cleaning the inside and outside of tanker trucks and             liter  gal chemical totes Many of the            employees had worked for the company for many years            and like other small companies management will            sometimes also do the required work The company            management has experience in hazardous waste            management Common contaminants cleaned from the tanks            and totes include floculating agents for water            treatment latex formaldehyde acids and bases            coatings paper industry chemicals and adhesives            OSHAs Preamble to the methylene chloride standard            noted that engineering controls such as local exhaust            ventilation were likely to be infeasible to control            methylene chloride exposure below the Permissible            Exposure Limit in vessel cleaning    The Preamble            states that respiratory protection equipment has been            used in the past in vessel cleaning and it expected            that it would be relied upon under this standard                                Process and Source Reduction            In the usual cleaning process workers first used            hot and cold water under pressure to clean the outside            and inside of the tank or tote A caustic sodium            metasilicatebased detergent solution was then sprayed            followed by a steam cleaning designed to remove            solvents As necessary the workers would also manually            scrape out dried contaminant  a process that required            a confined space entry permit            Of particular concern to the company was the process            required to clean an adhesive used in the automotive            industry from chemical totes Prior to the process            change described below the workers cleaned the inside            of these totes with methylene chloride and manual            scraping The cleaning process for this contaminant            involved a worker pouring  liters  gal of            methylene chloride into a tote tipping and rolling it            releasing the lid to degassify it as the manager            explained it getting into the tote and scraping for            eight hours a day for three days The workers also used            methylene chloride to clean the outside of the            totes            The company management consulted the Toxics Use            Reduction Institutes Surface Cleaning Laboratory and            initially selected a very effective substitute cleaner            based on nmethyl pyrrolidone and dibasic esters This            change reduced the hazardous waste cost from  to            tote but the cleaning process still took several            days The company also considered sand blasting but            determined that it would be too harsh on the totes            Following the receipt of a  Toxics Use Reduction            Institute Demonstration Grant the company moved to a            baking soda blast process where a small amount of            water is mixed with baking soda to suppress dust and            the worker directs the spray through a nozzle The task            now takes two workers one day to do each tote For the            task of cleaning the outside of totes the workers now            use highpressure water instead of methylene            chloride            The company began to look into alternatives out of            concern over the volume of hazardous waste produced by            this cleaning operation and methylene chlorides            toxicity Additionally the company was looking for a            faster less laborintensive work method This became            especially important after the company got a large            contract for this work at a time when the company lost            a significant portion of other work The introduction            of the  OSHA standard for methylene chloride also            provided a significant incentive for this change The            manager said he thought that the cost to comply with            the new standard would be very expensive especially            the cost of the supplied air respirator airpurifying            respirators are not permitted for methylene chloride            exposure prevention due to high breakthrough volume and            limited warning properties An additional factor that            not only motivated but also assisted with the change            was a demonstration project grant from the Toxics Use            Reduction Institute that defrayed the cost of the            change and was accompanied by technical assistance The            free services of the Surface Cleaning Laboratory were            utilized to find substitute chemistries                                Technical environmental health and safety and            financial assessment            As in the other cases technical performance            concerns dominated the companys evaluation efforts            Unlike the other cases worker chemical exposure to            methylene chloride was a central concern and this            change eliminated a very serious potential methylene            chloride exposure In the old process workers were at            risk of acute overexposure from working in a confined            space with this highly volatile and toxic chemical The            new process greatly minimized the toxicity of the            chemical exposure in this process but introduced new            physical hazards including noise and ergonomic stress            such as awkward postures and forceful exertions from            carrying and directing the nozzle Thumb pressure on            the nozzle is a particular ergonomic concern            Management has told workers to rest and to alternate            fingers to reduce the risk of injury            Noise from the new blasting equipment was not            measured but was perceived by the investigator to be            potentially hazardous Reportedly the sales            representative told management with regard potential            concerns about the noise levels of the equipment            theyll get used to the noise The baking soda is a            mild respiratory irritant and for that reason the            workers wear dust masks Additionally they use woven            gloves hearing protection Tyvek or cotton uniforms            safety glasses and boots Four to six hours of this            work is very hard but according to management the            workers are much happier with the current process than            they were when working with methylene chloride  a            process that involved forceful manual scraping in            awkward postures for days at a time            The company estimated cost savings of tote over            the old process  a savings of  The manager            specifically mentioned avoidance of OSHA compliance            costs especially the cost of the respirator as a            motivation behind the project Other cost benefits            included the ability to take on more of this work            without expanding the labor force and faster turnover            of the work The companys costs of the project were            minimized by the Toxics Use Reduction Institutes grant            and the savings gained from finding a used compressor            Management describes the costs of the new process with            the exception of the purchase cost of the compressor            as minor                                      Discussion                  Summary of source reduction process changes          Out of seven processes using methylene chloride in          these four companies two were adhesive thinning          operations and five were cleaning operations Three          companies eliminated methylene chloride and one          significantly reduced its use of methylene chloride In          three processes commerciallyavailable dropin          substitutes were used with little production process          modification but four process changes required some          equipment or production process modification  in one          case the entire process was replaced Two process changes          involved using mechanical cleaning in conjunction with          new chemical substitutes Some of the source reduction          process change initiatives took advantage of the normal          cycles of change in industry facilitated by increasing          and decreasing demand for products and services A loss          of orders enabled one company to use less methylene          chloride while an increase in orders prompted another to          seek out an alternative to methylene chloride Two          companies continue to look for substitutes for their          original substitutes  one because of environmental          concerns of the substitute and the other to lower          costs          The three companies that eliminated methylene chloride          use did not first attempt to control worker and          environmental exposure with engineering controls but          looked for substitutes directly The company that          continued to use methylene chloride implemented controls          required by environmental regulations  and not the OSHA          recommended controls which if implemented might have          conflicted with environmental protection Despite taking          steps including significant expenditures to control          methylene chloride emissions the company was still          motivated to further reduce or eliminate use of the          chemical Three of the companies relied on their chemical          suppliers for advice about safer substitutes Two          utilized technical assistance and Surface Cleaning          Laboratory services of the Toxics Use Reduction          Institute          Companies were strongly motivated by environmental          compliance and goals Specifically they sought to          improve compliance with the Clean Air Act reduce their          reporting under the Toxics Use Reduction Act and reduce          hazardous waste Worker health concerns including          compliance with the new OSHA standard were a partial          motivating factor in three cases Improving production          efficiency was the major motivation in two cases In a          third case the costs of using a volatile chemical such          as methylene chloride also motivated the changes                          Summary of technical environmental health and          safety and financial assessment          Companies evaluation efforts focused on technical          performance concerns However potential substitute          chemistries with obvious environmental problems were not          evaluated to see if they would work Financial          environmental and worker health evaluations of          substitutes were minimal          Three companies completely eliminated exposure to          methylene chloride in routine and nonroutine operations          The fourth significantly reduced overexposure potential          by reducing the duration of potential exposure Based on          available information the substitute chemistries and          processes appear to be less toxic and less hazardous in          use than methylene chloride see Table  Process          changes and the physical properties of the new          chemistries reduced potential exposure through reduction          in quantity of total chemical used lower volatility and          increased automation In three cases the principal          potential hazard of the substitutes is acute eye skin          andor respiratory irritation          One company selected potentially hazardous substitute          chemistries one a potential reproductive hazard with          potential for exposure through skin adsorption the other          an ozonedepleter and a potential cardiovascular toxin          However in the later case the total quantities used and          potential for exposure in this operation were minimal In          one company potential ergonomic hazards of the old          process using methylene chloride were eliminated with          methylene chloride but the new process introduced new          potential ergonomic hazards A noise hazard was also          introduced          Within general constraints of not wishing to invest          large amounts of money in capital equipment the          companies were not especially concerned about potential          negative financial impacts of the changes Only one          company conducted a financial analysis of the change          However the companies did try to economize on the costs          of the changes While the new chemistries cost more than          methylene chloride on a volume basis the lower          volatility and improved operations from the source          reduction process changes resulted in lower chemical          consumption and costs Two companies anticipated and          reaped significant financial benefits from the          changesmainly through improved production          efficiency                          Study limitations and strengths          This study used a case study approach to detail issues          related to source reduction process change As such its          conclusions may not be generalizable due to the small          sample size and selection bias due to a sampling strategy          that selected companies for participation based upon          their willingness to participate Additionally the          findings are largely the result of a single          investigators interpretation of the data and cases          Evaluation is meant to figure as a fundamental component          of the source reduction process However the small scope          of the project and restrictions in the amount of time          and resources of the participating companies meant that          neither the companies nor the investigators benefited          from ideal systematic financial technical and          environmental health and safety assessments Finally          this research focused on one chemical and just a few          industrial processes and may or may not apply to other          cases especially those with more specialized processes          or where the hazard in question is a formulated          constituent of a companys product and change would          require reengineering of the product itself rather than          of an auxiliary process          The study strengths include a rich descriptive case          study approach useful in understanding in detail source          reduction as a hazard control technique including          practical limitations potential for missed opportunities          to improve the work environment unintended consequences          future directions for preventive approaches and research          needs The discovery of themes common across these four          cases suggests their potential generalizability as          categories of analysis The findings of this study can          guide further investigation of the feasibility and          effectiveness of source reduction in other applications          Additionally the investigators believe that the          experience of these companies largely comports with the          experience of other companies in Massachusetts who had          used methylene chloride based upon an investigation of          more than twenty such companies                               Conclusions        These cases suggest that source reduction strategies can        be a feasible and effective approach to compliance with        workplace and environmental standards and reduction of        worker health hazards In its methylene chloride standard        OSHA had concluded that engineering controls were not        feasible for vessel cleaning and this industry would rely        on suppliedair respirators for exposure control We found        that for a vessel cleaning company and three other diverse        industrial examples source reduction process changes that        eliminated methylene chloride use were not only feasible        but beneficial to production and environmental protection        goals        The experience of these cases also suggests that        technical assistance sensitive to both technical and        occupational and environmental health concerns could help        maximize the benefits of source reduction process change        projects Typically technical concerns are toppriority        and many companies trust that unlisted products and        products recommended by chemical sales personnel are        safe Companies may make suboptimal choices from an        occupational health and safety or environmental standpoint        with inadequate information about alternatives        And finally it appears that source reduction strategies        can result in financial benefits without even considering        the reduced costs of regulatory compliance When companies        look at processes they often try to improve them overall        by reducing the problems they cause environmental        contamination and worker exposure and innovating        production improvements Financial concerns associated with        the change other than significant capital investments do        not appear to be a major barrier to the utilization of        source reduction strategies especially when the changes        are motivated by regulatory compliance        A recommendation based upon these project findings is        that source reduction should be included in the category of        potential feasible and effective strategies for compliance        with standards and reduction of health hazards Because        companies may miss opportunities to improve processes both        from an environmental worker health and production        standpoint without adequate technical assistance that comes        from noncommercial sources worker health agencies should        devote resources to this task andor link companies to such        resources Technical assistance programs and small grants        and loans can play a positive role in facilitating the        innovation that can be realized from source reduction This        may be especially true for small businesses without        resources to do extensive research or modeling of        alternatives The Toxics Use Reduction Institute Surface        Cleaning Laboratory has played a critical role in assisting        Massachusetts firms in finding alternatives and        demonstrates a positive model for other states        Intervention research is needed to find ways of        coordinating technical assistance with regulation and        compliance activities to maximize efficient and effective        dissemination of source reduction strategies For example        in this study it was found that chemical distribution        companies may be a primary and often exclusive source of        information on alternatives Efforts could be targeted to        improve the quality of information and services provided to        companies through their chemical suppliers                    Competing interests        This project was funded in part by the Toxics Use        Reduction Institute at the University of Massachusetts        Lowell which is funded by
