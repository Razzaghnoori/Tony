                            Imagine this scenario Youre the director of one of the worlds largest medical        research charities and you receive notification from one of your funded investigators in        Africa reporting some exciting progress toward the development of a vaccine for malaria        The work has just been published so you log onto the Web to do a quick keyword search and        a link to the article is brought up on your screen        Then imagine the frustration when you click on the link to read the message Access        Deniedaccess to this journal is restricted to registered institutional and individual        subscribers        And theres the rub this actually happened to the Director of the Wellcome Trust Prior        to this the committee that advises the Wellcome Trust Library were already asking whether        the Trust should adopt a formal position on the continually increasing prices of journal        subscriptions and the problems this trend was causing research libraries        These events encouraged the Trust to investigate the publication of scientific research        to see if there was anything researchfunding organisations could be doing to stimulate        change in what appears to be a failing market As it turns out there is quite a lot I now        believe it is the funders of researchcharities governments and other publicly funded        bodies such as national research agencieswho hold the purse strings that can untie        scientific discoveries from a publishing market that is no longer serving the community as        well as it could That is why today the Trust is a leading advocate for enabling free        access to research literature through support for new publishing models such as that of        the Public Library of Science and the establishment of publicly accessible repositories        working in partnership with the United States National Institutes of Healthfunded PubMed        Central         It is worth noting that the Trust is not a novice in seeking better ways to disseminate        research findings The fact that the sequence of the human genome is an openly accessible        work is due in large measure to the Trusts determination that this information be in the        public domain and not hidden behind commercial subscriptions As a consequence of that        insistence we believe these data are a more widely used and valuable resource                  Trustfunded researchers will have to deposit an electronic version of their          manuscripts in PMC to be made available for free via the Internet within  months of          publication                The Trust began its investigation of the scientific publishing sector by commissioning        two pieces of research one to inform itself of the economics of the publishing sector and        a second to explore whether there were alternative business models out there that could        enable research to have the quality assurance it needs peer review whilst being available        for free using the Web as the medium of publication                    The Economics of Publishing        The first Trustcommissioned study described how scientific research publishing has        traditionally worked and why it can be described in economic terms as a failing market         Essentially the producers researchers as authors and the consumers researchers as        readers are isolated from any of the costs within the system Researchers give away the        copyright to their work for free to the publishers who organise the peer review and        copyedit the article The publishers then sell it to libraries at prices that range from        enough to cover their costs through to some pretty high profitssome over  These        profits escape from an otherwise selfcontained financial cycle to satisfy shareholders or        run learned societies unlike typical publishing relationships none are returned directly        to the author the researcher who wrote the piece or even to the consulting experts the        researchers who provided the peer review        At the same time researchers as readers access the material if they are able to do so        through their employing institution either using the library ormore typically nowvia the        Internet through the institutions subscription To the researcher this access appears        free effectively creating a market system that has no pressures from the producers or        consumers to change One consequence of this is that publishers have been able to increase        subscription prices well above inflation the United Kingdom has seen subscription rates        rise by more than  in the last ten years Blackwells periodical price indexes         The money used to fund UK libraries is all public money and over  of the funds paying        for research in the UK university system is either government or charitable so in a        sense the people who are paying for the research cannot access its findings without paying        an additional fee        This then begs the question of what alternatives there are to this traditional system        now that the Internet has become the researchers tool of choice for searching and        accessing the literature The second piece of research commissioned by the Trust looked at        different business models for research publishing in order to address this question         It compared openaccess journals which often levy a charge to publish but provide the        journal for free and the majority of the traditional models which take the research for        free but charge readers to read it        This study convinced the Trust that the best way forward to improve access to research        findings would be through open access to scientific research articles This essentially        means two things first that the copyright holder or holders must grant to the public a        free irrevocable perpetual license to use copy distribute and make derivative works of        their research article in any medium for any purpose excepting those that constitute        plagiarism or other dishonest acts of course and second that a digital copy must be        deposited in an open public archival repository for example the US National Library of        Medicines PubMed Central Whilst a debate continues as to the most appropriate route to        achieve open access to all research literature it is important to bear in mind that the        publication and the archiving of research articles are intrinsically linked Both aspects        of open access need to be explored and experimented with and the Trust is actively        pursuing solutions for the problems of both                    Alternative Business Models        The findings of the second report seem to have caused quite a controversyparticularly        in the suggestion that moving wholesale to an openaccess publishing model might produce        savings of up to   One common misinterpretation of this conclusion is that any such        savings would be due solely to discontinuing the printed versions of publications that are        freely available online This is incorrect In fact if savings are to be made in an        openaccess model they will largely be found in the variable costs of journal        productionsince an openaccess journal will not have to cover the costs of subscription        management licence negotiations or sales and little is required for marketing and        distribution        In a comparison included in the report an article in a good to highquality journal        produced in the subscription model is estimated to cost US The equivalent cost under        an authorside payment model is estimated as USa comparable saving of  on the        costs and a saving of  when the variable costs are compared It must be remembered that        cost does not equate to price so to these figures regardless of the mode of publication        must be added overhead expenses and of course profit However if a truly competitive        market is createdwhere payments are directed to publishers not by third parties but by        those directly involved in the scientific enterprise who could easily compare the varying        article processing charges of different openaccess publishersthen the actual savings        might well be substantially higher        At its essence though the openaccess debate is not about economics it is about        access That is why the Trust has been in discussion with the US National Library of        Medicine about the possibility of creating a UK PubMed Central UKPMC as a publicly        accessible repository for Trustfunded research                    UK PubMed Central        The proposal is that a UKPMC will be run as a proper electronic library it will        collect collate and archive whole journals and be developed to receive single articles as        well Submission will be as straightforward as attaching a document to an email UKPMC will        be able to accept manuscripts in any format including Microsoft Word and it will be the        responsibility of UKPMC to convert the files it receives into extensible markup language        XML to enable the appropriate document type definition DTD to be assigned UKPMC will        also correct the structural content and consistency errors that occur when converting        text for digital preservation and provide the conversion process to print a clear PDF        version of included articles to those users who download them This is a process well used        by the National Library of Medicine and the one most suited for the longterm digital        preservation of articles        And once articles are in a digital format they can be searched and used in different        ways For example genome sequence data chemical compounds or protein structures embedded        within an article can be searched for in other articles and linked directly to genome or        structural databases uncovering new genetic markers drug uses or protein functions The        articles themselves become live research material greatly improving the efficacy of the        research itself        For a funder having all its research in one format under one roof and searchable        will improve the efficiency of strategy settingfor example setting funding        prioritiesassessing the outputs of the funded research and even gaining an insight into        the impact of the work As grants management becomes more electronic there can be a direct        link between original research proposals and the research outputs        For a medical charity like the Trust I believe it is our duty to actively encourage the        most efficient processes available to maximise the likelihood that the research we fund        will have the greatest possible health benefit        That is why the Trust will be making it a requirement of its grant conditions that        Trustfunded researchers deposit an electronic version of their manuscripts in UKPMC to be        made available for free via the Internet within  months of publication The delay means        that this is not open access in the truest sense However the Trust considers that the        development of a PubMed Central portal in the UK offers the best next step in the        transition towards a situation where all highquality peerreviewed research is available        for free via the Internet whilst leaving all publishers room for manoeuvre in this        changing market
