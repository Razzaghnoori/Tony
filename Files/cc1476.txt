 Introduction The use of inhaled bronchodilators to treat children with bronchiolitis remains controversial 1 2 3 4 The controversy may be the result of differences in study populations in choice of bronchodilators or in measured outcome variables between trials One common confounding variable of past studies has been the inclusion of children with a history of recurrent wheezing The measurement of pulmonary function during infancy is difficult because of the lack of subject cooperation It has been shown that analysis of flow volume loops at tidal breathing is useful in evaluating lung function in infancy 5 6 7 Morris and Lane 8 described a rapid rise of tidal expiratory flow to a maximum value in adult patients with airflow obstruction In their study the ratio of the time to PTEF to total expiratory time t PTEF t E and the ratio of the tidal volume at PTEF to total exhaled volume V PTEF V E were correlated with conventional measurements of airway obstruction 8 Studies have also used tidal breathing flow volume TBFV loops to evaluate airway function in healthy newborns and infants with and without wheezing 5 6 7 9 10 11 12 13 Cutrera et al 14 reported a good correlation between tidal expiratory flow patterns and conventional spirometric measurements in school age children Analysis of tidal breathing was used to predict wheezing illness during infancy 9 10 13 Respiratory function in infants after respiratory syncytial virus RSV proven bronchiolitis showed a lower t PTEF t E ratio compared with that of age matched healthy infants 15 Several groups have studied pulmonary function in infants with bronchiolitis with varying results 1 2 3 The recent literature also suggests either a lack of efficacy or a very small efficacy for albuterol administration in the management of bronchiolitis 16 17 The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effect of nebulized albuterol administration on TBFV loops and wheeze scores in infants with bronchiolitis due to RSV Materials and methods Selection of patients The study was conducted in the pediatric unit of a community teaching hospital Patients admitted to the pediatric unit were eligible for the study if they met the following criteria age younger than 1 year first episode of wheezing clinical features of bronchiolitis rhinorrhea tachypnea and wheezing and or rales and nasopharyngeal secretions positive for RSV as determined by enzyme immunoassay Preterm infants and infants with underlying cardiopulmonary disease bronchopulmonary dysplasia previous history of wheezing or those needing admission to the pediatric intensive care unit were excluded from the study The study was approved by the hospital s Institutional Review Board Informed written consent was obtained from all parents before enrollment of patients Study design Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive either 0 15 mg kg albuterol in 3 ml saline group A or 3 ml saline without albuterol group B via a nebulizer with an air flow of 6 8 l min The same patients were crossed over to receive the alternate saline or albuterol treatment 6 hours after the first aerosol administration The 6 hour interval before crossover measurements was used to exclude any carryover effect of nebulized albuterol or saline The timing of postaerosol measurements was based on several previously published reports 2 4 18 19 Observers were unable to distinguish between the two nebulizer solutions by any characteristics and both nebulized solutions were dispensed by the pharmacy in identical syringes Block randomization was also performed by the pharmacy department and the records were concealed until the end of the study Chloral hydrate 50 mg kg orally was administered 30 min before the measurements were taken An aerosol either albuterol or saline treatment was given following baseline measurements of heart rate respiratory rate wheeze score arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry and pulmonary function The same measurements were also repeated 15 min after the aerosol treatment The entire procedure was repeated in 6 hours with the second aerosol either saline or albuterol treatment None of the patients received any other bronchodilators within 6 hours of the first aerosol treatment or between the first and second aerosol administration In those infants who were on supplemental oxygen the amount of supplemental oxygen was kept constant during the study period Corticosteroids were not administered to any patients in the study Pulmonary function tests All pulmonary function tests were performed by two experienced respiratory therapists A SensorMedics 2600 Pediatric Pulmonary cart SensorMedics Corp Anaheim CA USA was used to obtain TBFV loops The TBFV loops were obtained and analyzed by a standard method described previously 5 A close fitting face mask Model VR 3100 Ventlab Corporation Mocksville NC USA with an air inflated cuff was used to ensure that no air leaks occurred Four representative tidal flow volume loops were stored for analysis Each loop was chosen from a series of breaths during established tidal breathing A minimum of 16 loops was collected to select the four stored loops The loops were selected from tidal breaths with as stable a volume and shape as possible The means from these four loops were used as the results for each child Outcome measures Several aspects of pulmonary function were chosen as outcome measures These included the ratio of expiratory time to reach PTEF to the total expiratory time as a primary outcome measure the tidal volume V T PTEF TEF10 TEF25 and TEF50 and 25 PT as other pulmonary function tests of interest Heart rate respiratory rate oxygen saturation and wheeze score 0 no wheezing 1 end expiratory wheezing only 2 wheezing during entire expiration inspiratory phase audible with stethoscope only 3 expiratory and inspiratory wheezing audible without stethoscope 20 were also measured Statistical analysis To estimate the sample size we analyzed pulmonary function studies of 14 infants with a recent history of wheezing illness that were performed in our pulmonary function laboratory We calculated the intrasubject coefficient of variation for t PTEF t E as 20 25 A 40 difference twice the coefficient of variation was considered a clinically important improvement Assuming an level of 0 05 two tailed and 90 power a sample size of 17 20 patients per group was predicted All values are presented as mean standard deviation Nineteen measurements were made all together in each of the two categories saline treatment and albuterol treatment The values for each investigated variable were compared with baseline measurements 19 measurements before nebulization with saline and 19 measurements before nebulization with albuterol by repeated measures analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons These comparisons included baseline before saline treatment versus baseline before albuterol treatment saline treatment versus albuterol treatment baseline before saline treatment versus saline treatment and baseline before albuterol treatment versus albuterol treatment The wheeze scores in various categories were compared with a non parametric Friedman test followed by Dunn s test Improvement after saline treatment and albuterol treatment from their respective baseline values were compared with a paired t test P 0 05 was considered significant Results Patient characteristics Twenty patients were enrolled in the study during the study period Analysis of one patient s flow volume loops was consistent with grunting and the subject was excluded from the study All 19 infants in our study had a cough 3 6 2 8 days Eighteen infants had symptoms of upper respiratory infection 2 94 0 9 days wheezing 2 3 1 7 days and breathing difficulties 1 7 0 9 days Sixteen infants had difficulties in feeding 1 6 0 8 days and nine of the 19 infants had fever 1 5 0 7 days A family history of wheezing or atopy was present in nine infants Exposure to passive smoking and household pets were present in 12 and eight infants respectively One child presented with apnea and four infants had otitis media at the time of admission The duration of hospital stay in our study group was 3 9 1 1 days Five infants received oxygen supplementation and eight infants needed intravenous fluids for more than 1 day All infants were positive for RSV and none were premature or had bronchopulmonary dysplasia All baseline demographic and clinical variables were evenly distributed between the two groups except for gender distribution Table 1 No significant changes were observed in heart rate respiratory rate oxygen saturation and wheeze score after aerosol treatments Table 2 The PTEF increased both after albuterol and saline treatments but the difference between the two treatments was not significant Both TEF10 and 25 PT significantly decreased after albuterol administration P 0 05 There were no significant changes in V PTEF V E and t PTEF t E either with albuterol or with saline Table 3 Discussion Relationship between tidal flow indices and airflow obstruction Morris and Lane 8 demonstrated that in older children and adults V PTEF V E and t PTEF t E values from TBFV loops correlate well with specific airway conductance with forced expiratory volume in the first second and with the ratio of forced expiratory volume in the first second to the forced vital capacity They also showed that the values of V PTEF V E and t PTEF t E were significantly lower in subjects with obstructive airway disease In children younger than 2 years of age with bronchopulmonary obstruction t PTEF t E and V PTEF V E values were lower than in the controls and improved after salbutamol administration 7 The magnitude of change in t PTEF t E was significantly correlated with the concentration of serum eosinophilic cationic protein an inflammatory marker 7 The same investigators showed in a different study that V PTEF V E t PTEF t E and 25 PT ratios were significantly lower in asthmatic children and improved significantly after salbutamol when compared with controls 24 In another study in school age children however the V PTEF V E value was not significantly different in asymptomatic asthmatics when compared with age matched healthy controls 14 In addition forced vital capacity peak expiratory flow by spirometry and forced expiratory flow at 75 of forced vital capacity FEF 75 were similar in both groups Only FEF 50 and FEF 25 discriminated asymptomatic asthmatics from the healthy controls The tidal flow index t PTEF t E measured during the first 3 months of life has been shown to be predictive of subsequent wheezing in boys during the first 3 years 9 10 Alder et al 13 however concluded in their study that t PTEF t E is only weakly associated with the development of lower respiratory tract illness during the first year of life and the ratio is less precise and an epidemiologically less useful measure than maximum expiratory flow at functional residual capacity Clarke et al 25 were also not able to detect any difference in t PTEF t E between healthy infants who did and did not develop lower respiratory illness In older infants aged 6 14 months who suffered from obstructive airway disease Banovcin et al 6 reported significant correlation between maximum expiratory flow at functional residual capacity corrected for lung volume and V PTEF V E and t PTEF t E They also showed a weak correlation between V PTEF V E and airway resistance reported as percentage predicted 6 Banovcin et al concluded that V PTEF V E and t PTEF t E correlate better with measures of peripheral airway obstruction than with airway resistance reflecting mainly central airway patency Dezateaux et al 12 compared t PTEF t E with airway function measured by plethysmography They found a weak but significant association between t PTEF t E and specific airway conductance in infants aged older than 3 months irrespective of their previous wheezing status What determines the t PTEF t E value There is controversy in infants about the validity of tests to measure airway obstruction 26 Little is known about the determinants of t PTEF t E in infancy The relationship of t PTEF t E to lung function may exist because t PTEF t E quantifies the degree of active tidal slowing that occurs in response to respiratory system mechanics In normal subjects during expiration the peak flow is reached approximately one third of the way through the expiration This is because of the slow cessation of inspiratory muscle activity at the end of inspiration If the inspiratory muscle activity ceases abruptly at the end of inspiration completely passive expiration results in early peaking of the flow due to unopposed recoil of the lung and the chest wall Both t PTEF and t E will influence the final value of the ratio t PTEF t E In a patient with airway obstruction slow exhalation secondary to an increased expiration time constant will increase t E In addition active breaking is diminished leading to decreased t PTEF Both these mechanisms result in a low t PTEF t E value in a patient with airway obstruction This effect could be further increased in severe obstruction with active exhalation and no active breaking In other words t PTEF t E may not be a direct indicator of airway caliber but may reflect a neuromuscular response to respiratory mechanics in airway obstruction The behavior of V PTEF V E mainly parallels that of t PTEF t E The same mechanisms responsible for determining t PTEF t E may be operative in determining V PTEF V E The role of several measured tidal flows TEF50 TEF25 TEF10 and ratios 25 PT in the evaluation of pulmonary function is mostly unknown In airway obstruction tidal flows may become flow limited especially towards the end of the tidal volume because of dynamic compression 8 The rate of airflow is highly dependent on the lung volume at which the flow is measured Without knowing the lung volumes at which the tidal flows are measured the tidal flows have limited value in the evaluation of lung function Tidal breathing parameters and bronchiolitis Low t PTEF t E values in infants with bronchiolitis may result from an increased time constant i e increased t E and or decreased active braking i e reduced t PTEF Both of these changes can happen because of airway obstruction Theoretically sedation may reduce t PTEF t E by diminishing active braking In fact t PTEF t E was found to be lower in awake compared with sleeping newborn infants 11 The mean value for t PTEF t E 0 16 0 09 in our study is lower than that previously reported values for healthy infants 10 15 27 The probable explanation for the low values of t PTEF t E in our study population is airway obstruction In our study PTEFs have increased with the concomitant decrease in tidal flows near the end of exhalation TEF10 and with the decrease in the 25 PT ratio Peak flow during tidal breathing is submaximal it can be increased with increased effort Theoretically it can also increase due to bronchodilation We cannot determine whether bronchodilation or increased force of contraction of respiratory muscles resulting from aerosol administration is the cause of the increased PTEF in the present patients The later in expiration that the flow is measured the more the measurement reflects the resistance of the very small airways 28 A significant decrease in tidal expiratory flows at the remaining 10 of tidal volume in the present study may suggest narrowing of the small airways after albuterol administration The ratio 25 PT will be influenced by the values of TEF25 as well as PTEF In the present study PTEF significantly increased and TEF25 decreased although not statistically significant after albuterol administration Both these changes have lead to significant decrease in the ratio of 25 PT Increased effort during exhalation can theoretically lead to an increase in PTEF and by dynamic compression of smaller airways to a decrease in TEF25 this leads to a decrease in 25 PT The resistance of small airways is believed to have a greater effect on flow at lower lung volumes 28 Although tidal volumes remained constant in the present study we do not know whether the expiratory flows at the remaining 10 of tidal volume were measured at identical lung volumes before and after aerosol treatment The lack of improvement of tidal flow indices of airflow obstruction in the present study may be because of a true absence of bronchodilation in these patients or because these indices are not sensitive enough to detect bronchodilation if one existed As the index t PTEF t E reflects the neuromuscular response of pulmonary mechanics it may not be sensitive enough to detect small changes in the airway caliber As we have not compared TBFV indices with conventional measures of airway obstruction we cannot be certain whether we have missed bronchodilation if one existed The small sample size and variability of the tidal flow indices might have also contributed to the negative results of the present study The power of the study was to detect 40 improvement in t PTEF t E We could have easily missed a much smaller response because of the sample size although the clinical significance of such a response is unknown We have only used a single dose of aerosol and measured the pulmonary function once after the aerosol administration Theoretically we may have missed a peak effect of bronchodilation Although we have used a standard method of aerosol delivery and a standard dose altered respiratory mechanics and small airway disease in these infants with bronchiolitis may have lead to a decrease in the delivered dose of bronchodilator resulting in a lack of response Clinical scores in bronchiolitis In recent years there have been several reports of improvement of clinical scores such as oxygen saturation and respiratory distress scores etc after bronchodilator administration in infants with bronchiolitis 19 20 The failure of clinical scores to improve in the present study may be because of the small sample size and the inclusion of patients with mild disease However the observed improvement in clinical scores in several previous studies may be due to mechanisms other than bronchodilation Transient improvement in oxygenation may have occurred because of increased minute ventilation secondary to alteration in tidal breathing pattern following aerosol administration without bronchodi lation An improvement in respiratory distress scores may be explained by an increase in nasal and upper airway caliber especially in the studies with epinephrine In the present study group there was no clinical improvement with a bronchodilator The bronchodilators may increase oxygen consumption precipitate paradoxical hypoxemia and increase the cost of hospitalization Conclusions This present study in infants with mild bronchiolitis due to RSV demonstrates that nebulized albuterol does not improve V PTEF V E and t PTEF t E but can decrease
