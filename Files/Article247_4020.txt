 Bill Bradley Saved My Infant Dear Merrill What do you mean The L A equivalent of the New York Post is just the whole city itself I actually saw the Today show Ricky Martin concert not because I was awake for it of course but on a Denver local newscast when I was visiting my mom They kept saying And coming up Ricky Martin mania or whatever like it was a news item and I m sitting there thinking ah the sad state of journalism type thoughts but I didn t know the half of it because then so anyway when they finally got to the segment they actually rebroadcast the whole show not just clips or highlights but the whole thing in its entirety I mean what the hell is that Afterwards they cut back to the anchorwoman and she s trading quips with the other newscaster and fanning herself in that Hand Gesture That Wouldn t Raise an Eyebrow in the Middle of Sunday Services way that very very middle aged very very white people do to indicate that they have become sexually aroused The noble fourth estate An equivalent would be when papers run giant articles reporting the content of an upcoming 60 second campaign ad Today s was in the New York Times on Bradley s first big promo spot in which because he drafted a bill to allow women to remain hospitalized for 48 hours after delivering a newborn a woman claims that Thanks to Bill Bradley my daughter is alive today It turns out that her baby was born before the bill was ratified but the explanation offered was that the bill s postpartum passage gave her the confidence she needed to have another baby later Now as a carbon based life form my cells require regular fluid intake to survive Yet somehow I don t see myself ever earnestly emoting to a camera Thanks to public works pioneer Thurmond Elias Plefko the Madison commissioner of waterworks from 1834 to 1872 who installed my city s water system I am alive today although technically I suppose its sort of true Speaking of public works while I have no idea what Dick Riordan ate for lunch I can tell you what s in his toilet bowl even as we speak water that nature in her wisdom intended to be thousands of miles away from him Since L A is a savage desert hellscape not fit for human life it has to suck its lifeblood Scream Blacula Scream style from the whole western half of the continent No offense some of my best friends are Angelenos because they are comedy writers and there is an unwritten law saying anyone who writes comedy has to live in a sprawling array of car phones and one story buildings stretching hundreds of miles in every direction and besides any city that can come up with Being John Malkovich which is in addition to being a nice metaphor for Hillary Clinton s identity shifting Senate bid as well as well her whole existence quite possibly the greatest movie ever made deserves nothing but admiration I ve heard An American Movie is fabtastic and I ll see it tonight so I can discuss it with you tomorrow By the way I see now that Mahir has made Time magazine Look on his works ye mighty and despair Gee this is fun Todd P S I should probably add somewhere in here that my mother is a wonderful person and I love her very much
