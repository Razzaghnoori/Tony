                            The Icelandic population is now a part of a unique epidemiological study which has        involved investigating the genetic heritage of many of them The reason that this        experiment can be done is because of the remarkable records that exist in Iceland Not only        is there almost complete genealogical information dating back to the th century on all        current  and many previous Icelanders more than  in total but in        addition the country has an almost complete cancer registry dating from  A company        deCODE Genetics was set up to mine healthcare data in Iceland and to use it to assess        the effect of genetics on health Initially the company attracted criticism with some        questioning the ethics of providing access to healthcare data for many disease projects to        a forprofit company But the company has been supported by many Icelanders themselves        demonstrated by Icelanders donating blood samples with informed consent for research on        multiple diseases and now the projects scientific value is becoming apparent        One such analysis is the subject of a paper by Laufey Amundadottir and colleagues in        this months         PLoS Medicine that assesses how much genetic factors contribute to cancer        risk across the whole Icelandic population        The paper looked at  different types of cancers all those with more than  cases        that had been registered between  and  and analysed the frequency of close and        distant relatives also having that cancer or another kind of cancer Of the  cancers         showed significant familiality and for some this risk even extended to distant that is        third to fifthdegree relatives The seven cancers with the highest increased familial        occurrence both in close and distant relatives were breast prostate stomach lung colon        kidney and bladder cancers And interestingly three cancersstomach lung and colon        cancerwere also seen more frequently in mates of patients indicating a shared        environmental risk factor And for some cancers there was a familial association with other        cancers for example relatives of individuals with stomach colon rectal or endometrial        cancer were more likely to have any of these cancers        Cathryn Lewis the academic editor for the paper comments on the studys strengths        This level of family relationship and clinical diagnosis is rarely available from        interviewing patients and family members The size of the study over  individuals        with  cancer cases and the high quality of data enables the authors to detect subtle        effects across distant relationships        How robust are these data and what do they mean for the biological understanding of        cancer As Lewis says Although the current study is impressive in its size and scope        even here the sample size becomes an issue with the most convincing results seen in the        most common cancers Certainly not all the findings are surprising some rare cancers are        already known to be associated with particular genetic defects and syndromes that        predispose to multiple cancers have been described for example that of Hereditary        Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer Other associations are more intriguingthe cluster of        related cancers that include prostate kidney and bladder could possibly have a        developmental origin since all arise from the same part of the embryo        So by highlighting these subtle links the studys particular value may become        apparent deciding future avenues of investigation in the complex interrelationships that        interact to produce cancer
