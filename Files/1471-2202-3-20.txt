 Background Sleep is regulated by both circadian and homeostatic mechanisms As a consequence of a signal from the circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei SCN of the anterior hypothalamus in mammals 1 sleep is more likely to occur at certain times of the 24 h day than others thereby determining the daily sleep wake distribution 2 Sleep is homeostatically regulated in the sense that sleep drive accumulates in the absence of sleep and decreases during sleep Changes in sleep drive are thus driven by the sleep wake history Homeostatic and circadian mechanisms interact to determine the duration and quality of sleep and wakefulness 3 4 5 Homeostatic regulation of sleep can still be observed in animals that lack circadian rhythms after lesioning of the SCN 6 7 8 9 suggesting that circadian rhythms and sleep homeostasis are independent processes Homeostatic regulation of sleep can be quantified objectively after a period of enforced wakefulness i e sleep deprivation although a similar relationship between sleep parameters and spontaneous wakefulness can be quantified under baseline conditions as well 10 11 The compensatory responses in time spent asleep sleep consolidation i e sleep bout duration 12 and or sleep intensity observed after an extended period of wakefulness are all taken as evidence that sleep drive is increased during wakefulness and thus that sleep is homeostatically regulated Non REM sleep NREMS intensity quantified as EEG power in the delta frequency range 1 4 Hz and NREMS consolidation are in a quantitative and predictive relationship with sleep history both variables increase with the duration of prior wakefulness and subsequently decline during NREMS 3 4 10 12 13 These variables are thus quantitative markers of NREMS homeostasis and are presumed to reflect an underlying physiological drive for sleep 4 The time constants describing the dynamics of the increasing NREMS drive during wakefulness and decreasing NREMS drive during NREMS 10 14 are compatible with a role for changes in gene expression in their regulation Although past studies have shown that extended periods of wakefulness cause changes in gene expression for review see 15 no causal relationship between changes in gene expression and sleep homeostasis has been identified A recent study in Drosophila melanogaster implicates transcriptional regulation by the circadian gene cycle a homolog of the mammalian bmal1 gene in the homeostatic regulation of rest 16 While rest in flies shares several features with sleep in mammals 17 18 it remains to be determined whether a similar role for BMAL1 or related transcriptional regulators is necessary for the homeostatic regulation of sleep In both flies and mammals circadian rhythms are thought to be generated by transcriptional translational feedback loops comprising a network of transcriptional regulators 19 20 21 The core of this self sustained molecular oscillation consists of positive and negative elements In mammals the positive elements are two basic helix loop helix bHLH PAS domain containing transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1 that form heterodimers that can drive the transcription of three period per genes per1 3 and two cryptochromes cry1 2 PER1 2 and CRY1 2 proteins suppress CLOCK BMAL1 mediated transcription thereby forming the negative elements in the feedback loop Consistent with their central role in circadian rhythm generation genetic inactivation of both cryptochromes cry1 2 results in circadian arrhythmicity in mice 22 23 Given the widespread expression of the elements of the molecular clock in the brain and elsewhere and the large number of genes regulated by bHLH PAS transcription factors e g 24 the role of cryptochromes may extend beyond circadian clock function To determine whether transcriptional regulation by CRY1 2 influences the homeostatic regulation of sleep we studied sleep in cry1 2 mice under baseline conditions under conditions of constant darkness and after sleep deprivation SD The expression of circadian genes that are regulated by cryptochromes were evaluated in the brain of cry1 2 mice and in sleep deprived wild type mice and rats Results Sleep regulation in cry1 2 mice In baseline conditions wild type mice showed the sleep wake distribution typical for this nocturnal species with high values of sleep in the light period and low values in the dark period Figure 1 Table 1 The sleep wake distribution in cry1 2 mice was distinct from that of wild type controls Figure 1 in that sleep variables did not differ between the 12 h light L and dark D periods Table 1 Nevertheless as in wild type controls the light to dark transition was accompanied by a pronounced decrease in sleep time in cry1 2 mice Figure 1 During baseline total daily NREMS time was significantly greater in cry1 2 mice than in wild type mice 683 25 vs 576 12 min P 0 002 unpaired t test whereas the daily time spent in REM sleep did not differ 118 7 vs 113 10 min The difference between genotypes in NREMS time was present only in the dark period and not in the light Table 1 Figure 1 Average NREMS bout duration a measure of NREMS consolidation that is positively correlated with a high homeostatic sleep pressure 13 was greater by 34 in cry1 2 mice relative to wild type mice during the light period and by 41 during the dark period Table 1 Consistent with this increase in sleep consolidation NREMS delta power was significantly higher in cry1 2 than in cry1 2 mice during most of baseline Figure 1 This difference in EEG delta power was specific for NREMS and did not extend to other EEG frequencies Figure 2A indicating that the increase in delta power is not due to a difference in EEG amplification This state specific EEG difference in delta power was especially evident at the wake to NREMS transition cry1 2 mice exhibited higher delta power values than cry1 2 immediately after the onset of NREMS Figure 2B The same genotypic differences in sleep were observed in constant dark DD conditions Figure 3 Mice lacking cry1 2 spent more time in NREMS 719 29 vs 629 29 min P 0 053 unpaired t test NREMS bouts were longer 3 8 0 3 vs 2 6 0 1 min P 0 001 unpaired t test and EEG delta power in NREMS was higher in cry1 2 compared to cry1 2 controls 594 21 vs 448 52 V 2 0 1 Hz P 0 04 unpaired t test Figure 3 The decrease in sleep time prior to the onset of the dark period Figure 1 was still present in DD in cry1 2 mice sleep time decreased in the latter half of the subjective day and minimum average sleep time was reached immediately after the onset of the subjective night Figure 3 The anticipatory decrease in sleep time that occurred prior to the onset of dark in cry1 2 mice in LD did not occur under DD conditions Figure 3 Under DD conditions less REMS was present in cry1 2 mice than in cry1 2 mice 119 7 vs 149 9 min P 0 03 unpaired t test due to an increase in REMS in cry1 2 mice in DD 149 9 min relative to LD 113 10 min P 0 03 paired t test To further investigate the homeostatic regulation of sleep in cry1 2 mice we assayed the compensatory response to a 6 h SD see Figure 1 After SD wild type mice displayed the typical increase in REMS and NREMS time NREMS bout duration and EEG delta power above baseline levels 10 13 Table 2 Figure 1 In contrast cry1 2 mice did not exhibit significant increases in REMS NREMS time or NREMS bout duration after SD only a brief increase in NREMS delta power was observed lasting 1 h in cry1 2 vs 5 h in wild type mice Figure 1 The initial increase in delta power relative to baseline measured over the first recovery hour was significantly smaller in cry1 2 than the increase observed in wild type mice Table 2 Delta power Figure 1 Table 2 and NREMS bout duration Tables 1 2 in cry1 2 mice is maintained at a level only attained by the wild type mice when their sleep pressure was highest i e at the end of the active or dark period and after SD In wild type mice EEG delta power still varied as a function of the sleep wake history with high values at the end of the baseline dark period and after the SD and low values at the end of the light or major rest period Figure 1 Presumably due to the altered sleep wake distribution the daily range of EEG delta power values was smaller in cry1 2 mice than in wild type mice Table 1 Figure 1 We tested the assumption of a relationship between delta power and the sleep wake history by using a mathematical method that predicts the level of EEG delta power occurring in individual NREMS bouts based on the 42 h sequence of 10 sec behavioral state scores for individual animals 10 With this analytical tool the time constants of the increasing delta power during wakefulness and its decrease during NREMS are estimated For both genotypes delta power in both baseline and recovery from SD could be reliably predicted on the basis of sleep wake history Figure 1 which is underscored by the highly significant correlations between empirical and simulated data r 0 91 and 0 87 for cry1 2 and cry1 2 respectively P 0 0001 for both genotypes Thus in the absence of cryptochromes NREMS delta power varied as a function of the prior sleep wake history However in cry1 2 mice a significantly shorter time constant for the increase i e a faster build up of delta power was obtained increase 5 0 0 3 h in cry1 2 vs 3 5 0 5 h in cry1 2 P 0 05 unpaired t test whereas the time constant describing the decline of delta power during NREMS did not differ decrease 1 7 0 2 h in cry1 2 vs 1 8 0 3 h in cry1 2 Circadian gene expression in the brain of cry1 2 mice Deletion of the cryptochromes disinhibits the transcriptional activation of CLOCK BMAL1 and NPAS2 BMAL1 target genes resulting in increased levels of their transcripts in the SCN liver and retina 20 23 25 We assayed the expression in the brain of three genes that are known targets of cryptochrome mediated transcriptional inhibition albumin D binding protein dbp 26 period per 1 and per2 20 23 27 in the middle of the daily light period Confirming the earlier studies in other tissues mRNA levels for all three genes were higher in the brains of cry1 2 mice compared to wild type mice Figure 4 This relative increase was highly significant for all three genes dbp per1 3 3 fold per2 5 6 fold P 0 0003 unpaired t tests n 5 genotype Sleep deprivation induced differences in circadian gene expression Messenger RNA levels for per1 2 cry1 2 and dbp were quantified by RT PCR in three brain areas cerebral cortex basal forebrain and hypothalamus from C57BL 6 mice that were sacrificed immediately after 6 h of SD or after 4 h of recovery sleep ZT10 Significant differences in expression were observed only in the cortex Figure 5A and not in hypothalamus or basal forebrain data not shown Both per1 and per2 mRNA levels were higher immediately after SD compared to controls cry1 2 expression did not change and dbp mRNA decreased significantly Figure 5A After 4 h of recovery sleep per1 2 and dbp expression returned to the normal levels for that time of day ZT10 Figure 5A We also measured the expression of five other circadian genes bmal1 clock npas2 per3 and casein kinase 1 csnk1e in the cortex the levels of these five mRNAs were not affected by SD data not shown As confirmation of our results in the mouse we determined the expression of per2 and per1 in the rat by RT PCR and Northern analysis respectively In a similar experimental paradigm rats were sleep deprived for 6 h and then either sacrificed immediately after the SD ZT6 or after 2 h of recovery sleep ZT8 n 5 group The cortex specific increase in per2 mRNA was confirmed by the RT PCR analysis and as in the mouse per2 expression returned to basal levels after a period of recovery sleep data not shown Northern analysis confirmed that recovery sleep was associated with a decline in per1 mRNA relative to the level of expression reached at the end of the SD Figure 5B Discussion Upon release into constant darkness cry1 2 mice immediately become arrhythmic at the behavioral level 22 23 at the level of SCN electrophysiology 28 and at the cellular molecular level 23 Of the available mouse models for circadian dysfunction only per1 2 double mutant mice 29 bmal1 knockout mice 30 and mice with an ablation of the SCN 31 show a similarly dramatic phenotype Thus cry1 2 mice appear to be a suitable model for studies of the regulation of sleep in the absence of an intact circadian clock Under light dark LD conditions running wheel activity patterns and as we show here the distribution of sleep in cry1 2 mice still exhibit diurnal variation LD cycles can influence the expression of sleep by entraining the circadian pacemaker that drives the diurnal rhythm of sleep and or by directly affecting the expression of sleep thereby masking the influence of the pacemaker on sleep Masking seems to be the mechanism by which light drives these rhythms under LD conditions in cry1 2 mice 22 since the daily modulation of NREMS that occurs in cry1 2 mice under a light dark cycle immediately disappears upon placement in constant darkness 22 Figure 3 At the molecular level per2 expression but not that of per1 is rhythmic in the SCN of cry1 2 mice under LD conditions Upon release into constant dark conditions per2 rhythmicity disappears concomitant with the immediate loss of behavioral rhythmicity suggesting a role for light driven per2 expression in generating behavioral rhythms 23 The most striking and unexpected finding of the current study is that under baseline conditions cry1 2 mice exhibit all the hallmarks of high NREMS pressure including more consolidated NREMS increased NREMS time and higher levels of EEG delta power relative to wild type mice that were attained immediately after NREMS onset The failure of cry1 2 mice to exhibit a robust increase in any of these measures after 6 h SD is consistent with the interpretation that these mice are already under high NREMS pressure during baseline conditions Determination of the time constants that most accurately describe the dynamics of NREMS delta power revealed that during wake the propensity for high NREMS delta power increases during wake in cry1 2 mice at a faster rate than in wild type mice This could help explain why NREMS delta power is chronically high in cry1 2 mice The coincidence of high NREMS time and chronically high delta power in cry1 2 mice is all the more striking when one considers that during NREMS the drive for NREMS should dissipate and result in lower delta power 14 32 These findings in cry1 2 mice contrast with the findings of sleep studies in animals that are rendered arrhythmic by lesioning of the SCN In nocturnal rodents lesioning the SCN results in more fragmented sleep with lower EEG delta power but leaving the daily sleep time unchanged 6 7 8 31 Lesioning the SCN in a diurnal primate the squirrel monkey did result in an increase in NREMS time but sleep was more fragmented with a higher proportion of light NREMS 5 i e with lower overall levels of EEG delta power Furthermore the homeostatic response to sleep deprivation does not seem to be altered in SCN lesioned rodents 6 7 8 Thus the sleep characteristics of cry1 2 mice do not support the concept of cry1 2 mice as simply a genetic model for ablation of the circadian clock in the SCN Together these unexpected results are compatible with a role for cryptochromes in the homeostatic regulation of sleep in addition to their role in generating circadian rhythms Recent observations including the current report suggest a complex interrelationship between homeostatic and circadian influences on sleep at the molecular level Deletion of the cycle gene in Drosophila produces flies that have an exaggerated homeostatic response to rest deprivation in addition to their lack of circadian rhythmicity 16 In a striking parallel to our current results flies with a mutation in the cryptochrome gene also exhibit increased rest time as well as a reduced compensatory response to rest deprivation P Shaw personal communication The clock mutation in mice which has a profound effect on circadian rhythmicity 33 decreases NREMS time and consolidation under baseline conditions 34 The clock sleep phenotype is the inverse of the sleep characteristics we report here for the cry1 2 mice and is thus consistent with CLOCK and CRY1 2 being positive and negative transcriptional regulators respectively Albumin D binding protein Dbp is a transcription factor whose expression is under the direct transcriptional control of CLOCK BMAL1 26 Deletion of the dbp gene which results in a shortening of the circadian period 35 also results in decreased sleep consolidation and NREMS delta power 36 We assume that the effects on sleep we observed in cry1 2 mice are a result of a lack of cryptochrome dependent inhibition of the transcriptional activation provided by the bHLH PAS heterodimers CLOCK BMAL1 and NPAS2 BMAL1 19 20 37 although cryptochromes also play a role in stabilizing and nuclear sequestration of PER proteins 38 and in photoreception 39 Lack of cryptochromes results in increased mRNA levels of CLOCK NPAS2 BMAL1 target genes including the circadian genes per1 and per2 20 23 The expression of these two genes is viewed as a state variable of the molecular circadian clock or a marker of CLOCK NPAS2 BMAL1 induced transcription although at least per1 transcription can also be rapidly induced by light 40 41 through a CREB dependent signaling pathway 42 43 44 The observation of high brain levels of per1 2 transcripts under baseline conditions in cry1 2 mice raises the possibility that these or other CLOCK NPAS2 BMAL1 target genes are involved in the homeostatic regulation of sleep The observation of elevated per gene expression in the cortex of sleep deprived rats and mice Figure 5 supports this hypothesis The increase in per expression after the sleep deprivation was specific to the cerebral cortex although it cannot be ruled out based on the present study that circadian gene expression changes with sleep wake history in specific nuclei within the other two regions examined i e the hypothalamus and basal forebrain A surprisingly small number 0 5 of the 10 000 genes screened by mRNA differential display and cDNA microarrays in the cortex to date change their expression with sleep deprivation 45 It is intriguing and encouraging that of the initial genes we assayed three changed their expression with sleep deprivation per1 per2 dbp none of which were identified in the aforementioned screens cry1 2 expression at the mRNA level did not change with sleep deprivation in wild type mice This observation does not necessarily obviate a direct role for CRY proteins in mediating a response to sleep deprivation CRY poteins may play a role at steady state levels or there may be post translational changes in the functioning of CRY proteins in association with sleep deprivation such as phosphorylation state ubiquitination 38 or intracellular localization 46 of the protein all of which are regulated dynamically at least in vitro In the liver CRY protein oscillations are not necessary for circadian oscillations of target transcripts as CRY proteins are present in excess of PER and oscillations in the latter produce rhythmicity 46 A similar situation might exist in the cortex The high per levels in cry1 2 mice and the low per levels in clock mutant mice 26 47 correlate with their contrasting sleep phenotype see above 34 In this context the sleep abnormalities in dbp mice might also be related to a reduction in per expression since at least in vitro DBP can amplify the CLOCK BMAL1 induced transcription of per 48 but it is not known whether per transcript levels are altered in dbp mice Apart from the present observations in sleep deprived rats and mice several other reports confirm that cortical levels of per expression in wild type animals are high at times when sleep drive is high irrespective of the phase at which the circadian expression of per peaks in the SCN Thus in both nocturnal and diurnal species per expression in the cortex is maximal in conjunction with the major waking episode 37 49 50 Under conditions where the phase methamphetamine administration restricted feeding or distribution circadian splitting of locomotor activity is altered per expression in the cortex parallels the overt rhythm of wakefulness whereas the circadian oscillation of per gene expression in the SCN remains unaffected 49 51 52 Thus in contrast to its role in the SCN PER protein in the cortex is not a component of a self sustaining circadian oscillator 53 Instead per expression in the cortex seems to the follow sleep wake history consistent with the hypothesis that it is related to homeostatic regulation of sleep However in the current study and those cited above the expression of per genes was studied at the mRNA level PER protein level may be affected differentially from that of per mRNA and levels of the PER protein are reduced in cry1 2 mice due to reduced stability of PER proteins in the absence of heterodimerizing CRY partners 19 38 46 Conclusions In the discussion we have focused on per1 2 mRNAs as transcriptional targets of cry1 2 because the expression patterns of these circadian genes have been widely described and because their transcriptional control by CRY proteins and by CLOCK NPAS2 BMAL1 has been well established At least 90 genes are regulated in a similar fashion by NPAS2 BMAL1 37 and the identity of the target genes critical for the NREMS phenotype in cry1 2 mice remains to be determined In the absence of cry1 2 the stability and overall level of PER proteins particularly in the nucleus of the cell is reduced 19 38 46 It would therefore be interesting to observe sleep in per1 2 single and double mutant mice the latter of which have been subjected to behavioral observation 29 but not to sleep EEG studies per1 single knockout mice and mice expressing a non functional PER2 protein both exhibit subtle differences from wild type in the homeostatic rebound after SD 54 an observation compatible with the hypothesis that these genes are correlates of sleep homeostasis In addition measurement of the effects of sleep deprivation on the expression of cry1 2 and per1 2 genes at the protein level will provide critical information Finally from a functional perspective it is interesting that CLOCK NPAS2 BMAL1 transcriptional activity is sensitive to redox state 24 This transcriptional activity might thus provide a link between neuronal activity and an energy regulatory function for NREMS as has been suggested previously 55 Methods Sleep studies Mice were generated by mating cry1 and cry2 single knockout mice both of mixed background ca 3 4 C57BL 6 1 4 129 Sv 23 to generate double heterozygotes that were interbred to generate double knockouts cry1 2 and wild type controls cry1 2 Eight wild type and 6 cry1 2 male mice were surgically prepared for EEG and electromyographic EMG recordings as described previously 56 Following two weeks of post surgical recovery mice were isolated for recordings in sound attenuated chambers The experiments were conducted under an LD12 12 cycle lights on i e Zeitgeber Time ZT0 at 0600 h Twenty four hour baseline recordings starting at ZT0 were followed by a 6 h sleep deprivation SD starting at ZT0 The sleep deprivations in this experiment and the other two experiments see below were performed by the introduction of novel objects into the cage or by gentle handling In addition to the SD experiment animals were subjected to one day of baseline recording in constant darkness separated from the SD experiment by 72 hours All experimental procedures complied with institutional and NIH guidelines Digitized EEG and integrated EMG were stored in 10 s epochs and classified as NREMS REM sleep REMS or wakefulness by visual inspection The EEG was subjected to a Fast Fourier Transformation yielding power spectra between 0 20 Hz Delta power was calculated as the average EEG power in the delta 1 4 Hz frequencies for epochs scored as NREMS For visual representation hourly delta power values Figure 1 were expressed relative to an individual mean i e 24 h baseline mean before transforming back to absolute values to capture both the highly reproducible individual time course of delta power and the genotype differences in absolute values 10 Statistical evaluation of genotype differences were based however on the absolute EEG values Post SD delta power was compared to baseline during the first hour of spontaneous sleep subsequent to SD while NREMS amount and bout duration Table 2 were compared over 12 hours ZT6 ZT18 in accordance with the distinct dynamics of the compensatory responses of these variables to SD 57 NREMS bouts were defined as periods of NREMS initiated by three consecutive 10 second epochs of NREMS and terminated by three consecutive epochs not classified as NREMS EEG delta power changes at transitions between wakefulness and NREMS were measured during those transitions characterized by at least 12 consecutive 10 s epochs of wake followed by at least 18 consecutive 10 epochs of NREMS A mathematical algorithm was used to quantify the sleep wake dependent dynamics of delta power during both baseline and recovery from SD 10 In this algorithm delta power decreases during NREMS and increases during wakefulness according to saturating exponential functions the time constants of which are estimated by minimizing the square of the differences between empirical delta power data and the values produced by the mathematical functions The two time constants for the increase and decrease of delta power that resulted in the smallest deviation from empirical values within each individual were used to statistically assess genotype effect on the dynamics of delta power 10 Northern analysis Five cry1 2 mice and 5 wild type controls were sacrificed in the middle of the light period ZT6 Brains were rapidly removed and frozen on dry ice Total RNA was extracted and Northern analysis was performed with 10 g whole brain total RNA as previously described 58 Ten Wistar rats were sleep deprived for 6 h beginning at light onset ZT0 Five rats were sacrificed at ZT6 at the end of the SD and five were allowed to recover for 2 h following the SD and were sacrificed at ZT8 Rats were monitored by EEG EMG throughout this period as described 59 Brains were rapidly removed dissected and frozen and Northern analysis performed Quantitative real time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction RT PCR analyses Four experimental groups of male C57BL 6J mice were studied 1 sleep deprived from light onset ZT0 to ZT6 2 control mice for the SD group 3 6 h SD ZT0 ZT6 followed by 4 h recovery sleep ZT6 ZT10 and 4 control mice for the recovery group n 7 mice group Animals were sacrificed by decapitation Brains were rapidly removed and the cerebral cortex basal forebrain and hypothalamus were dissected After a mid sagittal cut the entire cortical tissue was peeled off and separated from the hippocampus and underlying diencephalon Striatal tissue was also removed From each animal quantitative real time PCR determinations of 5 target genes cry1 2 per1 2 and dbp and a reference cDNA glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase g3pdh were made from the cortex basal forebrain and hypothalamus primer probe sequences available upon request For five other targets bmal1 clock npas2 per3 and csnk1e expression was quantified in the cortex only To confirm the specificity of the nucleotide sequences chosen for the primers and probes and the absence of DNA polymorphisms BLASTN searches were conducted against the dbEST and nonredundant set of Genbank EMBL and DDBJ databases Dual color fluorescence was detected using an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System Perkin Elmer Corp Foster City CA For each experimental sample the amount of the target and g3pdh reference was determined from the standard curve range of 0 2 200 ng total RNA measured in the same assay A normalized value was obtained by dividing the target cDNA amount by the g3pdh reference For details see 59
