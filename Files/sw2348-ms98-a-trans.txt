        hi Ellen   hi   um do you uh could you tell me if you uh budget your monthly expenses   no we dont really do anything formal um i kind of keep up with all the finances you know paying the bills and typically i do most of the spending too as well so uh you know i kind of have a handle on it and       i just sort of know what we can and cant do and it you know its worked pretty well i havent really gotten into any major problems without having something formal   yeah how about how about uh long term do you have anything uh for as far as as far as savings go for long term   well yeah yeah we have uh you know like a typical credit union account for you know just a a basic savings thing and then uh weve got you know the IRAs and CDs and various and sundry you know long term kinds of things   uh yeah   how about you   okay thats uh uh we used to budget when the children were small um things were and there was only one income so we had to watch what we were doing   umhum   and our savings werent that great but now the kids are all grown up and gone in fact the youngest is is uh finally getting out of college this uh May   uh   so weve we dont budget anymore we run basically the same as you do you kind of know what youre going to spend uh week to week or or you have your monthly bills at a fixed   right   um as far as electricity and telephone um we do the same thing we budget not budget but um i have a long term savings goal   umhum   for retirement you know   right   they take out for CODA and then uh um the IRAs and then uh i also take out for um a savings account but its its uh   um its not really savings its savings if we dont spend it   well i know yeah   its like a floating you know if something if something comes up   yeah or if you want to take a trip or something that you you plan it but thats where you get the money is   yes right yeah   yeah thats thats the way we work it   it it it doesnt come out um it doesnt come out of long term savings like we were we were um saving savings bonds too for oh years and years and years and now im getting up towards retirement age so we stopped stopped the the savings bonds and were going maxed out on CODA and then you know other things like you know CDs   uhhuh uhhuh   um but this other its in the credit union and they and they take it out and it goes in there and at the end of the month but if we want to go on a trip or if something looks good or if we want to go away for a weekend   yeah   thats what we hit   yeah   or if we go out for dinner say to a nice restaurant um thatll come out of that   uhhuh   rather than put it on a credit card   oh thats sort of the way we you know do it or at least certainly for some of those bigger things or maybe one of the appliances breaks down you know and we have to go get something new then weve got that little cushion in there that   right   you know will either cover it or partially so you know depending on what it is   yeah so it you dont have to really dig into long term or or you know well you cant cash in a CD thats kind of ridiculous um   yeah no i never go like to go into those things that are       like you say long term that have penalties and all sorts of other things they   yeah   uh  i i sort of feel like if you leave it there and you dont use it and you sort of dont see it then its its safe in a sense   right the only time you know about it is when it comes due and theyll say you know well youve got to reinvest it back in this or that or whatever   yeah   but yeah its its its kind of forced on you because you suffer a penalty   yeah   so thats yeah thats one of the thats one of the ways that we do it you you also have uh CODA   yes   so   definitely i mean thats a good deal   thats yeah where else can you get that kind of interest to start with   i dont know   i mean thats fantastic   yeah   you know they match it um my wife used to they matched hers only hers was a little bit better than ours um she hasnt been working for a couple of years her father took sick so shes been taking care of him   uhhuh   but that added up too i mean when when she left and the pay out came in you know if we just rolled that over and it just sits there and gathers   yeah   steam or momentum and you dont realize it you know it just piles up   yeah thats a good deal well when you did keep a a budget all the time how strictly did you do that i mean was it real precise or   um yeah we we took out actually my wife shes the one that ran the budget you know i just brought it home and she had to stretch it out wherever it was going to go but she would allocate so much at at at that time when the kids were growing up  so much went for groceries   umhum     so much went for the mortgage because we knew you know that was kind of fixed and electricity you could come pretty close and telephone you could come pretty close uh the oil   yeah   we heated with oil   uhhuh   we they put us on a budget they would run like uh  they could really tell how much oil you were going to use   uhhuh   so they budgeted it at year round so in the summer time which you didnt use very little oil you were still paying the same thing as in the winter time when youre using a lot but they kind of spread the payments out   yeah   and we stuck to that pretty much so uh groceries fluctuated um we didnt go out to eat that often but as times went on the children got older you know and naturally salaries increased um we kind of fell away from it   yeah   it it became a chore   well it is to a certain extent to have to try to keep up with all that   yeah i talked to to uh   other people and they used to have envelopes they used to stuff so much in you know so much for this so much for that so much for we never really we never really did that   yeah   we just allocated so much and it went into a checking account   yeah   and at the end of the month hopefully everything came out pretty close so we just kept certain things out for like i said for groceries um but even at that point you know shed say oh you know we we need this or the budgets not doing this or that uh course me i didnt run it like she ran it like you run it now   well   and its pretty much the same she still does the same thing everythings fixed   yeah   you know like CODA comes out of your out of your pay and the credit union comes out of your pay so we dont have to do anything there and the rest of it as far as my salary goes i just have it automatically deposited in into our bank   yeah i do that too   so we dont really see anything if if i need something ill go and you know use the teller machine or if she needs something shell go and shell use the teller machine so we dont really um have a lot of cash anymore   yeah   yeah i i walk around sometimes and ive got if ive got five dollars in my pocket thats thats a lot its     yeah i used to take money out for gas and groceries and things like that and i dont even do that anymore i mean i just dont have that much cash on me   yeah for your automobile   umhum right   you mean gas  yeah and now i dont know about down there but up here they got the pumps you just put your because i always put my gas on a credit card and i pay it at the end of the month   yeah   so you just stick your credit card in there and then it pumps whatever it pumps and it adds it all up and it gives you a ticket and off you go   yeah   so you dont even have to go in to see the teller anymore   works pretty good then   yeah yeah its not bad so you dont need you dont need money for gasoline you dont need money you know incidentals uh for coffee when i come into work in the morning and things like that but other than that um it looks like were probably going towards a cashless society   yeah to some extent i guess so   because if youre doing that you know and im sure it must be prevalent in your area down in Dallas um and were doing it most most of the people up here that work have already have their their checks uh electronically sent to their banks or the credit union if they belong to the credit union   yeah   so they dont deal much in cash anymore either   well if we   so it looks like were both running about the same   yeah   um maybe younger people are different im not sure   yeah they probably dont have enough to  thats right   uh they dont have spendable income right yeah the poor poor things i know like you know i look at mine and hes getting out of school and im saying geez you know im glad im not starting out now because things are kind of tough up here for as far as uh employment goes   yeah we were having some problems here too   still because you guys ran into it a while back   yeah theyre still laying off like over in Fort Worth and a lot of other companies too just here and there   uh oh yeah its not just yeah its not just TI they theyre doing the same thing up here and not just uh in yesterdays newspaper they said um IBMs going through theyre going to lay off like fourteen thousand world wide   well yeah that really is scary     So its still there unfortunately um
