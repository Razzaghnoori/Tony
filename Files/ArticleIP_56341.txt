token visit by a representative of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE to the embattled republic will do nothing to halt the gut wrenching mayhem in Chechnya where there remains no prospect of a ceasefire or even of a de escalation Noting that 66 percent of Russians support the war waged by hawkish Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin the paper warned there are real signs Russia is breaking away from the fickle embrace of western economic and political neo liberalism Men like Mr Putin harnessing nationalism fear and prejudice seem to promise a stronger prouder better future the Guardian added It is the Chechens who are presently paying with their blood for this illusion But if the trend intensifies post Yeltsin we may all pay for it The Independent of

expulsion from the OSCE if it doesn t pull back from Chechnya In Italy however La Repubblica of Rome reported Russia s acceptance of an OSCE representative under the headline Moscow yields on Chechnya In Moscow itself the daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta said the Kremlin would only start peace talks after the military campaign has reached its logical conclusion but that the country will be at a loss about whom to conduct them with having branded the republic s present leaders as bandits and terrorists Leaving Belfast after presiding over 11 week negotiations to rescue the historic Northern Ireland

ambassador s living room We shared meals together I insisted that there not be any discussion of issues at the meals that we just talk about other things so that they could come to view each other not
