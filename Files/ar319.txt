 Introduction Systemic lupus erythematosus SLE MIM 152700 1 is an autoimmune disease characterized by the production of autoantibodies with specificity for a wide range of self antigens These antibodies cause disease directly by binding to target tissues e g platelets and phospholipids and indirectly by depositing immune complexes in vascular tissues leading to organ damage 2 The current evidence suggests that SLE is a complex genetic disease with contributions from both environmental e g ultraviolet light viral infections and genetic factors A number of recent genome wide screens support the genetic hypothesis in human SLE and have reported in aggregate 48 potential susceptibility loci 3 4 5 6 7 reviewed 8 Of these intervals significant attention has been directed at the 1q41 42 chromosomal region After the identification of the syntenic region in mouse Sle1 as a susceptibility interval for murine SLE 9 a targeted study by Tsao et al 10 was the first to implicate this locus in human SLE marker D1S229 P 0 005 Subsequently two independent SLE genome scans also found suggestive evidence for linkage at 1q41 42 3 4 5 Poly ADP ribosyl polymerase PARP also referred to as ADPRT adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase was initially suggested as the relevant candidate gene in the region 11 12 but that finding was not reproduced in other family collections 13 The work of Moser et al 14 provided the initial evidence that the susceptibility locus in this region might lie centromeric of PARP In 127 multiplex SLE pedigrees the best evidence for linkage was at D1S229 with the greatest extent of allele sharing in the white families at the D1S2616 marker The data reported here confirm the evidence for genetic linkage at 1q41 in 210 SLE sibpair families families with a pair of affected sibs from the Minnesota collection 3 4 Furthermore we report new evidence for transmission disequilibrium of both single marker alleles and short marker haplotypes from the 1q41 42 interval in 122 trio families families with a single affected offspring and both parents and in the total dataset of 332 SLE families These data suggest that a human SLE susceptibility locus is located centromeric to PARP near the D1S490 marker Materials and methods SLE family collection The collection of 187 affected sibpair families in Cohorts 1 and 2 of the Minnesota collection have been described in detail elsewhere 3 4 An additional group of 24 sibpair families was collected and members were genotyped for the 11 markers in the 1q41 42 region One hundred and twenty two trio families were also collected This study was approved by the Human Subjects Review Board at the Mayo Clinic and at the University of Minnesota The clinical features of the sibpair and trio families are provided in the Supplementary material Samples and genotyping Genomic DNA isolation and genotyping of families was performed as described 3 4 The 12 markers from the 1q41 42 region originally typed by Moser et al 14 were typed in the Minnesota collection Marker order Fig 1 was determined using the public databases described in the Supplementary material Data analysis See Supplementary material for details of linkage analysis and transmission disequilibrium testing Results Genetic linkage in the 1q41 42 region In the combined data from the original Cohorts 1 and 2 genome screens the highest LOD score in the 1q41 42 region was 1 33 at marker D1S229 4 With the addition of five new fine map markers and 24 new families the best evidence for linkage was slightly reduced LOD 1 23 and shifted telomeric to marker D1S2616 Fig 2 This level of linkage support corresponds roughly to a nominal P value of 0 05 When only white families were considered the peak multipoint LOD score remained at marker D1S2616 LOD 0 99 Fig 2 Transmission disequilibrium in the 1q41 42 region The standard transmission disequilibrium test TDT 15 applied to the data for a single marker allele failed to identify significant transmission disequilibrium Fig 3 Analyses with the C TDT the TDT combined with the discordant sib TDT S TDT which allows additional families containing discordant sibs to be evaluated for disequilibrium 16 were then performed Among the 60 families with discordant siblings but missing parental information several microsatellite alleles in the 1q41 region demonstrated significant evidence of transmission disequilibrium Fig 3 Markers D1S490 allele 6 P 0 0044 D1S229 allele 7 P 0 0054 and D1S227 allele 5 P 0 0084 showed the strongest evidence for disequilibrium using the C TDT The TDT and C TDT are limited by the fact that only one triad or discordant sibship is analyzed from a given family thus these two tests examine only a subset of the data from general pedigrees The pedigree disequilibrium test PDT improves upon these two tests by generating a measure of linkage disequilibrium for every discordant sibship and triad in a pedigree 17 Because it examines the entire data set the PDT can result in much higher power than the other two tests 17 The version of the PDT used in this analysis has been modified to accept dyads a single typed parent and an affected offspring A dyad is informative only when the offspring has a heterozygous genotype different from that of the parent thus avoiding the bias of using inferred phase assignments 18 19 Using the PDT three single marker alleles of D1S490 exhibited evidence of transmission disequilibrium Fig 3 Consistent with the C TDT results D1S490 allele 6 yielded the strongest PDT result P 0 0071 Transmission disequilibrium of marker haplotypes in the 1q41 42 region Two and three marker haplotypes from the 1q41 42 region were next tested for evidence of transmission disequilibrium Fig 3 Haplotype clusters were generated for exact match haplotypes with more than 10 founders Analysis of two and three marker haplotypes revealed that haplotypes from D1S490 to D1S549 had the greatest number of transmissions and yielded the most significant P values with the majority of the significant haplotypes centered on D1S227 The two marker haplotypes D1S425 allele 10 D1S2827 allele 11 D1S490 allele 7 D1S227 allele 5 and D1S2616 allele 6 D1S549 allele 12 were significant in the TDT C TDT and PDT The D1S490 allele 7 D1S227 allele 5 and D1S2616 allele 6 D1S549 allele 12 haplotypes had 63 42 25 and 61 52 33 transmitted nontransmitted ratios T NT respectively Using three marker haplotypes the strongest evidence for disequilibrium was in the region spanning the markers D1S229 to D1S2641 Notably the D1S229 allele 7 D1S490 allele 7 D1S227 allele 5 T NT 23 6 79 T and the D1S2616 allele 6 D1S549 allele 12 D1S2641 allele 10 T NT 18 6 75 T haplotypes yielded biallelic PDT P values of 0 008 Global multiallelic disequilibrium statistic The PDT test also calculates a measure of the linkage disequilibrium for all the alleles of a given marker in the form of a global multiallelic P value Using this statistic the 11 markers of 1q32 42 fine map were tested for global transmission disequilibrium Fig 4 Importantly two markers in the 1q32 42 region reach the 0 05 level of significance in the data set from the 332 SLE families D1S425 results in a global P value of 0 034 which appeared to be largely driven by the contribution of families in the trio collection P 0 0056 D1S490 showed the most significant result using this test P 0 0091 with both the sibpair and trio collections contributing to the linkage disequilibrium observed Significant results for this global disequilibrium statistic were not observed for any other markers in the 1q41 42 region including ADPRT PARP Two and three marker haplotype analysis with the global PDT identified only one significant result The D1S425 D1S2827 window yielded a PDT global P value of 0 032 Discussion The localization of genes in complex genetic diseases is a challenging proposition given that these disorders are likely to show significant locus heterogeneity genetic epistasis and incomplete penetrance as well as environmental effects In SLE all the available evidence points to a similarly complex genetic etiology with six recent genetic linkage studies implicating as many as 48 genetic loci 3 4 5 6 7 20 While some of the loci identified are likely to be false positives or relatively minor genes enriched in one population or another the locus at 1q41 is unique in that it has provided a significant though modest linkage signal in three independent SLE populations 3 4 5 10 14 Fine mapping in the 1q41 region by Moser et al 14 also showed that the highest overall LOD score in 127 families of the Oklahoma collection was at D1S229 and the greatest degree of allele sharing in 78 white families was at D1S2616 D1S229 also showed the strongest evidence for linkage in the UCLA collection 10 and was the best marker in genome screens performed on the Minnesota family collection 3 4 Thus the evidence for linkage at 1q41 is reproducible in independent collections using the identical markers To detect association with SLE we used the transmission disequilibrium test TDT as well as two additional tests the C TDT and the PDT The PDT is the strongest test of association because of its ability to maximize the information extracted from complex pedigrees Importantly marker D1S490 in the 1q41 region was significant on the multiallelic PDT Fig 4 Supporting the global finding the C TDT and PDT tests also identified evidence for transmission disequilibrium with several alleles from D1S490 and nearby markers Fig 3 Marker D1S425 in the 1q32 region also demonstrated significant transmission disequilibrium particularly in the trio collection Fig 4 We sought to confirm and expand upon the results of the single marker tests by examining haplotypes from the 1q32 41 region for the presence of transmission disequilibrium Haplotype based association methods may be more powerful than single marker tests 21 22 23 For example the same microsatellite allele i e same size microsatellite repeat may be present on a number of haplotypes some of which may not be associated with disease Indeed haplotype based association methods employing a dense map of markers have been used to localize genetic effects to small segments of chromosomes 24 25 26 27 28 29 The knowledge of marker order and intermarker distances in the 1q41 region allowed the generation of haplotypes with unambiguously determined phase in our large collection of SLE families The D1S425 D1S2827 two marker haplotype window in the 1q32 region showed evidence for transmission disequilibrium via the global PDT while no other windows showed evidence of association using this multiallelic test However several individual two and three marker haplotypes from the 1q32 and 1q41 region showed significant transmission disequilibrium Fig 3 These haplotype results should be viewed with some caution since they are uncorrected for the multiple allele combinations tested and the possibility of Type I errors may be increased At present the most interesting candidate gene in the region showing the strongest evidence for disequilibrium is the estrogen related receptor gamma ESRRG This gene is found on the same contig as D1S490 NT_004817 and is an orphan receptor within the steroid hormone receptor superfamily It is expressed in lymphocytes and other tissues and is an interesting candidate given the suspected role of sex hormones in the pathophysiology of both mouse and human lupus 30 31 Other genes in the region include those for the cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide near D1S2616 an innate microbial defense peptide expressed by the skin during inflammation MARK near D1S2641 a serine threonine protein kinase and at least three uncharacterized genes The data reported here provide some additional perspective on the initial reports that PARP might be the relevant gene in this locus The finding of significant transmission distortion of marker alleles centromeric to PARP in the Minnesota collection suggests the possibility that the disequilibrium initially reported for PARP alleles may be due to more extensive disequilibrium to include the PARP marker in the families studied by Tsao and her colleagues compared with other populations and groups of families studied A dense mapping of this interval by all the various groups and a pooling of data would help to resolve this question It seems likely that as in the HLA region 32 there will be a limited number of ancestral haplotypes in the 1q41 region and that these ancestral haplotypes will be identifiable by typing a dense map of microsatellites This should facilitate the identification of the responsible gene s in the region Conclusions The data reported here confirm the evidence for genetic linkage at 1q41 in 210 SLE sibpair families from the Minnesota collection Furthermore we report new evidence for transmission disequilibrium of both single marker alleles and short marker haplotypes from the 1q41 42 interval in 122 trio families and in the total dataset of 332 SLE families These data suggest that a human SLE susceptibility locus is located

methods Establishing marker order in the 1q41 42 region The 12 markers from the 1q41 42 region originally typed by Moser et al S1 were typed in the Minnesota collection see Fig 1in the main text of this article Genetic maps for the region were obtained from the Marshfield Clinic Marshfield WI USA http research marshfield clinic org genetics and the Genome Database http www gdb org Since genetic maps have limited resolution in the case of closely linked markers the available human genomic sequence from the region was analyzed to more accurately assess marker order and intermarker distances The Human Genome Project Working Draft database based on October 7 2000 freeze at the University of California Santa Cruz http genome ucsc edu was the primary source used to establish marker order Three markers D1S425 D1S229 and D1S213 could not be located in this database The UniSTS database http www ncbi nlm nih gov genome sts epcr cgi located D1S425 on contig NT_004656 According to Mapviewer

sizing was performed using GENESCAN software v 2 1 ABI Foster CA USA followed by allele calling with GENOTYPER software v 2 5 ABI Data verification Each genotype was reviewed manually by two members of the team to confirm the accuracy of allele calling The genotype data from the 11 microsatellites used in the study were analyzed using PEDCHECK and RELATIVE to identify errors in Mendelian inheritance and to confirm familial relationships S2 S3 Additionally the maximum likelihood haplotypes for each pedigree generated by GENEHUNTER PLUS S4 a modified version of GENE HUNTER S5 were examined to identify multiple recombinants Double recombinants were generally found to be genotyping errors and were corrected Linkage analysis Multipoint nonparametric linkage analysis was performed using GENEHUNTER PLUS S4 We report the results based on the Sall scoring function which emphasizes sharing the same allele identical by descent IBD among all affected family members S6 The reported logarithm of odds ratio LOD score is calculated as LOD Zlr2 2ln10 In some instances families of different ethnic groups were extracted from the master linkage file and analyzed separately Allele frequencies used in the parameter files for each analysis were generated from the founder genotypes for the analyzed set of data sibpair families trio families all families combined and individual ethnic groups Transmission disequilibrium testing The alleles from the 11 marker fine map were examined for the presence of transmission disequilibrium using the transmission disequilibrium test TDT S7 and the discordant sibling TDT S TDT test S8 Analysis was conducted using the combined TDT S TDT program version 1 1 set to accept one missing parent per trio S8 This program outputs separate results for the TDT S TDT and the combined TDT S TDT referred to herein as C TDT In families with multiple affected individuals only a single affected patient the index case was used for the TDT and C TDT analyses Two and three marker haplotypes from the 1q32 41 region were tested for the presence of transmission disequilibrium Maximum likelihood haplotypes were generated using GENEHUNTER PLUS for the 274 families with at least one typed parent Markers where phase could not be definitively determined were identified and labeled as missing data for the haplotype analysis Founder haplotypes were then used to create two and three contiguous marker exact match clusters using a moving window approach as described by Nair et al S9 In order to prevent rare haplotypes from dominating the statistical tests and to better approximate the distributional assumptions of these tests only those haplotypes with at least 10 founders were clustered Haplotypes represented in fewer than 10 founders were pooled together Every two or three marker window was examined by moving the window across the 1q32 42 region one marker at a time from centromere to telomere The resulting haplotype data were examined using the TDT and C TDT with each haplotype considered as a single marker Additional information from the sibpair and multiplex families was extracted using the pedigree disequilibrium test PDT S10 The original form of the PDT incorporates information from every possible triad and discordant sibship in a given family to yield an average measure of disequilibrium for the entire pedigree In addition we analyzed dyads one parent and an affected offspring when the offspring had a heterozygous genotype different from that of the parent S11 S12 The PDT was used to examine the single marker and the two and three marker haplotype data Linkage analysis in families carrying risk haplotypes GENEHUNTER PLUS creates maximum likelihood haplotypes when conducting multipoint linkage analysis The GENEHUNTER PLUS haplotype output was used to identify families with founders carrying the seven three marker haplotypes in the 1q41 region D1S229 D1S2641 that had a TDT transmission nontransmission ratio of at least 2 1 66 transmission rate Multipoint linkage analysis was conducted on the risk and nonrisk subsets as described above Supplementary results Clinical features of systemic lupus erythematosus SLE in sibpair and trio families The composition of the sibpair families studied in this report is summarized in Supplementary Table 1 see below Twenty four additional families were included beyond the families that comprised the original Minnesota Cohorts 1 and 2 S13 S14 In addition a collection of 122 trio families one SLE patient with both parents was assembled Demographics and selected clinical characteristics of the affected individuals within the sibpair and trio collections are presented in Supplementary Table 2 The trio collection was highly enriched for white families 96 compared with 77 in the sibpair families Compared with patients from the sibpair collection trio individuals were more likely to be positive for anti dsDNA antibody and to have evidence of hematologic or renal disease Lower percentages of trio patients had pleuritis skin involvement or CNS lupus The differences in the clinical manifestations observed may reflect the greater ethnic diversity within the sibpair collection as well as potential differences in familial compared with sporadic SLE Linkage analysis in families carrying risk haplotypes The evidence for linkage was examined in the subset of families that carried the risk haplotypes defined as those families carrying three marker haplotypes from D1S229 to D1S2641 that displayed at least a 2 1 transmission non transmission ratio see Fig 3in the main text of this article Families with the 1q41 risk haplotypes n 88 demonstrated a multipoint LOD score of 1 15 at D1S2616 while the remainder of the family collection n 23 showed a LOD score at D1S2616 of 0 30 Thus SLE families carrying the risk marker haplotypes with the strongest evidence for transmission disequilibrium were also the families that accounted for most of the evidence for linkage in the 1q41 region Localization of the 1q41 effect through haplotype analysis The two most significant three marker haplotypes identified in the moving window analysis were D1S229 allele 7 D1S490 allele 7 D1S227 allele 5 and D1S2616 allele 6 D1S549 allele 12 D1S2641 allele 10 Interestingly none of the 83 individuals who carried one of these two haplotypes contained both of these on a further extended haplotype Furthermore 33 of 55 patients with the 229 490 227 haplotype 60 also bore allele 6 of D1S2616 while 14 of 28 individuals with the 2616 549 2641 haplotype also bore allele 5 of D1S227 This suggests the possibility that the major effect in this region is between markers D1S227 and D1S2616 an interval of approximately 0 96 megabasepairs Alternatively there might be two effects in the region each carried on one of the haplotypes The two marker haplotype data provide some support for the former interpretation since the peak number of significant haplotype transmissions is found within the D1S227 D1S2616 interval with the number of events falling off at surrounding windows Although the current evidence for linkage disequilibrium at 1q41 extends over quite a broad interval it is important to note that the marker density in the current study is still rather sparse Efforts to further localize the gene in this region will require the identification and typing of additional microsatellite markers and single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs in a large cohort of SLE cases and controls
