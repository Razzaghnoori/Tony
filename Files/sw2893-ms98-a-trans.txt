          so   okay do you regularly exercise regularly   yeah i sure do   what do you do   uh i ride a bicycle quite a bit and uh work out with free weights   okay i love to ride a bicycle   i live right near White Rock Lake so i used to i try to ride about ten to twenty miles a day but i   oh thats good   havent been doing so well this year   i went an last year i went an was exercising on a bike for a while and i when id gotten back i had gotten some sun that day the sweat had built up on me and built up under my skin and caused me to peel it was the sweating not the burn   oh thats weird   that was wild but i exercise i dont exercise now i just had a baby three months ago i havent really gotten back into exercising but i exercised real good for a couple of years it was   oh yeah   aerobics and lifting weights three nights a week and it was running three nights a week   so whats your motivation   what was my motivation   yeah   a friend of mine always pushing me this was in Louisiana and she would push you know she was hey lets go do it and you know she wouldnt take no for an answer   was it for health or to look good   oh i just i just wanted to look good   i would think   yeah it werent really health related   it was just a side benefit   yeah yeah because im not um im not big or anything but im not in great shape so but when i worked out i got in pretty good shape i didnt build up muscle though i just got real good and toned   yeah   i dont think women look good with muscles   up to a point   up to a point no more yeah  its just some of those women that come up there looking like Arnold Schwarzeneggers sister just doesnt get it   yeah yeah so what was what was the other question lets see do you do it as a task or do you enjoy enjoy working out   i guess its a task because i cant make myself do it lately   yeah i think i uh i enjoy it sometimes and theres other times when i just get tired of it and   yeah   and i feel like im obligated to do it because ive been doing it so i should keep up   you dont want to lose yourself   and theres some days its just like its the hardest thing in the world to to get started   well how old are you   im uh twenty seven   okay so youre still young   yeah still young getting older   we all are so   yep but uh   yeah its not hard to stay well if you keep working out when youre young though when you get older you know your bodys not going to look as bad i seen an old woman today she was about eighty and she looked so good i mean she was standing just as straight and tall and she had a small waist and she didnt have you know like you know how some older women will get the big bulge right in the middle   yeah right   and she didnt have that at all she her lips were a little bit wide but a lot of back in her time they liked women with big hips anyway   right   so she may be keeping that on purpose so   yeah i notice if you uh if you stay in shape you dont age as bad   umhum   i think too i was i go to school too at night and last semester i had stopped working out because i hurt myself and started smoking a lot and you just those kind of things age you more   well smoking ages you quick it puts those little wrinkles around your lips   right and right and you cant and then you know it just kind of feeds itself you smoke and then you dont work out because you     you get winded   yeah right and so i   oh i smoke a pack a day and   i finally quit because like i just all i was doing was going down hill fast   oh and i cant quit smoking ive tried i was telling a friend of mine that be almost almost as bad as being an alcoholic cant quit smoking   yeah   ive tried i just cant do it i quit when i was pregnant with my kids but you know as soon as i had them right back to it   right back to them yeah   yeah it was like you know that was the only reason i quit i didnt want to and i dont want to quit smoking i enjoy that i said i have very few vices ill keep this one thank you  but uh   yeah yeah   did you ever go to like one of those health clubs or anything   i went to a health club a few years ago and now i work out at home because i dont really my schedule with school and work i dont have time to get down to one   uhhuh   there used to be one that was a twenty four hour that i used to go to but uh i actually prefer to work out alone   i like to work out with people i need like you i i need competition is what i need ive got to have somebody to compete with or i dont want to do anything   really yeah i wouldnt mind having you know working out with a friend and and stuff but when you get into some of these some of these health clubs where you just stand around and wait   umhum are you   you know i like to start get it done and get out of there   uhhuh are you married or anything no   no im not   well get your girlfriend to work out with you a lot of women like that id love it if my husband would ask me to work out with him he doesnt work out very often course he dont need to hes small and he works as a laborer on the railroad so you know hes building his muscles up all day he doesnt have to do anything he can eat like a horse too   yeah right   and he dont you know he dont gain it like i do but uh   uh especially having a kid i guess tends to just gain weight because you have to to   yeah yeah you have to well you can gain too much weight i gained a little bit too much but i looked   to uh   with my first little boy i did gain a lot of weight i got i got about fifty pounds overweight with him and i didnt loose it until two years ago and then i got pregnant and you know ruined that  so   set to start all over   yeah well actually like i say it aint as bad this time because i was in shape when i got pregnant   right   i wasnt out of shape i wasnt overweight with when i got pregnant with him i just wasnt in in shape i dont know the difference but   yeah some people are a little bit fanatical about it you know i   about weight   well yeah and about   exercise   working out and fitness you know i like to to work out to look good and stay in shape and you know i know its good for me but people that live for it and you know eat a bunch of different pills and   wel l thats what my friend did   all that kind of stuff it gets a little bit   well she was she was with the wheat germ and all the vitamins and everything else and really we was you know even with her taking all those expensive expensive vitamins and stuff   obsessive yeah   we stayed right on the same track with each other you know developing and everything now there you can take those uh what is it   yeah steroids   steroids yeah i couldnt think i was going i was trying to say hemorrhoids  no i was trying to say hem hormones yeah hormones but yeah uh steroids but i stay from that crap   yeah theres really bad for you hem hormones yeah its too dangerous   oh i wouldnt  i could just see hair start growing out of my upper lip or something           yeah i had a friend whose brother did steroids and as soon as he stopped working out he just ballooned out it all turned to fat and it just   really   really looked bad   ooh   but uh   i didnt know it did that   i dont know if it does to everybody he was it it just thats how it affected him and he i dont know just   yeah but ive been wanting to get me a bicycle or a bike ive been wanting to get a ten speed to ride around im scared to run for dogs course i know dogs can get you on a bike too but   yeah   seems like it   at least you got a chance to outrun them that way   yeah   i dont like to run myself ive thought about it several times and i just it i like to move a little faster and cover more ground   well they yeah theyve come up that  running is not as good for you as they thought it was   its probably i would think it would be hard on your your legs and your joints and stuff   yeah its real hard on your legs and its hard on women and it it just makes stuff move down and uh but i i i like jogging i dont mind that i can get out and do that as long as its not hot if its hot you cant do that   yeah uh i cant   but in the rain oh i love to run in the rain just you know be careful not to slide   yeah   but you cant ride your bike at all in the rain can you   no you cant   you slide   its dangerous at least maybe some of these mountain bikes you could but a regular ten speed with those skinny tires   uhhuh   you slide all over the place   yeah oh i when i did ride my friends bike that one time i had uh i dont know what i was trying to do i was trying to make a U turn and i never could make a U turn in a bike i can do it in my car but i tried to do it on that ten speed and wrecked and i told her a dog was chasing me  but i wrecked it into the curb i didnt hurt it too bad i scratched it on the the oh she had some kind of fender thing going over the back tire i think but oh well   yeah   anyway its been nice talking to you   yeah well   and uh   good luck with the the new kid   thank you  shes it shes good anyway have fun exercising all right byebye   all right bye bye
