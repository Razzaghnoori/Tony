 Quibbles and Corrections Dear Culturebox I m not sure why booksellers don t want the hard numbers but their instincts are dead right Soundscan has done nothing but harm to the creative end of rock roll not because it has made information available but because it has made information available too quickly to people who in turn overvalue the importance of information gotten too quickly Put another way Soundscan has killed off word of mouth It used to be that a critic could get behind an album or an influential DJ or a cohort of college kids and bingo an interesting album becomes a hit album Now it s wham bam An album isn t catching on in a week or two as measured by Soundscan and the plug gets pulled on promotion the CD gets pulled from racks etc Further the industry itself starts pushing albums that will open big albums with a catchy single and maybe little else and did somebody say synergy soundtrack albums Look at this week s Pop Top 20 for the results of Soundscan If you want a Lorrie Moore to sneak onto the bestseller list every once in a while you better hope Bookscan never catches on Gerry Marzorati Dear Gerry I think there s a risk of such short sighted thinking but I don t think it would prevail in the end There just wouldn t be enough blockbusters to keep the book market going as a blockbuster only concern If all publishers and booksellers pursued that strategy in the end some of them would be forced to re enter the quality books market just to get themselves back in the game I tend to think that s what s happening in Hollywood actually which is why the whole indie scene has become so hot In response to your Lorrie Moore point I d think Bookscan would have the opposite effect By allowing publishers target their marketing dollars more effectively Bookscan would help them sell the smaller books The publisher could pinpoint exactly where Lorrie Moore sells and dispatch her there on a book tour could test whether her books were responsive to advertising and what kind a test run on Moore might also work for Alice Munro and so on In short with real numbers publishers would be able to maximize the audience for a serious book Culturebox Dear Culturebox With the consumer trade book category exceeding 10 billion in 1997 in retail dollars the stakes are now too high not to begin to fine tune the marketing mix For every 100 books shipped in 1997 over 33 came back to the publisher for full credit and a one percent reduction in returns would save the industry over 12 million per year It s important to note though that SoundScan s launch in the music world in 1991 was not an easy task Several of the same issues that you address in Fuzzy Logic existed in the music industry in the early 90 s Also the scanning device that you mention has existed for over two decades and has been utilized by package goods manufactures to target market their products onto the shelves of retailers across the world The system is the UPC or in the case of books a EAN ISBN number that when a book is scanned by a retailer identifies the book format suggested price point genre etc Tom Fogarty Soundscan executive in charge of Bookscan
