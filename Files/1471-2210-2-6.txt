 Background Clozapine is a widely used atypical neuroleptic with affinity for multiple receptors including dopamine serotonin alpha adrenergic muscarinic and histaminergic receptors 1 2 Although clozapine is effective in the treatment of schizophrenia refractory to traditional antipsychotic medication it also has a number of significant side effects ranging from the potentially fatal but rare agranulocytosis to weight gain constipation seizures and urinary incontinence 3 Urinary problems have been reported in the clinical literature with incontinence present in up to 44 of patients 4 and enuresis in 27 of patients 5 Since clozapine has potent anti muscarinic and anti alpha adrenergic effects 2 it has been proposed that peripheral effects on the lower urinary tract might be responsible for the micturition disturbances 6 Incontinence has also been reported following therapy with other atypical neuroleptics such as risperidone 7 8 9 and recently olanzapine 10 We have previously shown that intravenous administration of clozapine to anesthetized rats 11 12 altered several micturition parameters including a decreased amount of volume voided per micturition and a concomitant increase in the residual volume In addition clozapine also inhibits the external urethral sphincter Other newer atypical neuroleptics e g olanzapine and risperidone 13 were also found to have similar effects but with differing potency compared to clozapine Since risperidone has little or no anti muscarinic activity a primary anti muscarinic peripheral effect may be ruled out as the cause of micturition disturbances following risperidone administration and suggest a possible central role for atypical neuroleptics in regulating micturition The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of clozapine administered centrally at two different sites spinal L6 S1 spinal segments vs supraspinal lateral ventricle on micturition and the external urethral sphincter during cystometry in the anesthetized rat By limiting the application site to a specific area of the central nervous system and comparing the results with our previous findings after systemic administration 12 it might be possible to determine whether the effects of clozapine are mediated at a central or peripheral level Moreover a comparison of the two central routes might indicate whether the central effect involves spinal or supraspinal structures We report in this study that most of the effects of clozapine on micturition are mediated by its central effects Furthermore there are differences in spinal versus supraspinal effects Results Effects of central administration of clozapine on urodynamic parameters during single cystometry Table 1and 2 Figures 1and 2show representative examples of the effects of clozapine on single cystometry in anesthetized rats after intrathecal i t L6 S1 spinal segment and intracerebroventricular i c v lateral ventricle administration respectively Bladder capacity was increased by clozapine given i t or i c v only at the highest dose tested Fig 1G 2G After 50 nmoles of clozapine i t the bladder capacity was 0 47 0 09 ml compared to 0 29 0 027 ml after vehicle administration Fig 3A Similarly after 50 nmoles of clozapine i c v the bladder capacity was 0 51 0 11 ml compared to 0 25 0 027 ml after vehicle administration Fig 3A Micturition volume was significantly decreased after 5 0 and 50 nmoles of clozapine i t Fig 3B to 0 11 0 031 and 0 08 0 019 ml respectively compared to 0 18 0 022 ml after vehicle In the case of intracerebroventricular administration 0 5 nmoles of clozapine decreased the micturition volume to 0 11 0 02 ml compared to 0 16 0 018 ml after vehicle Fig 3B The effect of 0 5 nmoles of clozapine i c v on micturition volume was significantly different from the effect of the same dose given i t Further reductions in micturition volume were observed after 50 nmoles of clozapine i c v Residual volume was significantly increased after 5 0 and 50 nmoles of clozapine i t to 69 6 2 and 79 4 3 compared to 34 7 5 after vehicle administration Fig 3C Clozapine i c v resulted in a significant increase in the residual volume at all doses including 0 5 nmoles After 0 5 nmoles i c v the residual volume was 54 8 5 compared to 33 7 4 after vehicle This residual volume was not significantly different from the one observed after the same dose i t Larger doses of clozapine i c v resulted in further increases in the residual volume to 62 3 8 and 80 5 2 after 5 0 and 50 nmoles respectively Clozapine i t or i c v caused an increase in the pressure threshold only at the highest doses tested Fig 1G 2G 4A After 50 nmoles i t the pressure threshold was 6 0 0 86 compared to 3 4 0 46 mm Hg after vehicle whereas after i c v administration the same dose increased the pressure threshold to 7 2 1 46 mm Hg compared to 2 9 0 29 mm Hg after vehicle Clozapine i t or i c v had no effect on either peak pressure or contraction time in the range of doses tested Fig 4B 5A in this study Expulsion time was significantly decreased by clozapine at 5 0 and 50 nmoles either i t or i c v Fig 5B After vehicle i t the expulsion time was 2 4 0 3 sec which decreased to 0 7 0 46 and 0 9 0 93 sec after 5 and 50 nmoles i t Similarly after vehicle i c v the expulsion time was 3 0 0 28 sec and 5 0 and 50 nmoles of clozapine i c v decreased it to 1 8 0 35 and 1 3 0 39 sec respectively The effect of 5 0 nmoles of clozapine i t on the expulsion time was significantly different from the effect observed after i c v administration of this dose Fig 5B Clozapine also decreased the amplitude of and in some animals even abolished the high frequency oscillations HFO after i t administration Fig 1 5C After 5 0 nmoles of clozapine the HFO were 0 4 0 23 compared to 1 5 0 1 mm Hg after administration of vehicle In 4 of the 6 animals in this group 5 nmoles of clozapine i t abolished the HFO The reduction in amplitude observed at this dose after i t administration of significantly different from the effects observed after the same dose i c v Fig 5C A greater dose of clozapine did not cause a larger effect although the amplitude of the HFO after 50 nmoles of clozapine i t was still significantly reduced 0 5 0 19 mm Hg when compared to vehicle administration Clozapine i c v decreased the amplitude of the HFO only at 50 nmoles 0 6 0 2 mm Hg compared to 1 6 0 11 mm Hg after vehicle administration Fig 2 and the HFO were abolished in only 1 6 of the animals in this group Effects of central administration of clozapine on the activity of the external urethral sphincter during single cystometry Table 1and 2 Clozapine i t did not have an effect on the activity of the EUS during Phase 1 the rising phase during a contraction and only the highest dose of clozapine i c v 50 nmoles was found to decrease the activity of the EUS Fig 6A to 62 14 9 of that seen during administration of vehicle Phase 2 of the EUS EMG occurring during the time of HFO was decreased by clozapine either i t or i c v 5 and 50 nmoles of clozapine i t decreased the EMG to 37 24 and 40 14 of that observed during administration of vehicle respectively Fig 6B In fact in 4 6 animals 5 0 nmoles of clozapine i t abolished the bursting pattern of the EMG observed during phase 2 Fig 1F Clozapine administered i c v at a dose of 0 5 nmoles decreased the EUS EMG to 68 13 9 of the activity observed after vehicle administration Fig 6B Larger doses 5 and 50 nmoles of clozapine i c v further reduced the EUS activity during this phase to 54 8 4 and 26 9 9 Clozapine i c v however was not observed to abolish the bursting pattern during this phase Fig 2 except in 1 6 animals Phase 3 of the EUS EMG recorded during the falling phase of a bladder contraction was not affected by clozapine administered intrathecally Fig 6C However the largest dose of clozapine given i c v 50 nmoles decreased the activity to 50 14 9 of the activity observed during vehicle administration Finally the amplitude of the bursts observed during phase 2 in the EUS EMG were decreased to 32 20 5 by 5 0 nmoles of clozapine i t Fig 6D A similar dose of clozapine i c v had no effect However 50 nmoles of clozapine i c v decreased the amplitude of the bursts to 65 17 2 of that observed during vehicle administration Discussion In the present experiments central application of clozapine intrathecally over the L6 S1 spinal segments or intracerebroventricularly into the lateral ventricle resulted in a number of changes in the urodynamic parameters of anesthetized rats The major effect of clozapine was to decrease the voiding efficiency of the bladder by inhibiting expulsion parameters such as micturition volume residual volume and expulsion time In addition the activity of the EUS also decreased upon central application of clozapine One problem in delivering substances centrally is the possibility that peripheral spread may confound the results Since clozapine crosses the blood brain barrier readily 14 the maximum dose selected in the present experiment was restricted to the first appearance of a decrease in blood pressure as an indication of possible peripheral alpha 1 antagonism due to peripheral leakage We compared the effects obtained in the present study against those observed previously after intravenous administration 12 expecting that central effects would require significantly less application of clozapine than systemic administration We considered a minimum difference of 10 magnitude in the central vs peripheral dose that elicited a significant effect as an indication of possible central action Our doses of 0 5 5 and 50 nmoles of clozapine correspond to serum levels of 8 80 and 800 ng ml assuming a blood volume of 8 of body weight and are in the range of therapeutic levels 260 387 ng ml 5 15 A second problem in administering a substance at a particular central location is that of redistribution to other parts of the central nervous system Since application of a substance at the lumbosacral spinal level may travel to the brain after some time and vice versa we established two criteria to help determine a possible central site of action 1 the first dose to elicit a significant effect by either i t or i c v administration 2 significant differences at the same dose but different routes i t vs i c v Figure 7is a summary of our findings when interpreted in light of the criteria stated above for determining a central vs peripheral effects and b spinal vs supraspinal site of action The effects are presented as percent change over the control vehicle dose for each of the central routes in the present experiment and our previously reported findings for systemic administration 12 Theses changes are plotted at the dose mg kg that first yielded significant results The route that we consider most likely to be the site of action for clozapine is italicized Bladder capacity was increased to a similar degree by an equivalent dose of clozapine regardless of route Fig 7A 3A making a determination of most likely site of action difficult Given that the peripheral effects at low doses were similar to the effects after the highest central dose of clozapine by either route it appears likely that this effect is due to peripheral actions of clozapine Bladder capacity was reported to increase following i c v administration of muscarinic antagonist atropine 16 or i t alpha2 antagonists yohimbine 17 atipemazole 18 Given clozapine s strong affinity for muscarinic and alpha2 receptors 2 it is possible that central effects are also contributing to the increase in bladder capacity Micturition volume on the other hand showed a reduction after smaller doses of clozapine i c v or i t when compared to the i v dose Fig 7B 3B Therefore central effects of clozapine in controlling micturition volume are likely Furthermore when comparing the effects of i t vs i c v administration a 5 nmoles dose of clozapine i c v elicited a reduction in micturition volume that was significantly greater from the effects observed after the same dose i t Fig 3B Therefore supraspinal effects of clozapine in regulating micturition volume are likely with spinal effects perhaps contributing Clozapine i t also decreased the micturition volume however the dose that first showed a significant effect was higher than the i c v but smaller than the i v dose Spinal antagonism of either alpha1 or alpha2 adrenergic receptors was reported to increase micturition volume 17 in anesthetized rats However intrathecal atipamezole alpha2 antagonist increased residual volume in awake rats 18 Therefore it is difficult to interpret clozapine s effects on micturition volume in terms of spinal alpha adrenoceptor antagonism and possibly the supraspinal effects predominate Clozapine given i t or i c v also increased the residual volume Fig 7C 3C Since the effects were observed at doses that were lower than those after i v administration a peripheral effect of clozapine to increase residual volume appears unlikely The smallest dose of clozapine given i c v 0 5 nmoles increased residual volume to 160 Fig 7C suggesting that supraspinal effects predominate with possible contributing effects from spinal sites Ishiura et al 16 reported a decrease in voiding efficiency comparable to an increase in residual volume following atropine i c v or i t suggesting that muscarinic receptors at supraspinal and spinal sites are involved and may account for our effects after clozapine i t or i c v A decrease in residual volume has been reported following spinal antagonism of alpha2 receptors with yohimbine 17 but atipamezole produced an increase in the residual volume 18 similar to our findings with clozapine i t Clozapine increased pressure threshold after i c v or i t administration only after 50 nmoles Fig 7D 4A It should be noted that both central doses were at the range observed to result in cardiovascular changes and therefore the possibility of peripheral leakage of clozapine must be considered Still the effective central doses are approximately 14 less than the first dose observed to produce significant results intravenously and suggests a possible central site of action Peak pressure was not changed by clozapine after either route in the present study after central administration consistent with our findings afer intravenous administration 12 Ishiura et al 16 reported a decrease in maximal voiding pressure equivalent to our peak pressure after atropine i v i c v or i t in awake rats undergoing continuous cystometry Given that clozapine has a relatively high affinity for muscarinic receptors 1 2 it is surprising that we have not seen an effect on peak pressure Clozapine and also olanzapine 11 13 were able to decrease the contraction amplitude after electrical stimulation of the pelvic nerve Since the contraction pressures observed during cystometry were smaller than those observed after electrical stimulation of the pelvic nerve and against a closed urethra it is possible that the antimuscarinic effects of clozapine on bladder contraction pressure are not detected because during cystometry maximal bladder pressures are not necessary for emptying Contraction time was not affected by clozapine i c v or i t Table 1and 2 Fig 5A however it was clearly decreased after intravenous administration 12 Therefore we suspect that solely peripheral effects may explain the effects of clozapine on contraction time Antimuscarinic agents have been show to decrease contraction time e g atropine 19 and since clozapine has high affinity for muscarinic receptors it is likely that peripheral anti muscarinic effects of clozapine are responsible for the reduction in contraction time after systemic administration Expulsion time was reduced by clozapine after i t or i c v administration at much smaller doses than were observed to produce similar results i v Fig 7E 5B Therefore central effects of clozapine are likely responsible for the reduction in expulsion time Since the intrathecal effects were greater than those observed after i c v administration it is possible that a spinal action predominates with possible contribution from supraspinal sites The amplitude of the high frequency oscillations observed during the expulsion time in the rat micturition cycle 20 21 was reduced by clozapine i t at a dose of 5 nmoles Fig 8F This dose was 10 smaller than the first i c v dose observed to have a significant effect and approximately 142 smaller than the first i v dose to show a significant effect Therefore a spinal site mediating the effects of clozapine on the amplitude of high frequency oscillations appears likely Previous results 12 suggest that D2 receptors modulate the amplitude of the HFO since raclopride selective D2 antagonist decreased the amplitude of the HFO by 30 In addition to clozapine s effects on urodynamic parameters the EMG recorded from the external urethral sphincter also showed changes after clozapine i t or i c v The EMG during phase 1 of the contraction only showed a reduction after the largest dose of clozapine i c v This dose is equivalent to our lowest dose i v and in fact all doses i v previously showed a significant reduction 11 Intrathecal administration had no effect on the EMG at phase 1 The EMG during phase 2 corresponding to the period of high frequency oscillations was decreased by clozapine after i t or i c v administration at doses that were much lower than those necessary to produce an effect after i v Therefore the effects of clozapine in reducing the EMG during this phase appear to be central in origin Since the first significant effect was obtained after i c v administration Fig 7H it is possible that supraspinal effects predominate with spinal sites contributing The EMG during phase 3 closing phase of the contraction was decreased only after the highest dose of clozapine 50 nmoles i c v Fig 6C This dose was still 14 smaller than the first significant dose i v and therefore a central effect of clozapine is probable Finally the amplitude of the individual bursts of EMG recorded from the external urethral sphincter during phase 2 of the contraction also decreased after clozapine i t or i c v Fig 6D Since the doses that yielded significant reductions were smaller than those observed after i v admnistration a central effect is likely Moreover since 5 nmoles of clozapine i t produced a significant reduction when compared to the same dose i c v a spinal effect of clozapine in mediating the reduction of the burst amplitude of the EMG is possible In the anesthetized rat the external urethral sphincter contracts and relaxes during the expulsion phase in a manner that is complimentary to the high frequency oscillations observed in the bladder pressure record 19 whereas in humans the external sphincter not active during voiding Pharmacological blockade of the external urethral sphincter in the rat resulted in decreased micturition volume and increased residual volume 20 21 22 23 suggesting that the activity of the external urethral sphincter contributes to efficient voiding in the rat Therefore central administration of clozapine by reducing the activity of the EUS contributes to the decrease in voiding efficiency by reducing micturition volume and increasing residual volume Alpha1 adrenergic antagonists have been shown to inhibit pudendal reflexes in anesthetized cats 24 25 26 However a systemic dose of prazosin alpha1 antagonist did not inhibit the EUS EMG activity during high frequency oscillations in the rat 27 Thus although alpha1 antagonism has been shown to modulate pudendal reflexes in the cat their role in modulating the activity of the EUS during micturition in the rat appears unclear In summary our results in the present experiments suggest that most of the effects of clozapine on urodynamic parameters can be ascribed to central effects Expulsion parameters such as micturition volume residual volume expulsion time and amplitude of the high frequency oscillations appear to be mediated by the central action spinal or supraspinal of clozapine The activity of the EUS also appears to decrease after central application of clozapine Therefore central effects of clozapine appear to decrease the voiding efficiency of the bladder in the rat Contraction time clearly showed a peripheral effect only whereas changes in bladder capacity were difficult to explain from central effects and probably reflect peripheral effects of clozapine Clozapine is metabolized mainly at the liver resulting in several metabolites 5 14 One of the major metabolites N desmethylclozapine has been shown to have pharmacological activity both in vitro 28 and in vivo in rats 29 In addition N desmethylclozapine is found in large concentrations in the serum of schizophrenic patients 5 15 and in rats 30 The contribution of N desmethylclozapine to clozapine s central effects has been questioned recently since the levels of N desmethylclozapine in the brain were much lower than those of clozapine 30 suggesting that N desmethylclozapine does not cross the blood brain barrier as readily as clozapine Since we observed effects from central application of clozapine we consider it unlikely that the effects of metabolites contributed significantly However whether any of the major clozapine metabolites also have a role in regulating micturition remains to be determined Conclusions Atypical neuroleptics are useful in treating patients that are refractory to traditional antipsychotic medication and produce fewer extrapyramidal side effects However other side effects still occur with varying severity and frequency 31 and continue to pose a challenge to effective treatment Urinary disturbances as a result of clozapine therapy have been well documented and include incontinence enuresis and urgency 4 5 32 Other atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone 7 and olanzapine 10 have been reported to produce urinary incontinence We have previously shown 11 12 13 that systemic administration of clozapine olanzapine and risperidone to anesthetized rats reduced voiding efficiency Risperidone had smaller maximal effects than olanzapine and clozapine and had no direct peripheral inhibitory effects on the amplitude of bladder contractions In the present study we show that clozapine acts at supraspinal and spinal sites to inhibit certain urodynamic parameters and the external urethral sphincter of the rat resulting in decreased voiding efficiency If these effects also occur in patients they may contribute to the urinary disturbances reported following clozapine therapy The exact receptor types or combination of receptor types responsible for clozapine s central effects on micturition were not investigated in the present study However isolating particular receptors that contribute to the effects of clozapine might be useful in designing neuroleptics that may avoid these side effects or in providing an adjunct therapy to relieve some of the side effects Materials and Methods Surgical procedures The experiments were conducted in compliance with the USDA Animal Welfare Act and amendments thereto and the revised Guide for the Care and use of Laboratory Animals DHEW NIH and were approved by the Animal Studies Subcommittee of the Bay Pines Veterans Administration Medical Center Surgical procedures have been described in detail elsewhere 12 Rats female Sprague Dawley n 16 230 270 g Harlan IN were anesthetized with halothane and placed on a heating pad A catheter PE 50 was introduced into the jugular vein to administer urethane 1 1 g kg over a period of 20 minutes while decreasing the level of halothane to prevent respiratory depression Rats were instrumented with either an intrathecal cannula placed over the L6 S1 spinal segment or a cannula into the right lateral ventricle An incision was made over the dorsal aspect of the neck and the overlying muscles were retracted to expose the atlanto occipital membrane An intrathecal catheter PE 10 was introduced through a small slit in the atlanto occipital membrane and positioned over the L6 S1 spinal cord segments 33 Saline soaked gelfoam was placed around the catheter and the neck muscles and skin were sutured Spinal segmental location of the catheter was verified post mortem by performing a laminectomy Following a small craniectomy a stainless steel cannula 27 ga was placed in the lateral ventricle at the following coordinates AP 1 0 ML 1 2 V 3 2 mm 34 The cannula was held in place with skull screws and dental acrylic At the end of the experiment 5 l of fast green 1 was infused through the cannula while observing the CSF though a small slit in the atlanto occipital membrane Almost immediate visualization of the fast green in the fourth ventricle was taken to indicate appropriate placement of the cannula into the lateral ventricle After an abdominal incision both ureters were tied distally and cut centrally and allowed to drain onto cotton gauzes that were directed outside the animal A catheter PE 90 was introduced into the bladder dome and tied in place with a purse string suture A catheter PE 50 was introduced into the right femoral artery for blood pressure recording

Urodynamic studies In pilot animals the dose and duration of effects was determined by administering clozapine saline 0 5 5 50 100 nmoles at 10 min intervals either intrathecally n 2 or intracerebroventricularly n 2 during continuous cystometry infusion rate 0 11 ml min while recording bladder pressure external urethral sphincter EMG and blood pressure Fifty 50 nmoles of clozapine administered by either route resulted in a decrease in arterial pressure mean decrease in MAP was 20 2 and 15 3 mm Hg for intrathecal and intracerebroventricular administration respectively The onset time ranged from 1 1 5 min from the start of the infusion Since clozapine has alpha1 antagonist effects 2 it is possible that the blood pressure decreases were due to spread of clozapine into the periphery following central administration Doses smaller than 50 nmoles did not elicit a drop in arterial pressure In addition 50 nmoles represents a dose close to the smallest intravenous dose used previously 0 1 mg kg 12 Therefore during single cystometry the dose range was limited to 0 5 to 50 nmoles in order to reduce possible peripheral spread of clozapine Single cystometry studies were conducted as follows The bladder was emptied and allowed to equilibrate to air pressure for 5 minutes before beginning each cystometrogram Room temperature saline was infused into the bladder 0 11 ml min while recording bladder pressure and the infusion was stopped when a contraction occurred Volume expelled was determined by placing cotton gauze at the urinary meatus and weighing before and after micturition External urethral sphincter EMG EUS EMG was recorded throughout the cystometrogram and for some time after the filling had stopped Increasing doses of clozapine Sigma vehicle 0 5 5 50

at approximately 10 minute intervals Clozapine was dissolved in a minimal amount of 0 1 N hydrochloric acid and brought up to volume with saline final pH 6 Cystometrograms were started approximately 3 minutes after each drug administration At the end of the experiment the rat was euthanized with an overdose of urethane 3 0 mg kg i v Data analysis Bladder pressure EUS EMG and blood pressure during
