        okay the recording started what kind of habits hobbies do you have   okay i have two main hobbies one of them is painting and the other one is collecting wine but from your from the description it sounds like theyre more interested in painting   oh  well im interested in wine i like the wine   oh thats good thats fine i     yeah yeah what kind of wines do you like   well im a very big favor uh much in favor of red wines and i have about a thousand bottles down in my cellar and ive been collecting it now for oh fifteen years or so   oh really my goodness red wines huh im a white wine drinker myself i im on the white Zinfandels now i ive come up the ladder the Chablis and the Rhines now im got uh on uh Zinfandels   oh okay see white Zinfandels are not a big favorite of mine though   really   the whites i like are these very okay Chardonnays like Kessler Kessler and things like that   uhhuh uhhuh you dont have any vineyards up there do you Meryl   uh there are some but and in fact their white wines are better than their red wines because they dont get enough sun to make good red wine   are there oh okay now see im from Grapevine thats uh used to be we have a winery here but uh it used to be uh i think they had a couple of wineries at one time but they do grow grapes here thats where they get the name Grapevine   im originally from El Paso Texas and i have friend who has a vineyard actually its in New Mexico near La Yunon New Mexico which is just north of El Paso up the valley   oh are you uhhuh i understand i understand the University of Texas has a huge winery down in south Texas some place really big one but i dont know theyre i guess theyre bottling it i dont what they sell it under what name they sell it under have you ever visited the wineries in California   yes some of them   i uh ive uh gone to a couple my parents live in northern California so i visit there but back to hobbies i guess uh and what what kind of painting do you do   oh mostly mostly figures ive few done landscapes my grandmother was an artist so when i was a little kid i was baby sat in her studio so i learned to mix paint by watching people mix paint things like that so   uhhuh oh okay thats a good idea i used to paint uh you know i just dabble and i really think i have a talent for it but ive never really explored it like i should what little i have done i think is pretty good but as i said i never have gone on with it maybe i should have if id uh you know taken a lessons or something but  i in through the years ive just im not any good any more when i was younger i i used to be pretty good   oh for for years i used to go to groups that hire a model and draw once a week when i lived in New Jersey and used to work at Bell Labs and   oh did you uhhuh   id go twice a week for three hours and you do that for about ten years you get to where you can actually draw pretty well   yes i would imagine i would hope so anyway  well i  when i was in high school i think i drew a mural behind the concession stand at the local theatre and you know stuff like that       i won first  prize painting the front of a bar Halloween night instead of kids soaping windows they wanted us to paint you know windows in town and i painted something won first prize on that but like i said i never did go on with it and uh   oh i still paint occasionally not as much as i used to but i still paint i have some stuff set up the only two things in my basement are my painting stuff and the wine cellar which is   wine we have wine cellars thats nice let me   well i built it i you you have to way have some way of storing them so   oh did you oh uhhuh well you know we dont have not many people have basements here for some reason i dont know why the the grounds   it   not wet like it is in Florida so i dont why they dont have basements you dont see too many of them   yeah i think you probably dont get very good very good number of square feet for your dollar building a basement there thats probably why   yeah i guess so guess so well i  only hobbies i have is i jog and uh every night and thats just that and my yard work i love to i work in the yard i i have my yard work done but i do my flowers you know and stuff i i like to do stuff like that and i have quite a variety of flowers i work on that every all the time   so you must have a lot well you ought to be seeing lots of flowers this time of year   oh yeah they really are beautiful gorgeous time of the year because uh theyre really out and especially roses roses do grow good down here i guess thats probably my best hobby and then i do volunteer work at a hospital thats kind of a hobby i guess i work in intensive care at a local hospital just  um one night a week and thats kind of fun and different and kind of like a hobby i guess   you find out what its like in that kind of business   yeah ive im amazed the people uh the different types of people ive met that the rude people the people that are so inconsiderate of other people and i it just boggles my mind how many i find like that that think theyre the only ones that are grieving or having a hard time they dont have any respect for the people you know sitting across the room you know and theyll be laughing and carrying on and here are these people that are sad and i just  i just cant get over people how people are im really getting getting a rude awakening to how the human nature is i guess       you know and last last night i just theres big signs telling them not to go in without checking with the volunteer and you must be twelve years of age to go in and no more than two people at a time and so this man walks in you know just walks up without even checking with me with his seven year old daughter and his wife so thats three of them just you know theres three rules right there he busted you know just walked right on in and i thought       golly you know he didnt even follow any of the rules and i and didnt even seem to bother of course they kicked him right out       but   and he probably didnt like that   oh yeah very highly insulted you know how dare they  but i just       cant i just cant believe people i it this is the thats some place you need to work to really see how people really are  when it comes right down to it anyway   well working in a research place where i work at National Institute of Standards and Technology which used to be National Bureau of Standards thats kind of an ivory tower place so   oh uhhuh yeah i know used to know a guy that uh from TI that was uh real big in standards uh James Tu that worked at uh TI and he was uh over the standards labs and everything i believe there and i was always impressed by all the clocks and you know the when we take things to be calibrated and what have you in the standards lab and it was kind of interesting that what you all do calibrate and   yeah i yeah theres lots of stuff the only people i guess i know at TI are either the people who work in the speech program who run this this computer program or if the people in the semiconductor area i used to know Pallab Chatterjee and those kind of people i dont know dont know if youd know him or not   huh umhum uhhuh no i had worked for TI for seventeen years but i uh quit about five years six years ago i guess and went with Mark Marietta and then came up here with another company and uh about two and a half years ago from Florida theyre just back in the same area but i enjoy it here im a Texas person im not a native Texan but i love Texas so       i wasnt happy till i got back   well i grew up in Texas and i moved away and never came back so     never came back huh oh well  my all my familys in California i just i dont know i just couldnt stand being away from Texas i kept coming back       and it feels good i im real happy here i like the weather and the people and i like the people in Florida too they were nice uh i enjoyed Florida but i like Texas better i guess but anyway i guess our five minutes is up   i guess they are its been nice talking to you   its been nice talking to you bye   bye
