 Address your e mail to the editors to slate msn com posted Thursday Feb 20 Wild About Harry Part 1 I would just like to say how much I have enjoyed reading Harry Shearer s Dispatches from the O J civil trial Brilliantly well written and with the right mix of sarcasm and serious analysis they have been virtually unmissable throughout the trial The same can be said for his earlier Diary entries on the Republican and Democratic party conventions during the summer Now that the civil trial has come to a conclusion does Slate have any more projects up its sleeve for him to have a crack at James McBride Wild About Harry Part 2 You really should issue Harry Shearer s incredible O J Dispatches in book form His coverage has been far more insightful than anything else for either the criminal or the civil trial including the acclaimed book by that sly revisionist Jeffrey Toobin He also added something this whole escapade has needed from the start a little humor The material ought to have much broader exposure Patrick Hudson The Editors Reply Funny you should ask We ve collected all of Harry s O J Dispatches into one gargantuan Microsoft Word and Adobe Acrobat document that will you can dowload by clicking here It Was a Simple Error The Week The Spin Feb 6 1997 contained a terrible error Welfare reform was the hot topic at the National Governors Association winter meeting Several Republican governors supported restoration of aid to illegal immigrants which was cut in the new welfare law Unfortunately the substitution of illegal immigrants for legal immigrants in this blurb rendered this passage not only factually inaccurate but politically unintelligible The cuts the governors complained about were the elimination of benefits to legal immigrants who heretofore have been treated pretty much the same as citizens with regard to welfare benefits The big cuts were in SSI benefits to current legal immigrants and these cuts accounted for most of the welfare reform savings In California cutting legal immigrants off federal aid simply dumps them onto local taxpayers even though millions of poor continue to arrive Your coverage made a complicated subject even more obscure and made light of a sea change in the treatment of immigrants which carries grave human consequences Was it a simple error or muddled arrogance Freya Schultz Dwarves Through the Ages I enjoyed Pop Technology Louis Menand s take on the Star Wars legacy particularly his observation that human beings have become dwarfed by computer created images on the big screen It strikes me as a modern day perversion of ancient Chinese landscape paintings in which people are depicted as miniscule figures at the base of immense mountains and valleys Will our generation one day be interpreted as similarly insignificant in the face of colossal technology David Takami Worth Every Nickel A Penny for Your Thoughts by Nathan Myhrvold was excellent While I usually go to Slate for the political and social insights especially those by Jacob Weisberg see also his latest Strange Bedfellow Myhrvold s article was the first really well done concrete analysis of an aspect of the Web that I have ever seen I hope you all continue to capitalize on your ownership by Microsoft to get some of Microsoft s brainpower on your pages Rick Cendo The Price Is Right I read with interest Nathan Myhrvold s A Penny for Your Thoughts especially the comparison between Internet micropayments and the Dutch Auction style downward pricing structure of movies The movie going experience does have one other advantage over the other forms of intellectual stimulation you mentioned however nonregulatory price caps Patrons of Waterworld produced at a cost of 172 million paid the same flat fee say 7 at a first run theater this was two years ago remember as did fellow multiplexers interested in The Brothers McMullen produced for a mere 25 000 Such a price ceiling is downright reassuring compared to the world of say print publishing in which a newsstand browse yields magazines ranging from 2 to 20 per issue Now micropayments for popcorn on the other hand might be worth a try Erich Van Dussen Liberal Love Fest I consider this zine to be the epitome of corporate statism This is nothing but a Bill Clinton liberal love fest Browsing the Contents I see a Dialogue about the credibility of Kenneth Starr The Conservative Collapse about the foundering Republican Party and I Had Coffee With Clinton speaking glowingly about a White House visit If Kenneth Starr is so inexperienced why has he won so many felony convictions each closer and closer to the White House And the Republican Party is bereft of ideas Slate must believe that during the last 60 years the Democrats who never met a tax they didn t like and want to expand the rat hole known as the welfare state have had new ones The only ideas the Democratic Party has are tax and spend ideas And these hundreds of White House coffees Slate is obviously so misinformed that they don t know or don t care that using the White House for political fund raising not to mention using the Lincoln Bedroom as a motel is against the law Slate is obviously a product of our foundering educational system It does not know or care about the law or what is right and wrong If this is what passes as American culture God help us Jay Campbell Address
