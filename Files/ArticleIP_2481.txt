 Let Si Get This During a typical lunch time at the Royalton Hotel restaurant in midtown Manhattan The New Yorker s Tina Brown might be installed at her usual table and Vogue s Anna Wintour might be at her usual table chewing on her usual meal a 25 hamburger Vanity Fair s Graydon Carter might be there too although he has transferred his main allegiance to a place called Patroon Filling out the room are other editors publicists and writers from these magazines and GQ and House Garden and so on And one man who probably isn t there himself picks up every tab Some of the lesser fry may even utter the Cond Nast mantra though it is hardly necessary at the Royalton as they grab for the check Let Si get this S I Si Newhouse Jr and his younger brother Donald control Advance Publications one of America s largest privately held companies Estimate of their combined wealth 13 billion Donald tends to Advance s hugely profitable newspaper radio and TV holdings Si runs the less profitable but more glamorous properties These are the 15 Cond Nast magazines including in descending order of fabulousness Vogue Vanity Fair GQ Cond Nast Traveler House Garden Allure Details Self Mademoiselle and Glamour and Random House The expense account lunch is a hallowed journalistic tradition But consider a day in the life of an editor working for Si Newhouse Donald s editors are a different story as they will be happy to tell you It s a closed economy where almost all human needs and desires can be gratified with a miraculous unlimited currency called the Si A Lincoln Town Car is waiting outside your door in the morning to take you to work The car which costs 50 an hour is written into your contract First stop breakfast with a writer at the Four Seasons The check may be as little as 40 When you reach the office you realize you re out of cigarettes No problem you send your assistant to buy a pack for you She gets reimbursed from petty cash 3 Could be worse for the assistant She could be forced to pick up her boss s birth control pills or her boss s pet from the vet or presents for her boss s children regular duties for Cond Nast underlings You ve forgotten to return the video your kids watched yesterday so you have a messenger take it back to Blockbuster Si spends 20 you save a 1 50 late fee Then there s lunch The magazines account for more than a quarter of daytime revenues at the Four Seasons and the Royalton A modest lunch for two at the Royalton no fancy wine or anything might cost 80 But Si s generosity extends to even assistants and sub sub editors dining on sushi at their desks If you spend 10 or less on lunch and claim you were working Si pays At Vogue and Vanity Fair almost everyone has a working lunch every day An editor at Allure says that working lunches there are limited to 10 a month Back at the office you hear that a friend at another Newhouse magazine has been promoted so you send flowers The tab 100 Si pays One of my favorite Cond Nast stories is of an editor who had just been promoted to an extremely senior job His office was jammed with congratulatory flowers and cards All had been sent by fellow Cond Nast staffers All had been billed to the company Four o clock and it s snack time Your assistant joins the mob in the lobby newsstand She bills your candy bar juice and cigarettes as well as her own candy bar juice and cigarettes to the magazine 15 After all it s a working snack Later there s a birthday party for your assistant You order champagne and a cake on the company of course and present her with your gift a Prada wallet 200 Later she submits the expense sheet for it Finally after a Random House book party at Le Cirque 2000 estimated cost to Si 35 000 your car ferries you home Newhouse expense stories are a staple of New York literary journalistic conversation Stories about the 10 000 in expenses that a New Yorker editor billed for a single month About the interior decorating costs for the fashion magazine editor who likes to have her office photographs rearranged every few months About the hotel tab for the big name New York writer who spent three weeks in Washington s Hay Adams basic room 285 a night researching a Vanity Fair story that will never run About the Vogue editor who has furnished her summer house from items purchased for fashion shoots beautiful furniture designer pillows coffee table books Vogue assistants have nicknamed the house Petty Cash Junction None of the 39 past and present Newhouse employees I spoke to for this story would talk on the record for And the nature of the subject makes it hard to separate apocrypha from the truth Did Cond Nast pay as sources insist it did hundreds of thousands of dollars in back taxes on behalf of an editor who didn t bother to file tax forms Did an editor really expense 20 000 in a weeklong trip to Paris The people who pay the bills are not talking But every example of excess cited here was told to me by at least one source and usually more than one in a position to know Need a facial Treat yourself and bill it to Si This is what is called scouting It is also a great way to get free haircuts To be fair Si doesn t pay for all such treats There is also a much honored tradition of accepting tribute from companies that Cond Nast magazines cover One magazine exec reportedly got so much loot last Christmas Cuban cigars crates of wine designer suits It was like a Spanish galleon that he needed three cars to cart it home At yuletide even midlevel fashion mag writers and editors are inundated with cashmere sweaters Versace pillows coats recalls one ex Vogue staffer wistfully At the top of the masthead the perks are perkier His Si ness their joke not mine does not expect his editors in chief to actually live on their million dollar salaries He also gives them clothing allowances up to 50 000 a year He buys them cars of their choice and hires chauffeurs to drive them He offers them low or no interest home loans GQ editor Art Cooper reportedly received two 1 million loans one for a Manhattan apartment the other for a Connecticut farm Tina Brown and her husband Harold Evans former president of Random House reportedly just took a 2 million boost to buy a 3 7 million Manhattan house Si s favorite courtiers lead lives of jaw dropping privilege When she was editor of British Vogue Wintour commuted between London and New York on the Concorde Another Si confidant decided his office didn t feel right so he hired one of the grandmasters of feng shui to rearrange it Some editors prepare for trips by Federal Expressing their luggage to their destination Why So you don t have to carry your bags No one would be caught dead carrying a bag Cond Nast has also created a class of mandarin journalists writers who live much better than they ever could if they wrote only for normal magazines One free lancer tells of building much of a summer traveling with her husband in the West and Europe around a couple of Cond Nast assignments Last summer The New Yorker sent a staffer to Venice to cover the Venice Film Festival The weeklong trip which must have cost thousands resulted in a short piece Writers of course are nowhere near as profligate as photographers Stories of wasteful shoots abound the matching seaweed that had to be flown from California to the Caribbean for a fashion photo the Annie Liebovitz Vanity Fair cover shot of Arnold Schwarzenegger that reportedly cost 100 000 the Vogue shoot in Africa in which an ex Vogue editor claims the photographer and his huge entourage wined and dined to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars And then there are the parties Last month The New Yorker spent and this is not a joke 500 000 on a two day Next Conference at the Disney Institute in Florida in connection with a special issue on the same theme In order to get Vice President Gore who was traveling in California at the time The New Yorker paid for him and his entourage to fly Air Force Two from California to Florida and back And vice presidents are not the only things that Cond Nast flies in for parties The New Yorker once shipped silverware from New York to Chicago for a dinner What they don t have silverware in Chicago asks a New Yorker staffer Vanity Fair toted food from New York to Washington for this year s party on the night of the White House Correspondents Dinner What they don t have food in Washington That annual Washington do has grown from an after dinner gathering for drinks at a contributor s apartment to two huge blasts before and after the dinner itself at a rented embassy VF s annual Oscar night party has become a similar institution in Hollywood In addition to the parties themselves Si also naturally pays to fly in VF staffers and to put them up at top hotels What they don t have editors in Washington or L A Some Cond Nast parties are so ridiculous that even other Cond Nasties make fun of them This week s New Yorker for example mocks a recent Vogue party in honor of food writer Jeffrey Steingarten According to The New Yorker Wintour so detested the carpet at Le Cirque 2000 that she ordered the florist to cover it with autumn leaves handpicked of course The apogee of party absurdity is Vanity Fair s sponsorship of an annual London dinner for the Serpentine Museum in Hyde Park As one observer puts it Vanity Fair an American magazine pays more than 100 000 to a British art museum solely so that it can sponsor a dinner where Graydon Carter gets to sit next to Princess Diana The princess was the museum s patron Actually paying 100 000 for face time with Princess Di may not have been a foolish investment for a magazine so dependent on peddling her image And Cond Nast s excess has other plausible justifications as well Some top editors may earn their perks Vogue and GQ make millions according to industry analysts Vanity Fair is enjoying banner years and while it probably hasn t made back the millions Newhouse lost in starting it up it is certainly in the black The New Yorker loses money how much may even surpass perks as a topic of Newhouse gossip and speculation On the other hand The New Yorker is the most talked about magazine in America and Tina Brown is the most talked about editor That is worth something Public media companies such as Time Warner or for that matter Microsoft can entice and hold journalists with stock options Advance is private so Newhouse uses other golden handcuffs He runs a lifestyle prison Top editors stay because they could never afford to live in a house as nice as the one Si s interest free loan bought them or to host parties as nice as the ones Si s party planners throw for them Cond Nast s magazines are all about glamour wealth prestige To uphold that image magazine editors need to circulate at the top of New York society But the top of New York society consists of people who make far more money than magazine editors do investment bankers corporate chieftains and fashion designers Million dollar salaries aren t enough to mix as equals with the Trumps and Karans Si s perks are equalizers And they say it s not as good as it used to be In 1992 according to Thomas Maier s biography of Newhouse the editor of Self held a birthday party for Si Newhouse s dog Owners ate caviar dogs drank Evian The lowliest assistants used to take car services home But new Cond Nast CEO Steve Florio has restricted cars and catering Editors who used to fly the Concorde now fly first class those who used to fly first class now fly business Expense accounts are scrutinized Even so today s Cond Nast is economical only by Cond Nast standards The belt is tighter but it s still hand tooled hand tanned and fashioned from the finest Italian leather
