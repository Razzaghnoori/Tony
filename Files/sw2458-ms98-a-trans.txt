 hell air pollution tends to be a a topic that uh some people have a lot to say on and some don t care much for it at all but uh i found that there s there seems to be quite a bit that the individual can do as far as air pollution and one thing it kind of hits the old pocketbook a little bit but if you can just keep the automotives vehicles going properly instead of uh letting them rundown and use a quart a oil a mile like some of these smoke cars do that would uh make quite a difference we all seem to have one or more of those things and then we have a variety of people at least in this part of country that uh love their fireplaces and we burn off an awful lot of uh acreage of wood and put it up in smoke and on a proper day as far as the temperature goes you can have a cloud of smoke hovering other a neighborhood that s just sickening really i mean it may be pleasant inside but it stinks outside so uh little things like that uh an individual can do what what else do you think they can do well you know i i think fireplaces are great but you know you really don t have to have wood yeah that s true you know i mean fireplaces their great but you can get you know one hundred percent clean burning natural gas in your fireplaces and i mean you know most of the fireplaces are for ambience anyway they re not that efficient yeah that s true they they really are but but uh i live in a place where cars are are i mean you know you you you see a picture of the freeway here in the Bay area and you know at anyone given time you ll see you know maybe four out of a hundred will have more than one person in the car um so i m i m a real proponent for mass transit there s there s just uh uh you know there s just no reason on a regular basis for someone having you know to uh if if if we just did our mass transit better and longer and more complete you know um hum around the Bay area here we got uh uh system here called i don t know if you ve ever been to the Bay area uh it s called uh no BART Bay Area Rapid Transit and they uh um um hum uh connect Berkeley with San Francisco with Oakland and and a couple of other cities but if it were to go to complete completely around the Bay and when you ever you get on BART BART s just absolutely wonderful because it s fast it s clean it s really efficient and it s it s actually fun to ride but uh it s just you you know it s its its been half assed and uh they need to completely uh you know um hum make the system so it goes completely throughout the the Bay area a lot of people would ride BART but a lot more would make it right um hum if uh and i think that alone that alone would just cut down so immensely on that we ve we ve also i mean the fact of the matter is is that you know they ve just got to find other fuels that s true yeah and and and and go other routes our our our i think basically our air pollution is one of the one of the uh oh uh oh one of main side effects uh or or or or you know one of those visible symptoms of the US energy policy period and our energy policy is just nil just is nonexistent and uh if we had one you know striving to meet certain standards and certain goals and really to push it and uh let the corporations and the yeah you know the the automobile manufactures and stuff it it it just keeps sliding i i think it would make a big big difference it s just it you know it just hasn t hit people yet that we may have crossed the line right and that line being of of uh you know a a a a planet that s going to be able to continue to live or it s gradually already dying and it will not be renewable i mean we may have crossed that line um hum and it will be up to our kids and maybe their kids to you know to find out right and things will live on this planet but humans may not be able to anymore right it may not be us yeah we have a um they happen to use about the same abbreviation for the Dallas area they use Dallas Area Rapid Transit for DART and uh uh DART s problem here the you know the Metroplex itself suburbs and all it it s a pretty hefty uh distance from one suburb to the southern suburb so they they run uh they gather the monies from the other counties and the other suburbs and and run the DART system throughout the suburbs to downtown Dallas as it were and it s a good forty or so miles in each direction just about and they also try to run city to city with you know around locally the only problem is for me to go to work i live um less than ten miles from the front door of my my uh place of work and for me to get there it would take me an hour and a half of three different bus transfers and that s just ridiculous can t get there from here and it s a large place i mean we re talking about oh that that that s terrible i mean that really is you know yeah Texas Instruments thirty thousand people in the whole area right and then my building inside it s fairly large and there s no reason for me to have to go from point A to point B in an hour and a half yeah when i can roll that old beast of mine down there for a lot less than that sure plus it would cost me oh i think the last time i looked at it was about had a dollar fifty one way and i said no i m not going to do that fast isn t that bad yet yep so that part s one problem i i wonder about the whole CFC issue i ve i ve read some papers from some some scientist that don t get published that well because of their opposition to that saying that they re really not sure that the CFC s are the main problem yes we have a ozone problem but is it well i mean it it it is a fact uh the the CFC s do act like i mean it it it s it s like a billiard ball you get a CFC up there high enough you know it s a it s in the ozone layer um hum it doesn t just breakdown one it s not a one to one reaction it s it s a catalytic thing and it it actually just rumbles around and around and and breaks up every C O you know O O O three molecule it hits um hum and uh i mean well they weren t negating whether whether it is the main contributor or not it s uh you know i i think no one can doubt the fact that it is you know i mean it s it s a bad thing um hum it s a real bad thing and it s just you know i think it s so many of these bad things some little really don t contribute that much and some just insignificantly but uh you know i i heard something the other night that absolutely floored me i m a i m a i m a space enthusiast and just absolutely uh am absolutely crazy about the solar you know and think that we ought to put as much money as we can possibly get into the to the space program and i found out the other night from an Australian scientist one of the most respected uh scientist in Australia that every time i the US shuttle goes up it dumps more than what is it a hundred tons of these fluorocarbons into the ozone layer it is probably responsible our US shuttle um that s interesting breaking down the ozone layer each flight could bring it down as much as one tenth that s interesting and it s the solid rocket propellants great parts of the system if if it were to be jettisoned lower you know before it got up that high huh um hum uh it it it it it really wouldn t have that great of effect but what happens is it goes all the way up through into the ozone layer and then it keeps firing and dumping and i just blew me away yeah that that s an awful lot yeah uh and it s frightening and and and a couple of these scientist down there have been screaming about this for some time now and of course uh Australia is the one that s going to you know suffer the most because uh that main whole that s over the uh Antarctica continent continent you know uh it it expands out over Australia and at certain times of the year right you know there s absolutely no ozone protection whatsoever in Australia in the last in the years of the shuttle the uh uh the skin cancer and and other you know uh cancers in Australia have gone up you know so mething like like six thousand percent yeah it seems like i heard that just this week on either CNN or somewhere that they they were talking about that yeah they re they re they re so they re they re a little bit cross with the US and we could remodel that system you know yeah we don t have to use those as a matter of fact it wasn t designed that way initially at all the solid uh propellant rockets were a uh you know were time saving money saving afterthought right uh and uh i just you know i think it s just been uh uh uh terrible anyway anyway but that that that that that that as an aside but there s another one of those things you know it s like so many of these little things that that that add to it that i i just think this country not only this country but the world has kind of started thinking that uh if we don t get it together here
