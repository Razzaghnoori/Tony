 Background In 1960 Nowell first described lymphocyte activation by mitogenic lectins to result in blastic transformation and subsequent mitosis which are complex cellular events that require several days to evolve 1 More than 40 years later we have advanced considerably in our understanding of the cellular and molecular events responsible for these phenomena Now with the genomic revolution we are poised on a new threshold of discovery in that it is finally feasible to begin to identify the genes that are responsible for such complicated cellular processes However it is now necessary to develop an experimental approach that will rapidly and accurately facilitate the discovery process With the description of lymphocyte derived growth factor activities in the 1960s and 1970s it was realized that activated lymphocytes secrete soluble factors that are critical for subsequent lymphocyte proliferation 2 3 Moreover in 1967 it was demonstrated that monocytes or macrophages serve as necessary accessory cells for the lymphocyte activation process 4 Then in the early 1970s several reports indicated that mitogen or endotoxin stimulated macrophages release soluble lymphocyte activating factors LAFs that also amplify the activation process 5 6 Accordingly lymphokines and monokines which collectively came to be known as cytokines became prime research subjects for those interested in lymphocyte activation 7 8 However it was not until the 1980s that the cell surface and soluble molecules responsible for the complex cellular changes of lymphocyte activation were identified With the isolation of the lymphocyte derived molecule responsible for T cell Growth Factor TCGF activity which came to be known as interleukin 2 IL 2 9 10 and discovery of IL 2 receptors IL 2R 11 it could be shown that mitogenic lectins and specific antigens triggered an initial activation event which was analogous to the activation of cell cycle competence by serum stimulated fibroblasts and resulted in transition from the G 0 to the G 1 phase of the cell cycle 12 13 However just as in serum stimulated fibroblasts this initial activation event did not result in lymphocyte proliferation Instead it appeared that the initial activation of cellular competence triggered by the mitogenic lectins was amplified by the LAF activity which became known later as IL 1 and led to the secretion of the lymphocyte derived IL 2 and the expression of IL 2Rs 14 15 The subsequent interaction of IL 2 with the IL 2Rs then stimulated blastic transformation and progression through G 1 and into the S phase of the cell cycle followed by mitosis 16 Furthermore detailed studies indicated that successful activation of the IL 2R is a quantal i e all or none event that depends on surpassing a threshold of a finite number of IL 2 IL 2R interactions 13 17 18 This threshold corresponds to surpassing the restriction R point in the mid to late G 1 phase of the cell cycle first described by Pardee for serum activated fibroblasts 19 Accordingly activation of lymphocyte proliferation was realized to require at least 3 signals one delivered to the T cell via the lectin another supplied as a soluble factor by accessory macrophages and a third contributed by the IL 2 IL 2R interaction With the discovery of the T cell antigen receptor TCR in 1983 20 21 22 it was possible to demonstrate that the first signal is delivered via antigenic activation of the TCR 12 Subsequently discovery of accessory co stimulatory molecule expression by helper T cells Th revealed that activation solely of the TCR itself was insufficient to fully activate IL 2 gene expression and T cell proliferation Instead in the mid 80s it was found that the activation of co stimulatory molecules like CD28 expressed by T cells via ligands such as B7 expressed by antigen presenting cells APC deliver additional signals that synergize with those emanating from the TCR and result in maximal IL 2 gene transcription 23 As well CD28 activation stabilizes IL 2 mRNA transcripts prolonging IL 2 mRNA life span 24 Thus in addition to soluble macrophage derived products cell surface molecules expressed by APCs also contribute to the 2 ndsignal attributed to the APCs The molecules responsible for the contribution by the soluble macrophage derived LAFs still remain obscure even today Initially the nomenclature of IL 1 and IL 2 was created to delineate the sequential action of an assumed single macrophage derived soluble factor IL 1 which promoted the production of a single lymphocyte derived factor IL 2 14 15 25 However the molecular nature of the LAF activity was never fully elucidated even after the isolation and identification of multiple mitogen endotoxin stimulated macrophage derived products such as IL 1 IL 6 IL 12 IL 18 and Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha TNF It is probable that all of these macrophage derived soluble factors together make up the activity originally ascribed to LAF Accordingly it is obvious that addition of a polyclonal activating ligand such as phytohemagglutinin to peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs leads to the activation of soluble macrophage derived and lymphocyte derived activating factors and the almost simultaneous activation of multiple cell surface receptors signaling pathways and transcription factors that ultimately all contribute to lymphocyte activation Stimulation of the various receptors expressed by T cells and APCs results in the activation of distinct and also redundant signal transduction pathways and in the activation of distinct as well as redundant transcription factors Accordingly it has been assumed that triggering any of these receptors should result in the expression of distinct as well as redundant cellular genes Until recently the identification of large numbers of genes triggered by distinct ligands has been difficult owing to the cumbersome methods available for gene identification Cochran and Stiles were among the first to use differential cloning methods to identify PDGF regulated genes in fibroblasts 26 These investigators focused on the expression of immediate early PDGF stimulated genes by activating the cells in the presence of inhibitors of protein synthesis such as cycloheximide thereby preventing the expression of secondary genes Subsequently Zipfel and co workers employed subtractive hybridization to isolate and differentially clone immediate early genes activated via the T cell antigen receptor in the presence of cycloheximide 27 A total of 60 novel TCR induced immediate early genes were isolated but most were not identified at the time in that DNA cloning and sequencing methods were tedious and time consuming New differential cloning methods were developed subsequently including differential display 28 sulfhydryl labeling and affinity purification of newly synthesized transcripts 29 representational difference analysis 30 and serial analysis of gene expression 31 Each methodological advance has improved both the sensitivity of detection of differentially expressed genes as well as the speed with which the genes may be identified However the development of DNA microarray technology which allows rapid interrogation of thousands of genes and the detection of gene expression at frequencies even less than 1 in 100 000 has now greatly facilitated such experimentation 32 33 This communication represents our initial efforts to use DNA microarrays in a reductionist approach to begin to identify the genes expressed as a consequence of triggering each individual ligand during lymphocyte activation Because the IL 2 IL 2R interaction is discrete molecularly and leads to a very finite quantal decision to undergo blastic transformation DNA synthesis and mitosis we have focused our first efforts on identifying IL 2 regulated genes expressed by normal human T cells Results Detection of IL 2 regulated genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs Responses of PBMCs to IL 2 are complex involving direct effects of IL 2 on gene expression by T cells B cells and NK cells as well as secondary effects mediated by additional cytokines and transcription factors expressed by these cells in response to IL 2 To identify the maximal number of IL 2 regulated genes PBMCs comprised of 80 CD3 lymphocytes with smaller fractions of monocytes B cells and NK cells Table 1 were examined The cells were pre activated for 72 hr with anti CD3 to induce T cell IL 2 receptor expression then washed and rested for 36 40 hr prior to restimulation with IL 2 for 4 hr 16 Five independent experiments were performed with PBMCs from different donors to identify IL 2 regulated genes represented on the Affymetrix U95Av2 oligonucleotide array A comparison was made between the pre activated rested cells and those restimulated with IL 2 for 4 hr The expression levels were analyzed using DNA Chip Analyzer software 34 with normalization to the average chip signal intensity for each experiment and a 10 thpercentile value cut off for absent genes Approximately 45 of the 12 600 probe sets were detected above background Using the criterion of p 0 05 for the difference of means between the two groups a total of 316 of these 5 800 probe sets 5 4 were identified as putative IL 2 responsive genes A complete list of all IL 2 responsive genes identified in PBMCs and T cells can be found in the attached file IL 2 regulated genes Additional File 1 IL 2 target genes in human PBMCs and T cells This file contains expression data for IL 2 regulated probe sets detected on the Affymetrix U95Av2 array using samples prepared from human PBMCs and purified T cells These are the probe sets depicted in Figure 2A Click here for file Detection of PBMC genes already known to be IL 2 regulated The expression patterns of 19 genes already known to be IL 2 regulated which were represented by 25 distinct probe sets on the array were used to determine the range of expression parameters that might be most likely to identify bona fide IL 2 regulated genes Table 2 As negative controls glyceraldehyde 6 phosphate dehydrogenase GAPDH and actin were used as examples of genes that do not change expression levels under the experimental conditions used their expression levels were indeed constant without or with IL 2 treatment 1 04 0 06 and 1 06 0 01 fold change respectively By comparison the 19 selected genes showed IL 2 induced changes in expression levels ranging from 2 0 0 3 fold IL 4R probe set 404_at to 80 fold TNF 36296_at The subtractive differences in fluorescent intensity ranged from 114 20 c myb 1474_s_at to 1000 CR7 1779_s_at Four of the genes c myb CR7 flt3 ligand TNF were detected with more than one probe set and these replicates were in fairly good agreement It is worthy of note that there is not a correlation between the subtracted difference and the fold change in gene expression levels This is likely due to the fact that there is a wide range in the abundance classes of RNA transcripts derived from different genes from as few as 1 copy per cell to several thousand copies per cell 35 The signal intensity of a particular transcript detected on an oligonucleotide array would thus be directly related to this abundance level Therefore the subtracted change in signal intensity would be profoundly affected by the absolute number of cellular copies of a given transcript By comparison the fold induction is independent of absolute transcript copy number Detection of additional IL 2 responsive PBMC genes Based on the results obtained with known IL 2 target genes the criteria used to identify additional bona fide IL 2 regulated genes in these samples were set at 2 fold change with a subtracted difference in fluorescent intensity 100 and a significance level of the difference between the means of the two treatment groups of p 0 05 Of the 316 probe sets that met the standard of p 0 05 251 79 also met the additional criteria of either fold change 2 or subtracted difference 100 while only 84 probe sets 27 met all three criteria These 84 probe sets represent 72 unique genes 60 IL 2 induced genes and 12 IL 2 repressed genes that can be segregated into 8 functional groups Figure 1shows the fold induction and subtracted differences in expression levels of these probe sets Among the 4 apoptosis regulating genes bcl2 caspase 3 and DRAK2 are all induced by IL 2 while the expression of Toso is suppressed It is noteworthy that the IL 2 induction of bcl2 would be expected to promote cellular survival while the IL 2 regulation of the other three genes would be expected to promote apoptosis Additional IL 2 responsive genes include those encoding 6 cell surface proteins 11 cytokine and chemokine receptors as well as 15 signal transduction mediators 6 genes involved in cellular metabolism and biosynthesis 3 cell cycle regulators and 12 transcription factors IL 2 suppressed genes include lymphocyte antigen 9 inositol 1 4 5 trisphosphate 3 kinase B and cdc25B as well as transcriptional regulators MAX interacting protein 1 CBP p300 interacting transactivator inhibitor of DNA binding 3 Id3 glucocorticoid induced leucine zipper GILZ and zinc finger protein 36 ERF 2 All of the 19 already known IL 2 regulated genes Table 2 were also identified in this 72 gene cohort thereby yielding 53 newly identified IL 2 regulated genes expressed by PBMCs after 4 hours of IL 2 stimulation IL 2 regulated immediate early genes in T cells The PBMC populations used in our initial experiments included NK cells monocytes and B cells as well as T cells In addition cytokines including TNF TNF and flt3 ligand were induced by IL 2 as detected by the arrays so that the IL 2 effects could be mediated by the action of these intermediary cytokines on other cells in the mixed population or as well by the 12 transcriptional targets activated by IL 2 Therefore to identify the direct IL 2 targets in T cells we used CD56 depleted CD2 selected T cells which were 94 1 CD3 cells The PBMCs were pre activated with anti CD3 for 72 hr the T cells purified and rested for 36 40 hr prior to restimulation for 4 hr with 1 nM IL 2 In addition 10 g mL cycloheximide CHX was included to block protein synthesis so that only immediate early IL 2 regulated genes were detected CHX has been shown to both elevate and prolong the expression of many transiently induced transcripts 26 29 so that the 4 hr IL 2 stimulation in the presence of CHX should enable detection of genes induced within minutes as well as hours Samples from 4 independent experiments with pre activated rested cells or cells treated with CHX alone were combined for data analysis and compared to cells treated with IL 2 CHX As depicted in Figure 2A using only the criterion of significance level of p 0 05 for the difference between the means of the two groups 449 probe sets were identified as IL 2 regulated immediate early targets in the pure T cells Of these probe sets 110 were also detected in the IL 2 stimulated PBMCs As shown in Figure 2B when a second standard was included either a fold change 2 or a subtracted difference 100 161 probe sets 36 were expressed as immediately early genes in purified T cells and of these 71 were also IL 2 regulated in PBMCs However when all 3 criteria were applied Figure 2C a total of only 52 probe sets 12 were found to be immediate early IL 2 regulated genes in T cells Twenty three of these 52 probe sets were among the 84 probe sets identified previously as meeting all 3 criteria in the experiments with PBMCs Figure 3 By comparison the control genes actin and GAPDH showed 1 1 0 1 and 1 3 0 2 fold change respectively The 23 probe sets represent 20 IL 2 regulated immediate early genes Therefore only 1 3 of the genes discovered to be IL 2 regulated in PBMCs are actually immediate early direct IL 2 targets in T cells These direct IL 2 immediate early target genes included 4 genes that were suppressed DSIP GILZ the zinc finger protein 36 ERF 2 Tis11d Toso and cdc25B Notably of the 16 IL 2 induced genes we had already been identified 4 previously as IL 2 targets using differential colony hybridization CR3 CR6 CR7 CR8 29 while the 3 other known IL 2 stimulated target genes included TNF the IL 4R and the anti apoptotic gene Bcl2 Thus only 9 genes were newly identified as IL 2 induced immediate early T cell genes including the signaling proteins SLP76 and RGS1 the transcription factors IRF4 and XBP1 and 5 miscellaneous genes DKFZp586F1323 mitofilin cAMP specific phosphodiesterase 4B CMP N acetylneuraminate monooxygenase and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor In addition to the 23 probe sets in common with those identified in PBMCs 29 others were detected as IL 2 regulated immediate early targets in the purified T cells Figure 2C These probe sets met all three of the criteria of 2 fold change subtracted difference 100 and p 0 05 in T cells but were not IL 2 regulated in PBMCs These probe sets represent 27 unique genes and are presented in Figure 4 Notably only three of these were induced while the remaining 24 were all suppressed in response to IL 2 CHX Of the remaining 61 probe sets identified in PBMCs Figure 2C 31 showed changes in expression levels in T cells with p 0 05 although either the fold change was less than 2 0 or the magnitude of the change was less than 100 Table 3 These 31 probe sets are derived from 27 unique genes and most likely represent bona fide IL 2 targets since the group includes the genes JAB SSI 1 SOCS 1 flt3 ligand IL 2Rp55 caspase 3 and p78 which have already been reported as IL 2 induced genes If these genes are also included 47 of the 72 unique genes 65 identified in PBMCs are IL 2 regulated immediate early genes in pure T cells Similarly of the 29 probe sets identified as meeting all 3 criteria only in pure T cells 7 showed differences in expression with p 0 05 in PBMCs Table 4 These include linker for activation of T cells T cell specific transcription factor 7 STAT4 IL 7R PAS ser thr kinase l mfa domain containing protein and an unknown gene designated DKFZp586D1122 Notably all of the other genes 22 were suppressed by IL 2 in the PBMCs as they were in the T cells although they did not meet the significance value of p 0 05 in the PBMCs Discussion Lymphocyte activation is initiated by specific antigen receptor interactions and aided by accessory molecules However subsequently cytokine and cytokine receptor expression ensue and the cytokines ultimately drive the clonal expansion and functional differentiation of the antigen selected lymphocyte populations IL 2 was initially identified by virtue of its T cell growth factor activity and IL 2 is now recognized as the pivotal cytokine in promoting mature peripheral T cell proliferation 36 37 Therefore to initiate the identification of the genes responsible for lymphocyte activation we chose first to delineate the genetic mechanisms of IL 2 action Using oligonucleotide arrays of known genes to identify IL 2 regulated genes in human lymphocytes a total of 72 unique genes were found to change expression within 4 hr of IL 2 stimulation of PBMCs These genes could be segregated into functional groups including cell surface proteins cytokine and chemokine receptors as well as signal transduction mediators cytokines genes involved in cellular metabolism and biosynthesis cell cycle regulators and transcription factors In order to define the criteria that we used to sort the microarray data in this series of experiments we were able to take advantage of previous reports of 19 known IL 2 regulated genes By assessing the characteristics of the changes in expression of these known IL 2 targets we were able to define a range of both fold induction and subtracted difference that encompassed all of these genes When applied to the total data set these criteria were likely to identify additional meaningful IL 2 regulated genes Since 19 of these genes had already been reported to be IL 2 induced genes our DNA array experiments identified 53 additional IL 2 regulated genes expressed by PBMCs However only 20 of these genes were found to be IL 2 regulated immediate early T cell genes It is important to discriminate these results from other analyses of T cell activation that have employed antigen receptor activation as opposed to IL 2 The TCR and IL 2 receptors activate some shared signaling pathways such as the Ras Raf MAP kinase and PI 3 kinase pathways 38 However there are differences such as the Jak Stat pathway which is unique to the cytokines 39 and the Ca Calcineurin pathway which is activated by the TCR These signaling pathways culminate in the activation of specific transcription factors so that there must be both shared target genes as well as genes unique to antigen or IL 2 signaling As TCR signaling induces the expression of IL 2 as well as other cytokines and their receptors the ultimate T cell response is an amalgam of both antigen and cytokine receptor triggered events This point is well illustrated by the report of Teague et al 40 who used microarrays to identify murine T cell genes induced in vivo by SEB stimulation after 8 and 48 hours Again cytokine and cytokine receptor genes were induced during these time intervals so that the entire spectrum of genes identified included both antigen and accessory molecule activated as well as cytokine regulated targets Similarly Ellisen et al 41 used DNA arrays to monitor ConA induced genes in human T lymphocytes over a time scale ranging from 4 to 48 hours Inducible genes included IL 2 and TNF as well as the IL 1R IL 2R and IL 4R Thus at the time points used in this study many of the genes detected were likely regulated by these cytokines as well as Con A In a similar vein Herblot et al 42 used a subtractive approach to identify 66 genes induced by IL 2 but not IL 4 in a murine T cell line They further demonstrated that while in vitro ConA could induce expression of the IL 2 target genes in T cells from IL 2 mice the genes were not induced by ConA treatment of T cells from IL 2 mice Thus ConA induces IL 2 and IL 2R expression and the cytokine drives expression of additional specific target genes Recently Riley et al 43 and Diehn et al 44 described genes regulated by the TCR and the costimulatory receptors CD28 ICOS and CTLA 4 over a time course of 1 48 hours Once again numerous cytokines including IL 2 are strongly induced within 2 hr such that a number of the observed regulated genes are likely cytokine responsive targets Finally Gonzalez et al 45 have described murine genes induced after 8 hr IL 2 stimulation which likely include direct targets of IL 2 as well as genes induced via IL 2 regulated cytokines Therefore to discriminate between the distinct genes induced by each ligand that contributes to the overall response initiated by antigenic stimulation it is important to use cycloheximide to identify immediate early genes regulated by the TCR and costimulatory receptors vs IL 2 In addition the genes activated by TCR costimulatory receptors and IL 2 must be distinguished from those activated by IL 1 IL 6 IL 12 and TNF as well as the genes regulated by the Toll like receptors TLR all of which have been identified as mediators of lymphocyte activation events that were previously ascribed to LAF Moreover as IL 2 itself induces the expression of numerous cytokines and receptors it is important to discriminate the direct IL 2 targets from those induced secondarily through these intermediaries Thus it is worthy of re emphasis that of the 72 genes regulated by IL 2 in PBMCs only 20 were found to be bona fide IL 2 regulated immediate early genes in purified T cells In addition to imparting positive activating signals that result in cell cycle progression IL 2 has also been found to promote negative feedback phenomena Thus it is especially intriguing that IL 2 suppresses the expression of many genes both among PBMCs in the absence of CHX as well as in purified T cells in the presence of CHX The suppression of the expression of these genes may well be important in mediating the feedback down regulatory phenomena The high affinity IL 2 receptor is comprised of three subunits and 46 47 The chain is specific to IL 2 while the chain is shared among IL 4 IL 7 IL 9 IL 15 and IL 21 48 The chain of the IL 2R is also a component of the IL 15 receptor in conjunction with a specific IL 15R chain 49 The sharing of these receptors by multiple cytokines raises the question of how the ligands can trigger specific responses in the target cells Several signaling events including the activation of Jak kinases 1 and 3 are shared among the common chain cytokines 50 Other signaling events such as the activation of Shc Gab2 SHP 2 and MAPK are shared among IL 2 and 15 but not the other common chain cytokine receptors and Tyr 388 of IL 2R appears critical for these events 51 Despite these signaling similarities it is clear that the biological properties of IL 2 are unique among the common chain cytokines as the other cytokines cannot compensate for IL 2 in the IL 2 knockout mouse 52 In addition IL 15 appears uniquely critical for the development of NK cells as evidenced by the phenotypes of IL 15 53 and IL 15R 54 deficient mice Thus there must be a means whereby IL 2 and IL 15 as well as the other common chain cytokines trigger distinct intracellular signaling pathways and target genes Therefore identification of each of the cytokine specific target genes should shed light on the issue of specificity amongst the common chain cytokines Complete classification of the genes expressed as a consequence of distinct ligand receptor interactions during lymphocyte activation will also provide a powerful tool for the assessment and treatment of immunological disorders 55 In addition to defining the target genes of specific cytokines and cell surface ligands it is possible to further subdivide the genes based on the specific signaling proteins and transcription factors that govern their expression For example through the use of STAT5 mice Ihle et al have been able to identify those IL 2 target genes that require STAT5 56 57 Similar approaches with mutant signaling proteins knockouts or over expression systems enable such dissection of the signal transduction pathways leading to specific target genes Thus each ligand receptor pair will ultimately be linked to a specific signature of target genes derived from the signaling pathways and transcription factors activated Such information will be invaluable in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders involving aberrancies in these pathways Conclusions The rapidity with which lymphocyte activation genes may now be identified using the methods described in this report opens the way to a molecular genetic definition of the immune response based upon the categorization of the genes regulated by distinct ligand receptor pairs Consequently more precise genetic and molecular diagnoses of immune disorders will soon become available and hopefully new treatment regimes may be developed to target the specific molecular nature of each disease Materials and Methods Cell culture Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC were purified from venous blood of healthy donors by density centrifugation over Histopaque 1 077 Sigma Cells were cultured in RPMI1640 10 FCS at a density of 1 10 6cells ml and activated with anti CD3 OKT3 1 500 Ortho Diagnostics After 72 hr activation PBMC were washed and replaced in culture without stimulation for 36 40 hr prior to restimulation with 1 nM IL 2 16 To purify T lymphocytes 72 hr OKT3 activated PBMC were depleted of CD56 and

Analyzer software 34 58 Gene expression values were normalized to the average chip signal intensity for each experiment and a 10 thpercentile value cut off was used for absent genes that did not give signals significantly greater than background To calculate IL 2 induced gene expression changes the subtracted difference values were determined by subtracting the signal intensity of untreated samples from the values of IL 2 treated samples The fold difference was calculated as IL 2 treated untreated Standard errors were derived from 5 independent PBMC experiments and 4 experiments with purified T cells The average of the standard errors relative to the mean expression values SE mean signal intensity 100 was 22 for untreated and 15 for IL 2 stimulated PBMCs and 16 and 19 for the unstimulated and IL 2 treated purified T cell samples respectively The p values were determined by testing whether the absolute difference between treatment group means is not zero by unpaired t test
