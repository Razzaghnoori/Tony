 Braver New World Are we in Aldous Huxley s Brave New World already I suppose that many people who watched the TV version of Huxley s novel NBC April 19 1998 must have asked themselves this question Huxley visualized a society in which the population except for the few masters is kept under control not by fear of punishment but through the reinforcement of desirable behavior by rewards and the non violent manipulation of the environment and of the thoughts and feelings of individual men women and children In the novel everyone has free access to an unlimited supply of a drug soma that induces a feeling of happiness People are constantly brainwashed with the thought that they deserve to be happy Sex is readily available without complications Babies are produced in vats There is no love between individuals no families no devotion to anyone or anything to compete with devotion to the State All this brings up thoughts of Prozac and Viagra the sexual revolution the constant bombardment of product advertising and the political imposition of spin on every issue Hence the question Are we there already When Huxley wrote his book published in 1932 he placed the Brave New World in the 25 th century But in 1958 he wrote a little book called Brave New World Revisited in which he expressed the thought that we were getting there much sooner than he had earlier imagined and that indeed we would be far into it by the end of the 20 th century He advised his readers to read that book against a background of thoughts about the Hungarian uprising of 1956 and its repression Two forces led Huxley to advance the date at which his society would arrive They were population and technology He foresaw that the world s population would increase enormously by the end of this century He thought that the great increase in population would cause economic misery around the world creating the need for a dictatorship to maintain order and control future population growth Technological change would require the concentration of production in the hands of huge institutions controlled either by Big Business or by Big Government Within these institutions the technology would require workers to perform more and more as robots But the main contribution of advancing technology to Huxley s world was the facility it provided for manipulating the minds of the population Television would greatly enhance the ability of the authorities to bring their message constantly into every home Little newspapers and magazines with dissenting opinions could not survive economically The population would be constantly immersed in soap operas and sports on television effectively diverted from any thinking about society Mind altering drugs would be increasingly available cheap and without dangerous side effects In 1958 Huxley saw all this already happening or just around the corner What he would say today we cannot know He died in 1963 But it seems to me that the main lesson or at least one of the main lessons from Huxley s 1958 essay is how wrong a brilliant mind can be He was right about the growth of population But that growth did not produce an economic crisis with incomes declining and government control needed to maintain order World per capita income is higher than ever and still rising In what were the two most populous poor countries China and India the improvement in the economic conditions of life has been especially noticeable This improvement of economic conditions was not brought about by an increase of centralized control Government control of economies is diminishing everywhere The greatest economic crisis since Huxley wrote occurred in the most controlled state the Soviet Union and led to the dismantling of controls Moreover technological change did not lead to a centralization of production in a few giant institutions The trend has been the reverse Improved information technology has facilitated the efficient interaction of independent units through the market without central control And technology has not changed workers into robots On the contrary technology has created mechanical robots and calls upon human beings to do what robots cannot do The centralized manipulation of human minds through modern media that Huxley predicted and feared is not happening either He did not foresee cable television let alone the Internet People have access to more varied sources of information than ever before Moreover television is turning out to be an ineffective medium for influencing human emotions Huxley describes the rousing effect that Hitler could have on a hundred thousand Germans listening to him in person in moonlight in an amphitheater If he had delivered the same speeches on television to millions of people sitting at home in groups of two or three eating popcorn getting up to go to the bathroom and channel surfing with their remote control the effect would have been very small Certainly TV exposure of our great authorities has not increased respect for them or our willingness to follow their lead And the effect of advertising which concerned Huxley greatly as an instrument that a dictator might use has turned out to be trivial We may buy red or black cars rather than green or brown ones because of television but we don t buy cars because of television The use of mind altering drugs has probably increased as Huxley foresaw although probably not to the extent that he foresaw He thought that the use of these drugs would make the population indifferent and willing to accept control by political leaders But first there would have to be seizure of control by some group that was not indifferent Today we neither have such a group nor the atmosphere for its emergence Of course we do have people who want to be in office but once in office they don t want to be in control Anyway what causes indifference to politics today is not drugs but politics which seems less and less relevant to our lives There is a trick in Huxley s argument that makes it difficult to refute Unlike the people in the Gulag Archipelago the masses in Huxley s world do not know they are not free They have been drugged and brainwashed into thinking that they are doing exactly what they want not what some dictator wants them to do So if we say that we are free how can we prove that we have not been programmed to say that by a Master who is manipulating us into thinking that Perhaps he put soma into our drinking water There is however an answer to that The masters of the Brave New World would not allow a movie version of Brave New World to be shown on television The movie reveals what such a society could be like and what a horror it would be The heroes of the movie are a man and woman who escape the system with their baby and are going to live like a traditional family As long as Brave New World is shown on television we will know we are not in it I describe the Brave New World as a horror and Huxley thought of it as that also He was writing a warning not a prescription There may be people who do not look upon it as horrible It is a society in which every want is fulfilled But as Professor Frank H Knight used to say what people want is not only to have their wants fulfilled but also to have better wants People in the Brave New World satisfy the wants they have but are prevented from having some good wants like want for love and family and deprived of the opportunity to reach for new and better wants
