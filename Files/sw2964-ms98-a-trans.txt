                what do you think about gun control   well uh i am probably uh closer to being a what is it the ten is on the end of uh no gun control   uhhuh   i guess i am probably closer to a ten than a one i believe i am uh i am not opposed at all to having a waiting period for you know for the purchase of guns   yeah   uh i think that is appropriate uh a background check on people that uh  excuse me especially especially people that buy handguns   umhum   uh but  i believe that uh you know the Constitution gives uh the individual the right to own firearms for you know for their whatever their own purposes are as long as they are legal purposes and uh i am opposed to anything that would limit what the Constitution allows   yeah and i i think i think that is right uh the only thing i object to is like uh machine guns   yeah i i i uh i agree with that uh although i can i can see where there might be even be a a potential uh sometime you know a need sometime in the future for the individuals to have   yeah   uh even machine guns available uh you know if if we were ever invaded of course now that is pretty far fetched but if the United States were ever invaded i think that the man on the street is going have to be the one to defend the country at some point or or might have to at some point and uh i think that there should be uh sufficient sufficient uh guns and you know and ammunition and things available for that   do you think um like Reagan of course before that you know he was in westerns all that all that time and and uh he was real gung ho And then  then just now just this last year it seems like hes he was uh and he was not that bill does not restrict anything outside of just having to wait seven days but   right   it is interesting that he turned around for some reason   yeah well i i always wondered you know why he was so adamant about you know about being opposed to that waiting period     umhum   uh you know even before i mean you know i i did not see that the waiting period was a you know it was a major restriction   umhum       i think and i think a lot of times you know that uh criminals do not go out and buy a   excuse me   what uh uh a good gun costs like two hundred to five hundred dollars   umhum   you know a handgun they go out and buy the cheapest thing they can   right   and and then they go rob a liquor store or something   yeah and uh plus you know  i guess my opinion is that if uh if a uh criminal or somebody with criminal intent real criminal intent wants a gun they are going to get one   yeah that is true   uh the drug dealer is not going to you know hes not going to wait the seven days for a gun anyway   right   so it is it is only the actually it is only the  the uh the people that are trying to be uh law abiding people are the ones that are going to wind up being able to get the guns legally   umhum   uh you know after even with the waiting period and i you know i cannot see that uh that there is anybody that that does not have criminal intent that would have uh any reason to object to that waiting period that is   umhum that is right and a lot of times like um what is his name i cant remember his name right the guy in the Austin tower uh Whitman   yeah Whitman   you know he was sane and and i guess they could have said like Lee Harvey Oswald Oswald was sane when he bought his gun you know but he bought his by mail anyway   umhum   but later on you know something can happen they can they can have a brain tumor or they can break down one way or another   right well uh you know Hinckley was the one that took the shot at Reagan and uh he bought his gun at a pawn shop here in Dallas i think or somewhere in the Dallas area   right umhum   and you know if if hed had to have a waiting period he didnt stay in Dallas long enough uh at that time to have waited the seven days   right   so if if thered been a waiting period he wouldnt have had the gun uh or a least he wouldnt have had that gun he mightve had another one   yeah he might have   but uh you know so i you know i can see that there are are reasons for having a waiting period that uh i think that anybody that you know anybody that does not have a a criminal background or you know any any real reason to not allow them to have one i think that anybody that wants one should be able to buy one   umhum   thats interesting because i dont own one  though i dont own a gun but thats you know thats my personal opinion anyway   yeah    yeah i do not either yeah that is true because you know once once they start clamping down on one thing or being against one group then the   it gives them a foothold to to be against somebody else   right   and uh and the hunters you know the hunters uh with what game species there are left well especially i mean using a rifle white tail deers mostly   right   you know that is what people hunt for the most with a rifle uh you know they have every right to have a a rifle and be able to to hunt   right you know they rifles and shotguns for you know for like you say for deer hunting and for bird hunting are you know that is kind of the the American way so to speak   umhum and that um i think it was a rifle that that kid shot that burglar with in Arlington or wherever it was   uh   yes i think its two years ago or so now   yeah i believe it was yeah uh there was a a uh deal on television just uh i saw it uh yesterday or the day before where there was an an Oriental shopkeeper in California i think it was in San Bernardino California   you know umhum   That there were five young guys they were gang members that came in to rob his store and they all had guns and he had a gun somewhere under the counter that he got and he shot all five of those killed two of them but you know he he was really blazing away   yeah i wondered how he managed that   and uh i think he got shot twice himself and uh but he was okay you know it was just he was injured but not seriously apparently   umhum   but uh you know it was really surprising but it was good you know  from my point of view it was good to see him being able to defend him you know his his property and his store   exactly   and uh you know i i think that is you know that is the intent of the Constitution is to of that part of the Constitution is to allow people to defend themselves and their property   umhum and and more and more of that kind of thing happens i mean can you imagine i mean it used to be like with the dapper bandit is one guy you know   umhum   with a gun and a a lot of the stuff that he did they did not publicize because that it would breach the security of the rest of the banks the banks   right   one of the things that he did is is um any counter top that was there up to maybe like four feet high he could vertical jump on top of the counter top and and jump down and and be   umhum   with those people behind the counter before they knew it   right   you know and they they showed us a piece of tape of that one time but it looked like they had cut it up some and that was one of the things that was so scary about him     right   and not only did he he um rob banks but he uh at the time when he first started he robbed the Safeway that my brother was working at at the time  and that is how he that is how he surprised the cashier he jumped he jumped back there with her and and you know there was nothing  she could do by that time   umhum i had i had not heard about him robbing the Safeway   yeah   but then there is also there is the uh what is his name Bernie Getz   umhum   the in the New York subway i guess uh well i would have  even mixed emotions about him uh somebody carrying a gun you know out into the public on public transportation   right   uh you know of course he was his the purpose of him having the gun was to defend himself because he apparently he had felt threatened you know on the on the subway before   umhum   but uh i am not sure that uh the private citizen carrying a gun is you know just the routine private citizen carrying a gun   umhum   is uh necessary to   yeah i would   i mean if you are not if you are not uh in a position where you have to defend yourself you know uh in a routine basis then uh perhaps carrying a gun on your person is not uh is not all that advisable   yeah and then   uh i know that they are talking about here you know here in Texas about having a new gun law that would allow certain certain individuals to be licensed to carry a gun   umhum   and uh i think they ought take a long a good long hard look at at who is allowed to carry a gun in those you know in those situations   yeah right like the the judge what was it two or three months ago the judge in uh Fort Worth i think maybe it was Dallas but he  he just convicted uh a man for murder and the guy jumped up and and apparently knew where the judge kept his gun   umhum   and held it on him for a couple of hours you know and   right   he should he should either have kept it fairly well concealed or kept it a secret   right you know i guess that i do not really know uh i i guess there is not really a you know a lot to say from my point of view except that you know the the Constitution says what kind of rights we have and i do not i really do not see the the point
