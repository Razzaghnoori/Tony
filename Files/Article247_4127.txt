 George W Wobbles but He Doesn t Fall Down Prudie Even if you re not an Oil of Olay model and I find that hard to believe I would hope that you would never be caught farther than 15 feet from a Town Car Tomorrow I hope to return to the subjects of divorce and manners and models But this installment of the Breakfast Table is more like a nightcap Tonight s post debate spin session spilled over into the hotel bar and that s where I am just returning from So forgive me if I am sparing in my recounting of the action Most top drawer political reporters decided to sit this debate out For this I am thankful Campaign advisers desperate to spin had nobody else to chat up Of course dear Prudie it would have been far more pleasurable to be sitting in my hotel room and dashing off mail to you There seemed a consensus to which even W s advisers couldn t really refute with a straight face Bush looked truly wobbly Not that he did himself any sort of long term damage But he seemed to be unsure with his responses And the audience penalized him for it As he coughed out answers or recycled lines from the stump speech some of the Nice Republicans of Arizona actually laughed The press watching the debate on TV in a remote location weren t so kind A final note The candidates worked like hell to avoid engaging Alan Keyes in conflict and conversation This seemed to piss him off even more Afterward he was heard muttering something about being an invisible man Regards Massa Frank
