party thrown by a friend at her loft She s a lawyer and I m a semi starving artist At one point in the evening I stood up from her couch and an end cushion fell to the floor knocking a full glass of red wine onto her Persian rug It was my roommate semi starving artist as well who had set the wineglass on the floor We were both apologetic and the hostess seems to have forgiven us but Prudence 1 What s the best way to try removing the stain 2 What s the best way for me and my roomie to make amends Butterfingers Dear Butt Prudie is not a dry cleaner Had we by some mysterious mechanism been in touch the moment after the spill Prudie would have told you something she just happens to know Pouring white wine on red wine is the antidote But this only works immediately after the calamity Alas Prudie is as up in the air as you Do offer to pay for the rug to be cleaned at the finest rug cleaner you can rustle up If the lawyer hostess declines then send lovely flowers If she tells you everything s fine and only a faint hint of color remains suggest she tell friends the Persian weavers were famously big drinkers Prudie spotlessly Dear Prudie My best friend was married two years ago and I was his best man I was somewhat lazy in procuring a gift and in the intervening time my friend has got a divorce and is soon to be remarried He tells me that I need to double up on his gift What do you think is the proper protocol for this situation Richard Vagge Los Angeles Dear Rich Prudie is so busy sputtering she hopes she can type Your friend the groom is way out of line Double up indeed Why don t you respond that in the infinite wisdom of your procrastination you somehow divined the marriage would be a dud and you think you will give this one a similar two year trial period Prudie archly Dear Prudie I have but one living relative a female first cousin Her son has three children The girl has just finished college and married During her time in college I contributed 40 000 to the family most of it for her tuition The older of the two boys is now in college and the second will enter in the fall His father wants me to give him 50 000 net to cover a portion of his tuition fee of 21 000 annually by giving him stock to that amount plus what he estimates will be his tax liability on the gift It will amount to about a third of my remaining nest egg most went to my university as a planned gift for which I get a quarterly dividend Recently I bought insurance annual premium 11 000 plus that supposedly will pay nursing home care after Social Security and employers insurance coverage are exhausted I am 84 in reasonably good health and my cousin will get the estate after inheritance taxes My friends say don t do it and I am of the same opinion What do you think Old and Tired of Hassle Dear Old The beneficiary family seems to be proving the old adage No good deed goes unpunished You were most generous to your cousin s daughter Prudie imagines the gift was your idea To be asked for more and a particular amount yet seems grasping Prudie might point out that the group to which you refer is also not immediate family Security for the rest of your life certainly comes before anything else Discussion closed Prudie assuredly Dear Prudie I am a single woman and I frequent a chichi coffee shop near my home This establishment provides four bistro tables which obviously fill up quickly on weekends It is my habit to enjoy my coffee pastry and Sunday paper in the shop when it first opens and to leave as the crowds begin to come in This Sunday as I was poring over my outspread paper an older woman came over to me and said Would you mind if three of us joined you at this table As I silently looked up at her she demurred Or would you rather read your paper I asserted that I would rather indeed but added that I d soon be packing up Prudie I think you would agree that most of us linger over coffee within reason Lately though a young man has also begun to frequent the shop so singles occupy two of the four tables I m afraid he appears not to be the type I would approach to suggest sharing a table though this issue is not under my control as he comes in shortly after I do If you were I what would be your policy here Kick Me Northwest of Boston Dear Kick Prudie s instinct is yours An unknown threesome would not be the group with whom I d want to share Sunday breakfast As for the young man however here s what you do Alter your time a bit or hide behind a lamppost allowing the single gentleman to enter first Then you come in notice he s by himself and ask if he is inclined to have you at his table so that two singles will not occupy half of the available tables If he is welcoming that means you guessed wrong about his approachability If he declines your overture you will have definitive information that the Coffee Shop Man holds no possibilities and you can go back to the Sunday papers Prudie strategically
