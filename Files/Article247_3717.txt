 Public Funding of Art Received last night Dear Ester Alas this is my second attempt to respond to your last message Apparently I was writing to slowly for my service provider It inquired whether I wanted to stay online and despite my assurance that I did I was promptly disconnected losing my draft in the process What I was writing about was your initial discussion of art and funding as represented by the Brooklyn Museum dispute Frankly I sidestepped the issue because I am of a very mixed mind about the whole thing On the one hand I treasure the principle that artists should be able to express themselves in relatively unrestrained fashion On the other I have concern about public funding of art I am uncertain about the extent to which public funds should be used to fund art whether that art be kitsch or politically controversial statements Likewise I am perplexed by public funding of churches to provide certain kinds of social or other kinds of public services In each case my concern is not just on the impact on the public or public policy but also about the impact on artists or the church Is it possible that the public funding of art or church social services or schooling has a deleterious impact on their integrity Moreover should the state be funding activities that the general public finds offensive or services that compete with public services As I noted above I find myself really quite confused in each case School vouchers alternative schools charter schools and church schools all compete with public schools and probably challenge public schools to improve Moreover such school programs offer the working class and the poor the same opportunities that the wealthy have to send their children to alternative schools Yet it is fair to ask whether the diversion of public funds from public schools weakens and further threatens what was once a powerful institution of upward mobility for the poor and immigrants I guess that pushed to the wall I would choose school choice if only because schools have suffered from the same kind of stifling bureaucratic climate that has so hindered so many public services Yet So as you note this is an awfully late breakfast Tomorrow my response will be at breakfast Be well George
