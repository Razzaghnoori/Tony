 Drop the Big One Memo to Bob Shrum Your candidate Al Gore needs to strangle the baby in the bath that is crush Bill Bradley in both the Iowa caucuses next Monday and the New Hampshire primary eight days later If Bradley gets into the open field of the post New Hampshire contests he ll surely deplete your campaign treasury and he might just win Unfortunately the latest polls from New Hampshire are all over the lot The CBS and Newsweek polls show you ahead the University of Massachusetts poll shows Bradley beating you by 10 points Other polls show a virtual tie As you know New Hampshire voters can shift en masse in the final few days before the primary ask Walter Mondale This year they may be inclined to vote for Bradley to keep the contest going and prevent you from wrapping it up It looks pretty iffy Which is why sincerely I hope you re busy finishing up the 30 second ads that can destroy Bradley in New Hampshire the ones highlighting his 1996 vote against welfare reform Remember the poll last fall that showed 38 percent of Democrats let alone the all important independents thought less of Bradley when told of his welfare vote That was twice as many as thought better of him The welfare spots don t have to be harsh or anti left They can be uplifting Ex welfare mothers going to work earning income gaining respect and Bill Bradley voted against it Bad man Keep the ads in the can and drop them on Bradley starting Jan 25 the day after all those liberal activists in the Iowa caucuses have had their say Jeffrey Toobin Hypocrite Part II In his book Vast Conspiracy you ll recall New Yorker writer Jeffrey Toobin denounces sexual investigative reporting as tawdry voyeurism and sleaze But that doesn t prevent him from recounting on Page 53 the allegation of one Dennis Kirkland that Paula Jones gave him a blow job and that he d seen her giving blow jobs to three of his friends whom he named Is that really relevant Well maybe it is What s inexcusable is that Toobin waits 100 pages to mention that a Kirkland is a convicted forger who b had had five six seven eight even beers the night in question and c hadn t actually seen Jones give the serial blow jobs to his friends Simple fairness should have suggested that Toobin at least hint strongly during his initial presentation of Kirkland s tale that it was uncorroborated and would later prove a problem for Clinton s lawyers Toobin could easily have done that while preserving narrative suspense He might also have mentioned that none of Kirkland s friends backed up the allegations But then actually checking out and evaluating a story like that is sexual investigative reporting isn t it Plotting the Perfect Kausfiles Vacation Kausfiles is always willing to follow the innovative lead of its fellow
