 The Poverty of Electoral Politics A difference between you and me that transcends right vs left is that you take electoral politics more seriously than I Democrats vs Republicans is a politics of small differences at this point The country is basically being run by global corporations that aside from their direct economic influence on who gets elected and what they do when they get elected a large aside control economic policy by essentially saying to politicians on all levels federal state and local give us fiscal austerity low taxes and less regulation or we a will take our jobs elsewhere and b won t lend you money In general I prefer Democrats because they re not beholden to the Christian right and the anti abortion movement they re less likely to make totally Neanderthal court appointments etc But even on social issues there s more convergence than not Clinton is one of the more anti civil libertarian presidents in modern history Both parties support the drug war and its attendant police state apparatus no knock raids forfeiture of property of people who haven t been convicted of anything Draconian sentences peeing on command as a requirement for getting or holding jobs etc the latest thing is they want to inflict on Florida a genetically engineered fungus that s supposed to kill marijuana plants although no one can guarantee it won t be an ecological disaster these people are crazy Both parties want to censor the media The don t ask don t tell approach to gays in the military has only encouraged sexual witch hunts Then there s welfare reform whose two basic assumptions are that endless work at wages too meager to live on is morally uplifting and that single mothers are causing all of society s problems The bottom line probably not my best metaphor in this context is the success of the corporate elite and free market ideologues in pushing the end of history idea that in a post Communist world there is no alternative to our present economic and social system like it or not This is a colossal failure of imagination It s true enough that it s very difficult right now to envision what that alternative might be I certainly have no blueprints to offer But there have always been people who argued that change is impossible or unnecessary or both and they have always been wrong It seems to me that this idea that what is simply is period is paralyzing on a cultural as well as a political level I didn t mean to imply that there is really a counterculture now in the sense of any conscious collective opposition You re right there s nothing comparable to the cultural radicalism of the 60s and 70s And certainly not much interest in politics I think most people these days see politics as pretty trivial and irrelevant to their lives What I see in among other things techno is a countercultural impulse an implicit desire for something different Am I sounding too much like Greil again Mostly I don t see that young people have any sense that things can be different so the desire stays under the surface I think school massacres and teen age girls killing their infants are ultimately about despair and fatalism Keeping kids out of R rated movies is not going to help What did you think about the Columbine shooting and the public reaction I d be interested in your take OK onto somewhat less grim terrain Magazines You have to understand that my standards for a really good magazine are still New York and Esquire in the 60s and Rolling Stone in the 70s This is a recipe for total frustration on the contemporary magazine front Never mind favorite What are the magazines I look forward to reading First I guess would be Commentary believe it or not especially the letters section Then Atlantic I like to read the cover essays I like Lingua Franca but for whatever reason I let my subscription lapse So I guess it comes down to the Nation which provides much of my material for all my arguments with the mainstream left
