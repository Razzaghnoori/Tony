 The Midas Touch I had a great time with the tremendously entertaining New New Thing and it has taught me a lot You ve been following Silicon Valley for some time I ve mostly been living in the 19 th century with J P Morgan for the past 15 years and keeping up only from a distance with what one of Lewis characters calls the greatest legal creation of wealth in the history of the planet So Lewis account of the wild and uncannily shrewd Jim Clark is among other things a terrific introduction to the ongoing revolution in information technology to its transformation of the U S economy and to the gold rush combination of optimism and insanity in the current marketplace for Internet ideas Just for the record Clark founded Silicon Graphics Netscape and then Healtheon which you ve already mentioned and this spring he was worth 3 2 billion I ve been tempted to characterize him as the Dennis Rodman of Silicon Valley but his scoring record is closer to Jordan s Like you I found a number of annoying and frustrating things in the book but I ll talk about the good parts first Lewis has such a fantastic eye for funny telling moments that he often doesn t have to tell much around them such as that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas saw the possibilities of three dimensional computer graphics Clark s first Big Idea long before Lockheed or IBM did Or the sense of technological magic that drew other brilliant engineers to Clark Jim was building the coolest stuff says one You wanted to be around just to see what was going to happen next Also not everything Clark touched turned to gold and Lewis enhances the drama by showing the mistakes At a 1990 conference Clark predicted that personal computing would link up with personal communications once the PC became fun to use for instance through computer games like Nintendo That was wrong the games part but as Lewis observes he was groping toward a mass market It is amazing to think of 1990 as ancient history and to watch these guys groping toward what we know will become the Internet Next Clark thought that the new new thing would be linking the computer to television and got Time Warner to put up millions to build interactive TV Other major corporations jumped on the bandwagon billions of dollars followed Clark s best engineers put months of 18 hour days into the project but Clark lost interest and turned his attention to a piece of software called Mosaic that enabled its users to travel around the Internet With the help of Mosaic s young designer he set up what became Netscape The herd as Lewis puts it had followed Clark into ITV while Clark headed off in a new direction It was one of the greatest unintentional head fakes in the history of technology There s lots more that s good in here but we ve got two more days to talk about it and I want to answer some of your questions and outline some of my own reservations Yes I think it s possible that Lewis has too much talent for his own good He s in fact so deft with the telling incident that he doesn t bother to fill in facts you really want to know I did notice that he never explains what Healtheon is going to do which contributes to the hilarity of the scene in which the venture capitalists and Wall Street wizards throw money at Clark because they re terrified of missing out on the new new thing Lewis attitude here seems to mirror Clark s once the deal is done and the IPO billions have been made it doesn t matter what the company is or does Whatever Well it would be useful to know how or if Healtheon is actually going to fix the U S health care system and take control of a 1 5 trillion industry About the amount of time Lewis spends on Clark s 155 foot though sometimes it s 157 foot computerized sailboat I thought it was fun to read but too much The boat story nicely emphasizes the idea of Clark s lust for grandiose risk and sets up a neat contest between computer engineering and real world engineering in this context real world wins so far And there s a funny moment halfway across the Atlantic when the captain gets the news by computer that Home has just bought Excite and the crew goes on about stocks and taxes the way the athletes in those Schwab ads currently on TV talk about p e ratios But there is too much boat stuff and though as always with Lewis it s very well written it feels like filler Substantive reflections on history and on Clark s character might have been a better use for some of these pages but I m running out of space here so I ll continue with those thoughts tomorrow Sometime before we end this conversation I d love to know what you make of Clark s latest idea to create a cartel of high net worth individuals and engage in billionaire collective bargaining
