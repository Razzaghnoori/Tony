 Skip West Wing Watch Roswell The network premiere of the evening is NBC s The West Wing 9 p m but Culturebox suggests that come October 6th you spin your dial to the WB s Roswell 9 p m instead Here s proof that hybridization can succeed Generically Roswell is the spawn of The X Files and Dawson s Creek but the first episode at least has more charm than both It s the story of two teen agers of course it s on the WB She s a normal girl who fears she looks like a freak she doesn t he s an alien boy who looks like the kind of shy dreamboat a girl could get a crush on he is Girl who has waitress job takes hit from passing bullet in coffee shop altercation boy who has special powers heals her with his unearthly touch This prompts the revelation of his ancestry he descended to earth as an incubating fetus in Roswell s notorious 1947 alien spaceship crash the suspicions of a grim faced local sheriff and of course a star crossed romance According to Entertainment Weekly Roswell s creators an X Files director and a My So Called Life writer originally offered it to Fox which demanded changes and planned to launch it mid season They then took it to the WB which put it in the best slot of the week immediately after Dawson s Creek Once again the WB has demonstrated its superior programming abilites Roswell s Liz Siri Appleby and Max Jason Behr are fine tuned combinations of poise awkwardness and eloquence The hunger on the alien Max s face when he looks at the forbidden Liz is as raw yet sublimated as James Dean s displaced homoeroticism When Liz processes the facts of Max s non humanity the scene lasts a minute or two an eternity in TV time in order to register her sequence of expressions incredulity hilarity disgust at the cheesiness of the whole idea terror longing But what makes the show endearing is the tone matter of fact in the manner of Buffy you feel alien You are alien yet with a lighter touch Roswell s writers have clearly studied their teen romantic comedy history and understand that an adequate representation of the teen condition requires the presence of well meaning but oppressive adults and friends who try and try but just don t get it but also an absence of condescension Ignore the naysayers who will complain as they do about Dawson s Creek and Felicity that teens don t talk like that that they lack such advanced powers of introspection Teens never talked the way Romeo and Juliet do or agonized as deeply and who takes their creator to task for that
