 Background The proto oncogene TEL Translocation Ets Leukemia is a transcriptional repressor that contains a C terminal Ets family DNA binding domain a central domain that together with co repressors recruit histone deacetylases 1 2 3 and an N terminal SAM sterile alpha motif domain 4 5 6 which we have recently shown forms a polymer 7 Chromosomal translocations in a variety of leukemias result in fusion of the SAM domain of TEL to tyrosine kinase domains such as ABL PDGF and JAK2 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 or to the transcriptional activators AML1 and ARNT 15 16 17 In the tyrosine kinase fusions SAM domain polymerization leads to constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase domains which leads in turn to cell transformation 10 12 18 19 Thus compounds that block TEL SAM polymerization could be effective in treating these leukemias To assess the feasibility of this approach it would be useful to have a structure of the polymer The wild type TEL SAM polymer forms large insoluble aggregates which precludes structure determination We were however able to obtain a structure of a mutant TEL SAM polymer V80E 7 The V80E mutation is in the center of the polymer interface and reduces the affinity of subunit association enough that the protein is relatively soluble above pH 7 0 where the Glu side chain is deprotonated Sufficient affinity remains however that upon crystallization the polymer reforms in the crystal The structure of the V80E mutant TEL SAM revealed a helical head to tail polymer in which the interface is made from two different surfaces on the protein One binding surface the mid loop ML surface consists of residues near the middle of the protein and the second surface the end helix EH surface is centered around the C terminal helix Although the V80E mutant self associates weakly under the high pH conditions used for crystallization we were able to show that the native interface is quite strong In particular a protein with a mutation in the EH surface V80E could bind with high affinity K d 2 nM to a protein with a mutation in the ML surface A61D to form a heterodimer with a native interface In addition the wild type protein forms fibers visible by electron microscopy that have a similar width to the V80E mutant polymer we observed in the crystal While the wild type and V80E mutant SAM domains form fibers that are grossly similar we cannot be certain that the mutation does not significantly alter the interface Even a small change in subunit orientation could result in substantial alteration of the structure of the polymer when propagated over many subunits We have therefore determined the structure of a heterodimer with a native interface Results and Discussion Crystal structure of the TEL SAM dimer We first attempted to grow crystals of the V80E A61D heterodimer characterized previously 7 but only obtained crystals of low quality We therefore attempted to crystallize other variants and were able to obtain high quality crystals of a V80R A61D heterodimer The protein complex crystallized in space group P1 with cell dimensions a 52 8 b 60 3 c 62 3 116 2 98 9 98 7 There were three dimers in the asymmetric unit The structure was solved by molecular replacement using AMORE 20 and refined to an R free 27 2 at 2 3 resolution Details of the structure determination and refinement are given in Table I The structures of the three heterodimers in the crystal are essentially identical with an average RMSD of 0 68 on all atoms A representative heterodimer is shown in Fig 1A As shown in Fig 1B the interface of the dimers consists of an apolar core comprised of Met57 Ala61 Leu64 and Leu65 on the ML surface and Phe45 Leu47 Val80 and Leu84 on the EH surface The same residue positions make up the core of the V80E mutant structure 7 As in the V80E structure a network of salt bridges surrounds the apolar core The specific interactions in the salt bridge network are somewhat variable and differ slightly from the V80E structure In the structure of the native interface dimer reported here all three dimers in the asymmetric unit contain salt bridges from Glu44 to Lys60 Arg73 to Asp79 Asp69 to Arg71 Glu68 to Lys67 and Asp69 to Lys67 Salt bridges from Glu56 to Arg48 and Glu68 to Arg71 were found in two of the three native interface dimers All these salt bridges were also observed in at least two out of the three molecules in the asymmetric unit of the V80E structure with the exception of Glu68 to Lys67 which was surprisingly completely absent in the V80E structure 7 Thus while the interfaces are grossly similar in all the structures the salt bridging interactions are malleable shifting to accommodate slight changes in the geometry of the subunits Construction of native polymer model Although it is not possible to obtain a high resolution structure of the wild type polymer experimentally we can construct a model of the wild type polymer by stringing together repeated copies of the heterodimer structure This assumes that the structural relationship between subunits is not very flexible The rigidity of the interface is borne out by the fact that the structure of three dimers in the asymmetric unit and the structure of the mutant V80E see below are so similar The procedure for constructing a wild type polymer model is shown schematically in figure 2A Starting with a single subunit additional subunits were added by aligning a subunit of the heterodimer to the last subunit of the existing polymer chain The new subunit was then added to the existing chain This procedure was used to construct three different polymers using the three dimers in the crystal asymmetric unit The resulting polymers were essentially identical with an RMSD on polymers of nine subunits of 0 87 on backbone atoms The architecture of one of the resulting polymer structures is shown in Fig 2B The wild type polymer is similar to its mutant counterpart The wild type and V80E mutant polymers are also very similar as shown in Figure 2B Both polymers contain SAM subunits arranged as a left handed helix with a 6 5 screw symmetry The repeat distance of the polymers is essentially identical differing by only one angstrom 53 for mutant and 52 for wild type These results confirm the architecture of the wild type polymer proposed previously based on the V80E mutant structure SAM interface as possible drug target SAM domain oligomerization is the key event that triggers a variety of leukemias 21 and is therefore an attractive target for therapeutic intervention Compounds that inhibit SAM association could be effective in preventing activation of the aberrant SAM tyrosine kinase fusions and consequent cell transformation Deep pockets on a protein surface make ideal sites for the binding of small molecule inhibitors because the surface area available for binding can be maximized 22 Figure 3shows the interacting surfaces of the SAM domain in the polymer There are no obvious deep pockets for design of small molecule inhibitors Conclusion In this report we have extracted a TEL SAM dimer from the wild type polymer and present its crystal structure The native interface was found to be similar to the previously solved mutant interface We also constructed a model of the native polymer and found it to be similar to the previously proposed mutant polymer Thus the polymer architecture is sufficiently robust to withstand a mutation from a hydrophobic to a charged residue in the center of the subunit interface We have recently determined the polymer structure of the SAM domain from another protein involved in transcriptional repression the polycomb group protein polyhomeotic Ph Kim et al in press The Ph SAM polymer is quite similar to the TEL SAM polymer even though the proteins have an unrelated domain structure and show less than 20 sequence identity between the SAM domains Moreover different residues are involved in the inter subunit interactions We therefore speculate that the polymer architecture is conserved for an important role in transcriptional repression possibly involving in the generation of a repressed chromatin structure 7 A rigid well defined polymer structure may be important for organizing chromatin in this manner From the structure we found that the interacting surfaces of the SAM domains are devoid of the deep pockets that are ideal for small molecule binding Although it may still be possible to find small molecule inhibitors these results are not encouraging Perhaps a more effective strategy would be to develop protein inhibitors such as the mutant SAM domains described here that can bind with high affinity and block polymerization This strategy is currently being tested Materials and Methods Protein expression mutagenesis and purification We used the Quickchange kit Stratagene to generate site directed mutants V80R and A61D from wild type TEL SAM cloned into a modified pET3c vector Novagen 7 The expressed protein sequence includes an MEKTR leader sequence followed by residues 38 124 of the TEL protein and then a C terminal His tag Recombinant V80R and A61D mutants were expressed in E Coli BL21 DE3 pLysS cells Novagen and purified by Ni NTA Qiagen and HiTrap SP Pharmacia affinity column chromatography followed by ammonium sulfate precipitation as described by Kim et al 7 Crystallization data collection and refinement To generate the native dimer equal amounts of each mutant dimer both at 15 mg ml were mixed together prior to crystallization Crystals were grown by the hanging drop method in which 2 l of the 7 5 mg ml dimer solution in 10 mM bis tris propane pH 8 5 and 200 mM NaCl were mixed with 2 l of reservoir solution containing 5 PEG 4000 and 2 0 M ammonium sulfate Hexagonal rod like crystals grew at room temperature over a six week period Crystals were cryo protected with the reservoir solution enriched with 30 w v glycerol before data collection under a liquid nitrogen stream The data was processed with DENZO SCALEPACK 23 The molecular replacement solution was found using AMORE 20 with a previously solved TEL SAM mutant V80E dimer structure as the search model The program O 24 was used for model building and CNS 25 was used for refinement Water molecules and sulfates were added to the model near the end of refinement using difference electron density maps The final model has a crystallographic R factor Rcryst of 23 0 and R free of 27 2 on 10 of the data Table 1 The program O was also used for subsequent construction of the native polymer Coordinates Coordinates have been
