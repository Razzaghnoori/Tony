 John McCain Cosmic Jokester Margo First Prudie then America If McCain can win over the hearts of readers sitting in Harvard Square then I suppose he has a prayer What you and Kurtz say about McCain rings true Last week I trailed McCain to a town hall meeting in New Hampshire If he had a big band and a chubby sidekick you would have mistaken his speech for the opening monologue of a late night talk show Here s an excerpt from my notebook I d like to introduce some of the people we have with us here today Yes there s Mr Dan Rather of CBS News Could you stand up If any of you have any problems with socialist pinko commie bias of his news organization you know where to take up your complaints Is there anyone here from the Army We won t hold that against you Every line is a wisecrack And it s delivered in a deadpan style that seems clearly borrowed from Johnny Carson Much of it is a gallows sense of humor He is somebody who has seen the worst of life and knows that much of the garbage he deals with in Washington is a part of a cosmic joke All of which leads me to believe that reporters have been asking the wrong question about McCain We have had presidents with tempers before but have we ever had a president who is this glib Bob Dole certainly considered his campaign a joke and Lincoln had an ability to laugh off problems But at the end of the day Lincoln was a somber guy and Dole was a horrible candidate Being president is a serious business and I wonder if it s wise to install a jokester as leader of the free world Mr Gorbachev tear down this wall and remove that splotch Perhaps the answer is yes I am undecided on the matter Meanwhile the National Review online is reporting that a Dean Acheson anecdote McCain has been telling in debates is wrong Someone s research team must have been working overtime on that one Candor and accuracy are apparently not synonymous So Prudie give us a book report and tell us who s smarter W or Esther Williams M Honey
