 Feelin I Groovy I Have you ever set the dials in your head to register with maximum sensitivity any new encounter with a particular word or phrase I put the dials on high alert a few weeks ago for groovy spurred by a spate of printed sightings People magazine had just referred to Winona Ryder in passing as the groovy gamine The Washington Post at about the same time complimented the groovy appearance of the iMac computer The Chicago Tribune published a list of Web sites for kids that it had found to be full of groovy games A commentary in the London Independent about Britain s fuddy duddy Conservative Party and its forlorn attempts at image enhancement observed Here they are doing their best to be a little bit groovy a little bit New Labour and what do we do We snigger Meanwhile a communication from the editor of Slate brought my attention not so much to sightings as to hearings He wrote D S a man not given to air quotes just told me it was groovy that I would call him back later about something Young R a summer intern used the word constantly but with a smirk I ve heard it used by grown ups without apparent irony within the past hour I guess it s gone the route of cool revived as quaint and retro by young uns and gradually de ironized I assume the term originated as a 40s or 50s hip allusion to the LP record But maybe not Well close Briefly the word dates back to jazz circles in the 1930s and ultimately derives from the phrase in the groove meaning performing or doing exceptionally well What the groove in that phrase originally referred to is hard to establish definitively because several meanings current in the 1930s all permit plausible theories Many dictionaries do link the groove of in the groove to the groove of a record But groove could also refer to the path between a pitcher and the strike zone and had done so since the turn of the century a pitcher who was throwing in the groove was throwing very well Groove also had a vulgar sexual connotation which could likewise give in the groove the connotation of high performance and pleasure And groove could simply mean a style a sense associated with the parallel between being in a groove and being in a rut In the 19 th century groovy actually meant to be in a rut or to be of settled habits or conventional the first Oxford English Dictionary citation for this kind of grooviness is dated 1867 In any event by the 1940s groovy had expanded beyond the jazz world and a harbinger of what would happen in the 1960s and 70s was being used by nongroovy adults in a typically pathetic attempt to seem hip Here s a Buick ad cited by Thomas Dalzell a lexicographer of slang in his terrific book Flappers 2 Rappers Stand off and beam at Buick s years ahead style there s something not only favored by the old folks but termed by the younger idea definitely groovy The ad appeared in Newsweek in 1946 After the 1940s groovy went dormant for a time reference books begin to refer to it as archaic or obsolete Then came its re emergence in Beat and hippie patois and its ascension into totemic status as the primary pop cultural word that future generations would associate with the youth culture of the 1960s During the 1996 presidential campaign David Letterman s Top 10 ways Bob Dole is trying to appear younger included the following at the No 9 spot Peppers his speeches with words such as groovy and outasight A nuance that the future may not always appreciate though is how ironic or playfully self conscious its usage usually was I suspect that the word has long existed in a netherworld between interjectional utility and outright put on Perhaps an ingenuous minority used it innocently in its hippie heyday but most often one heard it uttered with a bit of wonderment as if the speaker couldn t believe that he or she was really using the word Groovy continues to thrive with the same sort of ambivalence attached to it The experts disagree only about the full extent of its range Anne H Soukhanov who oversaw the most recent third edition of the American Heritage Dictionary and is now the North American editor of the Encarta World English Dictionary recalls coming across the word these days mostly in speech especially in sardonic and sarcastic replies to negative context statements such as Dad I just wrecked your new car or This to inform you that the IRS has targeted you for a 10 year audit where its use as an interjectional reply parallels similar use of standard terms like beautiful terrific or great John Morse the editor of the Merriam Webster dictionaries sees groovy less as a bit of exotica and more as a robust adapter to an ever changing present Often he says drawing on Merriam Webster s voluminous citation files groovy is used in reference to something from or reminiscent of the 1960s clothing spiritualism things that glow in black light but just as often actually more often the word appears to be used in reference to the contemporary scene We have examples of trendy addresses in Miami Beach biker gal sunglasses MTV videos parties where hip hop music is played and jazz rap crossover music all being described as groovy and all without hint of irony The examples come from such publications as Rolling Stone TV Guide Elle the Village Voice and The New Yorker The word says Morse appears to live on It lives on but its evolution seems to be taking different forms in captivity and in the wild Such at any rate is slang specialist Dalzell s surmise and the comments by Soukhanov about the interjectional groovy and Morse about groovy in printed citations illustrate the point In the wild that is in the more freewheeling and inflected realm of spoken language groovy thrives in a largely ironic state the use of the word requires a context of wavelength synchrony between speaker and listener In captivity that is in the more restrained and stylized realm of written language examples of the nonironic groovy tend to predominate heavily Groovy s staying power it has maintained its meaning and its presence for more than six decades points up the robustness and even the relative antiquity of much of what seems like linguistic ephemera Out of sight meaning incredibly wonderful or extraordinary is as current as ever it goes back not to the 60s but to the 40s the 1840s Cool has experienced a change of intonation in the 1990s becoming nearly bisyllabic but it has been widely used over diverse demographic terrain for most of the 20 th century and it goes back as a term of admiration That s right i e very cool to the first half of the 19 th century Duh an interjection indicating stupidity or obviousness emerged from 1940s animated cartoons but its period of greatest efflorescence is probably occurring right now It enjoys life not only as an interjection but also as a noun The movie s real duh of a raison d tre Village Voice and an adjective That s so duh you ve got to smile Los Angeles Times Bummer one 1960s word that really did get its start in the 60s drug culture is also proving its hardiness a testament both to the term s euphony and to the ubiquity of bummers in the world at large Cat dig and hipster are enjoying a resurgence So are bitchin and stoked Every generation insists on having its own new words for the most aggressively up to date aspects of life Well duh But it s also true as never before that the archives of sound and image constitute a continuous retro loop that people can and will draw on The situation is oddly appropriate The idea of retro in a rut restores grooviness to its original meaning
