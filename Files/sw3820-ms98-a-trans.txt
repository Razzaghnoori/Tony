                um what have been some well ill start out with some of my my vacations um   okay   um when i graduated from high school um my uh band my jazz band and we visited Europe i visited Germany and Austria um Italy uh Switzerland and that was pretty fun i also have visited South America and just this last summer one of my favorite vacations is i went to China   oh boy youre a real world traveler here     so uh i i we my wife and i when we went to China we visited the Great Wall and uh the Forbidden City um the Forbidden City is uh  right there Tiananmen Square is right in front of it and so thats where all the killings occurred not too long couple years ago and uh also the Forbidden City if you saw what was that one movie that was really famous   all right oh yeah um emperor or  yeah   uh The Last Emperor yeah that was filmed in the Forbidden City so we had to see that when we went anyway   yeah that was a well my wife and i are right now saving for a trip to to England   oh that sounds fun   we would like to stay about a month uh   youll need to save for that unless you have some friends there youre going to stay with because   well we do have some friends that we can stay at their place for a while or as long as we want actually but its you know its in the southern part so but we want us to go all over the countryside thats our next big vacation weve got planned and just a few days in the London itself is all were interested in there but mostly to this date uh our vacations have been more like uh anywhere where theres not too many tourists   uhhuh   i hate resorts and things like that i like to go where you can get out by yourself in the mountains done a lot of camping in New Mexico and uh Colorado   uhhuh   and one time we even toured Iowa my wife is from Iowa but actually the southern part and uh shed never really seen a lot of the different northern places and just the lot of the little towns and  so we drove around went to the Humana Colonies things like that   uhhuh yeah theyre not too far from here   we really i think she enjoyed it a a lot because she knew more of the history than course than i did of Iowa but it was uh it was interesting   uhhuh   here in Texas we live in the middle of Texas its hard to get out of Texas on a driving trip   yeah got to go a long ways  uh yeah we also dont like to particularly go to tourist spots fact we usually choose to go places where we at least for part of our trip will be visiting someone and uh even when my wife is well and my graduate program that i was in we knew some people who were in Beijing and so uh we were able to stay with them for part of the time in fact they spoke English very well and and helped us around to see some of the places and even when we went to South America uh uh we knew there were people contacts we had there   yeah   so uh but most people that i that i uh met you know at the university and so uh it makes a big difference to us we like to go for go on a trip with someone whos from the area because i dont know ive im afraid especially if i dont know the language   right we had had a we went to Mexico City once by ourselves uh mainly because it was just something we could afford to do and we heard it was interesting well we just had a real awful time because we didnt speak Spanish i dont think that would have helped us any anyway it was just a miserable vacation and we decided you know well never go anywhere where they dont speak English or somebody that cant help us   uhhuh   it was by the end of that week we felt like everybody was out to get us   uhhuh   and that sort of thing and we werent having the fun we thought we would   yeah it really makes a difference because i know even when we went to China when we crossed the border we went over to Hong Kong we were so relieved it was so fun to be uh you know it seemed like returning to civilization and where a lot of people spoke English and uh  just the general living conditions were were somewhat higher also so it was uh   yeah yeah our last major vacation was uh well we had to go to Iowa to see some relatives because sickness in the family so we took that in for a few days and then we went to a uh to a Shaker settlement in Kentucky and uh its a its been rebuilt and we stayed there for three days and it was just kind of neat because we really like Shaker things and we were able to take our dog with us and he stayed with us and it was just the thrill of our life to it was early fall and Kentucky was beautiful that time of the year anyway
