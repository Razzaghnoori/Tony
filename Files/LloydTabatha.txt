 OK this is my third interview with my friend Tabatha Lloyd who also lives in Lincolnton NC where I live Have you lived here all your life Tabatha Yes all but six months and we moved to Robinsville And where is Robinsville Um it s at the tip of North Carolina and Tennessee it s in North Carolina but it touches Tennessee And that s where you have family I think your mom s family lives there Can you tell us a little bit about it Um yeah both my mother and my father s family all live there and um my mother and my father moved here with Duke Power um in about 73 I guess they moved to South Carolina first and then my dad was transferred here and the so the rest of our family lives there um and we re the only people who live here and it s just a total redneck town What Lincolnton or Robinsville Robinsville um what why is it redneck I guess well the whole town consists of nothing but white people and Indians Um the only chain that is in the whole town is an Ingle s grocery store we used to have Hardee s but they took it out We do have Papa s Pizza now and the rest of it is just all family owned businesses There there s probably I don t know the whole town consists of one block basically It s just a big circle uh and there s nothing to do there If you want to go shopping you have to go about thirty miles other than grocery store um you have to everybody goes to Asheville to shop because there s no there s no stores to shop there except for just like family owned little clothing stores and stuff stuff nobody wants Isn t that where they filmed the movie Nell and weren t your grandparents a part of that film No they they did film the movie Nell there but um they the pool hall was my uncle s pool hall that it was filmed in but no my grandparents had nothing to do with it Um my uncle did rent out his pool hall and in the grocery store scene my aunt and my cousin are in the grocery store scene and I guess that s all the family members I have in there They ve totally all the tourists have destroyed the house the little cabin in the woods where Nell was filmed Um they ve just went up there and took planks of wood and stuff off of it and totally destroyed the whole place Do you like living in Lincolnton and the people here as opposed to the people in Robinsville do you think they re nicer um I mean friendlier and just in general do you like living in this area Uh I wouldn t live anywhere but Lincolnton I don t think But as far as the people goes people in Robinsville are much friendlier Th like I say there s no you can t go shopping or anything so there s a lot of family time spent you know you there s a lot a a lot of visiting and people take time for each other up there there s not the hustle and bustle that s down here so life s a lot slower pace there What about Lincolnton Life s definitely fast paced here because everybody s always busy an nobody visits anybody we just don t have any of the old the old school tactics I guess that uh they practice in Robinsville Nobody has time for people around here Wow and this is considered a small town to lots of people who might live in larger areas like even Gast Charlotte Yeah Charlotte uh did you like going to Lincolnton High School Um no it pretty well no Lincolnton High School pretty well sucked Um I think I made it there like seventy five days out of my senior year and I still managed to graduate with my class with a B plus average This is something we re all proud of Tabatha Hey I m proud that I got out a there Um OK well so do you think you ll ever want to travel or and if you do where do you want to travel to I would like to go to Scotland I know Scotland and Ireland um just because I think the I think the land s beautiful I like the accent and I just think it would be a neat place to go I m not really Paris Europe doesn t really drill me um I d like to go to Scotland and Ireland and of course the Bahamas or Hawaii everybody wants to go there but that s um I guess Scotland would just be the place I d most like to go OK um your mom also lives here in Lincolnton and I ve never known a a family and I m talking about you your sister and your mom and your brother who is more close in such a functional yet dysfunctional way Tell me a little bit about your mom and the things that you appreciate in her or things that you remember about her best when you were younger Um we are really close and I guess that s because my mom was a single mother who raised us She had to work two and three jobs our whole life to take care of us So growing up she wasn t really around much um but she s always been our best friend Um my sister s just always kind of she s the middle child and she s always just kind of took care of me and my brother And um I m the baby so momma just always left everything up to Tonya to take care of us and that s why I guess we re so close because we all had to depend on each other and we didn t depend on anybody else to take care of us We we all leaned on each other and we all took care of each other We re we re all best friends and it s kind of hard for other people to fit in you know it s the four of us and then everybody else I guess OK and what about your dad do you I know you re not as close with your dad as your mom even though you do love him um do you remember your mom and dad being together when you were a child and you know holidays or anything like that that you remember them being together I don t I don t remember how young you were whenever they got divorced Um I remember Christmas some Christmases with my dad um because I remember one Christmas we got every we always got everything on Christmas Eve because my mom couldn t wait Um and I remember the day that um I was five years old and I was getting ready to go to kindergarten when my mom told me that my dad wasn t coming home and um it was the summer before I went in kindergarten And I was sitting in my dad s chair waiting on him to come home and uh my uh momma told me daddy wasn t coming home but uh that s really the only two things I remember about my daddy being young uh I remember one other night with uh when he took my brother and sister to a um a race car um a race or something but I stayed at home with my mom and that s really the only three times that I remember my dad before they split up And as for my dad you know he s a great guy I love him but he s set in his ways and he s always right he s never wrong and you know I m too much like my mom so we re not the best of friends but that s my dad OK Tabatha um we spent a lot of time together when we were younger um a lot of good times a lot of fun times What are the now that we re both two old married women what are some of the things that you remember and miss about our younger days especially our years in high school when we had to kind of rely on each other as nonconformists to the groups in Lincolnton High School Um I guess I miss going to church together because you know we were always in the same youth group And of course I miss Galen Radebaugh but um I definitely do not miss the short period of time that I had to live with you Oh God Because that was immortal hell Uh um I miss making fun of Alynne I guess I hope Alynne never goes to the Charlotte Narrative collection and pulls this interview up Alynne we love you if you do um Tell us about Alynne Alynne was crazy and speaking of my dysfunctional family my my brother was in love with Alynne and my brother s girlfriend wanted to kill Alynne and Alynne was crazy and probably on Prozac and Alynne tries to kill herself you know as we hear she she s constantly trying to kill herself and she contributes all her problems to the fact that my brother I don t know that she wasn t with my brother I guess But Alynne thought she had beautiful feet and she thought that she was holier than thou and she she was just a spoiled brat Um Golly Besides Alynne can you remember any fun things that we did together Fun thing What were the funnest memories I know I know I remember staying at your house spending the night ordering pizza whenever we didn t have any money to do so and having to steal money from your brother or just Count out change count out pennies and going swimming at the hotel where your mom use to work at night when nobody was there and we weren t really allowed to be there that was fun Um so what are your fondest memories I have no idea Oh that s nice Um I guess I don t know just hanging out um we use to hang out with like Steven Waites I guess we had a lot of fun with Brad We use to just hang out and have a good time all the time we stayed with each other all the time and um You taught me how to smoke Yeah I taught you how to smoke I m sorry Cigarettes which we have both quit smoking thank praise the Lord Um I guess the funnest times we ever had I would have to say was right after me and Doug got married but I m not going to talk about that so um I don t know Th that was the really memorable times um seeing who could stand outside the longest on the deck in the snow Oh I remember that that was fun It was never about partying I mean we did party especially after you and Doug got married but it was never about that I think when we had our funnest times I mean those times were fun but we also when when we were involved in youth and stuff like that we had fun then too so we didn t Did you go to the beach with us Fort Caswell yeah Oh Like a lot of my other friends in high school all we did was like party together and that s the only memories I have of them when I ever want to remember something about them it s always OK well we did we drank that night and did this that night But with you and you and just and maybe one or two of my other friends from high school really we really had a friendship that didn t involve stuff like that all the time We had good times without having to do that crazy stuff So I think that s good because a lot of people can t say that But I digress I m sorry anyway Um I ve been asked I asked dad and Linda the same question because it s such a cheesy question but I m going to go ahead and ask you since we re coming upon the year two thousand what was your favorite movie of all time and why Um I guess it would d d da da da da da probably Dirty Dancing It would be a close tie between Dirty Dancing and Up Close and Personal Oh God But uh Please Dirty Dancing I I just love Dirty Dancing and um it wasn t because I thought Patrick Swayze was beautiful or anything it was because I really don t think he s that good looking I just the story was sweet and it was a good story I always needed that older man to come take me away Doug took me right here to uh Lincolnton Um and if it was Up Close and Personal it would be totally because of Robert Redford standing at the end of the escalator Um speaking of Doug you guys have been together for how many years not not just including the years you ve been married We ve been married for for four and I guess we ve been together eight years OK we had to flip the tape over Um do you remember the very first time you ever saw or um met Doug in high school and can you talk about that a little bit The first time I ever met Doug was at church was at Covenant and he came to church with a friend of ours Tammy Taylor and um he um he had I don t remember if he had a mohawk then or if he was bald headed I m guessing he probably had a mohawk and had on a green and brown flannel shirt I would guess and he weighed a hundred and twenty six pounds and was six four he looked like he was dying with AIDS he was pathetic looking I felt so sorry for him and he was a total freak he did not talk to anybody he was just a skater and he was just a total freak And I decided I was going to be his friend and I talked to him at church but he was Uh uh was all he would ever say And then finally we had a class together when I moved and because I switched schools in tenth grade and when I moved to Lincolnton um well to Lincolnton High School I had a class with him And um he the way we started talking is he had shaved his head bald and he was going to let some of the guys draw a picture on his head with black magic marker and I felt sorry for him and I told him that they were not going to draw on his head and we just started dating And the first time he ever called me I was on the phone and he called I was talking to my mom and I switched over and I m like MAMA IT S DOUG and he said Huh I had forgotten to switch the phone over before I screamed in his ear Were you excited that it was Doug or horrified I was very excited um I liked him a lot though I just think really I really felt sorry for him and I just wanted to kind of take care of him and now he takes care of me And um you were talking earlier about being friends um one thing I think through being friends through the years and stuff and uh not all being about partying is we have a friendship that we I think we ll always be friends whether we re always together or not you know It s not a it s not about you know seeing each other every day or hanging out all the time its deeper than that and I think that s because God s at the root of it I agree Um oh I wanted to ask you about your I know you love kids and you ve always worked with kids since you ve been out of high school you ve wanted to pursue a career with child care development and why do you like kids because I don t see why but uh maybe you can explain to us why you like them so much I don t know I ve always liked kids I guess because I ve I guess it has a lot to do with the fact that I was the baby of the family and I ve always you know I was always just the kid of the whole family and um there was times that you know my dad wasn t around or whatever and I just there were times he didn t treat me like he should have I guess and I just wanted to be good to kids and I just want to show kids love and even if they have dysfunctional families or if things aren t the way that they should be that s that they have somewhere to go and somebody who loves them and um you know its not just kids it s you know it s teenagers I have a heart for teenagers and though sometimes that s got me in trouble I still have a heart for them and I still you know someday really want to help teenagers as well as children Um OK it s very understandable why seeing it from that perspective why you like kids so much Um I m going to ask you just maybe one or two more questions Um OK one of our favorite things to do is to tell ghost stories and scare the heebie jeebies out of each other um tell me one of your favorite ghost stories You have a friend Jennifer who lived like way out in the boon docks and some scary stuff occurred at her trailer can you tell us a little bit about that Yeah well um I had OK Jennifer I it been like a couple days about a week or so and I hadn t had time to go up and see her and I spent a whole lot of time with her and her kids this is before I got married so you know I spent the night with her a lot and um we we were friends and I went to lay down with her little boy one night to put him to bed because he wouldn t go to sleep by his self and I had worked all day so I was really tired and I went and laid down with him and me and him fell asleep Well Jennifer came back there and she woke me up and um she said Tabatha and I m like Um huh and she s like Tabatha get up and spend some time with me you hadn t you know I hadn t seen you all week please get up and talk to me for a little while and I was real sleepy and I m like OK Jennifer Well I opened my eyes and I like tossed my head over to look at Spencer when I opened my eyes she was going back down the hall I tossed my head back over to look at Spencer because he was laying on the other side of the bed and uh when I did Jennifer was in the bed with me and Spencer she was laying down between me and Spencer or on the other side of Spencer Spencer was in between us and I woke her up I m like Jennifer you got to wake up now because and I told her what had happened and that hadn t been the only time something like that had happened um there had been times when um we were like we were going to sleep or something and um one night I d spent the night with her and some stuff had happened that night I forget what all had happened but Didn t you stay the night with her a lot because her husband worked at night or something Uh yeah he worked third shift and um she didn t like staying by herself because you know stuff did happen a lot in that house but uh I spent the night with her one night and Patrick w was actually home that night and s some stuff had happened you know we d heard some noises and stuff and she d ask me if I would come sleep in their room she s like I ll make you a pallet at the end of our bed just come in there you know um um I m scared so I m like OK Jennifer and she made me a pallet at the end of her bed and we were we were asleep and I was almost asleep and all of the sudden we heard this noise and it sounded like it came from the bed and Jennifer said Tabatha I hope that was you and I said no I was hoping that that was one of y all and she said No it came from down there and I said No it came from up there Well she looked at the clock and she s like Tabatha get up get up now and come in the living room and we went in the living room and sh and I m like What Jennifer you know I wanted to go to sleep and um she said Did you see what time it was And I said No I didn t see what time it was and she said It was 2 15 well at the time that meant nothing to me but um she explained to me and later we watched the Amityville Horrors and then it really started making sense to me and speaking of Amityville Horrors my house looks just like the house in Amityville Horrors have you ever looked at it Yeah Um but uh um and th then some other weird stuff happened and I really think the reason that such weird stuff happened there was because I was the only Christian influence in her life and I think you know I really believe that her house was possessed and I believe that you know they probably wanted to get rid of me but Tell about her little boy knowing about her grandma Um um he one day her little boy who was about three years old um his grandpa s his grandpa s father was dead and well by that time his grandpa s mother and father was dead but one time he was talking to Jennifer s mom and it was Jennifer s momma s daddy whose father and mother were dead OK so Spencer was talking to his grandmother and he told his grandmother he said I know he said Your grandpa s crying She said My grandpa s crying my grandpa s hey you know my grandpa s gone He said But he was crying and he was running through the woods and um um Debbie asked Spencer she s like Spencer you know what are you talking about Spencer had never heard about this and um he said He s crying and he s running from somebody and she said Who s he running from And um um and Spencer said I don t know but he s crying he s running through the woods and she he said and she shot him And um Jennifer s grand uh Spencer s grandma asked Who shot him And said h his wife shot him and her um her grandpa had been shot and killed but they had never found out who had shot him they never knew who had killed him And then Spencer was three years old he had never heard it heard them talk about it before so I mean he just knew and Spencer would sit like he would be sitting in the living room a lot of times too and he would just look off into space and he would just get terrified and start screaming and he would run to you and just cry and would be still be looking at whatever he was just off in space like something was just scared him to death And um there was another one I was just thought about oh horror stories oh Jennifer always told me also about this um this woman who she got this call one and she it it was this little boy and he said Um I m lost and I can t find my way home and can you call my mommy And and um the lady said um you know Yeah I ll call your mommy do you know your mommy s phone number And he um s he gave he gave um the lady his his phone number and he she said Well where are you so I can tell your mommy where to come get you at and the little boy gave her the address of where he was and said Please call my mommy I m lost and I want my mommy to come get me Well the lady called the little boy the number that the little boy had given her and um the the lady answered the phone or I believe it was her husband actually who answered the phone and um the the lady said Ma am um your little boy called here tonight and she said Your little boy just called your little boy said that he was lost and that he couldn t find his way home and he gave me the address of where he was and he wants y all to come and get him And the lady said Ma am and the lady got really mad and she was really angry and she said My little boy s dead and I cannot believe that you would pull this joke on me and the lady said Ma am your little boy just called here and you know I would not play this joke on you And she said Let me give you the address of where he said he was because you know I would not make this up And she gave the address and the lady went she gave the address and um the lady told her she said That s the house we lived in where my little boy got killed at or not had killed but I think he had died in that house or whatever and um so um the little boy I guess was just looking for his way home Is that enough Yeah thank you Tabatha for those spooky stories Now I have to drive home by myself But um just wanted to mention again that that was Tabatha Lewis Lloyd sorry I m use to calling her Tabatha Lewis from Lincolnton North Carolina
