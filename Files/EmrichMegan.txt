 All right this is um Megan Emrich and she she grew up in Philadelphia and she s lived here since May April March April April first April first April first All right Megan when you were growing up do you remember any stories that you read or were read to you that uh stick in your mind I don t remember any stories that I read I remember reading the uh um my Nana and we were just talking about this at Christmastime my Nana had read a story had wanted me to read a book and we had gone to her apartment and she was um reading The Owl and the Pussycat and she would read it with me I think just to teach me how to how to read basically but I remember and apparently that was her favorite story or something like that but I remember being forced to sit down and read it with her and I really didn t want to do it but I always remember I can remember now the beginning part of it and that s really all I can remember of the story OK Did um was this at a particular time of the year like did you say at Christmas or holidays Whenever This was not at Christmas this was whenever we would go over and visit visit her She always made me sit down and read this book I don t even know The Owl and the Pussycat the book or a poem I m not really sure She always sat down and read this with her and I I always thought I was being punished by sitting there having to read it I guess she really liked it and she wanted me to learn it OK Um Did did she like read it to you or She would read it with me She d read it with me She d have to actually read the words Yeah She d actually have to read the words Did you like the story No I didn t like anything about it because I thought I was being punished But I could always remember you know The Owl and the Pussycat in the beautiful pea green book and that s what I remember but I don t really remember enjoying it I just thought I was being punished because every my brother and sister could do whatever they wanted and I had to sit there and read The Owl and the Pussycat you know I wasn t too happy about that Do you know why she made you sit there Did she ever make your brother and sister sit there No I don t remember them having to sit there I don t really know why I had to sit there I don t know She did this every time you d go over there like on a regular basis Yeah It seemed like it This was before this was when my grandfather and her weren t married so we would go over and read it with me I was not even sure what was going on but um but I just remember having to read that and that was it um with her OK Do you remember in your family any particular stories that were told like you know at Thanksgiving or just maybe even now stories that you uh know you remember when so and so did such and such Um no but I always not really stories I guess hearing my mom talk about stories about her her brother and her mother and stuff like that things I never even knew about that would interest me now that she tells me now But I don t remember um being told a whole lot when we were younger Um It was just you know we just went on with our lives but now now as I am older she would tell me things that you know I never even knew about Lived with we lived with the whole time but I never even knew about so it was a little different Is there something particular or like really weird that she s told you that stands out in your mind Well she told me she just told me last week that my her mother had breast cancer and I never knew that Wow I never knew that And she had tuberculosis and I never knew that either Is there any reason why she didn t tell you I don t know It never came up I don t think she ever you know she ever kept it a secret or anything like that but I don t I just she just never told me it never came out in conversation Um and that s just more of those every day I don t think there s any I don t know No I don t think there s any reason why she doesn t tell me anything I don t think Maybe she told everyone else and I wasn t paying attention at that particular time So I m not really sure why Um as far as never being told OK Um are there any you said you don t remember reading anything in particular like when you were older in school were there any books that you read that you liked or hated Um no to be honest I never read any of the books I was supposed to I know that s horrible That s why I didn t graduate college but I never I never read any of the books I was supposed to I mean I remember having to read um you know all the all the books that everyone I don t know John Steinbeck books and stuff like that Um but I don t recall ever finishing any of them And more looking through the Cliff Notes to be honest with you So I don t have any specific stories OK Um hum I don t know OK all right That s fine Thank you very much
