 Sweetness and Bite Early in June 1906 a certain Detective Young in Scotland testified before a Joint Parliamentary Committee examining issues of public morality He had seen boys and girls kissing and smoking and cuddling away at each other in an ice cream parlor he said He had encountered 12 year old girls lured into prostitution by sugar Then the following exchange occurred Q Do you ask us to believe that the downfall of these women was due to ice cream shops A I believe it is That delirious transcript is part of the story of the triumph of refined sugar over old fashioned honey that takes up almost half of Sidney Mintz s new book Tasting Food Tasting Freedom Excursions Into Eating Culture and the Past Mintz an anthropologist at Johns Hopkins University and author of Sweetness and Power a more detailed look at sugar and its meaning also explores other topics ranging from the broader relationship between political power and food to more idiosyncratic excursions such as the chapter entitled Color Taste and Purity Some Speculations on the Meanings of Marzipan But it s the saga of refined sugar that forms the core of this book a tale Mintz punctuates with telling historical surprises In the sweetener competition for example sugar received an early and unexpected boost from Henry VIII In 1537 when the king abolished the monasteries the decline in demand for candle wax slowed the honey output and opened a window for sugar Detective Young was able to indulge in his cheap moralizing four centuries later because back then everything about sugar was suspect its novelty and potency its exotic origin in Moorish Spain its pure pharmocopoeal whiteness Honey on the other hand was one of our first foods dating to the Paleolithic Era It was comparatively mild in taste always locally produced natural and gooey trustworthy even good for the youth In time sugar became the first imported luxury to become a cheap daily necessity of the masses and along with tea and tobacco it probably provide s us with the first instance in history of the mass consumption of imported food staples As 18 th century British aristocrats wallowed in sugar the working class yearned for it creating a demand that would underlie the expansion of enormous sugar plantations in the Caribbean and hence the slave trade For politicians sugar became an eminently taxable commodity and acquired many champions in the press in the medical journals in the Foreign Office and in Parliament It introduced the West to a new source of political power mass producers before whom elected officials would need to bow and scrape We ve never stopped linking sugar with notions of good and evil Mintz quotes some astonishing speeches by Abolitionists who easily equated cane sugar with murder one of them even providing the precise calculus I n every pound of sugar used the product of the slaves imported from Africa we may be considered as consuming two ounces of blood Sugar s aura of evil endures to this day that s what those pink and blue packages on every restaurant table signify At the same time vestiges of its virtue dating from a time when a gift of confectionery was both rare and prized survive in every box of Valentine s Day candy No one who reads these chapters will scoop up another spoonful of sugar without reflecting on the history of ambivalence global turmoil and centuries of suffering needed to put it on the table None of Mintz s other chapters is quite as satisfying as the three devoted to sugar Still this is a book whose bibliography includes monographs entitled Private Tooth Decay as Public Economic Virtue and tomes such as The History and Social Influence of the Potato so the rest of it is still loaded with nuggets worth finding The dominance of Coke for example in the cola wars may date to the influence of Gen George Marshall a Southerner who was able to get Coca Cola Atlanta based exempted from the wartime rationing of sugar As a result 64 bottling plants were built in both theaters of battle and 148 bottling technicians served there Three bottlers gave their lives for their country Toward the end of the book Mintz tells a story about offhandedly mentioning in a lecture that America has no cuisine The students reaction was swift and contentious as if their feelings had been hurt Mintz seems puzzled musing that it wasn t as though he d said America had no literature But it does hit a nerve so Mintz spends his last chapter pondering the question of whether America has a cuisine after all He answers with an academic distinction Regional cuisines Mintz says are authentic because they use local ingredients and involve a community of people who eat it cook it have opinions about it and engage in dialogue involving those opinions On the other hand national cuisines are largely artificial constructs You won t find a French restaurant in France for obvious reasons The blue plate specials typically offered as American cuisine hamburgers pizza fried chicken baked beans hot dogs aren t worth considering Mintz says despite such irrepressible enthusiasts as Edna Lewis and Betty Fussell His nouns in this chapter do begin to grate He then concludes I don t think anyone wants to call that array a cuisine That s right array Mintz dismisses our regional cuisines New England Southern Cajun Pennsylvania Dutch because they have been ruined by the environmental impact of overfishing local stocks and by ferocious marketing that dilutes their authenticity and ends in bowdlerization But this is food which means that it s not easy for all irrepressible enthusiasts to sit still and listen Mintz means to start an argument to lay out a polemic but what s nettlesome is not his answer but the question If cuisines emerge organically over time from rooted people then why pose the question about a people who have come to epitomize rootlessness Instead he might have consulted the works of J B Jackson the architecture critic who observed that most American architecture isn t meant to last Americans throw up office parks and strip malls one year tear them down the next and build something else So to judge America s fleeting architecture by Europe s canonical standards is preposterous Ditto with food Americans make no time for dialogue much less cuisine They re scouting out new food fads scarfing them down and then rooting about for the next one Had a blackened redfish lately Probably not Paul Prudhomme was so 1989 Enjoy this year s mesclun salads The end is nigh Even Mintz senses the bathos of ending his book on such a weak note So he tacks on different ending by turning in his own words to an unbelievably grim scenario He cites one of those suspiciously Malthusian studies forecasting a biblical future of scarce water arid fields and a desperately hungry America Then he well surprisingly he moralizes Mintz suggests that consumption gluttony will prompt another Operation Desert Storm but this time for meat Its effects on American moral integrity he intones would be utterly disastrous Worse we might let our obsessive notions of individual freedom destroy our democracy Oh for the restraint
