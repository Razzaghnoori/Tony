 Viruses are intracellular pathogens that are subject to intense selective pressures during their ongoing battles within the host To propagate successfully they must exploit numerous machineries of the infected cell Thus studies of their replicative cycles have yielded fundamental insights into eukaryotic biology A prime example is the human immunodeficiency virus HIV which is a lentivirus that causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS Unlike simpler oncoviruses that rely exclusively on host cell machinery lentiviruses code for additional accessory and regulatory proteins that act as molecular switches at different stages of viral entry and exit from the infected cell Studying the actions of these viral proteins has yielded understanding of diverse cellular functions such as the innate immunity against retroviruses control of transcriptional elongation export of macromolecules from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and intracellular trafficking of proteins reviewed in 1 The transcriptional transactivator Tat is a key regulatory protein of HIV It is expressed early after the virus integrates into the cell and stimulates the elongation of RNA polymerase II RNAPII This type of transcriptional control had not been previously appreciated thus work on Tat established a new paradigm in the field of eukaryotic biology Moreover these findings impacted greatly studies of cotranscriptional processing of nascent mRNA To understand these processes better we need to start with the basics of transcriptional control RNAPII is the enzyme that transcribes protein coding genes in eukaryotic cells Elegant studies in vitro first suggested that the simple recruitment of RNAPII to transcription units was not sufficient for the copying of genes and cotranscriptional processing of their transcripts Rather distinct steps could be defined which began with the assembly of the preinitiation complex PIC promoter clearance pausing and arrest and ended with efficient elongation of transcription reviewed in 2 The central component of PIC is the general transcription factor GTF TFIID which contains the TATAbox binding protein TBP and 12 to 15 TBP associated factors TAFs TFIID acts as a landing pad for other GTFs and RNAPII to nucleate PIC assembly Moreover TAFs serve as coactivators to a diverse set of activators Both an ordered stepwise assembly and the recruitment of the 100 plus subunit holoenzyme have been proposed to be critical for the positioning of RNAPII at start sites of transcription Next the GTF TFIIH unwinds the DNA opens the transcription bubble and phosphorylates serines at position 5 in the C terminal domain CTD of the RPB1 subunit of RNAPII reviewed in 2 This phosphorylation is critical for the recruitment of complexes that put a 7 methylguanylate cap on the 5 end of nascent transcripts After the transcription complex clears the promoter the negative transcription elongation factor N TEF is recruited to the RNAPIIa reviewed in 3 It consists minimally of 5 6 dichloro 1 D ribofuranosylbenzimidazole riboside DRB sensitivity inducing factor DSIF 4 and negative elongation factor NELF 5 They bind and arrest RNAPII distal to the promoter cooperatively Such arrested transcription complexes have now been found on many inducible genes in Drosophila melanogaster reviewed in 6 and humans 7 The transition to robust elongation depends on the positive transcription elongation factor b P TEFb reviewed in 3 P TEFb contains the cyclin dependent kinase 9 CDK9 and one of four possible C type cyclins When recruited to stalled transcription complexes P TEFb phosphorylates serines at position 2 in the CTD 8 the Spt5 subunit of DSIF 9 and the RD subunit of NELF 10 These modifications result in heavily phosphorylated RNAPII RNAPIIo the recruitment of the Elongator which contains splicing and polyadenylation machineries and the conversions of DSIF and NELF into elongation factors RNAPIIo now copies the gene and directs the cotranscriptional processing i e splicing and polyadenylation of primary transcripts Upon successful polyA addition the CTD phosphatase FCP1 dephosphorylates RNAPIIo RNAPIIa dissociates from DNA and the transcription cycle starts all over again reviewed in 2 Tat is unique among transcriptional activators in eukaryotic cells in that it functions via RNA rather than DNA promoter elements Figure 1 It binds the transactivation response element TAR that forms a stable RNA stem loop at the 5 end of all viral transcripts Thus Tat requires minimally the transcription of TAR before it can stimulate HIV transcription from the long terminal repeat LTR Indeed in the absence of Tat RNAPIIa clears the HIV LTR successfully but soon arrests yielding predominantly short viral transcripts 11 Tat binds the 5 bulge in TAR via its arginine rich motif from positions 49 to 57 where a central arginine R52 is key for this interaction However this binding is not sufficient for Tat s function in vivo Adjacent to the arginine rich motif lie N terminal core and cysteine rich regions which form the activation domain of the protein This activation domain binds cyclin T1 CycT1 from P TEFb whose partner is CDK9 12 As a consequence P TEFb and Tat bind TAR cooperatively The final proof that P TEFb is the cellular cofactor for Tat came from studies of HIV transcription in murine cells where the introduction of the human CycT1 protein restores Tat function 12 The same effect can be achieved by substituting just the tyrosine with the cysteine at position 261 such as are found in murine and human CycT1 proteins respectively 13 A paper in this issue of PLoS Biology suggests that Tat and P TEFb can also recruit TAF independent transcription complexes to the HIV LTR 14 Figure 1 Possibly this assembly reflects interactions between CycT1 and the unphosphorylated CTD of RNAPIIa 15 The assembly and disassembly of the complex between PTEFb Tat and TAR is a regulated process in vivo Whereas the phosphorylation of CDK9 strengthens this complex 16 the acetylation of the lysine at position 50 in Tat weakens it 17 Upon this disruption acetylated Tat is liberated from P TEFb and recruits the p300 CREB binding protein associated factor P CAF to the elongating RNAPIIo most likely facilitating chromatin remodeling In this issue of PLoS Biology Pagans et al now demonstrate that acetylated Tat is deacetylated by SIRT1 18 Figure 1 In this way Tat can reassemble with P TEFb on TAR Clearly P TEFb plays a key role in the control of transcriptional elongation Although Tat was the first activator known that could recruit P TEFb to initiating RNAPII additional members of this group were soon identified They include the androgen receptor c Myc the class II transactivator CIITA myoblast determination protein MyoD and nuclear factor B NF B The last one is of great interest as it explains how the HIV genome can be transcribed before the synthesis of Tat 19 Cellular activation triggers the nuclear translocation of NF B where it binds the HIV enhancer leading to the stimulation of viral transcription It is not surprising that proviral latency in which low levels of transcription or only short HIV transcripts containing TAR are observed would in large part reflect the absence of these activators Indeed in many of these latently infected cells the induction of NF B or the addition of Tat leads to the reactivation of viral replication and spreading of the infection 20 21 Recently important aspects of the regulation of P TEFb have been revealed Figure 2 Of interest P TEFb exists in two complexes in cells 22 23 The larger measures approximately 500 kDa and contains the hexamethylene bisacetamide HMBA induced protein 1 HEXIM1 and 7SK small nuclear RNA snRNA in addition to P TEFb 24 25 In this large complex Cdk9 is enzymatically inactive HEXIM1 was identified as the inducible gene following the exposure of vascular smooth muscle cells to a potent differentiating agent HMBA 26 7SK snRNA is one of the most abundant snRNA species whose function remained a mystery for over a decade Of interest targeting of P TEFb by HEXIM1 and 7SK snRNA contributes significantly to the control of cell growth and differentiation For example growth signals liberate P TEFb from the large complex in the course of cardiac hypertrophy in mice a disease characterized by the enlargement of myocytes due to a global increase in mRNA synthesis 27 Also following stress ultraviolet light or the administration of actinomycin D and DRB to cells the large complex is converted to the small complex to stimulate transcription 22 23 How central is P TEFb to eukaryotic transcription In Saccharomyces cerevisiae there are two candidates for PTEFb CTDK 1 and Bur1 2 CTDK1 negative but not Bur1 Bur2 negative yeasts still grow albeit poorly and only on rich media reviewed in 2 In Caenorhabditis elegans genetic inactivation of CDK9 or CycT1 and CycT2 resulted in the inhibition of all RNAPII transcription 8 Moreover in D melanogaster following heat shock PTEFb is recruited upstream of activated promoters 28 Although no murine knockouts of subunits of P TEFb have been reported DRB and flavopiridol two ATP analogs that inhibit the kinase activity of CDK9 can inhibit nearly all transcription by RNAPII in human cells 29 Indeed as P TEFb is a coactivator of potent activators that mediate effects of enhancers and can itself activate transcription when placed on sites distal to promoter elements 15 it might mediate many more signaling events than those of heat shock ultraviolet light stress and hypertrophy Conversely the inhibition of P TEFb could explain the mode of action of some transcriptional repressors Indeed the global transcriptional repressor PIE 1 the regulator of embryogenesis in C elegans binds the histidine rich stretch in CycT1 thus decoying P TEFb away from RNAPII and blocking the elongation of transcription 30 These are exciting findings and suggest a plethora of future experiments including the genetic inactivation of subunits of P TEFb and isoforms of HEXIM1 in the mouse Of special interest are questions as to where to place this mechanism of transcriptional regulation in the hierarchy of competing or complementary processes What roles do different P TEFb complexes play in the transcription of specific genes How central will the regulation of P TEFb be to cellular growth proliferation and differentiation and what roles will it play in normal development and disease states As to HIV how can we use our knowledge of P TEFb to slow down viral replication and or to eliminate the state of proviral latency in the host Obviously we are only at the beginning of this journey which promises to change radically our view of eukaryotic transcription
