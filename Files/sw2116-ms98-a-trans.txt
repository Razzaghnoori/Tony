 well Jerry do you have a favorite team oh yeah uh the of course the Dallas Cowboys yeah Cowboys yeah i live live and die with them okay well they re rebuilding right now yet i think it s going to take them a couple more years before they can be a really good team yeah yeah yeah uh of course i guess really the reason i like the Cowboys is because SMU was my favorite team uh college pardon me college team and of course they started out with Don Meredith right and uh so that that tie there between SMU and the Cowboys i think the Cowboys have shown a lot of improvement this uh past year yeah uh Jerry Johnson surprised me okay i didn t think he was going to do very good because i thought he was a college football coach and not a professional coach yeah okay yeah i think a lot of people had that impression that uh that he ought he should have stayed in the college ranks but uh looks like they re going to do all right yeah yeah course he he came after a legend too Tom Landry so he had some uh tough row to hoe there my yeah big shoes to follow well my favorite team is a is a sentimental favorite uh the Green Bay Packers i grew up in that area and have been following them yeah yeah pardon my for coughing i ve been coming down with a cold been following the Packers ever since uh they won the first two Super Bowls yeah they used to have some uh bang up fights and dig in the trenches with the Cowboys the Ice Bowl and yeah they sure did i remember those the other uh games that they would play for the Super Bowls yeah i actually know some people that went to the Ice Bowl yeah at uh they had they had some good teams though they could have had a good year this year uh unfortunately the quarterback uh controversy they had where Don McCowskey got hurt and couldn t play most the season yeah yeah they spent an awful lot of money on him too a million and a half dollars for a one year contract yeah so i don t know if he s going to be in shape to and course they were they were kind of like the Cowboys in that after Lombardi who could fill his shoes uh huh but uh who did you root for in the Super Bowl i i didn t really have a favorite in the Super Bowl i just wanted to see a good game yeah both New York teams i i was tired of blow outs uh huh well that turned out to be a good game and it it was it was good to see a good good uh championship game i think Buffalo is an up an coming team they re going to they re showing some real promise for the next uh few years yeah the Giants are always uh always there perennially a good team yeah well their coach has a lot to do with that i think i think they had a lot of luck there too with Montana getting hurt in San Francisco yeah yeah i think if if he was uh healthy San Francisco would have stomped those guys it wouldn t have been much of a contest yeah yeah but uh there s a lot of parity now compared to what it used to be yeah i think it s getting better more competitive yeah uh we see uh teams getting in the play offs every now and then with uh five hundred records or a little below even yeah the uh AFC Central is a lot like that with uh Pittsburgh Cincinnati Cleveland and Houston nobody really dominated that division last year at all yeah yeah another one of my favorites was in the old uh AFL or the uh uh American Football League the Dallas Texans when they started right in fact they were they out drew the Cowboys there for quite a while okay i wasn t living here then so i can t talk much about that yeah but uh but some of these some of the uh i get a little disappointed sometime with with uh players now days compared with the old players it seems like most the players today are right are playing for the money rather than the the uh fun and for the uh competition that used to be in the older days well there s no doubt about that the money s there and the owners are willing to pay if unfortunately uh and you get star players like uh like Joe Montana making four million dollars a year and everybody else wants to match that type of salary now uh yeah right and of course the people end up paying for it are the fans yeah uh it s no wonder ticket prices are so high yeah i don t go to games myself uh uh yeah i can t afford to go to them no you you really can t not when it costs twenty six dollars a ticket and uh so much for parking nah you you take yeah you take just two just a man and wife by the time you pay the tickets the parking uh any kind of refreshments or anything there you can spend a hundred dollars right quick sure and not many people can afford to spend a hundred dollars on the weekend yeah i think the owners have somewhat lost sight on that because uh they are all wealthy people and uh the expect that uh the average Joe is going to be able to to go to a game and uh pay for that type of entertainment yeah yeah and also i don t like the deal uh with the uh Cowboys stadium where that you to get a decent seat you have to buy a season ticket sure the only seats they have available are in the end zone yeah it looks like Jerry Jones is trying to make as much money as he can out of this deal uh he s got his own TV show and he opened the Cowboy Corral out in in the parking lot there yeah yeah and uh every every opportunity there is to make a dollar he seems to be exploiting that yeah but that s that s true just about every i think there s still a lot of distrust for uh for an Arkansas man to come here and own uh uh Texas team a team in Texas yeah and uh i don t think that s going to die very quickly he is getting some support there were a lot of people that are uh that were skeptical and the Cowboys are coming back and they have a pretty good team Troy Aikman looks like to be looks like he s got the star qualities for a quarterback hum yeah yeah yeah if they ll just give him some protection and don t kill him before h e yeah well i was surprised at the the way they drafted last year they didn t really didn t go for the uh big offensive lineman or the defensive lineman they re going for the skilled positions so quarterbacks they really yeah really didn t need that type of uh player yeah and i you know i think defense really is what wins wins uh in the long run you can have the best half back there is or the best quarterback but if they don t have any blocking maybe they can t do anything yeah they ve got an awful lot of good draft picks coming up it s going to be interesting to see what they do with them yeah so hopefully we ll see some more improvement yeah and uh the other teams in the NFC East uh they re they re getting uh older uh they re going to have to like the Washington Redskins uh that that s an older team and they re going to have to start rebuilding pretty soon too yeah yeah looks like we ll reach a point of uh parity there where the Cowboys may start being a little more competitive with the rest of those teams yeah what i don t know what Philadelphia s going to do without Buddy Ryan it might be interesting to see uh i don t know i i have mixed emotions about him uh sometimes i like him but at the same times i love to see somebody beat him yeah he s uh one of those guys you love to hate because he s got a mouth on him kind of like uh Jerry Glanville yeah man you love to hate yeah they they do pick up the image of a team though uh and they create a lot of excitement locally so i think they re good for the game just because they are diverse and they bring a different attitude yeah yeah but um but he yeah to me he s just like the Yankees you just but uh they re not my favorite people either you love to see someone beat him uh huh but um they do have a good team well Buddy will probably get another job yeah and i think old uh i think Cunningham is an excellent quarterback oh he s great i saw him play when he as at uh UNLV he was not only the quarterback but the punter and he can punt the ball sixty yards no problem yeah yeah yeah i imaging he could play just about any position on the team except maybe a defensive lineman but he s a very excellent athlete he s a very good athlete that is true uh huh yeah Philadelphia expected to do a little better this past year unfortunately they uh they got cut a little short yeah well i don t they uh the games they lost lost i don t think they lost by any blowout i think they were all close games no i like the team i really really like the Eagles a lot but uh Buddy Ryan is not one of my favorite people so i wasn t too disappointed to see them lose no i i m wondering where he s going to wind up i don t think he s going to get a head coaching job this next year um he d be lucky if he can get an assistant uh job someplace yeah um he s just one of those guys he s created such a controversy in Philadelphia nobody wants to touch him right now yeah but uh he ll he ll wind somewhere i m sure he will he s not going to have problems there if not in the NFL then in one of the other leagues yeah i m kind of interested how this new uh league s going to summer league s going to fare the World Wide Area Football League WWAFL or whatever they call it WWAFL World Football League yeah yeah yeah i think that the NFL is going to use that league as uh uh kind of like as a minor league to recruit players yeah the way people talk about uh there s not that it won t be as good as the NFL because uh there s not that many good or quality football players i can t believe that not only that but they don t pay the money either yeah but uh uh it s very low uh scale compared to the NFL but uh i still think there s plenty of good football players around that just were not able to get on the NFL because the NFL s teams were just full right well some people i m sure the the more talented people in that league are going to try to uh impress NFL scouts with their play in that league yeah but yeah and wind up in the NFL possibly but that s that s uh one in a million shot if they have the talent to be in the NFL they re going to get drafted and make a pro team there aren t going to be too many people that that ll make uh the NFL out of uh WWALF yeah yeah yeah it will be like Italian basketball with the uh with with the uh NBA yeah some guys can come back and play in the NBA but most of them don t really don t have the physical skills or the talent right but uh i m i m looking forward to the season i think it s going to be fun yeah i think it will be a good year the Cowboys are showing constant
