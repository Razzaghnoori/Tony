 well Patricia i was just about to get on my tread mill and then i remembered that i didn t make a call last night and i thought i d make one tonight well i have an exercise bicycle in my bedroom but it usually s holding clothes that s what i did with mine for a long time put it on the handlebars so i can hang them up right and sometimes she just flops them all over the seat well that s not why i got it right how do you like your tread mill uh huh i like it you don t get is it less boring than the bicycle or not no it s just as boring you watch TV or something while you do it i read a book while i m doing it but i was doing that on the exercise bike oh yeah i do that too i feel like i m getting a little better of a workout and i m losing more weight on this than i had on the other and my legs you know how okay i m going to turn forty this summer i was getting all dimpled up really are you a yeah and those are going away really so that s real good uh aren t they kind we got it at a little bit of an incline are they kind of expensive uh this one yeah this is five hundred ooh i know they get cheaper but i don t know uh huh oh do they probably the more you pay though the better the machine you have well i hope so well you can believe that anyway right yeah i didn t buy it really my husband bought it because we we d we d never get out and go walking or anything and we go to the lake and we ski and swim in the summer but during the year yeah well in bad weather you know well you d have to do something inside do you work at TI besides that uh huh yeah uh huh not uh huh i think your voice sounds familiar really where do you work i live in Arlington i wonder if we talked before where do you live i m in Garland no uh well you sound like this girl that i talked to about books and we got into movies one night oh really uh huh uh no this is the first time i ve done it uh my husband was just running out the door he s working at night tonight so i decided to do it i haven t talked before uh what subjects have you talked about let s see education uh social changes that we ve seen in the last ten twenty thirty years yeah that one was well that s interesting it s more interesting than the treadmill and the bicycle right the most boring one was about what meal would you cook for a sit down dinner oh my goodness the other woman didn t cook too much either right they really have a lot of variety yeah they do i talked to this old woman that was a retired administrator in Ohio one night about education and she was oh a a school administrator well that could that would have been interesting uh huh she retired but yeah and then one night i talked to these two guys no one night i talked to one guy and then a couple of weeks later i talked to the guy s roommate in Virginia about different things really well that s neat uh huh one was about painting um when was the last time you painted something did you feel like you did a good job did you feel uh rewarded while you were doing it i don t know hm how long is this going to go on do you know i don t know i don t either it s interesting though i never heard of such a project before well how d you find out about it pardon me how did you find out about it oh i don t know i guess my husband got a letter at the office i i presume and they must have been asking does your husband work with TI uh huh oh

at TI uh huh well that s interesting i had no idea that was just for the employees and i couldn t understand i kept getting these calls i thought it was an advertisement and they just were also called TI you know there is Texas Industries and different things uh huh uh huh i kept hanging up on them for days until my husband told me what it was oh i didn t know well if you work for TI you re supposed to get a prize is what i heard and if you don t work for them you re supposed to get cash but then on the letter it says cash or prize yeah they really oh oh well the prizes are pretty nice
