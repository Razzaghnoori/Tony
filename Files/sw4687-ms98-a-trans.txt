                 well uh my opinion on taxation well could being in New York state where taxes are high and services are low   hm   i guess id have to say i dont think were getting our moneys worth as far as uh the tax system is concerned i think a lot of it is going to waste on uh services services that arent necessary and uh outofdate ideas that just dont make sense anymore in these times   yeah i i have to agree im uh right now im in Atlanta in Atlanta but i grew up and am from uh Utica New York so uh i understand and i agree with the uh New York situation situation   hm yeah its as a matter of fact they recently in our county here our state sales tax has been seven percent   right   pretty much forever well theyve just decided now when our county where i am is looking at upping the tax rate to eight percent to try and close a deficit uh that theyve found in the county budget here and uh   right   you know between the increases in the sales tax and of course we have the high state tax   right   now we have to look into the possibility of you know it if it isnt from the Bush administration with user fees its more direct taxation   right   i dont know what the taxes are like down in Georgia   well  its um its kind of tough to tell i havent really got no good feel for it yet the um ive been down here for only like six months so it um theyre not i dont think theyre quite as bad as they are in New York state i guess is my opinion right now um there is like there are theres a tax on food here which is you know a little bit different because they dont have that up there and and other than that right now theyre starting to realize that their taxes are low but they also realize that they still have to make sure their roads are paved and so on so theyre starting to talk about um raising like instead of registering or uh getting your license which costs five dollars now they decide to well maybe we should charge forty dollars for it   well they just did that up here too it Mario Mario raised it   right   up here um considerably and you know weve had our road road road taxes and gas tax the gas tax was such a Utica boondoggle being from Utica you probably   yeah   um remember when they put that into effect and how that was going to save our roads  and what it did is it all went to New York City to  refurbish that subway disaster   yeah that would right of course of course no that seems like were in from New York state i guess youre youre pretty much your main concern is yes you sit there and to allow um you know taxes like crazy and all you do is see all the money go in a big funnel towards New York City   well yeah its you you know roads this year have been especially bad they um here in Rochester theyve now because to save tax money and that they have turned off the expressway lights at night   oh yeah umhum yeah theyve been talking about doing that here too but they havent theyve almost been able to push it through but people started complaining and     well they just shoved it through here and you know to hell with people and uh put it into effect and then suddenly of course you know ever since every day in the newspaper here its   yeah   people complaining you know well it was only saving two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year its just were paying good tax money for this and   yeah   they turned it off yet theyre still giving money to all these bizarre things in New York City the roads arent any better here   right right   and uh even the town here where i am in um the taxes have increased again i mean they just cant push property taxes any higher thats why theyre looking at this sales tax business now   yeah yeah thats down here theyre um that im amazed at the one cheap thing down here is gas im not sure what the price is up there but that down here its only like eighty nine cents per per gallon   oh thats not moving you know that Mario up here is were i just filled up tonight it was a dollar its a dollar fifteen nine a gallon     yeah i was home over at Christmas break and it was i saw the gas prices and it was like boy what a switch     well you know we also have a somewhat of a monopoly here of the gas suppliers you know anywhere else in the state its uh probably a nickel less but they say its going to increase around the summer time to a dollar twenty five up here   yeah oh sure yeah   which is insane   yep well as soon as they get near Memorial Day people start traveling and everyone knows it so weve got to raise the gas prices   yeah   so   oh well its its its interesting topic coming two days from tax day   yes i know i and i just i actually had filed earlier and i got my refund tonight actually small but small but uh i got it back anyway   yeah were   were just sitting down tonight to get ours filled out were going to do it were going to do it and were going to get we were doing software to do it and then you know put off put it off put it off   oh oh yeah yep   now tonight being two days left   yeah well its pretty pretty frustrating when you see the whole situation it doesnt seem as though   okay
