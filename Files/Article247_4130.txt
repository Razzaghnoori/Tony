 Ghosts of Trotsky in Arizona Margo It makes me happy that you feel comfortable calling me Massa Honey and I like the idea of Gary Bauer dolls Evangelical children across the country will want one for Christmas When you rub Gary s belly he says Welcome the unborn into the world and then emits a cute little giggle I am contrarian on the subject of Gary Bauer Let s set aside any of our quibbles with his positions I actually think he s a smart ideologically consistent guy who makes his case in a reasonable way But far more than Keyes is hobbled by race Bauer is hobbled by looks No profile can resist mentioning that he s short and looks like a lizard Last night Gary s questioning of Bush was especially shrewd He asked whether Chinese bad behavior would ever deserve sanctions Would Bush want to punish them if they doubled the number of slave labor camps Increased tenfold the number of forced abortions It made Bush squirm Bauer really has played a big role in helping put the China issue on the table and he deserves credit for this Let me bore you with a few Bauer tidbits 1 Bush thinks Bauer is a nitwit and has never had patience for the guy Bush looked physically pained being questioned by him 2 The McCain people are afraid that Bauer will be the social conservative to survive the New Hampshire primary Their fear Bauer will tag team with Bush to beat up on McCain because McCain isn t pro life enough This is what I love about watching the leadership of the religious right They are the closest living things to Trotskyites I should know Full disclosure Trotsky was my cousin The family never forgave him for changing his name from Bronstein They think about politics and power in a way far more calculating than we can imagine They will enter into popular front alliances to force their issues onto the agenda And they bicker among themselves endlessly Last night a friend tried to describe to me the differences between West Coast Straussians and East Coast ones apparently this is an important split among social conservatives over the teachings of philosopher Leo Strauss The debate revolves around the importance of the Declaration of Independence to conservatives I ll try to figure out more by my next dispatch The hotel bar is not nearly so glamorous as you would think For starters I never seem to know any of the truly good dish Besides the late night at the hotel bar is used to lay the groundwork to get good dish later Political reporting is like selling insurance it s about relationships I am hoping that my cultivation of spinmeisters tonight will score me scoops down the road Does that make me as calculating as the religious right and the Trotskyites I think so Your sectarian friend Frank
