values and vices That function is now provided by our daily papers which offer a kind of ongoing myth related to but not a literal rendering of any actual events much as the Old Testament account of Noah s Ark may allude to an actual flood but it doesn t really matter A more simplistic version of our National Mythology is provided by TV news the Classics Comic version the Cliff Notes This serialized myth presents a roster of stock characters among them the erotic dynamo male the erotic dynamo female the sexless genius male only the sexless workaholic female only the amiable doofus to nobly embody or disgracefully lack the qualities we prize If you follow our Ongoing Epic you become familiar with these characters handy for making metaphors or making conversation with your fellow North Americans This theory also gets at the proliferating sections of many daily papers devoted to so much that is clearly not news developments in TV sitcoms personal lives of athletes chefs These aspects of life provide additional character types imps and demigods nymphs and satyrs to further populate our great saga If we lived in ancient Athens we d sprinkle our conversations with references

s not a writer Deep yogurt Dr Mitchell Rabkin is a coy metaphor for deep trouble Does Your Doctor s Size Count Extra An ad for the Barron Centers runs in today s New York Times under the banner When
