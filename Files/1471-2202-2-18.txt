 Background Febrile seizures are the most prevalent type of seizures experienced by children affecting up to 5 of the world s population 1 Although most febrile seizures are benign and do not require treatment they are distressing to parents and in a few circumstances can increase the risk of subsequent epilepsy 2 In clinical practice therapy for febrile seizures presently is unsatisfactory since clinical data are insufficient to document efficacy of most anti epileptic drugs 3 The most commonly used drug phenobarbital has significant deleterious effects on learning and behavior A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of febrile seizures might lead to new strategies of prevention or treatment 4 Recent work has identified several genes associated with familial febrile seizure tendencies 5 6 7 Some of these genes code for ion channels that govern excitability of nerve tissue We recently published a study of the characteristic hyperthermic responses represented as epileptiform like population spike activity accompanied by spreading depression SD in a rat hippocampal slice which may serve as an in vitro model of febrile seizures 8 The hyperthermic response was age dependent occurring almost exclusively in young but not newborn rats The primary underlying abnormality in this model was inability of neuronal tissue properly to regulate extracellular potassium concentrations During heating of the slice extracellular potassium concentrations rose transiently from the normal 5 mM to as high as 40 mM and extracellular field potential shitted about 20 mV negative a reversible condition known as SD During the early phases of SD neurons burst synchronously in a pattern analogous to seizures Since hyperthermic epileptiform like population bursts exhibited the frequency of oscillations 30 100 Hz we hypothesized that GABA A receptor governed oscillations might underlie the cellular basis of hyperthermic epileptiform like population spike activity The frequency oscillations 30 100 Hz are characteristic of responses to sensory input measured by cortical EEG 9 In the hippocampal slice preparation oscillations can be evoked by brief high frequency tetanic stimuli to region CA1 10 11 12 13 The extracellular field potential response during these oscillations takes the form of a train of population spikes in stratum pyramidal at and 15 30 Hz frequencies 14 Intracellular recordings during oscillations induced by tetanic stimulation reveal a slow membrane depolarization in conjunction with GABA A receptor mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials 11 15 This synaptic inhibition based activity entrains action potential generation in pyramidal neurons leading to the population spikes at band frequencies The specific GABA A receptor antagonist bicuculline blocks the oscillations 14 16 an action that can be modeled by simulated neuronal networks 17 The band oscillations appear to play an important role in generation of ictal epileptiform activity in hippocampal slices 18 This study explores the role of oscillations in epileptiform activity in the hyperthermic rat hippocampal slice Results Hyperthermia induced epileptiform like population spike activity More than 90 of slices heated to 40 C showed a febrile seizure like event represented as initial epileptiform like population bursts followed by SDs Figure 1Ashows a typical febrile seizure like event elicited by heating a hippocampal slice from 33 9 to 38 2 C The epileptiform discharges demonstrated a frequency of 80 Hz Fig 1B within the 30 100 Hz oscillation range Summary of data from 24 slices showed that 71 17 24 of hyperthermic epileptiform like population spike activity fired at a frequency range between 30 50 Hz Fig 1C D with a mean oscillation frequency of 45 9 3 0 mean SE n 24 Comparison of post tetanic oscillation and hyperthermic population spike activity Figure 2shows the comparison between hyperthermic population spike activity and post tetanic oscillations In standard artificial cerebrospinal fluid ACSF a tetanic stimulation at 100 Hz 100 sec 2 mA for 200 ms 20 trains elicited and frequency population spikes visible both with intracellular and extracellular recordings In the same slice heating to 38 C 2Ab evoked population oscillation very similar to those of post tetanic oscillations Power spectrum analysis of the population of responses among all slices showed similar frequency peak of hyperthermic and post tetanic gamma oscillations Fig 2B Among all slices hyperthermic oscillations occurred at a frequency of 45 9 3 0 Hz mean SE n 24 and post tetanic gamma oscillations at 47 1 2 6 mean SE n 34 These two frequencies do not significantly differ Fig 2C Effects of high intensity tetanic stimulation Results from this and our previous study showed that the SD always followed hyperthermic bursts 8 but tetanic stimulation induced only oscillations in the absence of SD Fig 2 Therefore we investigated whether high intensity tetanic stimulation could induce oscillations followed by SD Fig 3Aillustrates a weak oscillation of field potential in response to tetanic stimulation at 2 25 mA Tetanic stimulation at 3 25 mA induced a strong oscillation with a large field burst amplitude and long lasting depolarization Fig 3B In 6 of 7 tested slices tetanic stimulation at 4 25 mA induced not only prominent oscillations but also SDs Fig 3C These post tetanic depolarizations had duration and time course very similar to those of hyperthermic SDs Fig 1A 2Ab Effects of bicuculline We utilized the specific GABA A receptor antagonist bicuculline methiodide BMI to ascertain whether oscillations were dependent upon GABAergic mechanisms The effect of BMI on the field potential in region CA1 is shown in Fig 4 Bath applied BMI 5 M changed the single evoked population spike to multiple spikes in a reversible manner In the same slice tetanic stimulation delivered in control artificial cerebrospinal fluid ACSF induced typical oscillations and these oscillations were abolished by addition of BMI to the perfusate oscillations recovered partially by 80 minutes of wash in ACSF Figure 4Bshows another case in which high intensity of tetanic stimulation was applied to elicit oscillations and SDs Addition of 20 M BMI reversibly blocked oscillations but not the SD In a second set of experiments using five slices Fig 5 we examined the effects of BMI on hyperthermic epileptiform like population bursts Bath application of 10 M BMI for 20 min abolished post tetanic oscillations After several minutes of exposure to BMI slices demonstrated rhythmic spontaneous bursts of population spikes Fig 5B indicating that GABA A receptors have been blocked by BMI Under these conditions heating of the slice only evoked the SD without the initial population spikes Fig 5C Effects of kynurenic acid and QX 314 Figure 6Ashows the effect of the ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenic acid Kyn A 7 mM on oscillations Kyn A dramatically attenuated evoked synaptic transmission but failed to prevent hyperthermia induced oscillations and slow SDs suggesting that excitatory synaptic transmission is not necessary for hyperthermic oscillations and SDs In Fig 6B 30 mM QX 314 was incorporated into the recording electrode The action potentials were blocked by intracellular QX 313 diffusion Heating the slice to 37 C elicited a oscillation followed by a slow SD in the extracellular field recording However the intracellularly recorded hyperthermic oscillation disappeared and was replaced by a smooth depolarization Fig 6B Discussion Gamma oscillations underlie hyperthermic epileptiform like population spikes Gamma oscillations are defined as coherent cortical oscillations at 30 100 Hz band frequency frequencies in in vivo and in vitro models In hippocampal slice preparations oscillations can be triggered by high frequency tetanic stimuli called post tetanic oscillations 10 11 12 13 In addition to post tetanic oscillations the oscillations also can be elicited by metabotropic glutamate receptor agonists carbacol or free extracellular Mg 2 18 19 In this study we report that oscillations can occur in a model of a clinical disorder namely hyperthermia Hyperthermic epileptiform like population spikes occur within the band of frequencies 30 100 Hz Post tetanic oscillations can be mimicked by hyperthermic stimulation in the same slice Tetanic stimulation at high intensity induces initial oscillations followed by a slow SD which resembles hyperthermic epileptiform like population spikes followed by a slow SD Finally both post tetanic oscillations and hyperthermic epileptiform like population spikes were completely blocked by a GABA A receptor antagonist BMI This experimental evidence suggests that the GABA A receptor governed oscillations underlie the hyperthermic population spikes in our in vitro model system Possible mechanisms of hyperthermic oscillation Accumulating lines of evidence demonstrate that the genesis mechanisms for post tetanic oscillations involve slow GABA A receptor mediated depolarization extracellular K elevation and field effects 10 11 12 13 The present study showed that these three major factors also underlie hyperthermic oscillations As shown in Fig 1Aand 2A the hyperthermic oscillations always overlie the slow membrane depolarizations For post tetanic oscillations the slow depolarizations were mediated by tetanic stimulation induced GABAergic depolarizing action 20 21 22 23 This GABAergic depolarization is attributed to the tetanic stimulation induced accumulation of intracellular chloride 24 and extracellular potassium 22 For hyperthermic oscillations heating causes a Na K pump failure 8 in turn resulting in the accumulation of intracellular Na and Cl as well as extracellular K finally causing a slow membrane depolarization In our previous report the extracellular K indeed elevated dramatically during hyperthermia induced epileptiform like population spikes and SDs 8 Field effects further contribute to post tetanic oscillations 25 26 High Frequency tetanic stimuli leads to cellular swelling 27 28 increasing extracellular resistance According to Ohm s law this increases the voltage deflection recorded for a given current flowing through this extracellular resistance Current generated by the active population travels through the resistances of the extracellular space and of the nearby inactive cells therefore producing the extracellular population spikes and meanwhile depolarizing the inactive cells In this manner inactive cells are brought closer to threshold enhancing their opportunity to firing together 29 30 31 The extracellular resistance is the major determinant of field effect strength 32 Since the extracellular volume fraction in CA1 stradium pyramidal is only 12 compared with approximately 18 in CA3 and granule cells 33 the CA1 pyramidal cells are particularly susceptible to field effects The accumulation of extracellular K during hyperthermic SDs depolarizes membrane potential which triggers initial oscillations Cell swelling reduces the extracellular space which triggers slow SDs 8 Fig 1Aand 2A In Fig 6A after blockade of synaptic transmission by kynurenic acid 7 mM heating the slice still induced oscillation followed by SD suggesting that a non synaptic mechanism local field effect may be involved in the generation of hyperthermic oscillations and SDs Figure 6Bdemonstrated that hyperthermic oscillations disappear in the presence of an intracellularly delivered Na channel blocker QX 314 30 mM Gamma oscillations and seizures Epileptic activity can result from an imbalance between glutamatergic excitation and GABAergic inhibition However this simple balance model has been challenged by findings that GABAergic transmission remains effective in some epilepsy models in epileptogenic human tissue 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 and by current findings of the excitatory effects of GABA 18 22 23 Therefore the GABA excitatory effects may work as a possible ictogenic mechanism under some special condition such as tetanic stimulation Indeed recently K hling et al reported that under epileptogenic condition free Mg 2 in ACSF band oscillations arise from GABAergic depolarizations and that this activity may lead to the generation of ictal discharges 18 It has been reported that prolonged periods of oscillations are associated with temporal lobe seizures in in vivo rats 41 Furthermore human EEG studies with subdural recording electodes showed that a band oscillation could be recorded at the start of typical seizure activity 42 In this respect the hyperthermic oscillations may also play a critical role in generation of neuronal epileptiform activity The extent to which the hyperthermic slice serves as a model of febrile seizures remains to be determined If oscillations do prove to be important in clinical febrile seizures then future work might profitably examine the therapeutic potential of mild disinhibition to disrupt inhibitory GABA mediated synchrony at the start of ictal activity Conclusions In the in vitro hippocampal slice preparation hyperthermia induced epileptiform like population spikes are at band frequencies and can be blocked by BMI Therefore the GABA A receptor governed oscillations underlie the hyperthermic population spikes in immature hippocampal slices Materials and methods Experiments were performed on transverse hippocampal slices prepared from Sprague Dawley rats ages 17 to 29 days Rats were anesthetized with halothane and decapitated The brain tissue was removed rapidly and placed in iced artificial cerebrospinal fluid ACSF Brain tissue was then glued to a cryotome and a few 450 500 transverse slices were cut through the hippocampal formations Slices were allowed to incubate and recover for at least an hour in room temperature ACSF comprised

recording chamber FST air liquid interface chamber and suspended on nylon net at the interface Carbogen 95 O 2 plus 5 CO 2 was bubbled across the upper surface of the slice Temperature was regulated by a feedback circuit accurate to 0 5 0 2 C Baseline temperature was 34 C After verification of evoked population spike stability for three consecutive stimuli over a time course of 15 30 minutes bath temperature set point was increased to 41 C and notation was made of actual temperature measured by a thermistor probe Extracellular field potentials were recorded with a borosilicate glass micropipette pulled to a tip diameter of 1 filled with 2 M sodium chloride and with resistance approximately 1 10 M Intracellular recordings were performed with a pulled glass fine tip micropipette 1 with resistance approximately 80 110 M filled with 4 M potassium acetate Hyperthermic spreading depressions SDs were considered to have occurred when all of the following conditions were met 1 At least 10 mV extracellular negativity 2 Duration of extracellular negativity at the half height of at least 10 seconds 3 Loss of evoked field in CA1 and recovery of field to at least 50 of control amplitude within 30 minutes of cooling to baseline temperature Electrophysiological data were stored on a computer Axon scope and played back on a laser printer Slow potentials including extracellular field during SD also were recorded on a continuous rectilinear chart recorder To measure oscillation frequency we chose a slice oscillation range beginning at 200 ms then used the frequency count
