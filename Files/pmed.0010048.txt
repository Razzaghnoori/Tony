                            Highly active antiretroviral therapy HAART for the treatment of individuals infected        by HIV is limited by high costs drug resistance and drugrelated toxicities This has        led researchers to investigate new treatment options including ways to boost immune        responses to better control HIV One such approach has been termed supervised treatment        interruption STIin which HAART is intermittently stopped once viral load has been        reduced to a low level in order to boost natural immunity by brief exposure to virus The        goal is to allow for the eventual discontinuation of drug treatment        Preliminary evidence published by Bruce Walker and his colleagues from Harvard Medical        School in         Nature in  suggested that this approach worked in persons treated in        the earliest stages of acute HIV infection HIV viral loads in newly infected patients        remained suppressed for a median of six months after therapy had been stopped However a        follow up paper published this month in         PLoS Medicine by the same research group shows that the viral load        rebounded in eight of the  patients by one year        The findings are very straightforward and very important comments Danny Douek from        the Vaccine Research Center National Institutes of Health United States who was not        involved in the study In almost every case virus rebounded and no clinical benefit from        the interruption could be determined        Walkers team first considered the possibility of STI in  after they demonstrated        that HAART given to patients recently infected with HIV could protect T helper cells which        are normally destroyed in the earliest stages of infection They hypothesized that early        treatment of acute HIV infection with HAART might boost the immune response allowing it        to control the HIV infection without the need for continuous therapy We did not know at        that time whether the T helper cells would be functional explains Walker The only way        to tell this was to stop medications and see if the immune response could control the        virus        To test this hypothesis the researchers did an openlabel trial of STIs they published        data from six months followup in the         Nature paper The key finding was that we were able to get at least        transient control of virus in all eight persons studied and in five of eight the viral        load was less than  copies very low at the time of publication explains Walker        However at that point they did not know how long the protective effects would last        The first evidence that protection was not complete came two years later when Walkers        team reported a case of superinfection one of the patients in the original experiment was        infected with a second strain of HIV even though the first virus was still well        controlled This paper was important because it indicated that the amount of immunity        might be enough for the persons own virus but might not protect against closely related        viruses circulating in the population says Walker        The         PLoS Medicine study adds more concern since it shows that although most        persons can indeed transiently control their own virus they do so for only a limited        amount of time We expanded the study to  persons and now have about five years of        followup on some of the patients says Walker Although we were able to use early        treatment and structured treatment interruption to boost immunity and have  of         patients control their virus most of the persons ultimately broke through meaning that        they had a recurrence of viremia At the present time the researchers do not know what        causes the loss of viral control        Walker and colleagues conclude that treatment interruptions should probably be avoided        outside the setting of controlled clinical trials whereas Douek goes a step further The        study shows that even early shortterm treatment and structured treatment interruptions        using current strategies impart only transient benefit and are unlikely to serve as a        reasonable therapeutic option in the future
