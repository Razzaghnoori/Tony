 Baitgate or the Corruption of David Hale With the closing of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr s Little Rock Ark grand jury last week the commentariat pronounced that the Whitewater scandal had passed with the president emerging unindicted and unscathed But another Whitewater scandal which neither implicates the Clintons nor involves shady land deals still has legs On the basis of evidence initially published in Salon the Justice Department has called for an investigation of charges that the conservative American Spectator magazine paid off Starr s star Whitewater witness David Hale Right wingers bark back that Salon is a mere conduit for White House spin Did Hale take money Is he at the nexus of a right wing conspiracy Or is this alleged right wing conspiracy an invention of a left wing conspiracy First a Whitewater refresher In 1993 Hale the head of an investment firm accused Bill Clinton of pressuring him to make a fraudulent 300 000 loan to Clinton s business partner Susan McDougal some of which flowed into the Whitewater project Hale s testimony helped persuade Janet Reno to appoint an independent counsel first Robert Fiske then Starr to investigate However a March article by Salon s investigative reporters Jonathan Broder and Murray Waas implied Hale s motives were less than pure The reporters say Hale repeatedly received payments that originated with Pittsburgh billionaire Richard Mellon Scaif e the alleged ringmaster of a right wing conspiracy aimed at the Clinton presidency Between 1993 and 1997 Scaife gave the Spectator and the foundation that runs it 2 4 million to track down dirt on Clinton s alleged malfeasance Click to read about this Arkansas Project A lawyer on the Spectator s board Steven Boynton in turn paid his friend Parker Dozhier a onetime TV reporter who now owns a bait shop in Hot Springs 48 000 to be the magazine s Arkansas eyes and ears For two years Salon says Dozhier used Spectator money to support Hale an old friend Salon also alleges that on Hale s trips to Dozhier s bait shop the two concocted elaborate schemes to sink Clinton Here s a flow chart to help you track the alleged money trail Nobody disputes that Hale frequently visited Dozhier or that the two discussed Whitewater the investigation did after all consume Hale s life And Dozhier concedes he lent Hale a pickup truck for two years paid his auto insurance and gave him about 300 to pay bills But he denies any intent to influence Hale s testimony The main source for Salon s article is Dozhier s ex girlfriend Caryn Mann who says Dozhier drastically underestimates the payments to Hale First she told Salon that though she didn t have an accurate fix on the amount paid it was substantial Click here to read the Salon story touting her testimony In an article that appeared six days later she recovered her memory and fixed the figure at 200 000 Click here to read the story with this version In later interviews she backed down from this number admitting that she doesn t recall seeing Dozhier give Hale cash Mann s credibility has been attacked by the Weekly Standard and the Washington Times who ridicule her for using tarot cards and allegedly boasting about transporting soldiers telepathically They also say she s a former Democratic operative and still seething from an acrimonious breakup with Dozhier Click to read about Dozhier s own credibility problems The testimony of her son Joshua Rand is far more vivid and detailed He says he saw Dozhier give Hale money on every occasion that Hale visited their trailer According to accounts that Rand gave both the Post and Salon the amounts ranged from 20 to several hundred dollars with an estimated total of 5 000 Rand admits the figure he provides is only an estimate Broder and Waas say they have spoken with two ex Spectator employees who anonymously corroborate Mann and Rand s assertion that the Arkansas Project paid Hale No other reporter working on the story has been able to track down these sources Even if the payments to Hale were conclusively proved they don t necessarily undermine his Whitewater testimony Newsweek s Michael Isikoff then at the Washington Post reported Hale s story on Nov 2 1993 months before the Spectator made any of the alleged payments to Hale Hale s story hasn t changed at all since he spoke with Isikoff in 93 Other reporters covering the story posit another scenario Financially ruined Hale was fined 2 million in 1994 he hung around Dozhier s bait shop looking for and receiving petty handouts In addition to attacking the story s source right wingers attack its purveyors Broder and Waas The Weekly Standard recycles the story that Broder had been fired from his job at the Chicago Tribune when he plagiarized from the Jerusalem Post s Joel Greenberg Others point to Waas supposedly shoddy reporting of a Pulitzer Prize nominated article on arms sales to Iraq that he co wrote for the Los Angeles Times There is no evidence that the pair repeated any of these alleged sins in their reporting on Hale Broder and Waas never explicitly claim that the Spectator money swayed Hale They let others tease out the implications of their story for them connecting the dots among Scaife Starr and Hale The billionaire endowed a position for Starr at Pepperdine University which Starr has subsequently declined and then bankrolled Hale Starr s chief witness This is the scenario implied by U S Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder who suggested that the Justice Department rather than a biased independent counsel should investigate Baitgate Others such as Rep John Conyers D Mich have used the Hale case to call for Starr s resignation Conservatives counter Salon s posited right wing conspiracy by charging that the Webzine is a pawn in a conspiracy by the left They note Broder s friendship with Clinton s now famous assistant Sidney Blumenthal R Emmett Tyrrell Jr editor of the Spectator goes further Salon he says is bankrolled by companies run by Clinton donors Apple Steve Jobs Adobe John Warnock and Hambrecht Quist William Hambrecht now retired Last week right winger Larry Klayman head of Judicial Watch subpoenaed Waas and ordered Salon reporters to produce all their notes relating to the Monica Lewinsky allegation as well as to Whitewater To read about how Klayman can do this click
