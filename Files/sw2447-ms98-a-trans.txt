 probably uh the lifestyles and the size of the area we live in and an age can make a very difference in how credit cards are used um at this point in life i do not carry a credit card that i have to pay a service charge on uh huh none at all huh right uh we used to have American Express and uh Visa that of course there s a yearly fee on i see yeah has it and we got rid of those we now have Discover we have a Visa that does not have a yearly fee and then we have a card that our bank put out on a promotion this year that uh of the first year there is no yearly fee and of course we don t plan on keeping it the second year uh huh uh huh yeah that because i m pretty frugal about things like that that s what we we got rid of an American Express card for the same reason is though we have a a credit union and we get our cards our other MasterCards for free so we don t have to pay a a fee at all uh huh and that s what i i know people who don t have any credit cards at all and i m always amazed because i don t know how they can get by without them it doesn t seem like you can do anything anymore without a credit card we find it especially useful because my husband retired over a year ago and we travel quite a bit and we we like to leave a credit card when we check into a motel in case we want to make a phone call or uh huh whatever which we do pretty often and and uh fact in a lot of motels we noticed from our most recent trip they that you do not even get the telephone turned on in your room unless you ve left a credit card at the desk uh huh uh huh so i suppose for that reason we will always have a credit card of some kind but yeah i like them too with with us we ve got insurance of course but due to my husband s work but by the time like two weeks ago we all got sick all four us and one kid had to go to the doctor twice and then all the other the the rest of us did and he was like six hundred dollars yeah and it was we were we all had it was a viral pneumonia it was really bad and and we were just horribly sick but i mean six hundred dollars i can t come up with oh my uh huh can you do that on a credit card yeah all the doctors here will take a Visa so that and you know and go to KMart and use the pharmacy to pay for the uh medicines and then turn it all into the insurance company and wait for it to come back oh for heaven sakes for the drugs yeah uh huh you know and so our part of it was still twenty percent but twenty percent i can payoff in one month whereas you know then i got to wait for the rest the rest of it to come back from Aetna but it basically floats uh huh you know during the the time because we ve got a thirty day grace period on the credit card as long as you pay it you know within that time and that s usually enough time for the insurance to get back oh uh huh uh huh i try to make that our biggest use of credit cards i know people who are so in debt people who have five Visa cards i can t believe you know it s like why did you go get they charged up one so then they but they were still paying their minimum so their credit rating was still good uh yes uh huh uh huh uh huh and and you would you know they get this in the mail say oh well we can t use that one anymore we ll just get another one and that s like who you i have a girlfriend who has one that her husband doesn t know she has now uh she must rent a p post office box or something or i mean she couldn t beat him to the mail every month i wouldn t think oh yeah because they both work and they uh he s a fireman so he s home two days a week that she teaches and would not be there so i don t know how she manages it but she keeps that a secret and i would not want to pay her monthly uh huh interest rate on the thing it just has to be awful because it oh yeah but that s that s a good way to make a big problem in your marriage real quick gosh that s just dishonest oh oh i would think so but they ve been married almost thirty five years so i think they ve done things like that to each other for a long time oh well maybe maybe they ll be all right i know in mine if i did something like that and then my husband found out jeez he would just be well i i think i would feel the same way i d i d really feel like i d been deceived you know that that wasn t the thing to do uh huh yes yes well many many many many years ago uh i bought wallpaper we have a large kitchen uh dining kitchen family room combination and i wanted to paper it and i bought wallpaper from Sears catalog on my Sears card and at that time i was only able to pay about ten dollars a month which meant i was taking about eight dollars a month off uh huh the balance by the time they got their interest out of it and it took forever to pay it off and at that point i promised myself i would never pay interest on a credit card again so that s kind of been my motto um yeah we ve tried to do that we ve paid ours off you know all the way down to where we had everything down to zero and especially right before i i quit work two years ago to stay home with the kids and right and before i left we had everything paid off we were in great shape we were putting money you know because we were both working we were finally putting money in uh huh but we ve gone back the other way to some extent because because just because there are times when you just can t pay it all uh huh uh huh because there are just too many bills well as you say when you re taking children to the doctor and adults too it does make a difference our children are matured out of the home and uh our needs are much different than they were yeah uh huh uh when we were raising a family i think back then we just now we feel like we might could live without one but uh we have a Discover card and i have to laugh about the cash back do you have one of those oh isn t that silly i i sent that one back because we had used it for a year and we had used a thousand dollars worth during the year and what we and and i think we got back fifty cents or something it was like please what is this this is and the interest on it was was eighteen or nineteen percent did you yeah yeah oh and our Visa card was we could get through our credit union was like fourteen percent so we just we sent it back we yeah we keep gas credit cards and we have Visa and then i have started my own business i have a photography business and i went ahead and got a separate Visa just for that photography business because there are things that i have to buy yeah and with my photography when i when i take things to the lab to get developed it s several hundred dollars at a time and i was using up all of our personal credit uh huh with my photography business even though again it s paying off every month because i m i m putting everything uh huh i m i m uh you know i m getting the pictures and i m taking them back to the people i already have their money but i wasn t depositing them until i gave them the pictures back uh huh uh huh another practice i found i m going to have to stop hot checks you wouldn t think for a for a twelve dollar school picture that uh that people would write a hot check but they do oh oh i see oh dear well uh huh i think those are the same people who have their credit cards uh charged up to the max and that s just a way of life i guess i guess it s just you know and when i think about that lady this this particular lady who wrote me a check for twelve dollars and it bounced and i sent it through you know sent it through the check through the bank once and she incurred at least a fifteen dollar fee uh huh uh huh uh huh for a returned check so now she s already doubled the price of her check and i ve s ent it through a second time because they said there s money in the account now uh huh you know and and if it doesn t go through the second time that woman s out thirty bucks for one twelve dollar check it s never quite made sense to me but then uh for one twelve dollar check when my husband was in business he had one customer who said that he had to use credit cards because he spent more than he made every month and he was perfectly serious about it gosh so i don t know why he you know didn t go ahead and project to the fact that eventually that was going to catch up with him but yeah he s going to have a debt going out the ear uh huh i was very glad my husband retired and got away from that kind of thing so we ve we have a little problem with our gas card we re uh we ve always used a Mobile card because he was affiliated with Mobile Oil and uh uh huh we it s very difficult to find their stations so i guess that s one reason why we use uh we ve used Discover and Visa quite a bit for fuel even uh uh huh yeah well we have a lot of Mobile stations around here and i used to use that card almost exclusively but now they re charging the extra five cents to use your credit card and Texaco and Chevron and somebody else is not anymore they ll take it you know at the cash price or you they ll now let you write a check if you have their card so you pay for it immediately instead of um you know putting it off for a month uh huh i thought that was illegal what s that writing a check for gas no no no to uh put a surcharge on a credit card of well all of them down down here you had a cash price for gasoline and a credit card price oh so what they re doing they re discounting for cash is the way they re because i think it is illegal to add a surcharge so right that s that s supposedly that s that they re looking at it differently it amounts to that you have to pay extra if you use your credit card but uh huh right and and they ve changed that now now stop it go play and leave me alone yeah and so i m using the other ones now because they re just as easy to get to and then they re nickel a gallon cheaper so yeah so what we re saying is that we use a credit card when it uh is convenient but if it s going to cost us money we don t though yes we try not to we re probably the only two people in the United States the bank the banks don t want to hear from us because they want those people who charge it up to ten thousand dollars uh and then get all yeah and then pay fifty dollars a month and it all goes to interest probably and leave us uh huh oh i guess they must they must make a ton there s not too many places you can make eighteen percent interest on things anymore that s right that s right that s what we need see you and i need to get in the credit card business we need to start our own credit card if you can yeah because you sure can t get that interest anyway else gosh i guess so that would be wonderful wouldn t it huh uh huh uh not on those CD s we re trying to live on uh yeah oh yeah ours are like seven percent we ve got one and with with IRA stuff in it and uh uh huh jeez you can t get any interest rates yeah my folks have just retired just in the last couple of months my dad has and uh they re trying to figure out you know what they re doing with stuff and my mom s in there cutting up the credit cards you know can t use these anymore and um hum sure sure yeah well like i say the only reason we do in fact i when my husband and i were
