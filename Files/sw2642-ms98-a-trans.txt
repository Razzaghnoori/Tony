           okay how do you feel about them   well i keep trying to get away from them i used to use a lot of credit cards i guess for a while i would use you know a variety of the the Visa and the MasterCard and the stores but i think i i impulse buy too much with them or i buy things you know i see it on sale and i think oh its on sale i have to get it and i really dont need it or i really havent budgeted for it so um the last couple of years i really have tried not to use them at all what about you   yeah well we have this philosophy we use it when we go off somewhere but we pay for it as soon as we come back you know as soon as we get our bills we pay it off and we only have one we tore all the rest of them up   umhum umhum okay   because i dont like credit cards for one thing you know i mean theyre okay i guess if youre on a trip or something you dont have to take a whole bunch of you know cash with you but i dont like using   umhum right   because ive seen too many people that used them and ended up bankrupt or on chapter thirteen and stuff like that because they have this weird opinion that if you use that card you dont have to pay for it   hum uhhuh thats true if if its on the credit card it doesnt seem like its money out of your pocket and sometimes you may think well i dont have the money so you use the credit card its like fake money or something   yeah yeah and it gives you a sense um a false sense of security or something it seems like because you say oh well i dont have to pay for it now but youre going to have to pay for it and it seems like   yeah you think well i dont have it now but payday will come and then ill have the money but thats probably paying for things that were still owed from last time  yes   uhhuh right are you married oh okay well i know that a lot of young people you know i it took me a long time to get it through my childs head i mean that was her goal you know uh got to have a credit card but now that she has one shes only used it one time but she wanted to establish some credit   umhum umhum   but i think it finally sunk in you know because she saw some of the other people and just like she heard them say you know well i used a credit card and my husbands sister is the worlds worst at oh well ill just use the credit cards and she has all of her credit cards up to the limit   um   you know and im im thinking woman  wake up and smell the roses before they come and get you but   right besides the fact that how much interest you pay and then this   right and people dont see that either   yeah this thing that you thought you got on sale by the time you get done paying with that with all the finance charges because you pay it off over a long period of time youve spent a heck of a lot of money on that thing   right the only one that we we have that we kept was the Discover card   umhum   and it pays you to use it i mean if you pay your bill off right away if you dont ever have to pay any interest on it because they give you a certain amount every time that you use it   umhum umhum   and you make that money as long as you dont ever have to pay them any uh interest now its and people say well you know im making money by using this credit card but they dont realize that if they i mean it only takes one time for you to use it and not pay the interest i mean you have to pay the interest not pay it right off   umhum   thats going to take up what you would have made   um   so thats the only reason that we kept that we debated for a long time plus they dont have that um charge on it you know like yeah right they dont have one of those   service charge you mean yearly fee yeah   so it we decided that was it you know and i mean everybody calls us and wants to give us a credit card we have we could have credit cards running out our ears   oh you get that stuff in the mail all the time   yes yes and then ill ill have just like uh department stores theyll call me up you know and ill say look i dont want the credit card well were just going to send it to you you know you dont have to ever use it if you dont want to theyll send me any credit card i tear it up   what i really hate in the mail is like for the credit cards that i do have still that they send you these things that look like checks   i just cant see it uhhuh yeah   and they say hey you know two thousand dollars you know free to you kind of thing you know all you got to do is go cash those things and youve got a short term loan i hate it  i cant believe they have the nerve to do that   i know it and you know what whats really bad about those though is just like young people if they dont you know we take the time to you know help my daughter shes in college   uhhuh   but it this is her first credit card thing well when she got her first one she was so excited it was unreal look at this they sent me this money you know so then when i explained to her look you have to pay this back and they are going to charge you interest and stuff of course she ter tore it up but a lot of parents would not take the time       you know and they wouldnt even think of it or their kids may not be as close as my daughter and i are and um you know they may not even discuss it they go out and cash that check thinking that you know theyve got something maybe theyve won something you know somebody sent them something free and go out and spend it   umhum   and um its just unreal i mean i dont like credit cards i wish that they would come up with some other way to you know the only way you could use them is if you were like on vacation they would let you use it maybe once a year you know i mean of course i guess some people go out and spend their whole entire limit on it like that at that time but um       i have seen so many people and i have a friend right now she just got off of thirteen she got uh i cant remember what she called it its some kind of maybe its sure or something like that its something its some weird name of a credit card and she is charging out of her mind already and im going you just got off   uhhuh   thats how you got on to it to start with you know what is the matter with this person  but um it seems like people just you know they just think well i can just have anything i want   yeah   and i just dont see it like that of course i always see pay the bills first and whatevers leftover thats what you have but um maybe a lot of people dont see it like that but i cant stand owing i mean i cannot hardly tolerate to owe something like you know i guess its just because ive been brought up like that but um i could not charge to the limit and knowing that i was going to have to pay this thing out for ever and maybe suffer from having to pay out but thats just the way i feel about it   yeah i think its its somewhat a um symptom of our me generation and that we think we need all these things and i think my parents always you know did without or saved up to you know buy things and we consider that so many of these things we just have to have you know like when i first got my apartment and i was setting it up i did try to economize some but you know i was just like well i have to have it all furnished and i have to have all of my kitchen setup and you dont you know do without too much and you know thats how i got started kind of with setting up a household all up you know it kind of like in the short amount of time you know you just have to have these things just you know have them at home have to have them at my own place and thats you know a big expenditure to start um buying all these things that you think or or have to have and actually theyre kind of luxuries or you should save up slowly and keep buying them and not just rush out and furnish the whole place you know going in one big swoop save up and then buy it   right yeah   but were not into that were into like have to have it all now   oh yeah i guess it is like that though because it seems like more and more people are like that but um i guess its because im older i mean im not real old but i am older and um you know i didnt feel like that i didnt feel like i had to have everything i guess it was because well i had everything when i was at home but i i dont know why i didnt   well were geared to that were like okay like i want a living room set and instead of sitting back and and going okay well its going to cost maybe a thousand dollars two thousand dollars and ill save for two years people go oh well ill just go buy it put it on credit and ill pay it off   umhum yeah   people arent tuned in to like saving for it and then buying it they just put it on a charge card put it on account and then pay off the bill because they want it now its always have to have it now   hm yeah um well it didnt hurt you did it to i mean you didnt go out and charge a whole bunch and lose everything did you   no no but i have had some times when ive had some pretty good balances on there and uh you know i finally you know paid them all off and thought this is you know kind of nonsense so we dont uh have big balances on them at all now were were you know we i use it occasionally but i pay it right off were   yeah well you learned then right   yeah you learn the you know the hard way you hate paying all that interest and ive never been one to itemize on my income tax and never had enough to itemize and so its just a big chunk of money and you realize that youre not buying anything on sale your paying so much more for that item because youve got finance charge and the cost of having that card every year which is what forty dollars sometimes just to have the card   yeah   thats a lot of money that you went to buy this item   umhum so then   and then you never feel like youve got anything to to put into savings or anything youre always just paying bills paying bills you know you dont feel that you have any extra to save and i hate i hate living paycheck to paycheck i like to have a little there you know that i can save so i can feel that you know if something comes up ive got the money to pay for it   right
