 All Chats Lead to Talk Dear Walter Of course Mark Barton s homicides didn t stem from day trading alone I meant that the Journal was far too offhand about the non digital factors that may have set him off The story begins with some general exposition about the sketchy details of Barton s past but once the narrative hits 1993 right before the Internet boom it restricts itself to Barton s highs and lows as a day trader That s why the Journal s line about trading not being the sole cause seemed so slapped on and insufficient to me As you suggest his killing spree may turn out to have a spray of policy and business consequences for gun control regulation of day trading the online sector of the financial industry So before we are asked to digest proposals and reforms I am hungry to know more about the other causes of Barton s rampage and some real consideration of what if anything makes day trading particularly nefarious For example the piece describes how Barton used the extra risky practice of trading on margin or borrowing funds against the securities he already owned which he was required to back up with additional funds when the value of those securities dropped But the story doesn t tell us if trading on margin is allowed at Charles Schwab or Morgan Stanley in other words if he could have bet as riskily at a more established firm or away from a computer You write that Barton s day trading career is emblematic of the glitz and greed 90s and that Americans are abandoning safe investments in the quest for instant riches I am chary of decade long generalizations I thought the 80s were supposed to have been about glitz and greed Your statement is wide enough to span the gold rush the junk bond era and the Las Vegas Strip Sure online investing is more populist and easily accessible than panning for gold or high risk bond trading but you make it sound as if droves of us are abandoning steady salaries for a home office a modem and a bunch of trading accounts So tops on my list of Pieces I d Like To Read remains a solid analysis of the scope and specific dangers of day trading and how it compares to more conventional forms of extracurricular investing Perhaps as you hypothesize Hillary chose to air her woes in Talk because it s a sympathetic forum But so are lots of magazines remember the New York Times Magazine s recent rah rah cover story I think she chose it simply because it s the highest profile magazine of the year Her Senate candidacy is a direct reward for the crosses she s had to bear before Monica her approval rating was too low to justify a run What bothers me most about the interview is that she seems to be trying to nourish her candidacy with a new harvest of Flytrap induced sympathy Boy did you dis my offer of a Talk subscription Your high minded sneer leaves me crestfallen does this mean you won t want to dish over it tomorrow I have a copy in front of me and Hillary aside it looks delicious I can t wait to read Martin Amis on Hannibal Tom Stoppard on his newfound Jewish heritage and Mimi Swartz on the legal revenge being exacted by wronged first wives But if you won t share with me then at least my fellow F train riders will A demain Jodi P S No I don t eat on the subway But I could if I wanted to A dirty little secret Like many of Mayor Giuliani s quality of life prohibitions including those on jaywalking and cursing the no snacks on the subway rule is never ever enforced
