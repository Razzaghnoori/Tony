 The East Is in the Red Want an easy way to eliminate the U S trade deficit Just declare New York City a separate entity with its own balance of payments statistics I can almost guarantee you that the trade deficit of the rest of the country call it mainland America will disappear After all if New York s numbers were counted separately we would no longer treat goods imported into New York as debit items in the U S balance of payments Furthermore all of the goods that mainland America ships to New York City would be considered U S exports True the goods that New York ships to the rest of the world would be struck off the export tally while the goods the city ships to the rest of the United States would henceforth count as U S imports But these would be minor adjustments New York City is basically not in the business of producing physical objects So we can be sure that the city runs a huge trade deficit probably bigger than that of the United States as a whole which is why splitting it off from the rest of the country would give the mainland a surplus Of course most if not all of New York s deficit in goods trade is made up for by exports to mainland America and the world at large of intangibles such as financial services and tickets to see Cats and the city also has a disproportionate number of wealthy residents who receive lots of income from the property they own elsewhere It would not be surprising to find that the city actually runs a surplus on its current account a measure that includes trade in services and investment income as well as the merchandise trade balance But if it s the trade deficit you worry about splitting New York off from mainland America will take care of the problem Nothing real would have changed but maybe it would make some people feel better What inspires this idea is China s assumption of political control over Hong Kong which removes the last faint excuse for treating China and Hong Kong as separate economies and therefore offers a way to make some of the same people feel better about another trade issue the supposed threat posed by China s trade surplus In recent years China sans Hong Kong what we used to call mainland China has been running large and growing surpluses in its merchandise trade although its balance on current account has fluctuated around zero But China plus Hong Kong does not run big trade surpluses In the year ending in April China ran a trade surplus of almost 24 billion but Hong Kong as one would expect for a mainly service producing city state ran an offsetting deficit of 19 billion reducing the total to a fairly unimpressive 4 6 billion China s trade surpluses in other words are largely a statistical illusion produced by the fact that so much of the management and ownership of the country s industry is located on the other side of an essentially arbitrary line Pointing this out doesn t change anything real but perhaps it may help calm some of the fears being fostered by underemployed Japan bashers who like old cold warriors have lately gone searching for new enemies Professional trade alarmist Alan Tonelson gave a particularly clear statement of the new fears in his New York Times review of The Big Ten The Big Emerging Markets and How They Will Change Our Lives a book by former Commerce Undersecretary Jeffrey Garten The review caught my eye because some of it matched word for word a recent speech by House Minority Leader and presidential hopeful Richard Gephardt After praising Garten for taking seriously the possibility that the growing ability of the 10 to produce sophisticated goods and services at rock bottom prices could drag down the standard of living of even affluent well educated Americans Tonelson chided him for imagining that developing countries China included would provide important new markets for advanced country exports C onsumer markets in these emerging countries are likely to stay small for decades if they don t keep wages and purchasing power low they will have trouble attracting the foreign investment they require both to service debt and to finance growth Iam always grateful when influential pundits make such statements especially in prominent places for in so doing they protect us from the ever present temptation to take people seriously simply because they are influential to imagine that widely held views must actually make at least some sense Tonelson s claim is that as emerging economies grow that is produce and sell greatly increased quantities of goods and services their spending will not grow by a comparable amount equivalently he is claiming that they will run massive trade surpluses But when a country grows its total income must by definition rise one for one with the value of its production Maybe you don t think that income will get paid out in higher wages but it has to show up somewhere And why should we imagine that people in emerging countries unlike people in advanced nations cannot find things to spend their money on In fact one might well expect that emerging economies would typically run trade or at least current account deficits After all such countries will presumably attract inflows of foreign investment allowing them to invest more than they save which is to say spend more than they earn To put it another way a country that attracts enough foreign investment both to service debt and to finance growth must by definition buy more goods and services than it sells that is run a trade deficit The point again is that the money has to show up somewhere How can a country run a trade deficit when it has the huge cost advantage that comes from combining First World productivity with Third World wages The answer is that the premise must be wrong When productivity in emerging economies rises so must wages that is the supposed situation in which these countries are able to produce sophisticated goods and services at rock bottom prices never materializes I am sure that despite its logic my position sounds unrealistic to many readers After all in reality Third World countries do run massive trade surpluses and their wages don t rise with productivity right Well let s do some abstruse statistical research by say buying a copy of the Economist and opening it to the last page which each week conveniently offers tables summarizing economic data for a number of emerging economies We immediately learn something interesting Of Garten s Big Ten six run trade deficits as does the group as a whole nine run current account deficits Of the 25 economies listed 17 run trade deficits and 20 run current account deficits Wage numbers are a little harder to come by but the U S Bureau of Labor Statistics makes such data available on its Foreign Labor Statistics Web site There we find that in 1975 workers in Taiwan and South Korea received only 6 percent as much per hour as their counterparts in the United States by 1995 the numbers were 34 percent and 43 percent respectively Surprise The facts fit the Panglossian economist s vision quite nicely Emerging economies do typically run trade deficits wages do rise with productivity and actual experience offers no support at all for grimmer visions But those grim visions persist nonetheless For smart people like Tonelson or Gephardt this cannot be a matter of simple ignorance It must involve ignorance with intent After all it must require real effort for a full time trade commentator who not only writes frequently about the Third World threat but also decorates his writings with many statistics not to notice that most of those countries run trade deficits rather than surpluses or that wages have in fact increased dramatically in countries that used to have cheap labor It is I imagine equally difficult to pursue such a career without ever becoming aware of the arithmetical necessity that countries attracting big inflows of capital must run trade deficits But perhaps the uncanny ability not to notice these things is acquired by focusing mainly on which does appear to run a huge trade surplus even while attracting lots of foreign capital Most of that trade surplus as we ve seen is a statistical illusion But it is still at first sight hard to understand how China can attract so much foreign investment without running a large current account deficit Where does the money go Auseful clue comes if we look again at the last page of the Economist and ask which country runs the biggest trade surplus of all And the answer is Russia Obviously this isn t because Russia s economy is super competitive What that trade surplus actually reflects is Russia s sorry state in which nervous businessmen and corrupt officials siphon off a large fraction of the country s foreign exchange earnings parking it in safe havens abroad rather than making it available to pay for imports China if you think about it suffers from a milder form of the same ailment The reason those inflows of foreign capital don t finance a trade deficit is that they are offset by outflows of domestic capital In particular huge sums are being invested abroad to establish overseas nest eggs for honest Hong Kong businessmen just in case Hong Kong ends up looking like the rest of China and no doubt to establish similar nest eggs for corrupt Chinese officials just in case the rest of China ends up looking like Hong Kong To the extent that China does run a trade surplus in other words that surplus is a sign of weakness rather than strength None of this should be taken as an apology for China s thoroughly nasty government I fear the worst in Hong Kong and worry as much as anyone about the effects of growing Chinese power on Asia s political and military stability One thing I don t worry about however is China s trade surplus Neither should you
