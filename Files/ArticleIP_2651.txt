 Mindless Merging So much for the idea that small is beautiful If you thought the advent of the Internet the spread of cheap and efficient information technology and the growing fragmentation of the consumer market were all going to help smaller companies thrive at the expense of the slow moving giants of the Fortune 500 apparently you were wrong In the wake of the three giant mergers Citicorp Travelers NationsBank BankAmerica and Banc One First Chicago in the banking industry over the last two weeks the conventional wisdom has quickly adjusted Bigger it seems is now definitely better The banking mergers follow a year that saw 1 trillion in merger and acquisition activity in the United States alone It s easy to overestimate the significance of that number which is inflated by the high price of most U S stocks In fact over the last two decades M A activity has stayed relatively constant as a percentage of the value of the stock market as a whole What s really important is not the size of the M A boom but the fact that merge bent companies are forging ahead undaunted despite all the evidence that the vast majority of acquisitions do not add value to the economy as a whole Don t bother them with the facts They re ready to buy What we re witnessing is a wonderful exercise in two track thinking by the people running U S corporations and by the shareholders investing in them On the one hand there s a general rejection of the old Fordist vertically integrated corporation From Sara Lee divesting itself of its manufacturing operations to the Big Three auto companies outsourcing their parts production to Marriott running hotels that other people actually own the idea of doing as little real work as you have to is much applauded by Wall Street today On the other hand though there s also a general acceptance of the corporation that promises to do everything such as Time Warner and Viacom in media or the new Citigroup with its financial supermarket in banking For a short time I think it was when IBM started laying off tens of thousands of workers it seemed that the ideas of economies of scale and scope had been permanently discredited Apparently not In and of itself this is no bad thing Economies of scale which mean that a product becomes cheaper to produce the more of it you make do exist in industries such as automobile and semiconductor production And economies of scope which mean that it s cheaper to produce or distribute many different products rather than just one obviously exist in supermarkets and Wal Marts as well as arguably in a company such as GE If a supermarket just sells milk it will probably be less successful than if it sells milk eggs cereal bread and so on Saying that size sometimes matters though is not the same as saying it always matters And even if size does have its benefits a merger may not be the best or lowest cost way to reap them Look at the arguments in favor of the Citigroup merger In the first place Citigroup will now be the largest financial institution in the world which will make it able to acquire other companies and make expensive investments But Citicorp and Travelers were already huge Perhaps Citicorp couldn t afford that slamming new computer system before it was part of Citigroup and now it ll be able to shop with impunity but somehow I doubt it Citigroup will also be more diversified which means that its earnings every year won t depend as much on volatile sectors as Travelers did on the trading of Salomon Bros and Citicorp s did on income from Asian markets But if shareholders in Citicorp wanted to diversify all they had to do was buy shares in Travelers and vice versa They re not any more protected now than they would have been then In essence after all what the Citigroup merger involves is Travelers shareholders trading half their shares actually it s a little more than half since Travelers officially acquired Citicorp in Travelers for shares in Citicorp The idea that that swap created value in itself is nonsensical The deal is justified only if the merged entity will grow faster and be more profitable than the two separate ones would have independently And so we come to synergy In the Citigroup case the synergy is supposed to come from the two companies selling each other s products Now you ll be able to get property insurance from Travelers when you take out a mortgage from Citibank or your Travelers agent will be able to badger you into getting a Citibank credit card after he s done badgering you about life insurance Citigroup will be your one stop shopping place your financial supermarket As nearly everyone has already pointed out the record of financial supermarkets is dismal Sears failed with Dean Witter Citicorp failed in the late 1980s when it tried to expand operations and Sandy Weill head of Travelers failed miserably when Shearson joined with American Express And the concept of one stop shopping does seem oddly ill suited to financial services It s not just that at least in the United States there s no evidence that people prefer national banks to local ones if anything there s a long history of distrust of large banks It s also that people take their financial decisions more seriously than they do their choice of toilet paper and that they are unlikely to pick up a home mortgage just because their insurance agent is hawking it At a time when people comparison shop for almost everything Citigroup s privileging of convenience seems oddly outdated Even if cross selling makes sense though it s not clear why Citicorp and Travelers had to merge Citicorp could have agreed to market Travelers insurance or Salomon brokerage services and vice versa without actually becoming one company For the deal to make sense the costs of working together in a contractual relationship would have to be greater than the costs of merging But the record in this regard is not comforting In fact if there s one thing that is unequivocally true about M A activity it s that companies dramatically underestimate how much it will cost and how long it will take to make two companies with their attendant managerial hierarchies corporate cultures and computer systems into one That s hardly surprising when one considers how little time companies take before agreeing to merge The Citigroup deal from beginning to end took less than five weeks The 60 billion NationsBank BankAmerica deal took three weeks and the companies did due diligence in three days How due exactly could that diligence have been It s true that if a company lets a potential merger candidate look too closely and the deal then falls through it may have given away its secrets for nothing But when you realize that people take more time to decide what car they re going to buy than Weill and Citicorp s John Reed took to decide on a 70 billion deal a little uneasiness might be in order The truth is that everything from the way investment banks are compensated to the rubber stamp role of boards of directors to the dominance of publicity hungry CEOs is set up to make mergers attractive And it s hard work to determine the success of mergers because you have to compare the performance of the new company against the projected performance of the previously independent companies That makes it easier just to assume success in the absence of complete disaster But the chairman of a large Midwestern bank put it best when he recently said You get big because you re better You don t get better because you re big
