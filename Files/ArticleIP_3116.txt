 Some Genius Leonardo da Vinci was a genius at painting no doubt about it He invented sfumato inaugurated the High Renaissance and created what is arguably the cleverest composition in the history of art The Last Supper Was he also a genius at science The casual visitor to the current exhibition of the Codex Leicester at the American Museum of Natural History in New York through Jan 1 1997 might come away with the vague impression that he was The curators describe the 72 page manuscript on loan to the museum from Bill Gates who bought it two years ago for 30 8 million as a masterpiece of science One of the catalog essayists writes that a s a scientist Leonardo rates more space in the reputable Dictionary of Scientific Biography than Kepler Galileo and Einstein combined But Leonardo was not a genius the way Einstein or Galileo was He was more a genius the way Buckminster Fuller was if that is a way of being a genius For a couple of centuries after his death in 1519 Leonardo was seen mainly as a painter albeit a preternaturally gifted one His artistic legacy comprises the Mona Lisa and 14 other paintings several of them unfinished together with a treatise on painting But he had also left behind some 7 000 pages of unpublished notes on hydraulics geology anatomy flight ballistics botany optics and astronomy as well as designs for all sorts of fantastical inventions It was not until the time of the Industrial Revolution that his notebooks by then scattered all over Europe were paid serious attention Soon he was being celebrated for his precursive genius He had beaten Newton to the theory of gravity and Copernicus to heliocentrism He had worked out the circulation of the blood before William Harvey He had grasped the principle of erosion more completely than Georges Cuvier He had invented the airplane the tank the bicycle the modern toilet such are the claims that have been made for him What is the evidence for such deep originality in the Codex Leicester The manuscript itself whose pages are dimly illumined in a series of glass cases at the museum is not at first blush a fetching object You can t exactly read the thing since Leonardo s jottings are in medieval Italian and are rendered in his famous mirror image script The hundreds of marginal drawings have some aesthetic interest especially those depicting the flow of water but they are mainly simple geometrical diagrams and doodles The earls of Leicester who owned the codex since 1717 seem rarely to have looked at it Nothing like three centuries of aristocratic incuriousity to keep ink and paper in near perfect condition commented one wag Between the Leicesters and Bill Gates the notebook was owned for a dozen or so years by Armand Hammer who with his unerring flair for the ludicrous insisted it be called the Codex Hammer and claimed that he had retained a squad of elite commandos trained in kung fu and armed with Uzis to guard it round the clock Looking at the English translation of the codex on a CD ROM at the exhibit I saw that what began as an attempt by Leonardo to set down the first principles of the behavior of water ended up as a farrago of observations and musings fanciful insightful analytically maddening At one point for example he notes that the higher a column of water the greater the pressure it exerts a valid if unexciting conclusion But elsewhere in the codex he maintains that only moving water produces pressure at the bottom reasoning that the still water of a pond after all does not press down the grasses that grow on the bottom Not only is this breathtakingly wrongheaded it contradicts the previous principle Leonardo s greatest shortcoming as a scientific thinker was not paradoxically his greatest strength as an artist his eye This for him was the ultimate epistemic instrument one to be trusted over all classical authorities Do you not see that the eye embraces the beauty of the whole world he wrote insisting that the visual eye was pre eminently the real It is Leonardo s sheer ability to see to notice in a way that no one had before precisely what it looks like when two streams of water merge that accounts for the thrilling bits of the Codex Leicester The problem was that Leonardo knew very little mathematics Algebra was a closed book to him and he was poor at figures When he writes Let no one read me who is not a mathematician he is using the term loosely to suggest a rigorous cast of mind His ocular observations were in a qualitative vein hearkening back to Aristotelian science rather than forward to Newton That is fine when it comes say to anatomy in which Leonardo was also well served by his willingness to thrust his nicely manicured hands into the guts of dead felons he was dissecting But it s disastrous in dynamics where his experiments led him to conclude that both the velocity of a falling object and the distance fallen are proportional to the time of the fall which a moment s reflection exposes as a logical absurdity The only other figure I can think of who had similar claims to genius both in art and science Goethe was also a mathematical innocent But where Leonardo had a keen respect for mathematics Goethe was openly contemptuous of it The true precursor of the scientific revolution was Galileo who proclaimed with almost mystical conviction that the Book of Nature was written in the language of mathematics As for Leonardo s inventions those that were sound from an engineering point of view were usually borrowed from contemporaries His elaborate hoists and cranes were designed by Brunelleschi his engines of war by the German engineer Konrad Keyser his automobile by the Sienese Francesco di Giorgio Martini On the other hand a device described in the Codex Leicester that the exhibition catalogue notes sounds curiously similar to a modern espresso machine seems entirely original Leonardo s flying machine would not have flown but that hardly counts against its visual bravura one version resembled a calabash shell crossed with a windmill and another a four winged butterfly Leonardo was a man who according to one biographer was plunged into a kind of ecstasy by devising never ending systems of cogwheels and screws rather like Buckminster Fuller deliriously multiplying geodesics If there was a bit of Fuller in Leonardo there was also a bit of Liberace in this theatrical high living dandy who favored brocade doublets and bad boys with pretty faces Since his disciples were chosen for their looks he had no distinguished successors Little of Leonardo s weirdness is conveyed by the Codex Leicester exhibit though Isabella Rosellini s blue velveteen voice narrating the exhibit s eight minute biographical video helps somewhat Here was a Renaissance humanist who regarded his fellow men as stupid and deranged sacks for food and fillers up of privies and relished the thought of humanity s destruction in a universal deluge Leonardo s obsession with swirling water which found scientific expression in the Codex Leicester and sublime artistic expression in the drawings he did toward the end of his life could be pretty morbid
