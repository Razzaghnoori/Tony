 Reno Divorce Even by Washington standards Janet Reno has suffered a wicked case of conventional wisdom whiplash After famously taking responsibility for the botched FBI raid in Waco in 1993 she was lionized for her refreshing readiness to be held accountable Before long however the buck stops here clich grew stale and the story line changed It became Because of Reno s managerial incompetence and the disarray she presided over at the Justice Department a lot of innocent Branch Davidians died unnecessarily Version 2 is at least as dubious as Version 1 Originally hailed as the very best appointee of the Clinton administration bar none by Morton Kondracke Reno has more recently been called the president s worst major Cabinet appointment by the editors of the Weekly Standard The latest and most dramatic turnabout has been on the question of Reno s independence The approved view until recently was that Reno had made herself irrelevant a Washington nonplayer by being so intractable and prissy Various articles published in 1995 and 96 included mutterings from White House officials that the attorney general had no relationship with the president and that officials would love nothing more than an excuse to replace her after the election More recently however Republicans have insinuated and the news media have reflected the view that Reno is not just a team player but a political shill for the White House This is because she refuses to appoint an independent counsel in the campaign finance scandal The New York Times in a recent editorial raised doubts about Reno s loyalty to the public Newt Gingrich the historian went well beyond that comparing Reno to Richard Nixon s Attorney General John Mitchell who went to jail for obstruction of justice Gingrich s comments are as offensive as usual but even the milder form is absurd People do play against type from time to time but the charge that Reno has suddenly become a docile tool of the White House simply doesn t wash Her decision on the independent counsel issue may be good or bad but it is legally defensible and the evidence that Reno has been swayed by political factors doesn t amount to a prima facie case The first point is Reno s own background and personality As state attorney in Dade County Fla Reno acquired a reputation not just for integrity but for an almost fanatical probity She asked the governor to appoint an independent counsel to prosecute her own mother when the late Jane Reno was arrested for drunken driving In Miami as in Washington Reno was criticized for her management style for her sentimental notions about crime and for her general mulishness But until a few months ago no one ever accused her of bending the law Even if she were a different sort of person the case that Reno is acting politically in not appointing an independent counsel would fall apart over the issue of motivation When calls first came for an independent counsel in November Reno might have been vulnerable to pressure She was by all accounts eager to stay on as attorney general in an administration that was not at all eager to keep her Until some time after the Inauguration Clinton might have got away with getting rid of her while he was replacing others in the Cabinet But political circumstances have changed since then The best thing Reno could possibly do to guarantee her own job security is to appoint an independent prosecutor If she did Clinton could never get rid of her If he tried it would be treated like a version of the infamous Saturday Night Massacre when Nixon kept firing Justice Department officials who wouldn t fire special prosecutor Archibald Cox Whether Reno s decision not to appoint is correct on the merits is another question which won t be settled here But it is pretty clearly within the bounds of reasonableness Reno s critics have been imprecise and often contradictory on the question of why they think she must appoint an independent counsel Under the law the attorney general is obliged to do so if she comes across specific and credible evidence of criminal wrongdoing by a high level official covered by the act She also has the discretionary powers to appoint an independent counsel if she feels there would be a personal financial or political conflict of interest if normal Justice Department procedures were followed Though it is blindingly obvious to Reno s critics that criminal acts were performed by high level Clinton officials they don t agree among themselves about which actions by which officials qualify Sen John McCain R Ariz thinks it s Al Gore s fund raising calls from his office Common Cause thinks it s Bill Clinton s coordination of soft money expenditures from the White House Orrin Hatch R Utah thinks it s letting John Huang into the White House Reno says that no accusation against either Gore or Clinton meets the specific and credible standard Gore she asserts in a lengthy response to a request from Hatch was raising soft money which is not covered by the regulation that prohibits solicitations from government buildings The coordination of soft money expenditures that Clinton was involved in she says isn t illegal I think this last interpretation is unfortunate because it opens the floodgates for unlimited contributions from corporations and labor unions which is what the post Watergate election reforms were supposed to prevent But legally Reno is on pretty firm ground That leaves the more vague and discretionary language about personal financial or political conflict of interest No one has suggested that Reno has a financial or personal stake in the latest scandal Hatch and others have made the case that she faces a political conflict Reno is an appointee of the administration presiding over an investigation that is potentially embarrassing and damaging to the administration But the standard for appointing an independent counsel can t be that broad Attorneys general face political conflicts every day whether to bring cases against enemies associates friends even relatives of members of the administration Given a broad interpretation the conflict of interest provision would require dozens if not hundreds of independent counsels Reno has apparently construed this ambiguous provision in the only way one sensibly can It gives her a wider berth than the specific and credible language but it does not require her to appoint an independent counsel every time someone in the opposing party detects the appearance of a political conflict Paradoxically caving in to her critics would bolster Reno s reputation for fearless independence If the attorney general had ordered up an independent counsel not only would her job have been secure but the New York Times and maybe even Sen Hatch would be swooning over her once again Standing up to them and doing what she evidently feels is right means being taken for a Clinton hack To her great credit Reno has thus far rejected the perception of independence in favor of the genuine article
