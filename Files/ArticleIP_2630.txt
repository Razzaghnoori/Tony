 An Awful Lot of Autos Imagine walking to the edge of a cliff looking down saying to yourself Boy that s a steep drop It ll sure hurt if I jump and then jumping anyway Such seems to be the curious strategy of the world auto industry in the late 1990s as it grapples with prices that are actually declining demand that s stagnant and production capacity that against all good sense just keeps getting bigger Now in one respect this anxiety about the auto industry simply reflects the fact that it has become the poster child for a global economy in which deflation is suddenly everyone s favorite thing to worry about Even in today s supposedly high tech world General Motors and Ford remain bellwethers for the way people feel about the economy as a whole In the mid 1970s Detroit s gas guzzlers were taken as emblems of the United States inability to adjust to the end of the postwar boom At the end of that decade nothing made inflation more real than the phrase sticker shock So today the image of assembly lines churning out hundreds of thousands of unneeded and unwanted vehicles is an excellent representation of the specter of global recession This is a specter that seems to loom larger of course after the series of currency crises that have beset Asia In another respect though concerns about global overcapacity in auto production are industry specific and by most accounts well justified It isn t just the William Greiders of the world who think that in the near future there are going to be too many cars and not enough drivers Instead just about everyone thinks this What s curious is that no one is really doing anything about it It s true that overcapacity concerns are at least a decade old click for a quick review and that the predicted crisis of demand has not yet materialized though perhaps it has and I ve just seen it as a pleasant period when car prices have stayed the same instead of rising That s because the U S economy has continued to expand so briskly and because the Big Three automakers have restructured their operations to do a better job of matching supply with demand In other words they downsized Overcapacity is in any case difficult to measure since it s more important for car companies to be able to meet increases in demand than it is for them to make only as many cars as customers want You can shut down a line for a couple of weeks without any problems if demand falls short You can t build that line from scratch if demand rises unexpectedly By some estimates in fact overcapacity of a million cars is reasonable for the Big Three You wouldn t be wrong then to see something a tad Chicken Littleish in all this overcapacity talk especially when it s being proffered by the very people building the cars for which there is supposedly no demand And there is clearly an element of saber rattling on the part of U S car companies which are anxious about the continued impact on their earnings of the strong dollar and who want South Korea in particular to open its markets to U S cars Last year the Big Three sold 3 900 vehicles in South Korea out of a total market of 1 6 million A Pontiac Bonneville is as rare a sight in Seoul as an Aston Martin is here Emphasizing the global realities of overexpansion thus becomes a way for the Big Three to serve their own interests without seeming parochial And yet there are those realities and South Korea is the most remarkable of them At a time when the South Korean economy as a whole seems to be in need of dramatic restructuring precisely around the issue of excessively free credit for capital expenditures South Korean car companies are forging ahead with investment plans that dwarf anything they ve previously done As a whole South Korean automakers plan to put 3 72 billion into expanding facilities Hyundai formerly the Yugo s poor cousin is increasing capital spending by 700 percent Daewoo is doubling its investment And most incredibly Kia Motors which needed a government bailout to save it from its creditors will be putting 500 million into plant expansion in 1998 a threefold increase Oh and then there s Samsung maker of cool stereos and microwaves which decided last year that it wouldn t be satisfied until it had become a world class automaker What about hand tooled leather bags They re nice Couldn t Samsung have decided to become a world class maker of hand tooled leather bags instead Similarly Mexico s output two thirds of which will be exported is expected to rise 10 percent a year for the next three years while even the Japanese whose car companies are among the only bright spots in a forlorn economy are adding to capacity And of course U S automakers even as they worry about their inability to raise prices are breaking ground on new plants and pushing their workers to take more and more overtime In that sense South Korea is just a striking example of what s happening all over And it is hard when reading yet another account of an auto company CEO s concerns about falling prices not to want to shake him vigorously and say Just say no damn it If there are going to be too many cars then it seems sensible to stop making cars Except of course that if you do you lose all hope of capturing what market does exist and except of course that when you stop making cars you have to close factories and throw people out of work It s important to see that the problem here is not no matter what General Motors says that U S workers are overpaid Nor is it really that individual factories are overstaffed After all the Big Three are enjoying hefty profits and spending billions on share buyback plans All three companies require between 3 27 and 3 56 workers to build a vehicle significantly inferior to Japanese standards but significantly better than it ever was and significantly more efficient than most people thought possible for a U S company And no I don t know what a 0 27 worker looks like The problems that U S automakers endured during the 1970s and 1980s were for the most part self inflicted as the superior performance of Japanese automakers over that period suggests But the problem that U S automakers face now is of a macroeconomic not microeconomic nature which is what must make it so difficult for them to accept It s about the fact that within a given industry supply does not ensure demand and that what is rational for the individual firm which needs to sell as much of its product as possible and so has to make sure that its product is available may be collectively irrational One interesting question raised by all this is whether cars are commodities In other words does the fact that there are 2 million more Kias on the road really make someone less likely to shell out 22 000 for a Honda Accord Auto design and advertising are all about differentiating one product from another But all this talk about global overcapacity suggests that automakers see themselves as all making the very same thing I wonder if that ll make me feel better the next time I see someone blow by me in a new Porsche Boxster
