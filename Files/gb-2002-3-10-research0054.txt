 Background Genome wide structural analyses in terms of patterns of protein folding have been useful in revealing functional and evolutionary relationships 1 2 3 4 Given the abundance of membrane proteins it would be highly desirable to have a similar analysis for this major category of structures however the number of known membrane protein structures remains small Here we exploit the fact that membrane proteins can be classified into families on the basis of sequence similarities and topology and use the family groupings to analyze genomic characteristics of membrane protein families Most transmembrane proteins are formed from bundles of helices that traverse the membrane lipid bilayer It is estimated that 20 30 of the proteins in known genomes are of this type 3 4 5 6 The most general description of the transmembrane helical regions TMs is that they comprise a region of 18 or more amino acids with a largely hydrophobic character This sequence feature can be identified in primary sequences using hydrophobicity scales 7 8 9 The most abundant amino acids in transmembrane regions are leucine isoleucine valine phenylalanine alanine glycine serine and threonine Taken together these amino acids account for 75 of the amino acids in transmembrane regions 10 11 12 Analysis of the distribution of amino acids has revealed patterns in TM regions for example GxxxG which are thought to be important in helix helix interactions 11 12 13 14 We took advantage of the classification of protein domains provided by others Pfam A and Pfam B 15 to identify families that appear to be polytopic membrane proteins and augmented these lists with additional family members based on amino acid sequence comparisons Furthermore we identified additional families on the basis of clustering of amino acid sequences resulting in 637 distinct families We used these families to analyze amino acid compositions in the helical regions pair motifs domain structures and patterns of families and arrive at a number of generalizations Among these are that glycine tyrosine and proline appear frequently in conserved locations within family transmembrane helices and that the specific pair motifs are found in families that seem to be transporters symporters and channels The number of kinds of domains and families seems to increase with the number of open reading frames ORFs in most genomes Here we present our analysis and discuss these findings Results Classification of polytopic membrane protein domains The procedure used to classify polytopic membrane domains is based mainly on family classification schemes Pfam A and Pfam B and is shown in Figure 1a We identified families of polytopic membrane domains in Pfam 15 by allocating TM helices annotated in SWISS PROT 16 to proteins in Pfam After conservatively picking 183 Pfam A and 152 Pfam B families we conducted an analysis of loops that connect TM helices It was shown that the loops tend to be short with most of them 95 having fewer than 80 amino acids We therefore took 80 residues as the maximal intra domain loop between TM helices to define polytopic membrane domains Though the 80 residue cutoff may not apply to a small portion around 5 of integral membrane proteins it diminished the chance of including soluble domains within membrane domains given that the average soluble domain has about 170 residues 17 Using TMHMM a membrane protein prediction program based on a hidden Markov model 6 TM helices of membrane proteins in 26 genomes were predicted Polytopic membrane domains were identified using the loop size between TM helices as a guide These domains were then classified into 231 Pfam A and 318 Pfam B families either by direct SWISS PROT ID matching or by sequence similarity matching using FASTA 18 Of the aligned domains most of their TM helices also aligned well especially in Pfam A families which have alignments based on manually crafted hidden Markov models Unclassified domains were clustered into 121 families by their sequence similarities For each family a profile was constructed as shown in Figure 1b This included an averaged hydrophobicity plot of all members in the family based on the Goldman Engelman Steitz GES scale 8 a consensus sequence of the family represented by a sequence logo plot 19 and consensus sequences of the TM helices By analyzing the hydrophobicity plots we can locate TM helices in the aligned sequences in protein families and assign a number of TM helices to each family Some families including 3 in Pfam A and 20 in Pfam B were eliminated at this step owing to the ambiguity of TM helices observed in the plot From this process we identified 228 Pfam A 298 Pfam B and 121 clustered families for our analyses with approximately 95 domains classified in Pfam families Analysis of the number of TM helices in Pfam A families of polytopic membrane domains After assigning a number of TM helices to each family we conducted a survey of the assigned numbers of TM helices in 228 Pfam A families of polytopic membrane domains Figure 2 Pfam A families are manually classified families that have well aligned protein domains and most of them have a well defined number for TM helices We also picked families in solute transport systems that are annotated as transporters symporters and channels and analyzed the number of TM helices for these families Figure 2 In general most Pfam A families tend to have a small number of TM helices For those with seven or fewer TM helices the number of families does not vary significantly with helix number although there are more families with two or four TM helices than with three five six or seven For families with more than seven TM helices the number of families decreases sharply as the number of TM helices increases Families with 12 TM helices are the exception however they have a small peak in numbers against the overall downward slope of the plot We also carried out the same kind of analysis on Pfam A families that are annotated as transporters symporters and channels and found that 12 TM helix families are preferred by transporter like families In addition most 11 out of 12 Pfam A families with 12 TM helices are transporter like families There seems to be a tendency for the transporter like families to have an even number of TM helices because families with 2 4 6 8 and 12 TM helices have a relatively higher occurrence than those with a neighboring odd number of TM helices Analysis of amino acid distribution and pair motifs We selected 168 families from Pfam A that had more than 20 members For each of these families we then generated consensus sequences with conservation value R sequence using the Alpro program 19 Relatively conserved amino acids in the consensus sequences R sequence value 3 0 representing the top 15 R sequence value of all amino acids and in TM helical regions were analyzed for their composition as well as for pair motifs We compared the amino acid composition of the TM helices in general with the composition of only the conserved positions in TM helices in the 168 families Figure 3 We noticed that some amino acids are considerably more prevalent in the conserved positions such as glycine 8 average composition in TM helices versus 19 composition in conserved positions of TM helices proline 4 versus 9 and tyrosine 3 versus 5 In contrast isoleucine 10 versus 4 valine 8 versus 4 methionine 4 versus 1 and threonine 7 versus 4 are less prevalent in conserved positions As might be expected the changes in prevalence of certain amino acids reflect their conservation in the consensus sequence Therefore glycine proline and tyrosine are relatively conserved residues in TM helical regions and isoleucine valine methionine and threonine have relatively high mutability This result correlates very well with the mutation data matrix MDM for multi spanning transmembrane regions in membrane proteins 10 In the MDM of multi spanning transmembrane helices isoleucine methionine and valine are found to have relatively high mutability as hydrophobic residues and serine and threonine also rank high in mutability as polar residues In the matrix proline appears to be highly conserved Our results confirm these findings in addition we find that glycine and tyrosine are also highly conserved residues in polytopic TM helices We also analyzed the consensus sequences of 168 Pfam A families for significant amino acid pair motifs and compared our findings with previous studies Table 1shows three pair lists one includes the top 50 pairs of Senes et al with their significance 12 the second includes the top 50 pairs with their occurrences from randomly generated pairs and the third includes the top 50 pairs with their occurrences using Senes et al s top 200 most significant pairs Of the three lists the GxxxG pair always ranks first highlighting its significance in TM helices 12 13 14 In the last list which contains top ranked pairs in the first two lists we observed some interesting pair motif patterns that are associated with glycine Amino acid pairs such as ZxxxZ and ZxxxxxxZ Z represents glycine alanine or serine residues with a small side chain are highly ranked in the last list It is known that amino acids are positioned with an average of 3 6 residues per turn in TM helices 20 Two residues that are separated by three or six residues are thus oriented in the same direction Therefore it was suggested that these motifs are favored for TM helix packing 12 14 Our results are in good agreement with the pair motifs that are formed with small residues but do not favor pairs with branched aliphatic residues isoleucine and valine This is probably because isoleucine and valine are highly mutable residues in TM helices Of all the 168 Pfam A families of polytopic membrane domains we studied 45 are classified as transporters channels and symporters representing 27 of the total families We studied GxxxG and GxxxxxxG pairs and found that they tend to be associated within transporter channel like membrane proteins Table 2 When one or both glycines is mutated to a small residue such as serine or alanine this association is weakened Therefore GxxxG and GxxxxxxG pairs are relatively conserved in transporter channel like membrane proteins By comparing the amino acid composition of conserved residues in the TM helices of the transporter like families with that of the rest of the Pfam A families Table 3 we found that glycine is two times more conserved in the transporter like families reflecting the favored GxxxG and GxxxxxxG pairs in these families Proline and asparagine are also among the conserved residues favored in transporter like families whereas cysteine histidine isoleucine leucine methionine and valine are unfavored Genome wide analysis of families of polytopic membrane domains Classified polytopic membrane protein domains represent from 40 to 81 of the total polytopic membrane domains in the genomes studied with an average coverage of 61 Figure 4a We kept the family classification relatively conservative instead of aiming for a high overall coverage with a less careful classification To avoid including falsely predicted families we based our analysis on families with no fewer than four members However a higher proportion of polytopic membrane domains could be classified if smaller families were considered Figure 4a We classified polytopic membrane domains into Pfam A Pfam B and self clustered families Figure 4bshows the distribution of these three kinds of families in all the genomes Most of the classified polytopic membrane domains belong to Pfam A and Pfam B which cover 95 of classified domains Classified polytopic membrane domains and their families were studied in relation to the number of ORFs in each genome Figure 5ashows the number of classified polytopic membrane domains versus the number of ORFs in all the genomes and Figure 5bshows the same relation in genomes of single celled organisms A rough linear relation seems to exist between the number of classified polytopic membrane domains and the number of ORFs in each genome However it is interesting that C elegans is an obvious outlier in the trend To try to explain this we took a closer look at the biggest families of polytopic membrane domains in C elegans Figure 5c The three biggest families in C elegans are PF01604 PF01461 and PB000009 which are described as 7 TM chemoreceptor families The annotation of PB000009 is from PD000148 in Prodom 21 These families are almost unique to C elegans as most of their members in Pfam are from C elegans These families contain well amplified membrane domains with total numbers of 289 250 and 216 respectively Those numbers are more than double the biggest family in Drosophila melanogaster which is PF00083 Sugar and other transporter with 108 members By removing the number of proteins in these three families a total of 754 we can see a better fit of C elegans to the trend line So the unusually large number of polytopic membrane domains is likely to be caused by protein amplification in a few families This hypothesis was supported by analysis of Figure 5d which shows the number of families of polytopic membrane domains in relation to the number of ORFs in studied genomes The number of families seems to have a logarithmic relation in all studied genomes including C elegans Given that C elegans has an unusually large number of polytopic membrane domains but a normal number of families the amplification of polytopic membrane domains is limited to a few families Discussion Polytopic membrane domains of integral membrane proteins in 26 genomes have been classified into 637 families which include 218 Pfam A 298 Pfam B and 121 clustered families Only families that are reasonably big 4 members were selected The classified families were used for amino acid distribution and pattern studies for genome wide analysis Our studies on amino acid distribution and patterns were conducted on Pfam A families We also analyzed Pfam B and the clustered families but found fewer conservations probably because the Pfam B and the clustered families are not as carefully aligned as Pfam A families In the analysis of amino acid positions glycine proline and tyrosine were found to be the most conserved residues in TM helical regions whereas isoleucine valine methionine and threonine were identified as the least conserved residues relative to average occurrence This result is mostly consistent with previous results from an MDM 10 Although hydrophobic residues such as leucine and isoleucine are among the most abundant residues in TM helices they are not well conserved in position The observed conservation in position for residues such as glycine proline and tyrosine raises the question of whether these residues are associated with the functions of integral membrane proteins We also studied amino acid pair motifs in the conserved sequences in classified families We show that pairs consisting of a glycine and another small amino acid glycine alanine or serine and facing the same direction in TM helices are common in conserved positions As those pair motifs have been shown to be important for packing of TM helices 12 13 14 conservation of those motifs probably implies their importance in folding stability of integral membrane proteins as is the case with hydrophobic residues found in the core regions of soluble proteins Our results have some interesting implications for the classified Pfam A families annotated as transporters symporters and channels First there is a preference for 12 TM helices among these families As there is no 12 TM transporter protein structure available we do not know exactly why a 12 TM helix bundle is preferred for transport The structure of MsbA from Escherichia coli 22 an ATP binding cassette ABC transporter homolog was recently solved It contains 12 TM helices in a homodimer of two 6 TM helical bundles which form a central chamber to translocate substrates However it is unlikely that polytopic membrane domains in the 12 TM Pfam A families have a structure like that of ABC transporters as there is no obvious sequence similarity within the sequence containing the 12 TM helices it is unlikely to form two 6 TM helical bundles By looking at structures of other transport proteins including the potassium channel 23 the mechanosensitive ion channel 24 the aquaporin water channel 25 and the glycerol facilitator channel 26 it is apparent that 7 10 TM helices are needed to form a tunnel and transport molecules This means that proteins with a small number of TM helices must oligomerize to form a proper tunnel to translocate molecules through the membrane In addition families of these proteins tend to have GxxxG and GxxxxxxG instead of related motifs that have one or both glycines changed to alanine or serine While this preference is interesting we do not know its origin Perhaps it reflects especially tight packing among helices in transporters permitting the C H O hydrogen bonding that has been discussed 14 We also studied the distribution of classified families in 26 genomes Although the classified families of polytopic membrane domains do not provide complete coverage of the total potential polytopic membrane domains we think they include most membrane proteins that have essential functions in these genomes The excluded domains are either unique in function for the organism or falsely predicted In most genomes the number of classified polytopic membrane domains seems to have a linear relation with the number of ORFs However C elegans is an outlier to this trend By studying the families in C elegans we found that it has an exceptional number of 7 TM helical membrane domains most of which are annotated as chemoreceptors As C elegans cannot see or hear but must search for food chemosensation is key to survival C elegans mediates chemosensation by 32 neurons that are mostly arranged in bilateral pairs on the left and right sides and it is estimated that there are about 500 G protein coupled receptors that act in chemosensation 27 We have now identified many chemoreceptors 750 classified into three large families Therefore classification of polytopic membrane domains into families gives us another way to look at the distribution and functions of integral membrane proteins in genomes Materials and methods Databases In this study the following databases were used SWISS PROT release 39 and updated to 19 December 2000 16 which contains 91 132 protein entries Pfam release 6 1 15 which contains 2 727 protein families in Pfam A and 40 230 families in Pfam B Proteome Analysis Database 28

and Arabidopsis thaliana AT Classification of polytopic membrane protein domains Figure 1ashows our complete classification procedure We extracted 8 301 protein entries in the SWISS PROT database containing no less than two TRANSMEM annotations in the FT field In these proteins a total of 52 636 transmembrane TM regions were allocated to proteins in the Pfam database By analyzing the location of TM regions in protein domains of each Pfam family we were able to identify families that contain polytopic membrane protein domains We went through a relatively conservative procedure to identify potential families of polytopic membrane domains First a Pfam family needed to have a significant number of proteins containing no fewer than two TM regions to be identified as a polytopic membrane domain family Second all families in Pfam A and some in Pfam B that have more than seven members are analyzed as the Pfam B database is under development and contains thousands of small protein families Finally we identified 183 Pfam A and 152 Pfam B families Proteins in these families contain 36 878 TM regions representing approximately 70 of the total TM regions extracted from SWISS PROT We analyzed sizes of the loops between all the TM regions as shown in the inner chart of Figure 1 By Pfam s protein domain classification most loops 95 are short peptides containing less than 80 amino acids Proteins from 26 genomes were submitted to TMHMM server for TM helix prediction 6 Predicted membrane proteins were searched for polytopic membrane domains using a rule generated from the above result that the intramembrane domain loop sizes must be less than 80 amino acids To identify domains that are included in the Pfam families that have been identified we searched the defined polytopic membrane domains for SWISS PROT ID matches and regional matches Unmatched domains are further classified on the basis of Pfam s classification and additional 48 Pfam A and 166 Pfam B families are identified small size Pfam B families with no less than four members and no less than three matches are selected In total we identified 231 Pfam A and 318 Pfam B families as polytopic membrane domains As not all proteins from the 26 genomes are included in Pfam we then tried to assign the unclassified polytopic membrane domains to the identified Pfam families by sequence similarity matching to proteins in these families We used the FASTA program 18 to search for matches and matches with E values less than 0 01 were considered positive Obviously one can assign Pfam A domains using the HMMer software 29 which they are closely associated with However we chose to take a somewhat simpler tack using FASTA This is a somewhat more conservative approach finding fewer homologs which has the advantage of using consistent thresholds that can be applied to all the searches Query domains were assigned to Pfam families that their best matches belong to As for those that have not been classified into Pfam families by either ID match or by sequence similarity match we tried to cluster these into families on the basis of their sequence similarities This procedure was done by an all against all sequence similarity search E value 0 01 using FASTA and polytopic membrane domains were clustered by applying a multiple linkage clustering method 30 to the FASTA results N family members must have more than 0 9 N N 1 links to other members with tolerance of 10 missing links among members We selected 121 clustered families that contain no fewer than four members and aligned protein sequences in each family using the CLUSTAL W program 31 For a complete list of assigned polytopic membrane domains see Additional data files and 32 TM helix identification in the families of polytopic membrane domains We assume that all protein domains in a classified family have a defined number of TM helices To identify the number of TM helices we made a hydrophobic plot for each family of polytopic membrane domain We took the aligned sequences in Pfam s families and in clustered families and calculated the averaged GES hydrophobic values 8 of all the residues at each aligned position Deleted and inserted residues represented by and respectively are given 0 individual values The plot for each family was generated by the averaged GES values along their corresponding aligned positions Most hydrophobic regions were clearly defined as most TM helices aligned well in each family By identifying hydrophobic regions in the plots we assigned numbers of TM helices to classified families of polytopic membrane proteins We also eliminated 3 Pfam A and 20 Pfam B families as they did not contain multiple hydrophobic regions in their hydrophobicity plots Therefore we have 228 Pfam A 298 Pfam B and 121 clustered families for further analysis Analysis of amino acid distribution and pair motifs We analyzed 168 Pfam A families with more than 20 members and generated consensus sequences with their sequence logos of all aligned sequences in these families using the Alpro sequence logo program 19 The selected family size threshold of 20 members is somewhat arbitrary We chose it because first a significant portion 75 of the 228 classified Pfam A families had more than 20 members and second the potential bias from small families could be reduced as they tend to have more conserved residues than big families However we can show that our results remain unaffected by changing this threshold In particular we analyzed Pfam A families containing more than 25 30 35 or 40 members and got essentially the same results Amino acids with sequence conservation values R sequence of no less than 3 0 top 15 of all values were considered as conserved residues For all the families we counted the occurrences of amino acids in the consensus sequences and in all aligned sequences in hydrophobic regions which are defined to have no fewer than 10 continuous amino acids with GES hydrophobicity value greater than 0 We used the pair definition from a previous study 12 For example a pair XY n X and Y represent amino acids and n a number corresponds to amino acids X and Y separated by n 1 residues We analyzed occurrences of pair motifs of all combinations of amino acids separated by 1 to 10 residues This result was compared with a previous study of the 200 most significant over represented pairs 12 33 Analysis of the families of polytopic membrane domain in genomes Using simple cross referencing based on the above procedure proteomic entries in each genome were searched for matches of polytopic membrane domains of classified families Numbers of membrane domains in classified families were counted and analyzed in all genomes studied Additional data files
