 Background Proliferation and dedifferentiation of HIV 1 infected renal epithelium is singularly unique compared to the effects of HIV 1 infection in other non lymphoid tissues Indeed unlike the atrophy and cell death of infected central nervous system 1 cardiac 2 or gastro intestinal 3 parenchyma aberrant cell cycle progression of infected renal epithelium is a defining feature of HIV associated nephropathy HIVAN 4 5 Yet the mechanisms are largely unknown whereby HIV 1 subverts the cell cycle controls that normally maintain renal epithelial in G 0 Nonetheless several observations from in vitro and in vivo models of HIVAN pathogenesis suggest that HIV 1 expression itself may be a key pathogenic factor Infection of cultured podocytes with replication incompetent HIV 1 demonstrated that HIV 1 gene expression leads to the proliferation and dedifferentiation of the infected podocytes 6 7 8 recapitulating the phenotypes observed in HIVAN specimens 9 10 Similarly renal expression of replication incompetent HIV 1 proviral transgenes in mice and rats produces a proliferative renal lesion that is indistiguisable both histopathologically and clinically from human HIVAN 11 12 13 14 These observations raise the possibility that HIV 1 gene products may interact with mitogenic pathways in infected renal epithelium to cause aberrant cell cycle engagement In comparison to the two general alternative mechanisms utilized by known transforming viruses to promote cell cycle progression namely by activating or bypassing endogenous D type cyclins herein referred to as cyclin D it has not been established whether HIV 1 gene products trigger either cyclin D dependent or cyclin D independent proliferation in non lymphoid tissues 15 In infected renal epithelium HIV 1 could disrupt the inhibitory binding of pRb to E2F independent of endogenous cyclin D analogous to transforming viral mechanisms that bypass and down regulate endogenous cyclin D such as SV 40 T antigen binding to pRb 16 HHV 8 v cyclin binding to and activating cyclin dependent kinase 6 CDK 17 and activation of cyclin E by EBV induced c myc 18 Alternatively HIV 1 could activate cyclin D dependent proliferation as exemplified by RSV v src mediated signaling 19 In most tissues the selective activation of these cell cycle pathways is readily discernable Indeed if cells depend on cyclin D mediated G1 S transition passage from G 0 through the restriction point in G 1 is dependent on the de novo expression of cyclin D transcript accumulation of nuclear cyclin D protein and cyclin D CDK 4 6 phosphorylation of pRb 20 Then although nuclear localized cyclin D decreases in S phase in individual cells 21 total cyclin D in asynchronously proliferating cell populations remain elevated compared to quiescent cells 20 In renal epithelial and mesenchymal cells cyclin D 1 is the dominant D type cyclin activated during cell cycle progression both during nephrogenesis 22 and in non viral mediated kidney cell proliferation 23 Here we ask whether infected podocytes expressing HIV 1 genes show the hallmarks of cyclin D 1 dependent proliferation specifically the up regulation of cyclin D 1 transcript and protein expression and the subsequent phosphorylation of pRb on serine 780 a target site of active cyclin D 1 CDK 4 6 that is not shared with cyclin E CDK 2 complexes 24 Utilizing two well characterized models of HIVAN pathogenesis HIV 1 transgenic mice 11 12 13 and HIV 1 infection of cultured podocytes 6 7 8 we find not only these hallmarks of cyclin D 1 dependent proliferation but also dysregulation of cyclin D 1 expression that normally occurs with cell cell contact and differentiation 25 Results Phospho pRb Ser780 expression in vivo Cyclin D 1 is characterized as the major D type cyclin controlling G 1 phase progression in kidney cells both during normal and abnormal proliferation 22 23 To determine whether cyclin D 1 may be active in promoting G 1 S progression in kidneys expressing HIV 1 genes we utilized a well characterized HIV 1 transgenic mouse model Tg26 of HIVAN 11 12 13 Secondary to renal expression of the HIV 1 NL4 3 gag pol proviral transgene adolescent Tg26 transgenics develop a progressive proliferative renal disease marked by podocyte and tubular epithelial hyperplasia that is indistinguishable both clinically and histopathologically from human HIVAN In order to determine if cyclin D 1 plays a role in this hyperplasia kidneys from three proteinuric 40 day old transgenic siblings and three non transgenic littermates were stained by immunohistochemistry with antibody to phospho pRb Ser780 a site of cyclin D 1 CDK 4 6 phosphorylation not targeted by cyclin E CDK 2 complexes that disrupts pRb E2F binding for G 1 S progression 24 Figure 1depicts the intense heterogeneous nuclear staining of glomerular podocytes and tubular epithelium from hyperplastic nephrons in the diseased transgenics versus the absent staining of nephrons in the non transgenics consistent with the very low mitotic index in normal kidneys of adult animals 26 This suggests that cyclin D 1 is promoting cell cycle progression during the proliferation of epithelium in diseased kidneys Cyclin D 1and phospho pRb Ser780 expression in vitro HIV 1 expression in cultured podocytes recapitulates the phenotypic abnormalities induced by HIV 1 expression in infected podocytes in vivo specifically proliferation loss of contact mediated growth control and dedifferentiation 6 7 8 To determine if these phenotypes were marked by enhanced cyclin D 1 and phospho pRb Ser780 expression we utilized the podocyte cell culture protocol developed by Rieser et al 27 28 to study both sub confluent podocyte growth and podocyte growth during the formation of mature cell cell contacts at confluence In this protocol normal podocytes are growth arrested 4 5 days after initial confluence and are fully differentiated with mature cell cell contacts approximately 10 days later Figure 2Ashows that cyclin D 1 message levels are nearly equivalent between mock wild type control virus and HIV 1 infected subconfluent podocytes although only the HIV 1 infected subconfluent podocytes had elevated levels of cyclin D 1 protein In contrast cell cell contact in wild type and control infected but not HIV 1 infected podocytes caused a severe down regulation of cyclin D 1 transcript and protein concomitant with the up regulation of synaptopodin a podocyte differentiation marker 7 28 by the end of the 14 day differentiation period Although HIV 1 infected podocytes showed some decrease in cyclin D 1 message by the end of the differentiation period cyclin D 1 protein levels remained elevated suggesting activation by HIV 1 of mechanisms that stabilize cyclin D 1 protein levels Moreover HIV 1 infected podocytes but not control infected podocytes had readily detectable phospho pRb Ser780 at the end of the differentiation period suggesting that the stably up regulated cyclin D 1 protein remained active in promoting cell cycle progression Figure 2B The ongoing proliferation of HIV 1 infected podocytes following cell cell contact led to the formation of multiple foci Figure 2C with intense heterogenous nuclear cyclin D 1 immunofluorescence consistent with ongoing asynchronous proliferation in this population of cells Figure 3 These data indicate that HIV 1 expression in infected podocytes induces cyclin D 1 and phospho pRb Ser780 expression hallmarks of cyclin D 1 mediated G 1 S progression The data however do not prove that cyclin D 1 expression alone is sufficient to cause cell cycle progression Requirement of HIV 1 expression for induction of cyclin D 1 We sought to further confirm that HIV 1 expression and not some idiosyncratic effect of infection was directly inducing cyclin D 1 expression in infected podocytes First we utilized the small molecule cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol which at low concentrations e g less than 100 nM can selectively suppress HIV 1 transcript elongation without altering cellular transcripts in cell types of various lineages including podocytes 7 29 30 Cyclin D 1 transcript levels were followed before during and after treatment of confluent wild type or HIV 1 infected podocytes with 50 nM flavopiridol a dose that suppresses HIV 1 transcription by 70 7 Analysis of HIV 1 cyclin D 1 and glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase G3PDH transcript levels in podocytes treated with flavopiridol for 2 days followed by drug washout for 1 day showed that cyclin D 1 expression paralleled HIV 1 expression in infected podocytes before during and after suppression of HIV 1 genes Figure 4 Secondly we utilized single gene mutants of HIV 1 8 to determine which HIV 1 gene s may be involved with up regulating cyclin D 1 expression Analysis of cyclin D 1 transcript levels in podocytes infected with HIV 1 singly mutated with premature stop codons in the genes encoding the various structural and regulatory proteins of HIV 1 except tat which is present in every virus showed that nef deficient virus did not significantly up regulate cyclin D 1 expression when compared to the other mutant viruses Figure 5 Taken together these data indicate that induction of cyclin D 1 expression requires HIV 1 gene expression and that HIV 1 nef is important for this induction Discussion The mechanisms whereby HIV 1 subverts cell cycle controls in infected renal epithelium have been unclear Here we demonstrate that podocytes expressing HIV 1 genes display the hallmarks of cyclin D 1 dependent cell cycle progression specifically that cyclin D 1 transcript and protein expression are markedly up regulated and that levels of phospho pRb Ser780 a target of cyclin D 1 CDK 4 6 but not cyclin E CDK 2 complexes 24 are induced in vitro and in vivo In addition preliminary micro array gene profiling of HIV 1 infected tubular epithelium showed that cyclin D 1 expression is up regulated several fold when compared to uninfected tubular epithelium Michael Ross personal communication This suggests that the HIV 1 induced proliferation of infected renal epithelium may be caused by a cyclin D 1 dependent mechanism unlike other viruses that bypass a requirement for G 1 phase cyclins to trigger aberrant cell cycle progression Moreover normal cellular controls on cell cycle progression appears to be dysregulated by HIV 1 expression because cell cell contact and differentiation events that normally lead to the down regulation of cyclin D 1 expression 25 did not significantly alter cyclin D 1 protein levels in HIV 1 infected podocytes This suggests a novel stabilization of cyclin D 1 protein in podocytes by HIV 1 We are exploring whether this occurs from enhanced translation of cyclin D 1 message and or decreased degradation of cyclin D 1 protein and whether other D type cyclins may be involved in phosphorylating pRb in HIVAN Prior studies in HIV 1 transgenic animals support the model that HIV 1 gene products interact with endogenous mitogenic pathways in infected renal epithelium 11 12 13 14 Kidney transplants between normal and transgenic Tg26 siblings suggested that specific HIV 1 proteins within the kidney and not circulating factors transform infected renal epithelium 13 Indeed HIV 1 transgenic mice generated with an HIV 1 proviral construct mutated in the Nef PXXP SH3 binding motif for Src family kinases failed to develop nephropathy 31 and a recent in vitro analysis of podocytes infected with single gene mutants of HIV 1 further suggest that Nef plays a central role in causing the proliferative phenotype in HIVAN 8 Utilizing these same single gene mutant viruses we showed here that Nef appears to be play a role in the up regulation of cyclin D 1 by HIV 1 in vitro Importantly these single gene mutants do not exclude the possibility that other HIV 1 gene s may cooperate with nef to induce cyclin D1 particularly tat which is present in every virus Cumulatively however these observations do suggest a mechanism whereby HIV 1 expression in renal epithelium may induce cyclin D 1 activation of Src family kinases by Nef would be expected to up regulate cyclin D 1 gene expression and promote the synthesis and stabilization of cyclin D 1 protein via Src Ras MAPK and Src PI3K mTOR signal transduction pathways respectively 32 33 34 Interestingly our unpublished in vitro observations and published data showing marked expression of basic fibroblast growth factor in the interstitium of HIVAN kidneys 35 suggest that soluble mitogens may be important cofactors with HIV 1 expression to induce cyclin D 1 Thus interrupting HIV 1 gene expression should down regulate cyclin D 1 and correct the phenotypic abnormalities in infected podocytes In support of this notion we show here that cyclin D 1 expression parallels HIV 1 expression before during and after suppression of HIV 1 transcription with flavopiridol and recently we showed that longer periods of treatment with flavopiridol ameliorate the phenotypic abnormalities of infected podocytes 7 Conclusions The following results of this study suggest that HIV 1 expression leads to cyclin D 1 mediated G 1 S progression in infected podocytes cyclin D 1 transcript and protein levels are markedly up regulated phospho Rb Ser780 levels are increased cyclin D 1 protein and phospho Rb Ser780 levels do not decrease with podocyte cell cell contact and differentiation and the up regulation of cyclin D 1 requires the expression of HIV 1 genes particularly HIV 1 nef In sum these results suggest HIV induced cell cycle mechanisms may contribute to aberrant epithelial proliferation in HIVAN Methods Podocyte cell
