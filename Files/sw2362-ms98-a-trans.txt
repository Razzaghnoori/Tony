 i i assume i assume you have kids uh we have one she s only nine months old oh well she she doesn t have to worry about public schools yet right well my degree is in teaching so ah so i well we have a little bit of a basis for conversation i was a substitute teacher for about a year oh really yeah i uh thought i wanted to be a teacher so but before i went through all of that i wanted to see how i was going to like it um hum and they uh in Alabama where i came from they they allow you to substitute if you got a four year degree so i went out and played substitute for a while and decided nope not for me did you teach in all subjects or in all grade levels or yeah it was i just took grades one through six i thought i was going to be smart and get the good kids wrong um hum well my degree was in fourth through seventh grade but i taught junior high and i expected it to be a lot of trouble but it wasn t that bad i taught remedial reading kids um and well they don t call it remedial reading these days they call it something else but but anyway at the time that s what i taught and um um yeah you kind of group your behavioral problems together that way hum hum when you have your slow readers but it it wasn t too bad we we got along real well well i i sometimes wonder if i didn t mess up i maybe should have taken the higher grades because at least you can if you have to you can get mean with them those little kids don t understand it yeah i especially with the real young ones i started out wanting to teach elementary lower like primary and then top primary and thought well no i don t like this as much and ended up moving up and got up until about the sixth grade and so that s what i got my certification in um hum but i had decided long before i was even married that i wanted to if possible teach my kids at home and not put them in the public schools yeah um and my reason for that was i don t like the uh what s the right word the varied inappropriate influences that you find so much in the public schools well that s a nice way of putting it you can find a lot of good public schools if you if you look real hard but i don t think they could cover everything that you could teach your children on an individual basis exactly exactly and two most people don t have that option yeah you know and plus it also depends on the district you re in as i mean on the i ve seen some districts where all the schools are lousy it doesn t matter what you do um hum uh accept for the private ones of course we re talking about public right i don t know back when i was going to school uh you just didn t get away with things these kids get away with now um hum i mean you you pulled stunts like that and you were down at the principal s office and usually bending over to get five of the best yeah um but now nowadays they can t even they can barely scold the children for something you you know without getting sued and the the um the crime is just escalated and the drugs and even in the the lower the lower schools oh yeah well the thing that really did it for me i was subbing in a fifth grade class and uh this kid comes to school with his lunch box and inside this lunch box he s got easily two i d say two hundred two hundred and fifty dollars in one dollar bills um and i asked him uh what are you doing with that he says my father gave it to me and i didn t believe it for a minute um hum um so uh but uh you know the not a lot i could do about it right can t stop the kid from bringing money to school if he wants crazy for him to but well i have i i ve fully i think i understood what the what the kid was doing he was a uh well let s just say he was one of those types that you wouldn t doubt that he was selling something um hum yeah but not a lot i could do about it well we had the problem when i was in with teaching um i was eighth and ninth graders that i worked with and if we did have a a student come in and they were drunk or they were on something you had the option of calling the police and have them taken out of the schools or trying to teach them something while they were there um hum and you don t know if you were reaching them or not but we felt like you know maybe just going ahead and try to teaching them was better trying to teach them was better than have them taken out yeah because uh that just that doesn t do a lot for them i mean it alleviates your problem but it doesn t do anything for them yeah right uh most the time if they were they were some of them were even better behaved i ve only had two instances where i could it was really noticeable but they were better behaved when they were um i don t know if it was alcohol or something else that they were on but it ended up better uh i don t know guns and but i don t know that s something i think there s a problem too with teachers trying to um to be so versatile that they do lose sight of the basics you know they ve been a big drive in especially in the seventies to return back to the basics um hum and uh and i m not completely just you know just teach the basics in schools but i think there does does need to be a reemphasis of those because of our our lowering grades in the standardized test and such oh yeah yeah oh sure i mean it s it s it s indicative across the board that we we ve done something wrong but right and when you see uh Koreans and Chinese and Japanese who are taking all the uh science jobs all the engineering jobs all the mathematical jobs and you know here we are we can t we can t balance a checkbook without a calculator um hum um i don t know well i spent a year and a half in Japan also and i ve seen how their sc hool system works and i they go by a complete rote system you you just memorize everything um hum and then at the end of the of a certain time period you spitted everything back out and the better uh memorizer you are the better your grades going to be yeah so i don t completely agree with that either no but there there definitely needs to be a balance somewhere yeah that s that s a great deal what law school s like oh is it yeah is that what you ended up going into um yeah oh and uh i just same sort of thing they just you you sit there and read hundreds and hundreds of cases and then you get one exam for the whole semester um hum and it s how well you can remember it all how how much you can stuff in your brain yeah and i found that a particularly useless way of studying yeah um i never did i always tried to understand things not tried to memorize um hum and consequently some of the very best students were had excellent memories um hum but they couldn t put two and two together as far as the law was concerned yeah so uh it didn t show me anything a year and a half i gave it up yeah i wasn t really want i didn t want to be a lawyer anyway just wanted the degree um hum yeah so yeah well well i don t know what can we do about it good good question probably taking money money is not the answer no there s plenty of money in the system it s just yeah i mean they re they re throwing more money at it now than ever before and things are getting worse i think it s uh like a lot of things in the in the the United States we ve got so much built up in um in the state in the bureaucracy and in the politics of it and in the the power plays that it needs to be pulled down and started over again and there s no way that that can be done um hum um hum um hum not without wiping out a whole generation of of kids in the school system and so yeah yeah maybe on smaller smaller scales well i don t know i uh as much as i didn t like school when i was going through it from my perspective now i can see that it s a lot better than what we have now um hum and i think part of it is that they ve got to give authority back to the local school yeah you know i mean it s it s silly that these that these people are handcuffed when it comes to discipline um hum right into the classroom it needs to be yeah exactly i mean i be able to be enforced i i mean teachers are so afraid now of even saying something um hum to students because they re going get they re going to get complaints or they re going to get sued or something it s like doctors in lawsuits you know they re kind of fearful of everything oh yeah well lawyers help create that that s that s true i ve well at least i ve heard that i i i haven t fortunately been in a situation where it s been applicable to me but but well i think i think i i mean what we ve turned the schools into now are just day care centers um hum you know somebody okay we re going to send our kid here for seven or eight hours a day and he s out of our hair right and the other part of it is parents have quit becoming parents um hum you know they just oh yeah it has to be reinforced in the home oh sure i mean mean you you can you can have the best school system in the world if you don t get anything anything at home then it s it s not going to help either yeah right so i i don t know i don t know what the i don t know what the answer is um hum it s an interesting interesting thing you want to do i how is Texas about keeping your children out of public schools do they allow it yeah they allow it under certain circumstances you have to to prove that you re teaching them something you have to follow um hum a preferred curriculum um well they try to encourage you to to follow a specific curriculum although you don t have to um hum and then if you have particular religious beliefs they have to be they re kind of monitored you know they they will allow you to i can t think of any examples but certain religious groups don t want their children in public schools because the influence and maybe if they was a group of Mennonites or something like that i don t think they re is in in this area but um hum um they they are monitored by the uh by the state school board hum so that s interesting i remembering reading a few cases about that when it when some people first tried that and they got sued um hum got taken to court by the school system i m glad the parents won i mean that s seems silly that uh i mean we started that s the that s the way you got your education in this country um hum and then uh
