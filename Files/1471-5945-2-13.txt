 Background Normal wound healing requires fibroblast proliferation and migration into the wound bed followed by tightly regulated matrix deposition and contraction Aberrations in these processes can lead to excessive collagen accumulation as found in keloids These scars extend beyond the original wound margins and are excluded from glabrous surfaces palms soles When grown in vitro keloid fibroblast cultures contain a high percentage of smooth muscle actin SMA expressing cells myofibroblasts In spite of numerous studies the etiology of keloid formation remains obscure 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 However as TGF 1 regulates the expression and deposition of collagenous extracellular matrix ECM 12 13 14 it is expected that keloids develop due to aberrant responses to this cytokine While in vitro analyses of TGF 1 levels in keloid and normal fibroblasts have yielded variable results 15 16 17 18 19 20 higher levels of TGF 1 receptors and Smad3 activation were recently reported in keloid fibroblasts 21 Thus procedures that lower TGF 1 expression may help prevent keloid development 15 16 18 22 TGF 1 also supports the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts which are a major constituent of the granulation tissue 23 24 The process depends upon the deformability of the ECM 17 25 and is mediated by the ED A splice variant of fibronectin 26 27 ED A fibronectin is expressed in the initial stages of wound healing and along with collagen I is positively regulated by TGF 1 26 Progression of granulation tissue to neodermis requires a decrease in cellularity through apoptosis of endothelial cells fibroblasts and myofibroblasts 28 29 Keloid fibroblasts demonstrate aberrant apoptotic behavior 30 31 although studies have given variable results 5 9 11 30 31 32 33 34 35 Our initial data for serum starvation induced apoptosis in monolayer cultures of dermal fibroblasts demonstrated delayed apoptosis of keloid fibroblasts and a negative correlation with SMA expression 36 Similar correlations were observed in rat lung fibroblasts where TGF 1 increased SMA content while acting as an antiapoptotic agent 37 38 It should be noted however that many of the myofibroblasts were still able to undergo apoptosis consistent with in vivo data on palatal wound healing 39 Thus TGF 1 can promote both SMA expression in the initial stages of wound healing and apoptosis in later stages of wound healing The latter effect may be related to the apoptosis induced by relaxation of the ECM or of the collagen gel 40 41 In order to follow both the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts and their apoptosis in relation to the tension in the surrounding ECM we utilized two color FACS analyses Experiments were carried out with human dermal fibroblasts of different origins keloid nonaffected palmar sites of the corresponding patients normal fibroblasts from palms heels or nonpalmoplantar sites SMA content and apoptosis were evaluated as a function of serum TGF 1 and collagen type I The observed phenotypic differences between fibroblasts grown from glabrous vs nonglabrous tissue suggest a reason for the exclusion of keloids from specific body sites of keloid prone individuals Methods Cell growth media collagen coating and embedding in rafts Skin samples from palmoplantar PP and non PP loci were obtained under IRB approval from African American keloid prone and normal donors 36 Biopsies were rinsed with PBS minced into small fragments and epidermis separated from dermis using a 4 C overnight incubation with Dispase II 2 5 mg ml in DMEM The epidermis was then removed with forceps and the dermal pieces were incubated with Collagenase D 3 mg ml in collagenase buffer see below for 15 30 min at 37 C Any cells and pieces were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in trypsin EDTA 0 5 mg ml trypsin and 0 25 mM EDTA in PBS for an additional 15 30 min at 37 C with occasional shaking Fetal bovine serum 10 was added at the end to neutralize the trypsin Cells were harvested by centrifugation 800 rpm in a clinical centrifuge and were grown and serially passaged as previously described 36 For experiments cells from passages four to six were used with an initial plating density of 10 20 cells mm 2 When added ascorbic acid and TGF 1 R D Systems were used at 50 g ml and 10 ng ml respectively Fetal bovine serum Hyclone 10 was used as supplement to the media low glucose DMEM GIBCO BRL when indicated Collagen type I coated plates were prepared by incubating tissue culture plates with 0 1 mg rat tail collagen per ml Phosphate Buffered Saline PBS for 3 hrs at room temperature followed by a 30 min 37 C incubation with 0 5 BSA bovine serum albumin in PBS with 0 5 mM Ethylene DiamineTetraacetic acid EDTA PBS EDTA and final PBS washes Collagen gels 1 5 mg ml were prepared with fibroblasts harvested at confluence and resuspended to 10 6cells ml collagen solution see also 36 One ml of this cell suspension was added per well of a 6 well plate Nunc Gel relaxation was achieved by full detachment with a spatula Gels with keloid fibroblasts tend to shrink but remain attached to the center of the well To harvest cells the gels were first incubated with 100 l trypsin EDTA 0 5 mg ml trypsin 0 25 mM EDTA for 10 min at 37 C and then with 400 l collagenase D 5 mg ml Boehringer in collagenase buffer 20 mM Hepes pH 7 0 13 mM NaCl 10 mM Ca Acetate for 30 min at 37 C The reaction was stopped by addition of fetal bovine serum to 10 Cells were collected by centrifugation at 2000 rpm and the resultant pellet was washed with PBS 3H Thymidine incorporation Fibroblasts at 70 confluence were incubated for 4 hrs in serum free DMEM containing 4 Ci ml methyl 3H thymidine 87 Ci mmol NEN Boston MA The cells were harvested by trypsinization sonicated and incubated for 1 hr in 10 tri chloro acetic acid TCA on ice They were then applied to a glass filter Whatman GF C glass microfibre and washed in a filter assembly Sigma with 10 TCA and once with 95 ethanol before being dried and counted in an LKB liquid scintillation counter The cell number was determined by direct counting The data were an average of three experiments Preparation and performance of the FACS analysis For each FACS assay about one million cells were fixed by suspension in the non formaldehyde tissue fixative HistoChoice Amresco Ohio for 20 minute at room temperature

measured using the TUNEL assay Boehringer In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit Fluorescein according to manufacturer s recommendations on cells which were resuspended in 50 l reaction mix and incubated for 1 hr at 37 C with regular agitation After two PBS washes cells were resuspended in PBS and incubated with the primary antibody The primary antibodies against human SMA monoclonal Asm 1 Roche Molecular Biochemicals TGF 1 pan specific produced in rabbits R D systems ED A fibronectin MAS 521 Accurate Chemicals Westbury NY and TGF 1 receptor II affinity purified rabbit polyclonal H 657 Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc were diluted 1 100 The secondary antibodies FITC and Phycoerythrin PE conjugated IgG Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs were used at 1 100 dilutions Incubations with antibodies primary and secondary were all carried out for one hour at room temperature with several PBS washes in between The samples were filtered through 35 m cell strainer caps of Falcon polystyrene tubes before being applied to a Beckton Dickinson Fascan equipped with CellQuest software version 3 2 Controls included cells incubated only with the secondary antibody cells incubated only with the primary antibodies cells after the TUNEL reaction only and cells without the TUNEL reaction These controls were used to determine the settings for the FACS analyses The background fluorescence had values around 20 30 in arbitrary fluorescence units for all of the controls Cells with fluorescence above this value were considered immunopositive and or apoptotic The results of the FACS analyses are presented using a combined measure of both percentage immunopositive apoptotic cells with fluorescence above the background and their GeoMean fluorescence immuno positive or apoptotic cells GeoMean

cells Click here for file The data presented were obtained in three independent experiments with fibroblasts from two keloid prone individuals labeled as keloid D and keloid T as well as with fibroblasts from one non affected individual Similar results not presented here were found with fibroblasts from other keloid donors and nonaffected individuals Results and Discussion Growth rates and morphologic characteristics of palmoplantar and non palmoplantar fibroblasts The proliferation of preconfluent fibroblasts grown on tissue culture plastic was measured as a function of 3H thymidine incorporation into TCA precipitates As shown in Fig 1 fibroblasts derived either from the palmar skin of keloid forming donors or the plantar skin of nonaffected donors incorporated more 3H thymidine than did those isolated from keloid or normal nonglabrous trunk skin This apparent difference in proliferation rate is consistent with the microscopic observation data not shown that palmoplantar PP fibroblasts reached confluence 2 3 days earlier than did the non palmoplantar non PP cultures when plated at the same density Earlier work from other laboratories had indicated that normal fibroblasts grew more quickly 42 similarly 6 43 or more slowly 16 34 than did keloid fibroblasts Such variations may reflect differences in culture conditions at the time of assay For example in confluent cultures the growth rate of PP fibroblasts slows to less than that of non PP fibroblasts results not shown As shown in Fig 2Aand 2B PP cultures can also be distinguished by a paucity of fibroblasts with high granularity side scattering a characteristic often associated with the elaboration of RER rough endoplasmic reticulum 44 In both confluent and post confluent cultures the populations of cells with the highest granularity were found in the non PP isolates keloid and nonplantar The differences in proliferation rate and granularity predict and are consistent with differences in protein expression 36 below Palmar but not plantar isolates were also found to have smaller cell size judged by forward scattering Fig 2A 2Band light microscopy data not shown TGF 1 receptor and ED A fibronectin in palmoplantar and non palmoplantar fibroblasts Earlier work demonstrated that palmoplantar fibroblasts express less SMA than do keloid or to a lesser extent normal non palmoplantar fibroblasts 36 As TGF 1 is a positive regulator of SMA these observations could reflect the relative levels of active TGF 1 or the levels of those proteins responsible for the transduction of its signal We therefore measured the expression of SMA together with of the expression of those proteins participating in the initial signal transduction event TGF 1 its type II receptor TGF 1 RII and ED A fibronectin No consistent differences were detected in the levels of intracellular or secreted latent or active TGF 1 data not shown However as shown in Figs 3 for FACS analysis examples please see additional file 1 Additional data 1 ppt the expression of both TGF 1 RII and ED A fibronectin was lower in PP cultures than in non PP cultures In contrast to previous reports 21 the level of TGF 1 RII in keloid fibroblast cultures was similar to that in plantar cultures or even lower than that of normal nonplantar fibroblast cultures Fig 3 SMA content correlated most closely with the levels of ED A fibronectin Fig 3 For keloid fibroblasts the size and granularity of the SMA expressing cells was similar to those expressing ED A fibronectin rather than TGF 1 RII not shown please see additional file 2 Additional data 2 ppt Cells with the highest granularity expressed TGF 1 RII while cells with medium granularity had high levels of SMA and ED A fibronectin not shown please see additional file 2 Additional data 2 ppt Together with our previous results demonstrating higher levels of thrombospondin 1 in keloid fibroblasts 36 the data suggest that keloid fibroblasts and to a lesser extent normal non PP fibroblasts appear primed to more effectively transmit the TGF 1 signal and thereby to express the myofibroblast phenotype Additional File 1 FACS analysis of fibroblasts reacted with primary antibodies followed by FITC conjugated secondary antibody The X and Y axes show the fluorescence intensity and the cell count respectively The background fluorescence values marked by the black bars were around 20 in arbitrary fluorescence units for all secondary antibodies used Fibroblasts cultures were grown with serum as monolayer cultures and were harvested three days

keloid fibroblasts The fluorescence ranges for each protein were chosen so as to represent fibroblasts with background fluorescence with intermediate fluorescence and with highest fluorescence The FACS results are for the samples represented in Additional files 1and in Fig 3 Click here for file Myofibroblast formation and apoptosis Resolution of normal dermal wound healing requires a decrease in scar cellularity so as to prevent excessive collagen accumulation and wound contraction The reduction in cellularity occurs through the process of apoptosis in fibroblasts 28 and possibly myofibroblasts 29 and see below To determine the extent to which the myofibroblast phenotype is expressed and the extent to which myofibroblasts undergo apoptosis SMA content and apoptosis were measured simultaneously using two color FACS analyses Shown in Fig 4are the four classes of fibroblasts which could be distinguished SMA apoptosis lower left quadrant LL na ve fibroblasts SMA apoptosis upper left quadrant UL myofibroblasts SMA apoptosis lower right quadrant LR apoptotic fibroblasts and SMA apoptosis upper right quadrant UR apoptotic myofibroblasts The analyses by FACS of fibroblasts grown directly on tissue culture plates monolayer cultures or on collagen I revealed several differences between PP and non PP cultures in response to confluence serum TGF 1 and embedding within collagen gels Figs 5 6 7 Monolayer cultures Comparisons of confluent cultures with three day postconfluent cultures revealed an increase in SMA levels independent of media serum content Fig 5A for examples of the actual FACS analyses please see additional file 3 Additional data 3 ppt The postconfluent PP cultures had considerably less SMA than either the keloid or the normal non PP control Fig 5A These results are consistent with data reported for palatal fibroblasts 43 but contrast with observations on corneal fibroblasts 45 In the absence of exogenous TGF 1 keloid fibroblasts accumulated the most SMA Fig 5A Additional File 3 Two color FACS analysis of apoptosis and myofibroblast formation Graphs are given in Fig 5A 5Bof the main text Fibroblasts were analyzed at confluence

given in Fig 5A 5Bof the main text Click here for file To determine whether TGF 1 could eliminate differences in SMA levels between PP and non PP fibroblasts cultures were incubated at confluence for three days with serum free or serum containing media supplemented with 0 ng ml or 10 ng ml active TGF 1 and SMA and apoptosis were evaluated Fig 5A 5B for examples of actual FACS analyses please see also additional files Additional data 3 ppt All fibroblast cultures responded to TGF 1 with an increased accumulation of SMA although the SMA content of PP cultures again remained lower than either the keloid or the normal non PP isolates While the two keloid and palmar pairs differed in absolute SMA levels the difference between paired keloid and palmar samples was statistically significant p 0 05 not shown please see also additional file 4 Additional data 4 ppt In both paired samples keloid fibroblasts contained more SMA than did palmar fibroblasts Lower concentrations of TGF 1 2 5 ng ml and 5 ng ml were also found data not shown to be equally effective in upregulating SMA in accordance with other data 45 46 Additional File 4 The difference in the SMA levels for two corresponding

for file Simultaneous evaluation of apoptosis was carried out Serum withdrawal increased the percentage of apoptotic cells Fig 5B for examples of actual FACS analyses please see additional files Additional data 3 ppt a considerable number of which were SMA positive The impact of serum withdrawal was found to be greater in PP cultures than in non PP cultures Fig 5B In addition during serum starvation about 10 of PP fibroblasts detached and were found floating FACS analysis demonstrated that these cells were all apoptotic not shown see also 36 Although TGF 1 acted anti apoptotically in PP cultures palmar and normal plantar fibroblasts and prevented the shedding of cells into the media its effect was dissimilar in non PP cultures where TGF 1 had either no impact keloid T and normal nonplantar fibroblasts or was pro apoptotic keloid D cultures In the presence of serum TGF 1 acted anti apoptotically only on the normal plantar cultures and was without observable effect on the palmar cultures Fig 5B However the addition of TGF 1 to the non PP cultures always resulted in increased apoptosis in the presence of serum in keloid D small increases were observed and in keloid T and in normal nonplantar cultures large increases were observed Thus in contrast to the ability of TGF 1 to induce the expression of SMA in all fibroblast cultures its effect on apoptosis was fibroblast origin dependent Impact of collagen on levels of SMA and apoptosis in fibroblasts Measurements were made of the SMA content and apoptotic status of fibroblasts embedded within attached or detached relaxed gels incubated for three days in the presence or absence of serum and TGF 1 Figs 6and 7 The data were compared with those obtained prior to embedding and with three day post confluent monolayer cultures Fig 5A 5B In attached gels SMA content modestly increased in PP fibroblasts e g UL in 6a Fig 7A for the FACS at confluence see examples in Additional data 3 TGF 1 further induced the expression of SMA e g UL UR in Fig 6B Fig 7A although in no instance were the levels increased to those observed in the three day postconfluent cultures Fig 5A In contrast to PP fibroblasts the SMA content of keloid and normal non PP fibroblasts did not increase post collagen embedding Even TGF 1 was modestly effective at increasing SMA levels in keloid and normal non PP fibroblasts Fig 7A The inability of keloid fibroblasts to respond with increased SMA to TGF 1 may be a consequence of their ability to initiate gel contraction only the central portion of the gel remained attached and apoptosis In relaxed gels there was no detectable increase in SMA in palmar fibroblasts and a decrease in SMA in keloid fibroblasts Most of the fibroblasts were apoptotic e g LR in Figs 6c 6c Similar results were obtained with normal PP and normal non PP fibroblasts The impact of ECM collagen on SMA accumulation was also evaluated in two other experimental settings data not shown monolayer cultures of fibroblasts grown with ascorbic acid to permit collagen secretion and monolayer cultures of fibroblasts grown on collagen I coated plates In both settings SMA levels were reduced compared to controls grown on noncoated tissue culture plastic or without ascorbic acid see similar results in 47 Taken together these results suggest that the presence of collagen and the stressed to relaxed state transition of the ECM alters or dominates TGF 1 signal transduction see also 25 The corresponding reduction in SMA is in agreement with recent in vivo data on splintered vs unsplintered rat wounds 48 but differs from in vitro results on human gingival fibroblasts 49 When apoptosis was evaluated it was found to increase significantly in all fibroblast types within attached gels by comparison to the input fibroblasts Fig 7B Many of the apoptotic cells were SMA positive see UR in Fig 6 Previous reports indicating a lack of apoptosis in attached gels were based on analyses using an ELISA that did not allow detection of events in apoptosis which precede the formation of a nucleosomal ladder 50 Experiments aimed at evaluating keloid fibroblasts in attached gels were confounded by the ability of these fibroblasts to contract the gels and cause partial gel relaxation with concomitant apoptosis Figs 6a 7B Thus while keloid fibroblasts did not readily undergo apoptosis in response to serum starvation in monolayer cultures they underwent the most apoptosis once embedded in attached gels due to the self relaxation of these gels At the same time and under the same conditions the corresponding palmar fibroblasts showed lower apoptosis levels Figs 6b 7B TGF 1 had minor and variable effect on apoptosis in attached gels Fig 7B Upon gel relaxation i e after full detachment apoptosis significantly increased LR in Fig 6c 6c In contrast to monolayer cultures exogenous TGF 1 did not alter apoptosis Fig 6c 6c data not shown This is consistent with other data on gel embedded foreskin fibroblasts which led to the conclusion that prior differentiation into myofibroblasts is not required for apoptosis in granulation tissue 41 Our data on attached gels when SMA positive fibroblasts were present even without exogenous TGF 1 demonstrated that a considerable percentage of myofibroblasts underwent apoptosis Fig 6a 6a 6b 6b and data not shown The decrease in percentage of myofibroblasts in the relaxed gels containing keloid fibroblasts compare Fig 6b 6b with Fig 6c 6c may be due to a gradual turnover of SMA in the cells undergoing apoptosis In the scheme presented in Fig 4this process would correspond to the phenotypic conversion of apoptotic myofibroblasts UR to apoptotic fibroblasts LR by proteolysis of SMA However during granulation tissue remodeling in vivo decreased cellularity may be the result of apoptosis of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts 29 Our findings showed that reduction of tension in the ECM provokes apoptosis and reduces SMA as human dermal myofibroblasts readily undergo apoptosis in response to gel relaxation or wound contraction their absence from the neodermis of a healed wound is likely the result of apoptosis Conclusions There are several issues addressed for the first time in this paper relating apoptosis and myofibroblast formation in human dermal fibroblasts Phenotypic differences exist among fibroblasts from different dermal origin non palmoplantar non PP or palmoplantar PP normal nonplantar plantar palmar from keloid patient biopsies or abnormal from keloid biopsies Our work demonstrated that keloid fibroblasts had higher cellular levels of several members of the TGF 1 pathway TGF 1 RII and ED A fibronectin also thrombospondin 1 36 In addition TGF 1 effects on apoptosis differed in non PP vs PP fibroblasts TGF 1 acted pro apoptotically on non PP fibroblasts and anti apoptotically on PP fibroblasts It had a pro apoptotic effect on myofibroblasts These results suggest that at least in part the difference between keloid and palmar fibroblasts may be due to particular levels of TGF 1 pathway related proteins at nonglabrous vs glabrous sites Effect of tension in the ECM We found that matrix tension was dominant over TGF 1 in determining myofibroblast formation and apoptosis levels Apoptotic cells predominated in relaxed gels independent of TGF 1 availability Keloid fibroblasts once embedded in collagen gels an environment exerting less tension on the fibroblasts were more apoptotic than the corresponding palmar fibroblasts This difference may be attributed to the ability of keloid fibroblasts to contract the collagen gel For the exuberant accumulation of collagen during keloid formation matrix relaxation induced apoptosis must be delayed This suggests that body site specific keloid formation may be dependent on the difference in the development and resolution of tension in the wound bed at nonglabrous vs glabrous sites in keloid prone patients Thus a necessary requirement for keloid formation will be maintenance of tension to prevent delay apoptosis This gives sufficient time for the fibroblasts to express and deposit collagen in the ECM With the accumulation of collagen the tension experienced by the fibroblasts in the keloid will be reduced and apoptosis initiated According to our data reduced tension would lead to lowering of the SMA level in the keloid Although myofibroblasts were not detected in vivo 51 the propensity of keloid fibroblasts to express SMA in vitro and the loss of this protein upon matrix contraction gel relaxation do not allow one to dismiss a role for myofibroblasts in keloids Rather it may be necessary to re evaluate SMA expression in the early stages of keloid development when tension within the wound bed is high Usually the studied keloids are at least several months old and may have had enough time for tension relaxation and loss of SMA Interestingly keloids in some Caucasian patients were found to contain SMA positive fibroblasts 52 Many of the SMA positive cells were spindle shaped which suggests that these cells experienced outside tension Furthermore persisting tension in the wound bed may explain why hypertrophic scars maintain the myofibroblast phenotype long after wound closure Fibroblasts at glabrous sites palms soles do not promote keloid formation consistent with an earlier reduction in cellularity necessary for a normal wound healing It is noteworthy that tension mechanical loading is exerted through the ECM by fibroblasts expressing a synthetic fibroblast phenotype 53 As TGF 1 supports this phenotype keloid formation at glabrous sites may be further limited by the PP fibroblast requirement for higher and or more sustained levels of TGF 1 Clinical applications of pressure dressings that relieve wound bed tension are traditionally used to prevent aberrant scar formation during burn wound healing Comparisons of non pressure vs pressure treated hypertrophic scars have shown that pressure supports the disappearance of SMA expressing myofibroblasts 54 The data presented in this work suggest that body site differences in fibroblasts and wound tension are critical
