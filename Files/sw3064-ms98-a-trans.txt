        do you use credit cards a good bit   i do and i wish i didnt  before i got married  uh about the only credit cards i used were gas cards because i didnt like carrying   uh   you know the cash with me all the time but i just never wanted to get into the hangup of using credit cards and having all those bills hanging over my head   umhum umhum umhum   in fact i remember getting my first MasterCard and the only reason i got it was you know there was a while years ago when you couldnt cash a check without like a MasterCard or Visa and so thats why i went ahead an got one   okay    absolutely right umhum   it was a mistake   yeah well actually i i have a whole wallet full of credit cards i dont use them very often um   yeah   oh i may use i try to use at least one gasoline credit card a week and try to use a different one so that you know i have keep those active   yeah   i have a half a dozen department store credit cards and im ill use those if i need to run in and buy a dozen pair hose right quick or something like that just enough to keep them active my biggies are the Visa MasterCard and Discover   yeah yeah   and for the most part i had used those for like uh charging airline tickets where i can pay for those you know you could make make the transaction over the telephone or i fly Southwest a good little bit which means i can just run that card through the machine   yeah thats right   uh and saves a lot time and thats what i was using it for however we had a had a a very pressing financial family crisis which said you have no alternative you must have the money to do this with and you do not have any other options so i charged all three of those cards up and right now i am paying paying and praying   umhum i know how that goes and thats exactly what weve i mean i have to say i have been thankful for them because there were times when   um but uh umhum umhum   it was just like that when we had to have the money we had no way around it and the only way to do it is go get you know an advance on a card and so like you were paying for it but its one of those im glad it was there   umhum umhum umhum umhum well i never did right i never did use it for an advance most of my charges were uh medications   oh i see   didnt have cash for the medications or it was uh the doctor would accept MasterCard or Visa   oh   and uh a lot of times you can get by using those for uh uh different labs will use those charge accounts for   well do you find now though that even some doctors wont ive gone some doctors that say you know i was so used to doctors or medical care places taking credit cards and so many of them dont anymore   umhum   so   well i have not i like i said that was just one period in my life where that was critical   yeah   i dont generally charge i say well i will need a checkup in six months and i kind of set that aside and just pay for it im reimbursed on insurance anyway and i can handle you know paying for it and waiting two or three weeks   yeah right right   getting into a credit card fiasco is easy   oh it is   it is easy and its very difficult to get out i just cringe every month when i see those interest charges   i know   i say wow i i ought to go to the credit union and borrow the money and pay this off big deal im saving two percent   right but you know the interest even though it bothered me it didnt used to bother me so much because of course you could list it on a schedule A and you got all your interest you know towards your tax deductions and now theyve messed that up to where it really is a financial burden to have to pay it and but it but it is easy to get into a credit card problem and i   umhum umhum right   i think about young people that think you know theres kind of that feeling of hey its so neat i have my first credit card and and they just dont understand that you still have to be able to make the payments you know   umhum oh yeah and its not just paying back what youve charged its paying that and half again uh you send in uh uh fifty dollars youre going to pay twenty twenty five in interest charges   thats right thats right thats right   you only get half of that paid for the principal so im looking at three or four years before my balances are cleared on those charge accounts now as the monthly payment   right   uh i mean as the monthly payment amount goes down that will free up more cash where i can continue to make the larger payments uh as long as i dont have a major disaster where i have to use it again i can i can do that   right right   meantime though im not building any reserves anything that i could be put aside into savings is going for interest on those cards   no and thats frightening to me thats right thats frightening too uh i i just i my husband is in business for himself i work for TI but he doesnt and uh   uhhuh umhum umhum   were uh i ive kind of got my fingers crossed crossed ive learned when youre in business for yourself that that you you dont count on something until its happened you know but hes got some   umhum   you know its those once in a lifetime cases and after ten years hes got two of them   umhum   and they should pay through next month and and were both just looking at each other every night going man thatll pay off like both of our MasterCards you know and you know just in one lump because thats the only way you can do it is to have a big chunk of money or its like you say you pay forever   oh right right   umhum umhum umhum umhum   and so im really looking forward to that   well you either need a big chunk of money or you need a large reserve so that if you do charge on that account you can make a single lump sum payment now those are very handy if you have the reserves and you can make lump sum payments sharp good no problem   thats right right sure yeah i agree thats right   because youre living on the other guys money for a while but i can promise you that those credit card companies are going to ride high on my money  and it just irks me i say my gosh i had to work three hours just to pay the interest on this and ive got three cards ive lost a whole day of my life   i know and i know youre like what am i working for today   to interest yeah yeah and that just blows my mind i my house is paid for my car is paid for ive got some home improvements but even the payment on that doesnt equal the payment on one of those credit cards   its incredible boy i wish i could say that my house and well my car is paid for now it was wrecked three weeks ago but   umhum   but you see again the credit cards came in handy i had to have the money to pay rental car pay this pay that till the insurance company pays back and uh   umhum thats right  i think that is a good healthy safe use of credit cards   yeah because you know thats coming back to pay it off   umhum umhum uh i went to a seminar they said dont ever use your credit card for consumable items you only use credit cards for investments   right   i say for crying out loud if i had the money to invest you know  if i could do some investing youd have to invest at better than twenty percent earnings in order to pay for the payments on the credit card   it sure thats right   that doesnt make a bit of sense to me i thought God dang where is his pencil   thats right well the smart half was dont pay it for consumables dont you know if you cant afford to go to a restaurant and eat out and pay cash dont put it on a credit card you know and and so that that is the smart half   thats right umhum   but uh and i can remember before we had kids we did that a lot but it was no biggie   umhum   you know because we could pay it off while after kids and youre paying child care and other things all of a sudden its not so easy to pay off so we cut that out real quick   umhum umhum   and uh but i i do like having them there there is a bit of security in having the credit cards and knowing that in times of crisis they are there to use   umhum   but you have to have a very good sense of saving and or common sense not not to get yourself in trouble   umhum umhum you also have to have that willingness to commit to that because youre committing a good portion of your life and income when you do it   umhum
