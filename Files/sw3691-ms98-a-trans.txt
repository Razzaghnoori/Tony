guess about five years old   oh my goodness   how about you guys   we have a three dogs and two birds at this point parakeets   three dogs and two birds what kind of birds you have no kidding enjoy enjoy them   oh have a ball with them   you let you let them out and let them fly around everything   well no because my dogs chase them  so if in order to have the birds not stuffed i have to keep them in their cages   oh okay we you know this is like a cruelty joke and i apologize if youre a bird lover but uh we had a parakeet   uhhuh   and my fault put up our first electric fan and never thought about it knocked that parakreet right right out of the air   uhhuh well we had that happen once um my son had the bird back in his room because its his bird well the first one that we had was his bird and i had the ceiling fan put up and it the bird got away from him one afternoon and i mean that sucker hit that fan and went flying up against the wall i thought oh so much for the bird no hes still alive and kicking   it kill it oh thats no it killed ours ill be darned   no i guess we didnt have it high enough or he didnt get hit in just the right spot but it threw him up against the wall you know and he slid down the wall     well speaking of pets ill tell you my my kids are older now my both of them are either in or out of college but but we had for years about five years i guess had a my son had a Burmese boa constrictor and   oh gosh   that thing grew to be seven and a half feet in in length and finally my wifes wife bless her heart got rid of it because i didnt really like it   oh i hate them   and we also had a one year down in Florida on a vacation for Fathers Day my kids years ago maybe uh ten years ago go bought me a skunk from a like exotic pet shop itd be like itd had been like deactivated as far as uh   oh my goodness   smell and everything and we had that darn pet skunk for about five years and and my son left went to school we finally sold his boa constrictor but my son needed some money and we we sold it for about two hundred and fifty dollars so ah   youre kidding   so when the guy came over he was infatuated by that skunk so i made him a deal i said you take that skunk and he said ill sell that snake to you for two fifty i said otherwise im gonna give it to this other man so he took the skunk too and the skunk was a good a decent pet but you know it does its little jobbies in the litter box and     oh well thats pretty good   and it was sort of a neat but they just stink too much   oh yeah oh yeah   that was sort of fun you i  tell everyone this story because my wife is a real pet lover i used to visualize my wife for  many times my wife be lying there on the sofa and this snake honestly would be stretched across the top of her body with with its with its head right on her neck   oh youre kidding oh   and the skunk would be sitting at her feet that the cat would be on the back of the sofa and a dog be running around crazy  oh   oh my gosh i can not imagine i just i dont do my in fact my brother has a uh a exotic pet shop out in California and he keeps threatening to send a snake through the mail you know im going dont do that because they wont come in my house   oh gosh oh my son bought this snake uh  someone gave it to him when he was in junior high school and it was just a small thing then but it got to be pretty big and you know youd feed it you can put and feed him that small mice to big rats and things like that and   uhhuh   its just uh too much that snake used to watch our cat walk around i always told my wife i said you know what your friends gonna get our cat one of these days   oh my gosh yeah thats right oh my gosh that is wild oh i just cant do those and the lizards and the   oh oh me neither   all of those things ugh they they need to stay outside far away from me   were down to a simple dog and cat now and thats the way it should be and havent had any parakeets for quite a while or birds uh customer of mine has a parrot   yeah   and uh gosh sticks in my mind he paid eighteen hundred dollars for a parrot and that was just mind boggling   oh yeah they are so expensive well my son was just dying for a bird and im really allergic to them so i i tried to stay away from them except ive gotten real attached to this one and and uh we went down to Canton one time oh gosh   are you uhhuh   two or three years ago now and hed saved up his allowance you know and picked him out a bird and a bird cage and and that stinking bird when i brought it home tried to take it out of the little box that they give you     yes   clamped onto my finger and would not i mean i had to literally shake him off to get him in the cage and he has tried to bite me for two years and all of a sudden this bird and i have become wonderful friends hell gives me kisses he talks now   oh gosh thats neat   and its just hysterical im the only one that pays attention to him   why sure   and im a substitute teacher and one of my fifth graders last year came up to me and said my moms making me get rid of the bird we have too many pets i thought yeah right come tell me about it you know   come to my menagerie   they knew the sucker when they saw one so now we have two parakeets
