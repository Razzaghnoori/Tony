        okay Eric um       are you married and do you have a family   uh yes i am to uh both questions   okay and do you and your wife have a budget plan for your finances   uh yeah we do we um uh basically theres the you know expenses that are fixed during the month you know the ones that come every every month and   uhhuh   we uh enter those into uh into a spread sheet       and uh whats ever left uh after that we you know we we sit down and agree on kind of what you know what sort of range were gonna   uhhuh   generally gonna shoot for   i see um     so what do you do   well thats basically what we do um about every every three months or so we reevaluate our budget and we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest   umhum   and then we divvy them up between our four pay checks i work part time at night and he works and my husband works full time days and so we have the four pay checks with that works out nice because we get paid every week   wow   and so that does help that helps a lot   yeah   and then um we dont have a lot extra extra for extra spending  so its pretty well  earmarked   yeah all allocated out  yeah   yeah  every every penny is earmarked but um it we have found that that works the best and and so if we can just divide them up all the major bills up in fact we found it easier to divide the major bills up you know cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half and and divide those up between all   all the   umhum and so we are not taking a huge sum out out of one and then the next pay check were real short or   checks yeah right yeah we found that um       its definitely helped uh get a handle on kind of the unnecessary expenses  we were before we started doing that kind of a thing we were um spending uh   thats true   money for things that you know we probably tended to eat out a bit more than the than we should have and it was easy to uh let things get out of hand we thought it uh   uhhuh     thought it to be really helpful weve gotten some of our loans paid off early   yeah   because of this and and stuff like that so   well it helps you to focus where your money goes and and im sure you felt the same the same frustration before you got on a budget but   yeah   youre wondering my when you put down all the money that you do bring in and then youre saying my word where did all that money go where does it go   thats a lot of money but yeah   huh and also we have found that if we write down       and and we did this were not real consistent with this but we did it for about a month and we wrote down everything that we bought with you know every paycheck   umhum   and so we could see where every penny went and it was really interesting to see just what you do spend and and like i say we havent been real consistent with it its       we should because it does help   yeah the other the other thing that that weve found that that helps if you know we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit its just to uh uh get out the money in advance and put it in uh   uhhuh     um so long as it wasnt you know unreasonably high but for things like food expenses or or whatever just put it in a   uhhuh     in an envelope or whatever and that way it kind of forced us to uh stick to that amount     just stick to that uhhuh that is   and then once that was gone well  if the entertainment amount was gone for the month oh its gone   uhhuh yeah that that sounds like a really good idea   so   and it really helpful um have you  developed a savings plan or IRAs or anything like that yet   we we havent we our our initial goal was just to retire our debt uh completely retire our debt for car payments and credit card   oh uhhuh uhhuh   uh credit card debt and and all of that and were just at a point where where we could start thinking about it so   oh thats good thats a good feeling     yeah i   my husband just graduated from the university uh a year ago so finally  finally we are getting to that point too so are you still going to school or   umhum   a study yeah yeah im actually in the in the master
