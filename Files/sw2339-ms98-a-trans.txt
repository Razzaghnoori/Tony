 okay i was thinking about camping and different i people s ideas about it um hum we ve even seen people with these campers and they got the big old antennas up so they can watch their TV when they re going but that s not right or the satellite dish yeah a satellite dish on top of those recreational vehicles oh golly that s not the kind we do do you go camping yeah we have a little bit and we ve just gotten one of those little tents that we throw out on the ground and that s what we camp in so we kind of rough it well so do we in fact when we first got married we would try to take these trips to Minnesota to see his family um hum and we didn t have a tent or any camping supplies so we d sleep on those picnic tables at roadside parks i mean i know it s dangerous i wouldn t do it now but we did oh no and one time we went to Yellowstone and we were doing the same thing we couldn t find a place to camp and so we were on top of a picnic table with our our sleeping bags i guess and this ranger comes up with this light shines it on us and said that we re just bear bait out there we had our food you know oh uh huh and told us to get inside our car gosh bear bait bear bait that would make me nervous yeah have you done any camping around here yeah we ve got some land at Holly Lake outside of Tyler uh huh and go up there fairly often sometimes we get a lot of people together to do it yeah that sounds fun and we ve done things like when when it s kind of cold we take extension cords and we ve all brought heaters in our tents and in the summer same thing we get our extension cords running from all these tents but we ve got the fans going right so we re not roughing it too much and we have taken TVs out there for the kids yeah yeah and they ve got their electrical hookups so it s not so bad yeah do you go on long like a week at a time or just weekends i think the longest we ve stayed out there is like five days and they even they had a library at one time out there uh huh oh so that s really not roughing it so much but yeah we have gone on trips we ve bathed in streams uh huh that s kind of different yeah i like the campgrounds that have a nice shower and a pool to go to that would be nice uh huh yeah we ve uh we camped at the DeGray State Park in Arkansas in the fall and there was nobody else hardly around and it was just really nice that time of year we had taken our electric blanket too just in case it was unbearable but we didn t need it well my husband has even camped at Lake Lavon with one of his friends he just decided to take the kids out there oh really yeah i mean it s not very many miles from our house at all but they had the time of their lives you know oh yeah had the boat just pulled up right by the tents uh huh it wasn t bad that sounds nice yeah and we ve taken our tents though loaded them up in car carrier and decided we were going to tent most of the way and it ended up when it came time for us to pull in for the night we d take a vote and most of the time we decided we wanted to stay in a hotel yeah instead of getting out all that stuff you know yeah it s a lot of work to set up just for one night yeah then you have to get up the next day and move it on right huh uh but we re set now we ve got cook stoves and we ve got our bug light and everybody s got their sleeping bags we got air mattresses we decided that was easier than cots and more comfortable yeah those are nice we have one of those too uh huh yeah those double ones pretty good we re on our third one i think somehow yeah how do you blow yours up we ve got an electric pump that hooks into the cigarette lighter oh we we were looking at those in a magazine last time we went we took our vacuum cleaner with us i didn t know you could do that and yeah you can if you can reverse the nozzle on your vacuum cleaner and it blows air out instead of sucking it in and you can yeah fill them up that way but it something that s smaller would be a lot more convenient no joke i hope you didn t have a big vacuum cleaner no uh huh we have a my husband and i we have a pickup truck so there s plenty of room to hold things yeah now we ve used a hair dryer before uh huh but i put it on hot and also melted it oh no i found that you don t do that yeah i didn t realize it would melt so easily oh i don t know we take we take our dog camping she likes to go out and stay in the woods sleep she sleeps in the tent with us yeah it s fun i don t like it when there s mosquitoes so bad oh me either and then one night we were camping and it came just a torrential downpour we had the steaks on the grill these people were with us and it i mean everything was sopping wet inside the tent it was just that bad you know oh no and we decided we d just go across the road to the office and see if we could rent anything uh huh so i got a condo with a jacuzzi and it was wonderful yeah oh boy that was lucky yeah it was we ve been lucky we ve never really been rained on the few times we ve gone it s horrible oh i bet it when we were younger when i was a kid we camped in Virginia and we had one of those little pop up tents which is really nice because it kind of gets you off the ground but it seemed like it rained every weekend for about a year the year we we were really into camping you mean that you put on a truck or what uh no it s a little trailer you pull behind your car and uh oh yeah yeah you know you the lid pops off the little tent comes up the top and it had two double beds in it how many weeks have you been doing these calls oh since the beginning i guess it s been two or three weeks i think this must be into my third week too so do you work for TI uh well i work as a temporary in the Speech Lab in a speech lab uh huh where they re doing this program the voice recognition program and what exactly are they going to do oh they turn them over to somebody and they re going to i guess they re going to try to teach computers how to recognize voices and search for specific words and stuff so any voice no matter what the speech pattern or the dialect or anything right yeah hum i wonder if these are going to be speaking the computers i don t know i type up the tapes of what people talked about oh that s kind of neat yeah it s sort of interesting do you put all the uh hums in here on everything too uh huh everything like that all the little stutters and everything what do you write for stutter duh duh oh like if they say i i we just type it in like that uh huh well i guess that s it for camping huh i guess so unless you want to talk about stakes what size stakes to put in you need metal instead of plastic yeah and you make sure that you keep up with them for the next time we got one of those kind that have got the yeah oh what is it they re plastic and they ve got the elastic on the inside of the poles and you just put them together and it s a dome tent oh uh huh that s what we have too yeah that s what ours is that s good isn t it yeah yeah they pop up pretty fast yeah but have you ever camped on sand um no that can be a mess we camped at the beach one time and that was sort of miserable you just couldn t everywhere you went there was sand you couldn t even when you re eating it it was in your bed i ve done it in a shelter uh huh it was in Padre Island and in a truck of course not but not in a tent oh uh huh oh well that s about all i know to okay uh huh bye okay well it s good talking to you bye
