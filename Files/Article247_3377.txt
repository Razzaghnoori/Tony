 Off the Marx Dear Jim Daniel Bell spends such an extended amount of time writing about Marx that it s hard to discuss this book without making reference to Marxism Perhaps in some trendy way much as Nike revived Che Guevara with a swoosh instead of a star on his beret Marx will be back in vogue sometime in the 00s Hip hop information workers will discourse on Karl during MTV s Road Rules We ll have a Marxist analysis of banner ad click throughs and tomes on the five year plan for the collectivization of Windows 2001 I find it difficult to discuss Marx today because it s so hard to make sense of him in the context of our time Let s take a look at some of the more super capitalist structures the use of stock options to incentivize workers As workers like err Microsoft employees for instance get vested with options convertible to stock or get to buy stock at a discounted rate typically 15 percent of that day s market price it s hard to say where the capitalist class ends and the proletariat begins The tension between the haves and the have nots is supposed to destabilize the system leading to in Marx s view a revolution of the proletariat Bell examines this question but phrases it in terms of envy writing Democracy is by nature contentious because men constantly covet what other men have the result is often in Nietzsche s term ressentiment or envy anger and hatred towards those at the top What then to make of Newsweek s recent cover story with a tag line paraphrasing Everyone is getting rich except for me accompanying a Roy Lichtenstein esque caricature of a 1950s businessman with furrowed brow The cover a reference to the omnipresent Internet Nasdaq slow mo capitalist money shot that s lasted four years doesn t hint at any sort of destabilizing class conflict but rather phrases it in terms of envy alone There s always someone else with a better package By turning the stock market into America s national lottery everyone gets a chance to become a successful capitalist Our gonzo day traders high on Starbucks double lattes and monitor afterburn are today s working class With 90 percent of them estimated to lose money extending their margin calls on their Visa bills they re modern day sharecroppers of a sort indebted to the dot com company store known as an online brokerage In this kind of environment Bell s analysis seems off in the wrong side of the woods As you point out Jim Bell is really a reformed old school lefty As far as I can tell the main element of his vision that s come to pass is his rather abstract statement that Now reality is primarily the social world He also wrote The post industrial society is essentially a game between persons There s a Ted Kaczynski quality to his writing earnest structurally obsessive and plodding I take this to mean that our media matrix TV radio Net and magazines have come to form our reality And this media world obsessed with celebrity famous persons and the game between them does form the shared experience as a society This aspect of Bell s thinking isn t developed much in his book Another aspect of our future that he mentions but fails to really investigate is his criticism of groups blacks hippies women etc and his sense that a cultural fissure is appearing between young and old Where he sees these elements as destabilizing and misguided we ve come to understand them as modern day tribalism what marketers like to call affinity groups But from Bell s perspective affirmative action demands for quotas and automatic inclusion of minority groups in democratic decisions through mandates are his red flags He imagines a future where the call of every minority for inclusion by quota destroys the meritocratic principle of his favored scientist citizenry The problem with revisiting this book is that so many of Bell s bugaboos from 1973 don t exist anymore Twelve years of Reagan Bush plus eight of Clinton took care of that along with the longest peacetime economic expansion in American history So Jim what s the takeaway from Bell that you re left with Any gems in this coal mine
