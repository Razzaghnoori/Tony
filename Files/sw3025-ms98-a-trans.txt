          yep   okay i i do a fair amount of cooking   uhhuh   and i love having guests to dinner i probably do that at about once a month and uh i usually prepare something depending upon the guests you know if if i like to prepare chicken that seems to please please everybody pasta or a casserole how about you   umhum yeah those are things i like the most i like fish and chicken the most   um   and um  most i cooking i do just comes out of a can   uh   unless unless it is unless it is i catch a fish and i prepare it and then i just uh you know i just broil it and put lemon on it   umhum well thats about the way i prepare most fish   umhum   uh i made scallops the other night that was unusual and uh basically uh i found a recipe to to make it in the microwave and you sprinkled the you you swished around a little melted butter and do uh oh i do not know microwave microwaved them for about nine minutes no no four four and a half five minutes and you had to add sesame seeds and bread crumbs on top very simple but very nice so if you are looking for a fish recipe that was good   sesame seeds and bread crumbs   sesame seeds and bread crumbs   uhhuh   and uh my husband liked it   yeah   and uh no unfortunately scallops are one of the more expensive uh fish items   right uhhuh   but you know i i look for them to go on sale at the grocery store uh one of the things i love to do eat out how about you   oh yeah uhhum   do you have any particular places you like going   oh theres a restaurant called String Bean on Spring Valley and Central   uhhuh   i like that its just its just home cooking   yes ive been there   umhum   and uh i kind of kind of like the black eyed pea but i dont think its a chain   right exactly uhhuh and thats thats the other restaurant also think they got black eyed pea   oh   so i dont really like uh  you know uh chili places or what is it Judge Roy Beans or   oh   i dont like greasy places   yeah yeah i i i dont feel like they are very healthy and i always feel like the home cooking places are are the healthiest meals even though i tend to have chicken fried steak when i go go to them   yeah right and i and i got uh chicken marinara the last two times you know   oh how was it   it was i was great because thats thats what i like i dont like it you know its like a baked   um   you know a piece of chicken and then i get like green beans and mashed potatoes   umhum   you know     yeah i i tend to uh i get teased by my family a lot because uh i like experimenting on on food and sometimes i go for exotic fairly exotic things and and my father teases me about gourmet cooking   umhum   which is not always true but  and the thing about experimenting with cooking or anything else is that some of the experiments fail   no thats true   uh the last time we had some uh friends over for dinner i tried the dessert that sounded wonderful wonderful in the recipe and it was just total bust   yeah   i was sorry i didnt have ice cream to fall back on   yeah my uh my brother tried to make a bunch of things uh way back he tried to make bagels one time   oh my thats ambitious   yeah and uh  we took some and and we had uh German shepherds at the time and we took some and gave it to the dogs and the dog never you know he treated it like a milk bone and he never did finish it he barely made a dent in it   hum yeah   and and uh then he tried to make grapefruit citron one time   uhhuh   its uh supposed to be a candy   yeah   and uh it it didnt turn out very well it was you know it it like made concentrated all the acid of the grapefruit into uh into a kind of a candy stick so   huh see i am not thats interesting one of the things i dont make is dessert   umhum   and uh my husband accuses me of putting him through dessert deprivation because you know we have ice cream  or something like that and thats why when i took did this experiment for this company we had about three weeks ago it was just a total fiasco   umhum huh   um everything else was fine but that was a fiasco   well you have to put eggs and everything dont you or   uh yeah   yeah just about   yeah and i i also dont have much of a sweet tooth so i can live without live without desserts for the most part   uhhuh use about half the sugar or make everything diet   yeah uh do you cook for yourself or do you cook for others   mostly i just cook for myself   yeah well when i was single i used to uh i think my favorite meal was a a baked potato   umhum its easy thats for sure   and oh yeah   yeah   oh yeah and i mean i never put anything other than a little butter on it if i had or or if i had a little cheddar cheese sometimes i would grate that up   hum yeah i always put cheese on them   and uh amazingly satisfying   umhum yeah but you know theres hardly any i guess theres hardly any protein its mostly starch fills you up and then the cheese has to make up for whatever the protein you get   yeah i didnt i didnt say it was nourishing but it was satisfying   oh yeah it really is then you have to make a salad or   and yeah yeah that but you know um i i never really enjoyed cooking for myself so i ate very simply and i was   umhum   thats why i think thats one reason i like having people over because i could try things i mean i must be a frustrated chemist or something like that cause cooking is a little bit like like being in a chemistry lab   right umhum   and uh   except you get to taste the product instead of   instead of having an explosion     foam up or blow up or       sometimes it blows up anyway   oh yeah  you know   i i once had a an old boy friend over to to dinner when i was just briefly staying with my parents and uh i had this wonderful recipe and and you were supposed to make a a toffee like substance for a pie by uh boiling evaporated milk three hours and it does turn to toffee inside the can   oh yeah   and uh the only problem was when i opened the can it just flew all over the place it was on the ceiling on the walls and me and and the boyfriend saw that he was supposed to be there at six oclock not seven oclock so just at the time all this happened the door bell rang and there he was       and i had to have my my my my dad sort of entertain him for a for  for awhile while my mother and i scrambled to clean everything up   right uhhuh did you let the can cool off   uh i really dont remember that was about ten years ago i just remember how embarrassing it was and i have made i have made it since ive i i and several times before and i never had that problem just that one time   yeah huh yeah   and uh he he was a gourmet cook he was kind of person who acted like he came from San Francisco and he had a very sophisticated taste i i really wanted to impress the heck out of him and and  well it was a memorable evening anyway   right   uh but i i do enjoy cooking so i was awfully glad i was given this
