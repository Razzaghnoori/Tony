        hello okay so you were with TI huh     yeah ive been with i was with uh TI for uh thirty four years so obviously i found something worth worth doing there and have prejudices about uh what i want     well any stay any place that long they got to be doing something right right   yeah uh where do you work   i uh work for myself i sell uh metal fabricating equipment and tooling and uh uh oh CAD CAM systems and things like that and uh consequently i cant really discuss big time benefits at the moment although i had worked for Univac and Pitney Bowes and some big companies once upon a time and uh i think most people dont necessarily realize the cost of them and theyre somewhat probably getting out of hand   oh yeah they uh im not sure what the categorys supposed to be uh but it was what something about what benefits would you consider something like that when you uh go to work for a large company   well   uh   i think uh oh the way i got   other other than salary didnt it say yeah   right well no it didnt necessarily say other than salary but what would you consider to be kind of important i guess   well im i thought it said other than salary but yeah   such as well i i imagine thats what theyre referring to you know like uh your health insurance and pensions and all that kind of good stuff uh   yeah yeah well i uh personally i left my previous job which was with ChanceVought before i joined uh there and ironically i left ChanceVought the largest employer in Dallas County at that time with some thirty thousand people as i recall and uh joined a little firm of Texas Instruments because i wanted to go with a small company   and they grew up around you didnt it   and uh that was twenty five hundred people when i joined and uh   uhhuh   then it became Dallas Countys largest employer oh   yeah   but uh one reason i left where i was it definitely had to do with what i wanted uh  besides what i was getting and it had to do with uh wanting to do research and in other words i wanted to enjoy the job and have the freedom to do the job   well i think thats one of the keys that most people uh probably put above benefits thats why i work for myself basically too i want to do what i wanna do   yeah well i participated on many uh surveys and that sort of thing i was a TI fellow so i was down on you know on the technical ladder side rather than the uh   umhum   heavy management although i was a branch manager at one time and  its amazing that managers in general just would not believe the survey results because to them uh money is the motivation and uh benefits you know stock options uh perks that sort of thing   right right   and power and they they just couldnt understand why with the technical surveys that were done by the uh Institute of Electrical Engineers and uh others uh including IBMs that in the technical community salary was never first  it was usually about third and  yeah   well i think as long as its comparable with you know the job or can   right   that uh you arent being  picked on in the sense of being the whipping boy dollar wise in the corporation you you know you know you got to i   right number one and number two usually were uh number one was usually uh enjoyable work or work that i enjoy something of that sort uh and number two was freedom to do that work normally and uh third or even fourth sometimes  was the salary   yes yes   and that was in virtually every technical uh ladder survey that was taken over the   well   oh fifteen or so years that i participated but invariably the managers would challenge this you know because because they just couldnt believe that that people werent motivated by money     right well i i wouldnt say they arent motivated by money but i would say that there are other things that are equal or greater important i i guess if you make enough money uh if the money were really big bucks i guess some of these other things you could uh   yeah well im sure you know if you were being paid a slave labor scale obviously money would be high up on the list but   live with for a while anyway until you had enough to do what you wanted to do but yes   in a competitive uh market as it was most of the time when i was in where you could get you could get a job elsewhere anytime any day of the week you wanted to go until about the last two years and uh   right   in that case you felt more secure uh money wise so that you could seek uh enjoyable work or creative work that sort of thing   right
