                ill start   okay   um my feeling is that you become a politician perhaps because um you think youre doing something noble perhaps because youre on a power trip but   umhum   what it all comes down to is you are doing this because you think that your approach is better than what another persons approach is and youre looking to impose their will upon them your will upon them   umhum   and um so theres a fundamental problem   umhum   okay is that you you get into this to impose your will upon others   umhum   if you um could do it you know if you didnt need to impose your will then you could just do it by suggesting or writing articles in newspaper or what have you   right right but it it does seem like a problem that the only people who become president are people who want to be president and i dont really know if i want anybody who really wants to be president   well i think that the uh what do you call it uh you know those those guys who took pen to parchment a couple hundred years ago   umhum   had some good ideas and um one of the things that i think has gotten out of hand   umhum   is what the government does what kind of things they get involved it   thats possible   um there was a time when the government wouldnt wouldnt think of telling you what you could eat or smoke um there was a time when the government wouldnt think of um imposing heavy taxes on transportations on on your means of transportation to uh build uh roads where they wanted them   um   and i think those those are the first of things that come to mind i think that um if what the government sets out to do is fairly limited   umhum   then the people who decide they want to be politicians cant get into a whole lot of trouble   thats true   um its only when you try to run every aspect of life from cradle to grave that when a politician runs amok they can do serious damage   thats an interesting point so youre youre taking sort of a libertarian view here   oh absolutely um you know i think that uh weve gotten ourself into a lot of trouble um i think that well i think that getting ourselves out of it is going to be painful   umhum   um i hope it happens peacefully   umhum   because it will happen   now what sort of uh what sort of which part which sort of trouble are you speaking of   well were in a situation right now where um uh the comment  even in a situation right now where um large portions of your life are controlled by forces that arent particularly interested in your welfare and um   what sort of control   the quality of life is deteriorating uh   what control what sort of controls are you thinking of   well take well taking half your income is uh a pretty good one uh not being permitted to defend yourself is another one um   or what sort of areas you know life   um   i dont know what the laws are like in New York in in California but in New York um if you wake up one night and go down stairs and see a fellow about to climb out the window with your TV set you cannot use deadly force against them   well then the question is so hes climbing out the window   with your TV set yeah   with your TV set and you feel that a fitting punishment for television theft is death   um um well theres an interesting issue there uh lets suppose someone breaks the window of your car and steals your radio   umhum   all right um we look at this and we say okay fine its three hundred dollars damage just picking a number off the top of my head   umhum   lets suppose you make thirty five bucks an hour uh thirty bucks an hour to make the math easy   umhum   theoretically ten working hours of your life have just vanished   oh sure   and and and dont quote on the uh example of insurance because that  means those ten working hours of someone elses life got vanished   right and youre pay for it eventually   yeah one way or another um so when material objects are destroyed you know its its its its you you you its its a um how can i better say it you know when a material object is destroyed it is a portion of ones life thats consumed if you look at it that way   umhum   you know its not as cut and dry and radical as uh you know as um when someone is killed in cold blood but uh there is a very very subtle effect there and i think one of the problems we have with law today is that   umhum   when somebody runs out and passes a law be it increase in taxes be it what have you generally speaking   umhum   um youre not creating anything youre just moving stuff from one place to another okay youre moving some kind of uh you know if if you um very strongly reinforce the particular enforce enforce enforce a particular um civil right um one of the example that comes to mind is Miranda   okay   okay um which i think is a good thing um but
