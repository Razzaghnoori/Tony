 God s Grandeur The world is charged with the grandeur of God It will flame out like shining from shook foil It gathers to a greatness like the ooze of oil Crushed Why do men then now not reck his rod Generations have trod have trod have trod And all is seared with trade bleared smeared with toil And wears man s smudge and shares man s smell the soil Is bare now nor can foot feel being shod And for all this nature is never spent There lives the dearest freshness deep down things And though the last lights off the black West went Oh morning at the brown brink eastward springs Because the Holy Ghost over the bent World broods with warm breast and with ah bright wings Gerard Manley Hopkins the Catholic convert and priest who wrote near the beginning of the 20 th century had the gift of seeing spiritual life as dynamic even agonized rather than complacently sweet As part of that gift he went beyond conventional forms and images of expression In this poem he sees divine grandeur not simply in a trite vision of nature but in nature as human nature affects it too industrial images such as shaking metal foil or crushed oil embody the grandeur And in the poem s final image of the Holy Ghost at the brown brink eastward appears as the sun rises in a spectacular dawn including the brown sky of coal fueled industrial terrain a vision of godhead as sunrise in smog Our smudge and blear and soil he proposes do not efface the glory Robert Pinsky
