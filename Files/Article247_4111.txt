 Smile You re on Fox Tucker I had an interesting focus group moment before and during the debate that told me all I needed to know about it or so I thought I couldn t watch it in real time because I was co hosting a party of 100 or so welcoming the new New York Times bureau chief in Houston to Texas and not a single person here in Austin where George W Bush lives and governs seemed even to know or care that he and the five other Republicans were having at it while we made polite conversation and munched mushroom rugalach Not a single person in the media and trust me this was an Ink Stained Wretchathon seemed even remotely interested to see how Bush was sparring with yet another New England TV reporter Not a single highly paid political spinner or slick lobster as we privately refer to lobbyists seemed even a little bit curious to learn about Bush s positions on abortion Social Security or welfare recipientarians The reason is that the damn thing didn t matter and wouldn t unless Bush or maybe McCain began speaking in tongues or Alan Keyes stopped They aren t debates no matter how many times the candidates stiffly turn to address each other There s nothing being debated here They don t really answer the questioner s questions and they don t bother to rebuff each other s lame parries They regurgitate their pre packaged sound bites which are the astronaut food of political discourse add water and serve stand up straight smile wide and get the hell off stage That said when I flipped on the Fox News Channel rerun at 11 my time there was plenty to see You re right about Bush he didn t look right At one point I thought I saw him rocking back and forth on the balls of his feet I couldn t tell if he was nervous or excited but he wasn t comfortable he wasn t in his element Bush is all about one on one He s an absolutely fabulous retail politician Put him in a social setting where he gets to grab shoulders and kiss cheeks and twinkle and he could be the next pope But in front of a big audience he s off his game I haven t seen every one of his speeches this campaign obviously but the ones I ve seen have been really mediocre not in the writing but the delivery In this way he isn t Reagan and he isn t his dad and he isn t Clinton They could all get up do the TelePrompTer fandango and say God bless in one fluid motion in Bush the elder s case too fluid But W s not cut out for dramatic pauses laugh lines etc He rushes slurs put the right emphasis on the wrong words and twists his face up into a half smirk that distracts you from the message I bet he s distracted too He d rather be anywhere else There was a lot of this in Bush s performance last night Did you notice him weirdly laughing when other candidates particularly Forbes were speaking I realize it was hard not to laugh but like I said it didn t look right I keep having to remind myself that Bush has a mixed history of debating He did OK against Ann Richards a tough character in 94 but a much weaker opponent in 98 Garry Mauro cleaned the floor with him in their one debate in El Paso Fortunately for Bush it was a Friday night during high school football season so about eight people saw it Judging by my focus group last night it s possible that not many folks saw this one either But Bush shouldn t worry Stylistic quibbles aside he was the night s big winner How could he not be given who he s running against The X Files analogy is right on Steve Forbes has to stop smiling or else Fox Mulder is going to put one of those sharp stainless steel thingies in the back of his neck The guy is sooooooo strange As far as I m concerned he lost any shred of a chance he had when he refused to allow Bush to consider a change in the Social Security age By doing so he gave Bush his best shot of the night Prepped for an assault Bush whipped out an editorial Forbes had written in his father s magazine in 1977 suggesting that the nation consider such a change Of course the joke s on Bush I d bet the ranch that Forbes didn t write that himself Somewhere in New Canaan a former editorial assistant is getting his hand wickedly slapped in retrospect McCain smiled a lot too Was this a deliberate attempt to mute the criticism of his temper or was he going after the Forbes alien vote Like other journalists I find myself oddly compelled to want to like McCain whose honesty and openness is appealing but he creeped me out last night Every one of his answers went in one of my ears and out the other because they were delivered from behind an enormous unnatural smile John lose the happy pills or change pharmacists Alan Keyes Alan Keyes Do I really want to waste my breath No But let me say just one thing It ain t racism that s causing the media to ignore his campaign it s no chance in hellism Gary Bauer to my surprise was the least nutty of the nuts His head didn t do a 360 on his neck no need to call a young priest or an old priest But his positions on the sanctity of life on down are simply too extreme for the Republicans in 2000 and therefore way too extreme for the country which is momentarily moderate Otherwise Tom DeLay would be running Instead we get Borrin Hatch Tucker it s going to be long year Regards Evan
