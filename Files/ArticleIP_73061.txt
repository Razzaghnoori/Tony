 Horace Epistle i 15 Vala what s the winter like at Velia Tell me about the climate at Salerno What are the people like Are there good roads Musa my doctor has seen to it that Baiae s Absolutely out of the question for me And furthermore he s seen to it that I m Extremely unpopular there now that he makes me Pour ice water over myself in the middle of winter Naturally Baiae grumbles because its groves Of myrtle are now no longer what one resorts to And its sulfur hot baths scorned so celebrated Once upon a time for being good for Everything that ails one and they re miffed By invalids who go away to put Their heads and shoulders under Clusium s waters Or else to plunge in Gabii s frigid baths So I have to change my route and drive right past The old familiar places Where are you going This isn t the way to Baiae or to Cumas That s what the rider s going to say to his horse Angrily trying to make him go the old way But the horse has the bit in his mouth and won t be turned Tell me what town down there is the best for food Do they have fresh water there flowing from springs The whole year round or do they have to use Rainwater collected in tanks and saved for the purpose No point in even asking about the wine At home I m used to putting up with whatever But when I go away I want to have Something a whole lot nicer smooth and mellow Infusing hopefulness into the heart and veins Good for banishing care and promoting a flow Of eloquence to make some lady think That I m still young when it s perfectly clear I m not Which town down there is better for serving rabbit Which for wild boar which one is better for fish So I ll come back home as fat as a Phaeacian Write me a letter you re my authority Maenius with great spirit squandered all The inheritance he had from his father and mother And so became an extra man and sponger A parasite with no fixed place of his own Who when he needed a dinner would gladly dine out On vicious scandal he spread with impartial justice About both friend and foe And when he wasn t Able to wangle an invitation he lived On dishes of cheap gray lamb inveighing against Gluttons and prodigals saying they ought to be branded But when he ate well he ate it all up and said My heavens this ragout of quail is simply delicious I m just like that When there isn t a lot to be had I m very good at praising moderation But when there s something better and richer offered Why then I m very good at praising how You rich men live and dine in your splendid houses
