 Welcome to Boondogglia Why hasn t the steel bending number crunching competence of the nerds at Boeing and Microsoft rubbed off on those who build this state s bridges ferries and nuclear reactors Why is this whiz kid s paradise also the world capital of boondoggles the heartland of the misconceived misdesigned and misbuilt A tradition was born on Nov 7 1940 when Galloping Gertie the 4 month old Tacoma Narrows Bridge writhed snapped and collapsed Gertie would be hanging still a marvel of suspension design but for one rather obvious fault Her stiffening girders solid plates rather than the usual open trusses caught the full blast in a high wind corridor Caught on film the catastrophe has delighted generations of science students as a demonstration of oscillating wave motion The day after Gertie opened so did the world s longest floating bridge which connected Seattle to its Eastside suburbs across Lake Washington It took 50 years but we finally sank this sturdy floater During a summer spruce up its pontoon hatches were opened to catch the dirty runoff from hydraulic hoses that were being used to clean it The hatches were inadvertently left open till November when rainwater topped the pontoons and scuttled the whole show These weren t the only Washington bridges to which disaster paid a visit In 1979 the Hood Canal Bridge to the Olympic Peninsula which had supplanted the Lake Washington span as the longest floater sank in high seas At least its pontoons were sealed The year before the freighter SS Chavez wrecked the West Seattle drawbridge forcing authorities to build the new high bridge that West Seattleites had long sought It was whispered that locals had arranged for the Chavez s 80 year old pilot Rolf Neslund to ram the bridge Neslund took whatever secrets he had to the burn barrel two years later when his wife shot him and torched his remains When bridges fall ferries still float And if any state ought to know how to build them it s Washington which operates the country s largest ferry system Even so in the early 80s it built six god awful super ferries that required more than 5 million in corrective repairs Their electronic propulsion systems tended to conk out especially when braking causing them to smash one dock after another On dry land government projects haven t fared much better In 1987 the University of Washington added a 100 foot tall deck to the north side of its football stadium It was designed by the acclaimed engineers behind many of Seattle s commercial skyscrapers all of which remain standing thank you But this was a state project When a roof support buckled the whole frame tumbled to the 50 yard line Afterward the recriminations flew Was a bad weld to blame or defective steel from Korea Four years later Hammering Man the 48 foot 13 ton sculpture that today stands outside the Seattle Art Museum slipped its chains at installation and hit the pavement Could have happened anywhere At least 20 other Hammering Men have been raised around the world two taller than Seattle s None has tumbled While Microsoft programmers made the company billions state agencies wasted millions on a failed computerization scheme While local boy Craig McCaw built his cellular empire Seattle s transit agency procured a 5 million bus radio system that never worked Inspired as these follies are they pale before the state s most expensive boondoggle and history s biggest bond default the 26 billion WPPSS Washington Public Power Supply System cash toss Consider France has built 60 cookie cutter nuclear power plants that work WPPSS used three different designs to build five plants one of which worked Why does this high tech haven produce such jumbo turkeys My guess is that Washington is the mirror image of the old Soviet Union where only the military and space industries functioned The Russians built the sturdy Sputnik MiGs and AK 47s but they couldn t make bras or toasters In Washington the private sector makes fine stuff and the public sector sinks bridges Perhaps competence is a finite quantity apportioned between the two sectors When one gets too much watch out for the other WPPSS is the price we pay for Boeing and the Silicon Forest Not that the government can t build anything right out here Amid political and legal turmoil it raised the Kingdome Seattle s biggest building and the world s widest concrete roofspan for a third to half the cost of other 1970s sports domes about 160 million in today s money Granted this home to Mariners baseball Seahawks football and everybody s favorite tractor pulls is plug ugly inside and out But its hyperbolic paraboloid roof system is a renowned engineering triumph It has weathered moderate earthquakes with nary a crack or untoward ripple and looks as fit for the eventual big one as it did 20 years ago So how has the county government that owns the Kingdome dealt with this unseemly achievement By trying its best to undo it First it cheaped out on maintenance letting birds peck away the roof s foam covering Then it accepted an implausibly low bid to re cover that roof from an inexperienced contractor who blasted the old foam off with water jets The resulting leaks dislodged four ceiling tiles which in turn prompted a pull out the stops rush to scour and re cover the roof and ceiling before football season A 5 million job grew to 67 million After readying the dome s roof for the ages the county and state decided to raze it and replace it with a 327 million roofless football stadium and a 414 million baseball stadium with a retractable roof I m sure both projects will come in on budget and that the retractable roof will work flawlessly Among the arguments advanced in support of knocking down the Kingdome was one that especially resonated with any child of Boondogglia It had to be replaced because its roof was falling down Ah the things we ll do to snatch disaster from the jaws of competence Now can we get some of that Korean steel for the new stadiums
