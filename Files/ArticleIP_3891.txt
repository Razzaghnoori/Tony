of the word punditocracy in favor of commentariat coined by Meg Greenfield He says punditocracy is clumsy while commentariat is much wittier He is in good company but it is a hopeless battle and he should relent William Safire complained in the Sept 11 1994 New York Times Magazine that the word was too intellectual But Safire knew better than to fight the tides of history and included the word in his political dictionary lest that weighty tome prove useless to future generations I am informed that the next edition of the Oxford English Dictionary will also include it I am sorry to have to inform Michael of this but New York and Oxford are where etymological decisions get made In Redmond you people are charged only with the momentous decision of choosing whether to name new software programs Three Point Three or Four Point Oh So while I admire Kinsley s lonely battle on behalf of his witty friend and former editor s sorry ass word I think he should stick to moral causes still worth fighting For instance I hear Bill Gates is being unfairly harassed by the can t stand to see anybody be successful Justice Department Eric Alterman The Age of Innocence While I actually agree with Michael Kinsley s main points in the Nov 27 Readme one aside disturbed me Kinsley wrote Often in the past the press has brushed aside the question of what exactly is wrong with the explanation that the situation creates the perception of impropriety Uhm wasn t it none other than Michael Kinsley in his years at the New Republic who originated this line of reasoning when castigating the top Reagan and later Bush administration officials who had a nasty tendency to do sleazy things but avoid technical illegality and thus proclaim themselves innocent While that line of reasoning can be taken too far and has in the most recent case with the Arlington plots I do believe Michael Kinsley circa 1987 was right to say that high officials should observe standards of propriety which surpass the merely legal I don t know why Michael Kinsley circa 1997 seems to disagree Matthew Singer Budapest Hungary Michael Kinsley replies I m clean I maintained throughout the Reagan years that appearances was a dodge for accusers and malefactors alike I doubt you could find a single example of my ever having used it myself Talk of the Talk of the Town I have enjoyed participating as a voter in Slate s Hackathlon but the criteria are ambiguous The nature of the events suggests that we are to vote on who best imitates a New York Times editorial or a Talk of the Town piece Malcolm Gladwell s exegesis however suggests that we are to vote for the most impressive display of empty virtuosity Actually I think his definition of a hack is incorrect a hack is one who s paid by the word or line not one to whom the rules of journalism don t apply So do we vote for virtuosity in imitation or virtuosity in itself If the former then all the contestants have missed the boat on the second event There is a formula for New Yorker Talk of the Town pieces First the focus of the event as defined by the headline of the press release would never be the focus of the article It is therefore unlikely that Donna Karan or any other celebrity would have been quoted It is much more likely that the correspondent would have talked to the caterer or a disgruntled unknown sitting in the corner Also no New Yorker correspondent would include details of clothing unless it were to make some larger allegorical point about the subject Confusion and uncertainty have never kept me from voting before however Tracy Warren Washington Camus Snafu In Suicide Watch Atul Gawande makes a very poor effort He may claim to know something about science and policy but he is bumbling out of his depth when it comes to matters of philosophy I agree with Gawande that Capt Button s alleged suicide was a strange event indeed However after ruling out addiction or mental illness by what logic does Gawande assume that Button and all others who commit suicide are not thinking rationally Wasn t it Camus who wrote that the only reasonable decision a man can make is whether or not to commit suicide This letter does not permit me the space to develop a definition of rationality to examine its compatibility with the decision to end one s life or to explain why it s so important that we must always be strictly rational in the first place However I would expect exactly that from Gawande before accepting his somewhat outlandish claim In fact the way Gawande explains Capt Button s situation his decision seems quite reasonable Assuming you have no a priori moral or religious objection to suicide and do not greatly fear death death seems like a rational if not recommended alternative when faced with likely court martial professional ruin a possible jail term and a very public dishonor brought upon oneself and one s family Perhaps Gawande s own prejudices are showing when he simply assumes that the elderly or terminally ill in wishing to escape from constant pain or degeneration through suicide are if not actually addicted or mentally ill then obviously irrational Perhaps the need for rationality does not enter into the assisted suicide debate simply because it is taken for granted by all parties In the two other countries that have flirted with voluntary euthanasia Australia and the Netherlands at least two psychiatrists must first agree that the candidate s why does Gawande assume they are all patients decision is not made under the influence of addiction mental illness or Gawande s dreaded scourge of irrationality Chet Pager Melbourne Australia Atul Gawande replies Though I didn t say all who commit suicide are irrational I did argue nearly all are By what logic Well for starters I noted that studies show that over 90 percent of suicides suffer from mental illness or substance abuse In addition I pointed out that psychiatrists find that an additional group kill themselves on impulse I wasn t trying to use the word rational in any fancy sense When I say most people who die by their own hand are irrational I mean that their thinking is usually clouded Generally mental disease or drugs impair their thinking If not victims are often simply caught up in circumstances and exaggerated fears as it appears Button was I ve seen such victims myself One girl I saw rashly swallowed a bottle of pills after a fight with her boyfriend Later she thanked the team for saving her from what she called a stupid thing to do Is it possible to kill yourself while thinking clearly Yes but it is far rarer than Pager would like to believe In Button s case it s particularly doubtful given his tendencies toward dumb impulsive action revealed in his records Playing the Percentages Regarding the Dialogue involving Stephan and Abigail Thernstrom and Randall Kennedy Though I admire the Thernstroms new book America in Black and White I was more than slightly disturbed by the facile understatement from the Thernstroms when they pointed out in reference to residential choices among whites Only 18 percent said they would move if blacks came to live in great numbers Much other reliable polling summarized in our book paints an equally reassuring picture We should all be aware of our diction Only 18 percent is huge Nearly 1 in 5 whites would relocate if blacks became their neighbors Purely on racial grounds not class And other sources paint an equally reassuring picture Is this fact a reassuring one Any number greater than zero is too big Chris H Kwak Cambridge Mass Roof Goof Seth Stevenson s Signs and Wonders incorrectly traces the lineage of Raising the Roof I think you will find that it is Broadway that gave birth to this sports gesture In the musical The Pajama Game the big dance number Once a Year Day has the lyrics Everyone s entitled to be wild be a child be a goof raise the roof at which point the entire chorus raises a two armed palms skyward pump I am sure that this is not the first time that the theatrics of Broadway have crossed over to the sports field Richard Stewart Ecclesmachan Scotland Deriving High Fiving Contrary to Seth Stevenson s Signs and Wonders credit for the first High Five should go to Mel Brooks director of the 1968 classic The Producers Actually Brooks did not execute the maneuver but directed Dick Shawn as a flowery actor in the title role of the fictitious Broadway play Springtime for Hitler to complete the first High Five with another actor who was giving a Nazi salute to which Shawn responded Heil Baby and slapped the man s outstretched right hand in the exact same manner that thousands yea millions have done since L C Renbaum Bethesda Md Terminatour II Judgment Day It is as incorrect for you as an American publication to refer to the Labor Party in This Is Not Quite Your Life by Jodie T Allen as it would be for an English publication to refer to Pearl Harbour Both are proper nouns and should be spelled accordingly In other words you could legitimately state that The Labour Party represents the interests of organized labor in the U K To modify the names of people and organizations to fit a localized spelling style is to show disrespect to the owners of those names and condescension to your readers Peter Kendell Wokingham England I Don t Like Writing Headlines I Like Having
