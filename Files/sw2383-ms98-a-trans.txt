 well in the norman in in the normal route of way we do things how about the ladies go first alrighty um well i uh have have a four year old who will just be entering public school next year so i m really just starting to get involved in uh in what s out there and how they do things um as as far as the system as a whole i really don t see a a problem with it i do see a problem with graduating people that that can t read and are not you know productive in society or productive to themselves and uh i think that s the main problem at this point how about yourself all right i m uh live in Plano Texas and uh um uh huh uh today we re not even suppose to be in school because the uh the way the taxation and all that crap is there really legally isn t any funding for the school systems in Texas today right so uh i mean when you when you take uh uh professionals and put them in situations they have to make decisions based on money to fund public education and they can t get their finger out of their ear long enough to to get that major subject in line something s wrong so i think here in Texas mainly that the the they re not serious they re more serious about what the salary should be for senators than they are for what how the level of education should be for children i have a one year old so i m not i m more opinionated about the observations than than the than the true facts but uh huh uh it s just a shame to me that that that the our firemen our policemen and school teachers are the three least paid utilities um that have the biggest impact to our well being that s true i have a i have a real issue with that um i think that if from every year when they when they pull in the the the the uh test that the last three years you know ten eleven twelve year uh graders take and and and you see that their their education is below the norm throughout of all fifty states then that s saying that something s wrong with the educational system here in Texas and i have a real concern with about that um um matter of fact i m very content to send my daughter out out of state to college in in Virginia uh verses having her go down here and not learn anything and then uh so i m uh huh my my opinion i think i think there s a big concern uh hopefully hopefully the new uh education secretary of education will do something to fix the problem but uh i don t know they got to quit worrying about uh the uh religious uh overtones in our textbooks and get on with teaching the product yeah i think they get bogged down in a lot of small issues that people you know special interest groups can blow up um hum and uh and not really get down to teaching what s important teaching these kids you know how really the basics is what it comes down to exactly i i was astonished to find out that that across the United States in all public schools it is not mandatory for them to take phys ed is that right half they don t even a lot of the school systems don t even uh the kids nowadays don t even know what what the President s uh Fitness Education Program s all about they don t have to do sit ups and push ups and all that crap we had to do when we were going to school huh i remember and yeah and uh i ll i talked to a thirteen year old last night who s uh goes to uh one of the Plano schools high schools or or junior highs i guess and she said that that she had a a choice she could either have taken tennis or weight lifting so she chose to take weight lifting over the regular gym i mean give me a break i mean the the the kids sit there and they drink and they drink Cokes and eat popcorn for for for lunch for lunch and then go out there and lift weights and talk yeah and don t learn anything it s just a real i have a real problem with the whole system they need to put some sternness back into the into the teachers and let them be able to uh get the old whip out and get some discipline huh yeah then it comes down to what you said before though about them being uh some of the lowest paid public you know public service um hum employees that there are and yet they re so important i used to i used to date a girl who taught English at ninth grade level uh huh i mean i was absolutely flabbergasted at what she they would that she was paid true she was young you know but still it s the principle of course if she got her Master s degree it d all be different but uh right well you know it s hard though because then you start talking taxes and uh that s bad word oh taxes lord forbid forbid lord forbid taxes goodness gracious if we would uh plan our expressways a little better that ten dollars for the bridges and the roads we d cut that in half and give to the teachers we might have such a problem there s an idea maybe i should run for office huh run on that then no income taxes in Texas huh i m in Texas too so this is true that s funny that s funny well gee well that s about all i have here well me too i uh i think we both agree there s some problems there but yes ma am we ll small maybe do our small part to fix them up surely i ve enjoyed it bye bye all right you too bye
