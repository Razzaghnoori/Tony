 okay what okay opinion do you have about what was what happened well it s it s a real mixed um feeling about it uh it s really good that we did well and that uh um hum we we went in and did what we set out to do i i have there s there s been like a lot of things said about if it was a political well if it was a war for oil or a a war for ideals and seems to be real mixed between those two things um hum um i don t know i think the the the guy should have been ousted out of there and now we don t seem to be as interested in in doing what s right um hum um hum as we were when we started the whole thing yeah see i feel like i don t know i feel like the motivation Bush is a member of the Trilateral Commission and he s a member he was a member of the Skull and Bones at i think at Princeton or Yale i m not Yale Yale yeah and uh his motivations are i don t feel like he was absolutely on the up and up with us on you know the motivation the true motivation he talks a lot about the new world order right and most Americans probably don t really know what that would mean and i maybe i m being maybe i m assuming too much no i don t think most would i really don t and so i feel like the real motivation was something that uh most people would have absolutely no idea and that that motivation is to um you know to establish a one world order and to break up the monopoly power of the Middle East will so that they will submit under the uh one world order i mean that s what i felt so i m like going hum am i glad we went over there and did that um i think God s ultimately in charge and right you know i m not afraid of what they ve done i m not afraid of Saddam Hussein i feel he s lost and you know he needs to get saved just like the everybody else but right you know i just i guess i have kind of like hum kind of real cautious in the whole thing because i know that there s a motive that hasn t been openly discussed or revealed to anybody and uh that s where that s why i really don t have a real right set opinion because i don t know everything i don t much you could watch news all the time but you don t know anything hardly and he did talk about that though he did uh at least he did mention it right you know what i m saying i don t think most people understand what he s talking about when he talks about that new world order so i don t know what do you think of that it s it s it s a whole monopoly that needs to be broken up that s for sure it doesn t it s they have far too much influence over there and they re so unstable that it makes it hard for um it it makes it hard for us to deal with them i have that same problem at work um hum our our plant is so unstable it makes it very difficult to laughter to plan ahead or or do anything that that s uh huh productive uh huh yeah and i can understand why he he felt he needed to go over there on the other hand it s too bad that he couldn t use this i i i know that oil s real important to our life style but it s too bad he couldn t use this as um hum um hum a launch to say let s conserve more because he never said that um hum uh huh during the whole war he never put out like a conservation a conservation effort for oil um hum but the motivation though see wasn t didn t have anything i don t believe it had anything to do with the oil because i think i i feel like the real the real motivation of the war was to break up that Arab power not to disperse the oil but to they were a big problem for the the unifying of the EEC the European Economic Community which are gonna become i i i mean they re gonna be um hum they re gonna put us under if we don t become part of the new world order next year the United States if we don t i mean we re going to be in big trouble because when Europe unites unites that s why TI s building plants in Italy because they re going to have power like we can t imagine right and so the i think Bush wanted to break up this other power thing and it looks real good but in the end i just see that ultimately who s going to be in charge of this one world order you know what i mean is is George Bush really any better than Saddam Hussein or does he just look better do you know what i m saying i mean i think one person right in power that s not really seeking God and wanting to do good for the people and not deal for selfish motives is very dangerous and i don t see that this one world this new world order that him and Gorbachev keep talking about i just don t see that um that s just a real good thing but i think it s something that s going to happen but i guess that s what i feel happen with the war and that was the motive of the war was to try and break that up and so that they could be you know get more power over that Arab lands when they try and next year really start pushing this new world order well he talks about it all the time i mean right i mean that s all he talks about but anyway there s a good book by Larry Abraham um you probably have heard of None Dare Call It Treason and Call it Conspiracy right well anyway Call it Conspiracy is a real good book and he talks a lot about this i ve heard him interviewed some so i think it s kind of interesting but anyway he probably has a new book out that i don t know about yet because i haven t heard him in a while but i don t know so that s kind of my thing on the war i m kind of like nah it s all power plays you know there s so much stuff going on we don t know about oh yeah it s you know i m like going hey Peter Jennings you know he knows a little bit but he doesn t even i mean we would all die if we knew what was really going on i mean all of America would probably go into coronary attack well they would yeah i know i agree oh my money s in the stock market oh i can t believe they re doing this but it doesn t change anything so i m just like i don t know just i mean i would probably most people probably think i don t even have a high school education you know because of my attitude about it but i just feel like there s so much going on that you know hey i m going to pray about it and if i feel led to vote for a certain person i m going to do it but i m not going to get all up tight about all this and stuff you know hum um because i know at first we were watching the news a lot and man it was like gosh we were like all the time and i thought gee you know God s going to protect Israel i mean he starts well you can t yeah he starts nuking Israel man he s in big trouble i mean we ll just we ll hear about it you know what i mean if anything major happens we re going to find out so let s chill out and just do what we need to do so yeah that s where i got to too the first i got chills up and down when i heard the on the radio and the first time they started doing the bombing um hum i know it was kind of exciting at first but and then i know the first night of the bombing we had it was a Wednesday and we had home church and we had a surprise birthday party planned for a sixteen year old yeah exactly and so when we you know we re on the way to home church and the bombing s just begun you know and we go into this birthday party for a surprise party oh and so it was you know we just went from one extreme to the other you know and it was like kind of sad it was like man this is really hard you know i want to watch the war and so and so imagine the sixteen year old yep boy i had a surprise birthday party and a war started in Israel that ll be a good story when she s thirty won t it right it will be well well anyway well i guess do you think we re finished i guess so i think so too i don t know if we did what we were supposed to but yeah we did they can do a lot of research we get along good too some of the callers you don t along with that good you know you have you know what i m saying yeah we talked yeah isn t that funny i bet they re going to do a lot of research on that oh yeah well yeah one one guy i talked to about about colleges he was very opinionated and i know uh huh it was difficult really he probably had those glasses on like you know those Annie Hall kind of glasses i don t know what you call it John Lennon glasses that s what they are the women i call Annie Hall glasses but yeah real thick yeah is i don t know if they re Annie Hall glasses or not i just i don t know i always think of Annie Hall when i see them but yeah i think they re versions of that really i know the female version of John Lennon s but yeah yeah i know i talked to some guy who was i talked to some of the yuppie types you know and they re pretty interesting but yeah they re real opinionated but i guess that s better than nothing you know yeah yeah but anyway yeah it s been interesting though all these different people and some of them are real friendly you know and it s like yeah man when i come to Dallas i ll call you you know and then others of them are like they just wanna go but then some of them have babies crying in the background too so there may be other reason than you know that but well anyway are you in Dallas right yeah i m in Dallas i didn t know that people from other parts of the country were doing this yeah i had a guy from Rhode Island that we talked about fishing so and uh oh i had some i ve had people in Massachusetts and Vermont they work at TI up there do you work at TI no my husband does see mine does too in Dallas and um yeah but no there s there s TI s up in Rhode Island and stuff and that guy talked about fishing and i asked him if he took his wife and yeah and then he didn t have a wife and i felt bad but well i m sorry and he goes we re divorced well i m sorry it was real sad but he was pretty nice and stuff and then him and my husband started talking salary oh no how much do you make up in Rhode Island so i was just going wait a minute we re supposed to be talking about fishing now stop but yep anyway is that funny but we did talk about fishing though so but i guess i ll let you go i m going to finish my dishes and if anything happens interesting in the war maybe they ll have another thing and we ll get you again all right bye okay all right thanks bye bye
