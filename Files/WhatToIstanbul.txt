                      What to Do        Shopping        Istanbuls markets and bazaars offer some of the worlds        most interestingand challengingopportunities for shopping A huge        variety of handmade goods finds its way into the city from towns and        villages all over Turkey much of it of very high qualitywool and        silk carpets kilims flatweave rugs cicims embroidered kilims        leather goods ceramics and pottery copper and brassware and        jewellery There is also of course a lot of poorerquality        merchandise aimed specifically at the tourist market notably in the        big coastal resorts        The principal shopping area in Istanbul is undoubtedly the        Grand Bazaar with more than  shops crammed beneath its roof        Running downhill from here is Uzunar Caddesi lined with hardware        shops which leads to the Spice Bazaar the best place to buy lokum        Turkish Delight The weekend fleamarket in Beyazt Square is an        interesting place to browse and there are bargains to be found among        the bricabrac Across from the square are the back streets of Laleli        the place to look for lowpriced clothes For more modern upmarket        shopping you can join Istanbuls jetset in the stylish boutiques of        Nianta and Tevikiye near Taksim Square or head west to the        Galleria shopping mall by the marina at Ataky For craft shops        antiques dealers and galleries take a stroll around Ortaky on a        Saturday or Sunday        Shops are generally open from  am to  pm Monday        to Saturday and closed over lunch from  to  pm  though many        tourist shops stay open later and on Sundays The Grand Bazaar is open         am to  pm  Monday to Saturday        Bargaining        In an economy where many products are handmade each item        has a different value depending on the quality of workmanship it shows        Bargaining is thus a way of determining an appropriate price not        simply a way for the shopkeeper to get more money from the buyer To        get the best price though you must get to know the market by browsing        in several shops and asking the prices of comparable pieces        When you find something you want to buy ask the shopkeeper        how much it costs and then offer around half of what youre prepared        to pay The owner will feign amazement at such an insultingly low        price and discourse at length on the quality of the work but will        eventually suggest a lower price You of course will plead poverty        and suggest that you can buy the same thing more cheaply elsewhere but        end up making an offer slightly higher than your first Ideally you        should have a partner who acts impatient and tries to get you to leave        This goodnatured banter will continue back and forth until you settle        on a mutually acceptable price For expensive items say a carpet or a        leather jacket the process might be lengthy and involve several        glasses of tea and a good half hour of your time Two golden rules        never begin bargaining for something you do not really intend to buy        and never quote a price that you arent prepared to pay        In the resorts on the coast many traders are aware that        some tourists feel uncomfortable with bargaining and will give you        their best price straight away if you ask them to This is the        minimum they are prepared to accept and you will probably be wasting        your time if you try to force them any lower The competition between        shops is fierce and many traders work on very narrow profit        margins        What to Buy        Antiques In a place steeped in history buying antiques        seems the logical thing to do But remember it is illegal to take        genuine antiques out of the country without an export licence If you        want to buy any object that might be considered a museum piece you        will have to obtain a certificate from the directorate of a local        museum that clears it for export Despite this there are many        interesting and attractive fake antiques for sale in Istanbul        including swords and daggers Ottoman coffeemaking sets and copper        and brass tray tables with wooden stands But even if your purchase        only looks antique it may still arouse suspicion at customs Make        sure the dealer gives you a fatura invoice stating the value of the        piece and when and where it was made        Carpets and kilims Turkish carpets are of course world        famous for their beauty and durability and are top of the shopping        list for many visitors Kilims are small rugs that are woven rather        than knotted and have no pile a cicim is a kilim with embroidered        decoration All originated as floor and wall coverings for nomad        dwellingscarpets as hardwearing insulated floor coverings and        kilims as covers and wall hangings No two handmade carpets are        identical The traditional patterns and symbols are handed down from        generation to generation and have great significance to the weaver        conferring good luck on the household protection against the evil        eye or expressing the desire for a child Ask the dealer to explain        the symbols on any carpet you are thinking of buying        The price of a carpet is affected by its age rarity        quality of materials and dyes and tightness of weave The number of        knots per square centimetre ranges from  for a coarse wool carpet        to  for the most expensive silk carpets which can cost tens of        thousands of pounds Natural dyes look better and last longer than        synthetics but are more expensive You can tell the difference by        wetting a corner of a white handkerchief and rubbing the carpet        Synthetic dyes will stain the white material while the smell of        chlorine means that the carpet has been bleached to make it look older        Even if you are not an expert asking a few pertinent questions will        make the carpet seller less likely to fob you off with an inferior        item Again it is well worth doing your homework and shopping around a        bit before deciding on which carpet to buy        Ceramics and pottery The best ceramic tiles ever produced        in Turkey came from the kilns of Iznik near Bursa but these are now        collectors items Today you will have to settle for polychrome tiles        bowls plates and vases made in Ktahya which often copy the Iznik        designs but serve as affordable souvenirs        Copper and brassware Shining handbeaten objects in        copper and brass can be found in the shops around the Old Bedesten in        the Grand Bazaar and also in Bakrclar Caddesi Coppersmiths        Street behind Beyazt Square Braziers and shoeshine boxes lamps        candlesticks coffeegrinders coffeepots and samovars are among the        many objects available The coppersmith will also be happy to make        items to order or to engrave your purchase If you plan to use a        copper item for boiling water or cooking make sure that it is tinned        on the inside as unlined copper can be slightly toxic        Leather and suede Istanbuls Grand Bazaar has many leather        shops offering a huge selection of handbags belts purses wallets        jackets trousers and skirts Prices and quality vary widely but are        generally about a half to twothirds of what you would pay back home        While the leather is generally of good quality some of the goods on        offer in the popular tourist resorts suffer from poor stitching so        check the standard of craftsmanship carefully before buying If you        prefer you can have clothes and shoes made to order at many shops but        goodquality work will take time        Jewellery The best place to shop for quality jewellery is        the Old Bedesten in the Grand Bazaar cheaper items can be found in the        shops along nearby Kalpakclar Ba Caddesi the bazaars main street        Gold is sold by weight with a surcharge for workmanship gold prices        are posted daily in the bazaar genuine sterling silver should carry a        hallmark There are many cheap imitations on the market with fake        stones and silver plating so beware of ripoffs especially in the        coastal resorts        Other items you might consider include nargiles the famous        hubblebubble pipes popular with old men in Turkish cafs meerschaum        pipes and figurines produced in Eskiehir luxurious Turkish towels        the best of which come from Bursa colourful Karagz puppets made from        dyed
