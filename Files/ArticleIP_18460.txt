 Paula s Back Bill Clinton s payoff has failed to silence Paula Jones In the first installment of a two part world exclusive in depth interview she told the British celebrity magazine OK this week that because of my beliefs and stuff she thought she had been chosen to bring this man to light She explained I was the strong one that did not say no The unnamed author of the interview which was spread over 14 pages and accompanied by more than a dozen large photographs of Jones posing variously in black leather fake leopard skin and white shirt and jeans wrote that although she was heavily made up there wasn t even the smallest hint of a smell of perfume about her Jones claimed that Clinton s people were still out to get her and that she will feel even less safe after he leaves office because then he s not the President and he may think well since I m not the President now I can do whatever I want I can get rid of her or hurt her family But she said that although something like 53 people who could have helped to expose Clinton for what he really is have died since her case started she feels she is being watched over by God the strongest protector of all Of her famous 1991 encounter with Clinton then governor of Arkansas in his suite in the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock she said it left her feeling like he raped me without physically raping me On the dismissal of her case by Judge Susan Webber Wright Jones said I was just devastated I can t even describe my feelings It was almost like I d lost somebody In an article last week for Cambio of Bogot Colombia reprinted in English translation Saturday by the Guardian of London the writer Gabriel Garc a M rquez praised Clinton for his intellectual brilliance and lamented that this exceptionally human man should have his place in history distorted because he couldn t find a secluded place in which to make love Garc a M rquez wrote Sadder still the President only wanted to do what the common man has done behind his wife s back since the world began Puritan stupidity didn t only refuse him that it withheld his right to deny it Surely it is more dignified to perjure yourself in defence of carnal desire than to condemn love altogether The Independent of London led its front page Monday with a warning by U S Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin that Europe and Japan must take urgent steps to stimulate domestic demand and bring down trade barriers to prevent another world economic crisis In an editorial the paper generally supported Rubin and attacked protectionism The American triumphalists of the Chicago School who attribute any of the world s economic troubles to a falling short of the free market ideal make the mistake of overlooking the cultural and infrastructural differences between different economies it said But they are more right than the new protectionists But an editorial in the Financial Times Monday criticized Rubin for having little concrete to offer on the great policy issue of today reform of the international financial system Discussing his Saturday address to the World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland it said Rubin s proposals had little substance and that that he was effectively telling emerging economies that it is up to them to avoid becoming ill and should they succumb to make themselves better Also on the Davos forum the Russian daily Sevodnya published an article Monday by Mikhail Berger under the headline No Recovery for Russia saying that Russia unfortunately lived up once again to its reputation as a country which has failed to build capitalism and does not pay its debts Referring to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov s speech urging investors to keep faith with Russia and its creditors to be tolerant Berger wrote that despite his talks in Davos with Al Gore and the International Monetary Fund s Deputy Managing Director Stanley Fischer no one has shown any intention thus far to write off Russian debts For more on the Davos gathering see the Slate by Jodie T Allen In the Israeli paper Yediot Aharanot Elyakim Haetzni who speaks for the hard line right wrote Monday On the eve of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat s visit to President Bill Clinton I recommend that we think again before it is too late about the American involvement in the negotiations Haetzni said the Wye agreement had been a catastrophe because it had brought Arafat to the goal he had longed for instead of negotiations between him and the Jews there would be negotiations between the Americans and the Jews with the United States representing the Palestinians He went on Wye turned Palestine into an American protectorate An Israeli military strike would run into an American response If Israel were to refuse Arafat s demands it would be like refusing the United States Both Ha aretz and the Jerusalem Post gave front page treatment Monday to a row over the nomination of the businessman philanthropist Ronald Lauder to chair the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations in New York Ha aretz said pressure was mounting to delay Wednesday s vote on his appointment following the paper s disclosure that Lauder had provided financial support for right wing organizations identified with Benjamin Netanyahu The Jordan Times Monday praised the American born Queen Noor for Jordan s progress in getting rid of anti personnel land mines in the country The achievement of having already destroyed some 60 000 land mines out of an estimated 220 000 planted in various areas of the country has been commended by the U N Mine Action Service established under the Ottawa Mine Ban Treaty The paper said It is no secret that the Jordanian government was divided on whether or not to go ahead and sign the international treaty Thanks to Queen Noor Jordan has not only signed the Ottawa treaty but is closer than ever to ratifying it In Japan an editorial in Asahi Shimbun applauded the government for planning a new law to prevent unauthorized access to the Internet The proposed legislation would punish those who connect to the Internet by using other people s codes or by hacking into the system it explained Official regulation should be kept to a minimum but it is natural that improper access which can lead to criminal acts such as shopping with other users accounts or rewriting and destroying their data should be prohibited by law Back to the
