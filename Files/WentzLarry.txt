                     OK this is my second interview with Larry Wentz my father         He is also living in Lincolnton WV but hes originally from but um I mean          hes living in Lincolnton NC sorry but hes originally from Buckhannon WV         OK         Dad um what was it like growing up in Buckhannon for you                     Buckhannon was uh uh a very small and closeknit town         Uh what I enjoyed the most growing up was uh was the college campus         Its the home of West Virginia Wesleyan College and that was my playground that was my own the place where I spent so much of my childhood playtime and uh running through the different buildings and structures of the campus         Uh having a free reign going and coming as I pleased almost because my grandfather was the Dean of the College         And and everybody knew me so nobody really tried uh to uh corral me so I was sort of free to go and do what I wanted you know when the buildings were open         And uh just uh using that campus as a playground to um have war games and and do all kinds of adventurous uh you know hide and seek times and things like that with my friends a lot of roller skating a lot of raking leaves in the fall and to making leaf houses and all kinds of things like that is uh very memorable                     OK         Um Dad what was it the what were some what are some of the main things that you remember about your grandfather who was Dean of Wesleyan         I think his name was Grandfather Schoolcrafts         Grandfather Schoolcraft         Sorry                     Um some of the things that I remember is a small office that uh we would go into a lot         He had one of those oldfashioned uh recorder machines that uh had a cone on it where the needle would imprint your voice onto a cylinder cone         I dont know the technical name for the machine now         But uh I would always hide is his closet a lot in his office you know or maybe he put me in there for disciplinary reasons         I dont know I just remember being in there a lot         Um he had about two or three secretaries and um they were always nice and um it was just a fun thing to see his name on the door and to know that he was an important man but he was also my grandfather                     OK Thank you         Um do you feel that Buckhannon is a place that you will ever want to return to live in the future         And why or why not or why did you like living in Lincolnton NC so much                     As far as Buckhannon being a place I would want to retire in or retire back to uh I dont see that in the future to me         Uh not that its not a nice town there are a lot of good memories and so forth there         Its more of a place in my life now that I like to visit um I dont see the change in it that I do in NC         As far as WV compared to NC I dont see the change um and maybe the change is something that I enjoy and uh thats why I sort of tend to think that if current change intend to think Ill be retiring um in um NC or TN         Someplace like that that is more south         But I enjoy WV and I enjoy going back and meeting friends and uh         stirring up memories                     OK um were certainly not doing anything for promoting tourism for WV today         But uh with my last two interviews but I digress anyway                    Dad Dad um do you remember going to Audra State Park a lot when you were a younger teenager and if so what kinds of things would you do there including snake hunting drinking of alcohol etc                     Jess I never hunted snakes because I dont like snakes         Uh we did see them in the water occasionally and screamed and yelled and ran you know         There was the occasional bottle of alcohol consumed in the water on the water around the water um         Im glad those days are gone way gone         But uh Audra State Park was a fun place we would get on our bicycles and in our teenage years before we could drive and that was a good  miles over hill and dale to get there and we would definitely ride our bikes there and spend the day even walk uh hitch hike and walk the railroad tracks which cut the distance down considerably just to uh spend a day in the water and uh hunting uh you know exploring and uh just enjoying seeing new people and different people you never saw before                     OK um          do you remember any ghost stories or scary stories from uh         around the area of Buckhannon         Or Audra         Or Sago                     Or come up with a different question         No I dont remember any scary stories because I dont believe in scary stories         And there werent any really except headless farmers that would come out at midnight on certain days of the year and throw potatoes at you                  If you were walking the road at night                     Yes I think thats a favorite for lots of folks around the country         Um oh I um asked Linda the same question because we are getting ready to move into the year  a new century         Dad what is your fav         what is your favorite movie of the century and why         Lindas was The Sound of Music                     Put that on pause                     My favorite movie of the century                       Well a few of them two or three                              Would be From Here to Eternity         Uh I did like Creature from the Black Lagoon when I was a child         That was one of the scariest movies I ever saw         And The Mummy because that was a good one too         I liked Frankenstein         I liked the Werewolf         My mother made me see all these scary things thats why Im warped and hairy today                     What is a favorite movie since the age of  or above                     Um my favorite movie uh since the age of  I sure do like The Wizard of Oz before I was ten         Since the age of  I guess it would have to be Fiddler on the Roof I love that movie         I also enjoy um Scarlet Pimpernel and Hook         And Black Beauty                              OK         We all understand why you like um Scarlet Pimpernel because         it was such an intriguing story of         revolutionary proportions but why do you identify so much with the Jewish plight portrayed in Fiddler on the Roof                     Um well my favorite part was the two staircases one going up and one coming down or there were three actually one going nowhere in between                                       Dad come on youre making no sense at all                     I know Im at the no sense time of this interview         I dont make any sense now         What do you want me to say                                           Fiddler on the Roof I like the story I like the fact that                                            Oh yeah I like old whats his faces voice I like to sing like he does         I like the song I like his beard I like his prayer shawl         And um I like the fact that um its a wonderful story about the some of the traditions some of the type of holocausts that some of the Jewish people had to go through living in that country and at that period of time and um just uh just uh something in my heart that uh maybe Jewish roots from centuries back or something that uh tends to make me feel the way I do about the movie         Um being um Jewish born again myself I have that tendency to uh know about the plight of the Jews and sympathize with them                     OK thank you         Um Dad were getting close to Christmas and the media has had such a fun time the last few weeks talking about shopping on the Internet         In this new age of technology with emails websites um downloading this and that do you feel overwhelmed with those kinds of terms         Um do you feel like you are able to get on a computer and understand it         Or does it sort of scare you                     It sort of scares me I am so confused         Thats all I can say that was a horrible question                     Linda did you think that was a horrible question                     No                     I thought it was         I mean                       Do you like computers         I mean youre going to you are opening a new business                       I am computer illiterate so I dont have a like or dislike for them because I dont know what they can do for me                               Youre getting a new retail business started and                      And someday Ill like computers                     Some people sell a lot more on the Internet         Do you think that with this business um youre going to have to learn how to do it                       Sure                               And become acquainted with the                       Sure                              Internet where you can sell your tree water         That is water from the made from the maple                      Squeezed from the might maple         Squeezed we are talking hand squeezed         Milked from the tree                               Its a one of a kind folks         Anyway                       My hands hurt                               Straight from WV         So theres one good thing about WV we can talk about                      We got strong hands         Milking them trees                     Okeydokey          Um we                       How much did you say you were going to pay me for this                              Youre not getting paid Dad         OK um what uh what is your favorite show of the century and why                     My favorite show of the century                       A lot of people say Seinfeld what do you think about that                              No I like Archie Bunker All in the Family with Edith         Thats my favorite time of growing up         I can remember it very well         In fact I was humming the tune today                               Im not a bigot         But I enjoyed the TV series                     OK                                           Im sitting looking at my kitten Cordelia who Ive named after a popular character in a TV show Buffy the Vampire Slayer         Um what do you think about the rise of occult occultic matters or TV shows movies about the occult         Why do you think theyre becoming so trendy in recent years                     Uh I feel that man basically is a spiritual being first and he is always trying to get to the root problems of his personality and his surroundings         God creates in the spirit creates in the natural and uh man does the same and mans trying to find his creativity of the spiritual realm and I feel hes just um the day and age is getting closer and closer to end times as far as I believe the word of God says and so the days are drawing closer to where man will be harboring more and more blackness in his heart it will prevail         And uh man will be trying to find uh you know the cause of life so I dont know         Its just um its a deep subject to talk about a very broad subject to talk about but being spiritual beings I guess the shortest way of saying it         Mans fantasy and tendency is to go into the occult into black magic and the dark side because thats where he dwells and thats where his heart is uh settled in right now and until you know the Lord and know the true meaning of life and your purpose youre always searching in the dark side for the the meaning of reality and the meaning of life always trying to find out about the future         I remember when I was kid I was always trying to uh find out about the future because of the fear that it brings         But uh by knowing the Lord those fears are all removed                     OK and also we think goodness for Buffy that we have her to fight back against these evil people         Especially the vampires and demons         Now                                           Um one last question Dad um          what is your favorite time of year and why         Do you like spring or summer or winter or fall and why                     Whats my fifth choice         Hum my favorite time of year is summer         I enjoy spring and I enjoy fall but summer is the best         Im a summer person         I love warm weather I love the colors that summer brings         And uh life I just enjoy everything is alive and at its peak in the summertime         And um my favorite time of the year because uh as a kid I really enjoyed myself more during the summer I wasnt a uh person that got into sports so it wasnt like a fall thing or a spring type mentality but uh or winter sports so um I just enjoy summer                     OK I lied and said that was my last question         I have a few more actually          Um                                Repent                              I asked Linda what she if she could remember meeting you in junior high and why she fell in love with you                  Can you give me some feedback on your first encounter with Linda Stonicker in junior high or high school                     My first encounter with her was by phone when I called her up to ask her out for my friend Tom because Tom was a chicken         He was a dweeb         And so I call her up knowing that she probably wouldnt go out with him hoping she wouldnt         But and she didnt hallelujah         And so I asked her out and she said Yes         And that was my first encounter         My second encounter was kissing her rosy lips                     Larry                              Oh forget it I got overwhelmed by my first encounter                     OK and also one last question and Dad I promise this is the last one         What do you think about my husband Bob                  Since hes not here to defend himself                     What do I think about Bob         Well for the last year year and half everybody Ive ever met that weve talked to about Jessica and Bob Ive right from the start said that Bob was the one I would have picked out for my daughter for a husband         Of all the jerks that she ever paraded through my living room or some of them wouldnt even parade through my living room they just would stay in the car because they knew better         Um he had to be the um best looking the most appealing for her         Um his character hes blooming but uh I always say that to my friends that he would have been the one Id pick and Im happy and very glad that I have him for a son inlaw                     OK and were sure that he appreciates that         Um once again that was an interview with my father Larry Wentz who is originally from Buckhannon WV and now resides in Lincolnton NC
