                            Physicians now commonly advise older adults to engage in mentally stimulating activity        as a way of reducing their risk of dementia Indeed the recommendation is often followed        by the acknowledgment that evidence of benefit is still lacking but it cant hurt What        could possibly be the problem with older adults spending their time doing crossword puzzles        and anagrams completing figural logic puzzles or testing their reaction time on a        computer In certain respects there is no problem Patients will probably improve at the        targeted skills and may feel goodparticularly if the activity is both challenging and        successfully completed        But can it hurt Possibly There are two ways that encouraging mental activity programs        might do more harm than good First they may offer false hope Second individuals who do        develop dementia might be blamed for their condition When heavy smokers get lung cancer        they are sometimes seen as having contributed to their own fates People with Alzheimer        disease might similarly be viewed as having brought it on themselves through failure to        exercise their brains                    What Does the Evidence Show        Three types of evidence are cited to support the idea that mental exercise can improve        ones chances of escaping Alzheimer disease                  Epidemiological studies          Having more years of education has been shown to be related to a lower prevalence of          Alzheimer disease in crosssectional populationbased studies  and to a lower          incidence of Alzheimer disease in cohorts followed longitudinally  Typically the          risk of Alzheimer disease is two to four times higher in those who have fewer years of          education as compared to those who have more years of education Other epidemiological          studies albeit with less consistency have suggested that those who engage in more          leisure activities especially activities that are mentally stimulating have a lower          prevalence and incidence of Alzheimer disease  Additionally longitudinal studies          have found that older adults without dementia who participate in more intellectually          challenging daily activities show less decline over time on various tests of cognitive          performance           In epidemiological studies people cannot be randomly assigned to different levels of          education or to different kinds and levels of participation in leisure activities          Consequently researchers must try to identify confounders and take them into account          analytically However uncertainties remain Both education and leisure activities are          imperfect measures of mental exercise For instance leisure activities represent a          combination of influences Not only is there mental activation but there may also be          broader health effects including stress reduction and improved vascular healthboth of          which may contribute to reducing dementia risk  It could also be that a third factor          such as intelligence leads to greater levels of education and more engagement in          cognitively stimulating activities and independently to lower risk of dementia          Research in Scotland for example showed that IQ test scores at age  were predictive          of future dementia risk           Another problem with these epidemiological studies is that reverse causation could be          involvedin other words that incipient dementia could be causing reduced engagement in          leisure activities although some prospective studies have been particularly attentive to          controlling for this possibility  Clinical trials are needed to test the hypotheses          that emerge from the best epidemiological research Moreover because the onset of          Alzheimer disease can be hard to pinpoint and early changes may occur years before the          disease is diagnosed conclusions must be based on large samples followed over a long          period of time                          Randomized clinical trials          Many studies support the possibility of enhancing memory and other cognitive          performance or of slowing cognitive decline in older adults without dementia  The          most effective programs teach mnemonic strategies provide practice and give supportive          feedback Mnemonic strategies include the organization of items into meaningful groups          the use of imagery and the method of loci visualizing items to be remembered in a          sequence of specific welllearned locations Comprehensive programs can also include          encouraging memory aids such as appointment books teaching relaxation techniques and          providing instruction about memory changes in normal aging However improvements are not          found in all studies When improvements are found they are often modest may not be          maintained over time and do not generalize beyond the skill being trained Often the          subjective gains rival the objective ones for example participants do tend to report          fewer complaints about their memory          These limitations are evident in one of the largest randomized controlled trials of          cognitive training with older adults a large multisite study named ACTIVE Advanced          Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly  Participants were assigned to          receive training in one of three cognitive skills memory reasoning or speed of          processing Tests of cognitive abilities given immediately after training showed large          improvements on the particular cognitive skill on which the individual had been trained          but no transfer to the other two cognitive domains Additionally for the control group          that received no training simply taking the test battery at pretest led to improvement          on the posttest The effects of training were maintained over a twoyear followup          However the cognitive training program had no significant effect on measures of everyday          functioning Finally for participants in ACTIVE or in other memory training programs it          remains unknown whether eventual rates of Alzheimer disease will be reduced                          Neurobiology studies          The third type of evidence suggesting that mental exercise may help to prevent          Alzheimer disease comes from neurobiology studies that show greater brain complexity in          those with higher levels of mental activity Many such studies done with animals show          greater neural complexity after having been exposed to an enriched environment that          provides lots of stimulation for example by including wheels tunnels toys and gnawing          sticks  One human study with magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed changes in the          hippocampus in elderly memory training participants compared to controls  Another          report found changes on positron emission tomography scanning following two weeks of a          comprehensive memory program that included memory training special diet physical          exercise and stress reduction                             Mental Exercise and Cognitive Reserve        The concept of cognitive reserve is often used to explain why education and mental        stimulation are beneficial The term cognitive reserve is sometimes taken to refer directly        to brain size or to synaptic density in the cortex At other times cognitive reserve is        defined as the ability to compensate for acquired brain pathology This definition        encompasses coping skills as well as recruitment of other brain areas with cognitive        reserve thus accounting for individual differences in severity of cognitive dysfunction        when there are pathological neural changes People with a higher level of education have        greater cognitive reserve In some studies education or occupation are even used as proxy        measures of cognitive reserve while others are beginning to measure neural substrates that        correspond to reserve         Taken together the evidence is very suggestive that having greater cognitive reserve is        related to a reduced risk of Alzheimer disease But the evidence that mental exercise per        se can increase cognitive reserve and stave off dementia is weaker Epidemiological studies        suggest that individual differences in cognitive reserve may actually be lifelong In        addition people with greater cognitive reserve may choose mentally stimulating leisure        activities and jobs leading to a chickenandegg dilemma for the interpretation of the        relationship between mentally stimulating activities in adulthood and dementia risk        Cognitive training has demonstrable effects on performance on views of self and on brain        functionbut the results are very specific to the skills that are trained and it is as yet        entirely unknown whether there is any effect on when or whether an individual develops        Alzheimer disease Further the types of skills taught by practicing mental puzzles may be        less helpful in everyday life than more prosaic tricks such as concentrating or taking        notes or putting objects in the same place each time so that they wont be lost                    Conclusion        So far we have little evidence that mental practice will help prevent the development        of dementia We have better evidence that good brain health is multiply determined that        brain development early in life matters and that genetic influences are of great        importance in accounting for individual differences in cognitive reserve and in explaining        who develops Alzheimer disease and who does not At least half of the explanation for        individual differences in susceptibility to Alzheimer disease is genetic although the        genes involved have not yet been completely discovered  The balance of the explanation        lies in environmental influences and behavioral health practices alone or in interaction        with genetic factors        For older adults health practices that could influence the brain include sound        nutrition sufficient sleep stress management treatment of mood or anxiety disorders        good vascular health physical exercise and avoidance of head trauma But there is no        convincing evidence that memory practice and other cognitively stimulating activities are        sufficient to prevent Alzheimer disease it is not just a case of use it or lose it
