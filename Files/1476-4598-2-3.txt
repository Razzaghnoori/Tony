 Background RU486 Mifepristone has shown remarkable antiglucocorticoid and antiprogestrone activities both in vitro and in vivo 1 2 This compound has a high affinity for ligand binding sites of both receptors 1 2 Current clinical uses of RU486 are limited to its function as a progestrone antagonist 1 2 where it was approved in France in 1988 and recently in the USA as a means to induce early termination of pregnancy 1 2 3 Based on its antiprogesterone activity RU486 has been evaluated as a useful anticancer agent in organs sensitive to this hormone 4 Although evidence was not conclusive in these studies RU486 demonstrated a benefit to humans suffering from meningioma breast cancer and uterine leiomyomata 4 Several in vitro studies also demonstrated that RU486 induced antiproliferative effects against murine mammary tumors 5 as well as cultured human endometrial stromal and epithelial cells 6 7 Antagonizing the effects of glucocorticoids by RU486 may however result in deleterious effects Glucocorticoids produce a receptor mediated inhibitory effect on both basal and hormone stimulated expression of a newly discovered family of molecules known as suppressors of cytokine signalling 8 These molecules play an important role in shutting off cytokine action 8 and RU486 may therefore augment cytokine mediated effects Indeed since tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF is known to suppress hepatic apoptosis 9 a function which is considered a safeguard mechanism against neoplasia 10 11 the reported ability of RU486 to elevate hepatic TNF production in vivo and to enhance cell sensitivity to its toxic effects is alarming 12 Glucocorticoids also inhibit hepatocellular proliferation 13 14 15 and modulate the expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes 11 via mechanisms involving the glucocorticoid receptor 16 17 18 further supporting the notion that inhibiting these receptors may result in harmful effects We tested the hypothesis that inhibition of the glucocorticoid receptor will trigger events that may ultimately lead to liver cancer Consequently we investigated the impact of RU486 on hepatocellular proliferation and programmed cell death in livers of male B6C3F1 mice and quantified hepatic levels of genes involved in these events Results Effect of RU 486 on hepatocellular proliferation and apoptosis In control mice 1 55 0 12 of hepatocytes were labeled with BrDU Fig 1A Treatment with RU 486 significantly diminished these labeling indices by approximately 45 to 0 86 0 039 Fig 1A Similarly RU 486 caused a remarkable decrease in programmed cell death in the liver In control animals 2 68 0 7 of hepatocytes were undergoing apoptosis Fig 1B These levels were significantly reduced by 66 to 0 9 0 16 in livers of mice pretreated with RU 486 Fig 1B Increasing oncogene mRNA expression by RU 486 Pretreatment of mice with RU 486 caused significant increases in hepatic levels of JunB and mdm2 Fig 2 A remarkable 2 5 fold increase in the mRNA of JunB was detected upon treatment with RU 486 Fig 2A RU 486 also increased the hepatic mRNA levels of the oncogene mdm2 by 21 7 Fig 2B Decreasing Liver mRNA Levels of c myc and p53 by RU486 In contrast to its effect on JunB and mdm2 mRNA levels RU 486 diminished the hepatic expression of c myc and p53 mRNAs to comparable degrees Fig 3 While mRNA of c myc was significantly decreased by approximately 25 3 Fig 3A that of p53 was also diminished significantly by about 21 5 in the livers of animals treated with RU 486 compared to control mice Fig 3B Discussion Effect of RU 486 on liver cell proliferation Glucocorticoids have been shown in various studies to inhibit DNA synthesis 13 14 15 Therefore we hypothesized that blocking the glucocorticoid receptor by the potent antagonist RU 486 would result in increased incorporation of BrDU into hepatocyte DNA indicating an enhanced cellular proliferative capability Indeed RU486 caused a remarkable 2 5 fold increase in the expression of junB mRNA Fig 2A The protein product of this gene is a member of the activating protein 1 AP 1 family 19 which upon binding to either c fos or fos B protein form a complex that have high affinity to AP 1 binding concensus sequence 20 A wide variety of chemicals including growth factors and tumor promotors increase the expression of this gene in various cell types 21 Compared to untransfected keratinocytes JunB transfected cells grew more rapidly and were highly invasive in an in vitro assay 22 Therefore the increased hepatic levels of junB gene in mice treated with RU486 was expected to reflect an uncontrolled hepatocellular growth in these animals Surprisingly however RU 486 diminished the capacity of liver cells to proliferate Fig 1A In order to explain this discrepancy it is noteworthy to mention that unrelated to its anti glucocorticoid activity RU486 also has antioxidant properties that have been suggested to play a role in the inhibition of cell growth caused by this compound 7 Such an effect and or other anti glucocorticoid independent influences by RU 486 appears to prevail in relation to the overall impact of this compound on cell proliferation and may indeed suggest at a first glance a protective effect against the risk of hepatocellular cancer Diminishing liver capacity to eliminate pre cancerous hepatocytes Despite the decrease in hepatocellular proliferation caused by RU 486 inhibition of hepatic apoptosis in animals treated with this compound Fig 1B represents a potentially deleterious effect Apoptosis is considered a safeguard that enables an organ to purge itself of transformed cells 10 11 and its inhibition is proposed as a mechanism by which non genotoxic hepatocarcinogens produce liver cancer 9 23 We examined the effect of RU 486 on the hepatic expression of two genes involved in the regulation of this function 10 11 c myc and p53 to evaluate how RU486 might inhibit apoptosis This compound diminished the hepatic mRNA expression of both c myc and p53 significantly Fig 3 We previously reported that enhanced liver apoptosis in response to the antihepatocarcinogen rotenone was preceded and accompanied by a marked increase in the hepatic levels of c myc mRNA 10 a proto oncogene that plays a dual role in cell proliferation and apoptosis 24 Since in our study 10 rotenone inhibited hepatocellular proliferation while enhancing apoptosis we concluded that the increase in c myc mRNA expression acted as a pro apoptotic signal in the liver Also p53 modulates a battery of downstream genes involved in growth control and apoptosis 25 26 Taken collectively diminishing liver mRNA levels of both c myc and p53 by RU 486 may help define the underlying reasons for the observed anti apoptotic activity of this compound In addition to its effects on mRNA of c myc and p53 RU486 significantly increased that of the oncogene mdm2 by approximately 20 Fig 2B The protein product of the mdm2 oncogene is over expressed in a considerable number of tumors 27 This protein is a pivotal negative regulator of p53 27 it interacts with the P53 protein masking its transcriptional domain and accelerating its proteasomal degradation 21 27 The later process involves the deacetylation and ubiquitylation of the p53 protein by mdm2 28 Inactivation and or degradation of p53 diminishes the cell ability to undergo apoptosis 21 Conversely p53 may influence mdm2 Over expression of homeodomain interacting protein kinase 2 HIPK2 which increases p53 protein expression and or stability leads to a downregulation of mdm2 protein but not mRNA 29 Consequently the RU486 induced increase in mdm2 mRNA expression coupled with a decrease in that of P53 may also act in tandem to suppress the liver apoptotic capacity Fig 1B NF B and the glucocorticoid receptor The transcription factor NF B plays a critical role in controlling expression of downstream target genes in immune and inflammatory responses development and apoptosis 30 Important advances have been made in understanding the signal transduction cascades that control NF B activation Several lines of evidence indicate that NF B is constitutively activated in cancer cells suggesting that it plays an important role in tumorigenesis 30 Activated glucocorticoid receptors have been shown to repress NF B mediated gene expression 31 and to cause a significant reduction in nuclear levels of p65 protein a subunit of NF B 31 A variety of mitogens cytokines and reactive oxygen intermediates have been shown to rapidly cause the translocation of NF B to the nucleus 30 31 32 and the ability of dexamethasone to interfere with this translocation is blocked by prior treatment with the glucocorticoid antagonist RU 486 30 Based on these findings it is plausible to speculate that exposure to RU 486 may interfere with the function of endogenous glucocorticoids as regulators of cell cycle allowing the initiation and progression of malignant transformation of liver cells Other mechanisms that may participate in the RU 486 induced inhibition of hepatic apoptosis include the fact that this compound blocks the inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids on suppressors of cytokine signalling in the liver 8 This family of proteins is induced by growth hormones and cytokines and is strongly repressed in vivo by glucocorticoids 8 Up regulation of these proteins by RU 486 8 coupled with significant increase in hepatic TNF level found in animals treated with RU 486 12 may contribute to the inhibition of apoptosis observed in our study Fig 1B Increased liver production of TNF has been promoted as a significant factor in the mechanism by which non genotoxic hepatocarcinogens produce their effect 9 Conclusion RU 486 has recently become available in the USA for clinical use as an effective non surgical means to induce abortion The inhibitory effect of this compound on hepatocellular apoptosis observed in this study raises questions about the potentially deleterious impact of RU 486 A single dose of RU 486 such as that recommended for abortion or possible long term treatment with this drug in the future for other therapeutic purposes could potentially initiate events that could increase the risk of hepatic cancer Such an effect would be of special concern for individuals concurrently exposed to other carcinogens Methods Chemicals and supplies TRI
