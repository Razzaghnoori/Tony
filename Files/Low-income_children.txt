 Foster s Online Tuesday February 19 2002 Study Low income children lack advocates in court PORTLAND Maine AP Low income children in Maine involved in divorce or parental rights cases are often denied the benefits of court advocates because their families cannot afford to pay the fees according to a new report The report by the Muskie School of Public Service at the University of Southern Maine completes a three year evaluation of Guardian ad Litem or GALs in divorce and parental rights and responsibilities cases in the state GALs are lawyers or licensed mental health counselors appointed by a court to represent a child s best interests in family proceedings Their fees which can range between 75 and 150 per hour under a private system are paid for by the family said Muskie Fellowship recipient Alison Beyea Overall we found that GALs are very beneficial said Beyea who co wrote the report with Frank D Alessandro However we also discovered that in hundreds of cases each year the court recommends that a GAL be appointed but cannot do so because the families can t afford the fee Beyea said the study was conducted because of growing concern that low income children were subject to intense emotional arguments that more affluent children would be sheltered from The children are living in fairly intolerable situations while the parents are battling it out she said There may not be anyone else involved to insulate them Often GALs end up doing more social work than legal counseling such as improving communication between family members Beyea said Collaboration with mental health groups is critical she said Beyea a lawyer at Pine Tree Legal Services conducted the study and said she surveyed district court judges case management officers family law attorneys and people registered to be GALs There were 170 GALs in Maine at the time of her study she said Beyea said the report s findings are timely given that Chief Justice Leigh Saufley has said that one of her priorities is to provide GALs to all children regardless of economic background Unlike child protective cases children in divorce proceedings are not guaranteed the right to a court appointed guardian by the state Low income children who have been victims of abuse or neglect are not charged for guardians rather the state pays the GAL 50 per hour under the state courts budget Beyea said she would like to see the state implement a similar program that offers resources to lower income families involved in divorce and parental rights and responsibilities cases We do think given the report that there might be some legislative appropriation she said
