 The Browning of America A gray morning looking north from my office windows over Manhattan Listening to Miles Davis the Kind of Blue album er excuse me the Kind of Blue compact disc with John Coltrane blowing glissando on my favorite composition the smarty pants So What written by Miles A genius was Mr Davis adding depth and beauty even to less than stellar music by Cindy Lauper or Michael Jackson I write to jazz always have it smoothes the flow Miles Davis as you may recall maddened critics by playing with his back to the audience Never pandered He said instead accept what I am or I will give you nothing Yes the FALN guys and gals have accepted the clemency Is Hillary caught now Well maybe yes maybe no Remember Tamar New York has a lot of cops Now she can reasonably say to the police unions That was my husband I did not do this Last night s Inside City Hall on New York 1 the cable channel had a police union guy pretty much swallowing Hillary s line that it was Bill not her who pardoned these people Meanwhile the representative from the Puerto Rican detective s group was saying My community will make her pay dearly for this we will make her walk the line which is a laugh really because they have nowhere to go Think a moment Tamar She has foxed them She can now look clean to the cops and upstate conservatives The Latino legislators get to rant a while and look good to their more radical constituents But in the end as I said yesterday Hillary is telling them through that razor smile that they have no choice except to vote for her Speaking of clouds I was waltzing around Seattle earlier this summer when the political candidates swept through The Unity Conference the big confab of black Latino and Asian journalists George Bush as you may recall said no at first then rushed over to pass through and shake a hand or two Wasn t someone fired from his campaign for issuing that initial no Bush was right to come in a segmented market like this one you need every vote you can get It was healthy for his party too which is too white by far Don t be so hard on the pols for making the rounds in the colored neighborhoods It s good for business Look at the Bush brother Jeb with that Latina wife and the kids that Daddy Bush called the little brown ones quite an asset on the hustings How do you think he won Florida You ve got to face it Tamar we are a browning nation A room without some brown folks in it looks awful funny to most people probably even to you No
