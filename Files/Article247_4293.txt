 The Backlash Against the Backlash Against Irony The backlash against the backlash against irony has begun and just in time Deriding irony is now a reflex not just among the serious such as Jedediah Purdy the author of For Common Things but among the ironic as well Take Infinite Jest author David Foster Wallace who has called irony the source of a great despair and stasis in U S culture Or former Spin editor and wit about town Michael Hirschorn who agreeing with Purdy in a Slate Dialogue deemed irony a comfortable perch from which we can be unserious about the environment not to mention labor unions third world malnutrition ethnic conflict wage disparities corporate malfeasance When master ironists feel the need to disparage non ironically the very instinct that animates them you know that we ve all traveled too far down the path toward neurotic self negation Hence Culturebox s relief at the first glimmers of a countertrend three articles and one movie defending irony in the past three weeks The first piece was an unsigned Dec 18 editorial in the Economist endorsing the opinion of an essayist from the British Foreign Office who considers irony a necessary virtue in a post colonial world It suggests a certain modesty about oneself one s values and one s aspirations At least irony is unlikely to be used to justify programmes of conquest or extermination The second article was by critic and novelist David Gates in Newsweek claiming in somewhat overblown newsweekly fashion that irony and ironic juxtapositions are an inevitable response to the human condition The original ironic juxtaposition after all is the spirit plunked down into the material world The third was Slate s own Chatterbox who argues for irony on the charmingly loopy ground that it is a fin de si cle condition and that one corrective for the fin de si cle condition is historically the election of non ironic presidents whose ranks might include not just Al Gore and Bill Bradley but also the frightening Gary Bauer Orrin Hatch and Alan Keyes What unites all of these articles is a certain earnestness Their authors are not joking well Chatterbox sort of is Irony they say is good good for foreign policy good for the soul even good for the presidency Which brings us to Man on the Moon a movie celebrating comedian Andy Kaufman whose performances were ironic in the deepest sense Sweet gentle and never sarcastic Kaufman was a kind of holy fool He refused to wink at the audience so as to let them know that his nonsense was a put on Wrestling irate women Bashing the South in the South Being an inept and unfunny foreigner with no business on stage Kaufman refused to reassure you that any of it was a joke The movie has no such qualms however It is a conventional celebrity biopic lionizing its subject at every possible turn and congratulating itself for its insight It winks nonstop See the movie says S ee how great Andy was See how stupid everyone else was because they didn t get it See how smart we are who do get it Man on the Moon is so insufferable it made Culturebox wonder whether the entire effort to defend irony nonironically welcome though it is is somehow doomed to fail Does the very effort to defend irony to those impervious to its charms require you to trick it up as something it is not After all irony is not for anything It has no higher purpose It is a perspective on the world one that takes advantage of distance and some weirdly skewed point of view to see everyday things pomposity convention higher purposes and the earnest advancement of points like this one as ridiculous or sad or just somehow other than what they usually seem It s a lens that is morally neutral deployed for evil as easily as for good There are philosophers who argue that the ironic sensibility is morally preferable because it makes you aware of limitations but Culturebox would argue that what they really mean by irony is the tragic vision of the world not a particular trick of speech or performance Andy Kaufman would have been horrified by the implication that he was better than the people who failed to understand him if only because that would have made him so easy to skewer The people on whose behalf David Gates is pleading Quentin Tarantino Lorrie Moore Beck would not be happy to know that their particular slant on life expresses the universal human condition The Economist gets a little closer to the heart of the matter when its editorialist writes Many people when hearing an ironic remark may not realize that it is meant in jest those who realize that an ironic remark has been made are instantly complicit and they can enjoy the fact that there are others who have missed the joke In other words irony is how the superior presumably of class certainly of intellect get together and exclude the idiots It s funny and it s fun and Culturebox for one couldn t live without it But it s neither virtuous nor defensible
