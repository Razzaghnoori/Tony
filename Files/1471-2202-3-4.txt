 Background Nociceptors are specialized primary afferent neurons and the first cells in the series of neurons that lead to the sensation of pain 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 The receptors in these cells can be activated by different noxious chemical or physical stimuli 9 10 11 The essential functions of nociceptors include the transduction of noxious stimuli into depolarizations that trigger action potentials conduction of action potentials from peripheral sensory sites to synapses in the central nervous system and conversion of action potentials into neurotransmitter release at presynaptic terminals all of which depend on ion channels 6 12 13 14 15 16 Recent expression cloning has led to the identification of the first pain sensory receptor The cloned receptor is called VR1 vanilloid receptor subtype 1 9 10 The nucleotide sequence of VR1 predicts a protein of 838 amino acids with a molecular mass of 95 kDa The predicted topological organization consists of six transmembrane domains with a hydrophobic loop between the fifth and sixth domain which lines the ion conducting pore 17 VR1 has been expressed heterologously in several cell lines and has intrinsic sensitivity to thermal stimuli and to capsaicin a pungent extract of the Capsicum pepper family 18 VR1 does not discriminate among monovalent cations 19 however it exhibits a notable preference for divalent cations with a permeability sequence of Ca 2 Mg 2 Na K Cs 9 Ca 2 is especially important to VR1 function as extracellular Ca 2 mediates desensitization 20 21 a process which enables a neuron to adapt to specific stimuli by diminishing its overall response to a particular chemical or physical signal Although not activated by voltage alone VR1 currents show outward rectification and a region of negative resistance in the current voltage relation The VR1 channel is a member of the superfamily of ion channels with six membrane spanning domains with highest homology to the trp family of ion channels For those ion channels within this superfamily for which stoichiometry has been directly examined all have been shown to be composed of four six transmembrane domain subunits or pseudosubunits with auxiliary subunits sometimes present as well 22 An initial characterization of VR1 channels expressed in Cos and CHO cells has recently revealed that under certain conditions they run as multimers on pseudo native PFO gels with tetramers being one of the primary bands observed 23 Thus like other six membrane spanning domain channels VR1 almost certainly forms as a tetramer whether it combines with homologous subunits to form heteromeric channels remains to be determined In this study we have examined the electrophysiological and biochemical properties of VR1 expressed in Xenopus oocytes We found that its apparent affinity for the ligand capsaicin is comparable to that observed by others When examined for size on denaturing gels we found that the monomer appeared to be a doublet and that there was a band that corresponded to roughly twice the molecular weight of the monomer bands Through site directed mutagenesis we determined that the doublet represented unglycosylated and glycosylated forms of the VR1 subunit monomer and identified the glycosylation site as N604 Next using a VR1 subunit engineered to be of different size we show that the larger band on the gel represented dimerized subunits Several mechanisms underlying dimerization were examined and ruled out Since VR1 likely forms as a tetramer the strong interaction we observed between pairs of subunits raises the question of whether this subunit interaction is involved in VR1 function Results Electrophysiological and biochemical properties of VR1 We expressed VR1 channels in Xenopus oocytes in order to characterize their electrophysiological and biochemical properties Using outside out patch clamp recordings we studied the responses of the channels to capsaicin Figure 1Adepicts a current family obtained using a saturating 4 M capsaicin concentration when the voltage was stepped from a holding potential of 0 mV to from 100 to 100 mV A current voltage relation measured from these currents Figure 1B shows the pronounced outward rectification exhibited by VR1 This rectification has been shown to be independent of external divalent cations 24 and is likely due to a combination of rectification in unitary conductance 9 and voltage dependent gating 24 Application of a lower concentration of capsaicin 0 5 M activated a smaller fraction of the channels in this patch giving a smaller overall current Figure 1C By plotting the normalized currents in the presence of 4 M and 0 5 M capsaicin on the same graph Figure 1D we show that the voltage dependence remains unaltered under both experimental conditions Figure 1Eshows a dose response relation for activation of VR1 channels by capsaicin for the same patch Fits of dose response relations with the Hill equation see Experimental Procedures yielded values of n 1 8 0 06 and a K 614 110 nM mean of 5 patches These values are similar to those previously reported 20 24 These data indicate that in our system VR1 RNA is expressed as a functional protein with characteristics similar to those reported by other groups To examine the size of VR1 with SDS PAGE we constructed a VR1 subunit with a FLAG epitope tag on its extreme C terminal end Figure 2A By using both this C terminal FLAG epitope and an N terminal epitope for which a commercial antibody is available we could determine whether the band s we observed corresponded to full length VR1 subunits When oocytes injected with VR1 RNA were examined with SDS PAGE and Western blot three bands were apparent Figures 2B 2C 2D Two of these bands were seen as a doublet at about 80 kDa and 84 kDa best seen in Figure 2D A third band of about 200 kDa was also observed The size of these bands was the same for blots probed with the N terminal antibody Figure 2B or the FLAG antibody Figure 2C indicating that they represent full length VR1 subunits For the remainder of this study we used the FLAG antibody due to the lower background it produced Identification of the glycosylation site in VR1 A doublet of monomers has been previously observed for VR1 expressed in CHO cells 23 In that case treatment of cells with peptide N glycosidase F eliminated the larger monomer band suggesting that it represented a glycosylated form of VR1 Although the difference in apparent size in that study was 19 kDa and we see a difference of only 4 kDa Figure 2C we wondered whether glycosylation might explain our doublet as well We therefore examined the predicted amino acid sequence of VR1 in order to identify potential glycosylation sites see Experimental Procedures Figure 2Adepicts the proposed topology of the six transmembrane domains of VR1 A consensus sequence for N linked glycosylation is located just distal to the fifth transmembrane domain at position 604 We introduced a point mutation to change the asparagine at position 604 into a serine N604S If indeed N604 is a glycosylation site channels expressed from this N604S construct would be expected to lack glycosylation Figure 2Dshows that in N604S channels the upper band of the doublet has been eliminated These data indicate that wild type VR1 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes are present in both unglycosylated and glycosylated forms and that the N linked glycosylation occurs at position 604 Once we determined that the N604S mutation efficiently removed the glycosylated form of the monomer we tested to be certain that N604S channels were present in the plasma membrane and had electrophysiological characteristics similar to those observed in wild type channels We performed patch clamp recordings on oocytes injected with N604S RNA The results of these experiments are shown in Figure 3 Like for wild type VR1 channels capsaicin activated N604S channels in a concentration dependent manner Figures 3A 3C and 3E Current voltage relations at both a saturating Figure 3B and a subsaturating Figure 3D concentration of capsaicin show that the voltage dependence of N604S channels is similar to that of wild type VR1 channels in Figure 3compare data from N604S channels blue and red to data from wild type VR1 channels green the ratio of the current at 100 mV to that at 100 mV is not statistically different from wild type VR1 Furthermore the dose response relation in Figure 3Eshows that the apparent affinity of N604S channels for capsaicin is not significantly different from wild type channels t test p 0 05 with n 2 3 0 3 and K 780 71 nM mean of 5 patches These data indicate that eliminating the N glycosylation site of the VR1 channel gives rise to a functional protein electrophysiologically similar to wild type VR1 Identification of the nature of the VR1 high molecular size band At 200 kDa the third band observed in Figure 2was approximately twice the molecular weight of the monomer We therefore suspected that it might represent a dimer of VR1 subunits However it could also arise from a monomer in combination with another cellular factor To distinguish between these possibilities we engineered a VR1 mutant in which amino acids 2 52 in the N terminal were deleted termed 2 52 This construct gave rise to a high molecular weight band of 180 kDa 20 kDa smaller than that observed for wild type VR1 Figure 4 When coexpressed with VR1 heteromeric channels composed of both types of subunits are expected to form If the higher molecular weight band does represent a dimer of subunits the heteromeric VR1 2 52 ought to be intermediate in size between the homomeric dimers When equal amounts of VR1 and 2 52 RNA s were coinjected into oocytes three bands were observed 200 190 and 180 kDa Figure 4 The 200 kDa band represents the homomeric VR1 dimer whereas the 180 kDa band represent the homomeric 2 52 dimer The middle band at 190 kDa is indeed intermediate in size Our interpretation is that this 190 kDa band is composed of one wild type VR1 subunit and one 2 52 subunit indicating that the high molecular weight band represents subunit dimers Furthermore quantification of the intensity of the bands on the gel revealed a 1 2 1 ratio of the three bands This ratio of the three ways in which the two types of subunit can assemble is what would be expected if assembly between the different types of subunits were random Next as with N604S we wanted to be certain that 2 52 expressed as a functional channel in Xenopus oocytes The results of electrophysiological experiments are shown in Figure 5 We found 2 52 to form functional capsaicin activated channels in Xenopus oocytes Although an increase in rectification was consistently observed with these channels compared to wild type VR1 Figure 5B the ratio of the current at 100 mV to that at 100 mV is not statistically different from wild type VR1 Fits of dose response relations Figure 5E with the Hill equation yielded a mean n value of 2 1 0 26 and a mean K value of 1 98 0 8 M neither n nor K were significantly different from VR1 t test p 0 05 for 5 patches Examination of putative cross linking factors A previous study has reported that the presence of capsaicin and chemical cross linkers influence the formation of multimers in VR1 23 Moreover this study reported that cross linking could be a Ca 2 mediated process through the activation of endogenous transglutaminases In our expression system the presence of a dimer was seen even in the absence of capsaicin Thus we set out to study the factors that could be involved in the formation of this complex Our first approach was to determine whether this dimer could be due to the presence of a disulfide bond between subunits Although we have mercaptoethanol in the sample buffer for all experiments it is possible that a disulfide bond refractory to reduction by this reagent was present We therefore used the stronger reducing agents DTT and TCEP in the biochemical assays and used them in various steps of the purification see Materials and methods Figure 6Ashows the results for this experiment The control lane represents the results obtained from oocytes processed under control conditions with mercaptoethanol as the only reducing agent The next two lanes shown are those of oocytes exposed to the reducing agents DTT 100 mM and TCEP 20 mM both during processing and in the sample buffer We quantified the ratio of intensity of the monomer band to the dimer band Neither DTT nor TCEP treatment produced a difference in this ratio compared to the control condition t test p 0 05 for 3 independent experiments These data indicate that the presence of the VR1 dimer is likely not due to an intersubunit disulfide bond We next addressed whether Ca 2 could affect the monomer dimer ratio in our expression system Oocytes were processed for biochemical assays under the various experimental conditions depicted in Figure 6B In the first lane we show protein obtained from oocytes exposed to Ca 2 1 8 mM in frog Ringer s solution but not to capsaicin both monomer and dimer bands can be observed When capsaicin and Ca 2 were added together the ratio of monomer dimer remained unchanged in comparison to the previous experiment p 0 05 for 3 independent experiments We then tested whether eliminating Ca 2 from the oocyte media would affect this ratio As seen in the last two lanes of this gel the presence of EGTA 2 mM did not alter the formation of the VR1 dimer whether capsaicin was or was not present in the assay the monomer dimer ratio did not differ from control conditions p 0 05 for 3 independent experiments under the same conditions Our data indicate that under our experimental conditions Ca 2 does not play a pivotal role in VR1 dimerization Finally we tested whether the transglutaminase inhibitors cysteamine and monodansylcadaverine MDC could affect this process As shown in Figure 6C second and third lanes the addition of these compounds for 1 hr to the solution bathing the oocytes and to the homogenization solution did not modify the monomer dimer ratio when compared to the control lane p 0 05 for 3 independent experiments The concentrations of cysteamine and MDC used here are identical to those previously shown to disrupt transglutaminase induced cross linking of VR1 channels in other cell types Kedei et al 2001 This result comes as no surprise since transglutaminases are known to be Ca 2 dependent 25 and our previous experiment demonstrates that Ca 2 has no effect on the dimerization we observed Discussion Unglycosylated and glycosylated forms of the VR1 monomer We show that in Xenopus oocytes VR1 is expressed in both glycosylated and unglycosylated forms with 4 kDa difference in their apparent molecular weights The complete disappearance of the upper band of the monomer doublet for the N604S mutation strongly suggests that the extracellular linker between the fifth transmembrane domain and the P loop of VR1 is subject to N linked glycosylation Moreover since channel function did not appear to be affected by the absence of glycosylation Figure 3 it appears that glycosylation at this site is not essential for correct folding and targeting of the protein to the plasma membrane The position of the glycosylation site in the structure of the channels is in a region of known importance in channel function Lying between the fifth transmembrane domain and the P loop this region contributes to the extracellular vestibule of the ion conducting pore 26 The vestibules of ion channels are thought to influence the permeation of ions 27 28 and in CNG channels it has been reported that elimination of the N glycosylation site which is in an analogous position between S5 and the P loop can induce changes in the apparent half blocking constants for extracellular and intracellular Mg 2 29 Whereas two monomer bands had been previously observed for VR1 expressed in CHO cells 23 a major difference between this study and ours is the difference in size between the two monomer bands 19 kDa about five times larger than we observe On the other hand Kedei et al 23 show a doublet in channels purified from DRG cells which express VR1 endogenously that is similar to the one we observe Further unlike in CHO cells no additional high molecular weight glycosylated bands were observed Dimerization of VR1 As a member of the six transmembrane domain superfamily of ion channels VR1 most likely assembles into tetrameric complexes Evidence that VR1 is capable of forming multimers has been previously reported when studied under pseudo native conditions 23 In this previous study tetramers were the major band observed although larger and smaller bands were also seen Interestingly there is precedent for an ion channel to retain some intersubunit interactions even on denaturing gels like those used here The bacterial K channel KcsA whose X ray crystal structure has been solved and is definitively a tetramer 30 runs as a tetramer on SDS gels 31 Furthermore mutations that disrupt a known intersubunit interface at the level of the pore disrupt this biochemical tetramerization The structural interactions that underlie tetramerization of KcsA on gels are disrupted only by heating the sample and by pH 12 31 treatments that had no effect on the dimerization of VR1 we observed data not shown Although it is tempting to conclude that the pH and heat resistent dimerization we observe with VR1 results from a covalent interaction we cannot rule out other explanations such as strong hydrophobic interactions What does a dimer observed on a gel mean given that the channels are almost certainly tetramers Precedent for dimerization of limited domains of ion channels abounds Cyclic nucleotide gated channels for example appear to exhibit functional dimerization of their cyclic nucleotide binding domains 32 The RCK domain of BK channels has a dimerization domain even though BK channels too are tetrameric at the level of the pore 33 Finally the GluR2 ligand binding core has a dimerization interface in the crystal structure 34 Evidence including the clustering of residues involved in receptor desensitization at this interface suggests that the dimerization is not just crystallographic but functional The dimerization observed in the above examples all involve ligand binding sites Given that VR1 is also a ligand activated ion channel it is tempting to speculate that it may too contain such a dimer interface Recent work identifying amino acid residues that likely comprise part of the capsaicin binding site 35 suggest that capsaicin binds at the interface between transmembrane segment 3 and the cytoplasm Could this be a point of intersubunit contact Although the dimerization we observe may represent a native intersubunit interaction other possibilities must be considered For example hydrophobic interactions can cause membrane proteins to aggregate during purification Alternatively a covalent interaction may link pairs of subunits This possibility will be investigated in the future Materials and methods Heterologous expression of channels in Xenopus oocytes Segments of ovary were removed from anesthetized Xenopus laevis After gross mechanical isolation individual oocytes were defolliculated by incubation with collagenase 1A 1 mg mL in Ca 2 free OR2 medium 82 5 mM NaCl 2 5 mM KCl 1 mM MgCl 2 5 mM HEPES pH 7 6 for 1 5 3 hours The cells were then

were dipped in a seal glue composed of one part light mineral oil one part heavy mineral oil and 10 parafilm beads to promote formation of high resistance seals 36 Currents were low pass filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at a 10 kHz with an Axopatch 200B Axon Instruments Union City CA Data were acquired and analyzed with the PULSE data acquisition software Instrutech Elmont NY and were plotted and fit using Igor Pro Wavemetrics Inc Lake Oswego OR All currents shown are difference currents in which the current in the patch in the absence of capsaicin has been subtracted All dose response curves were

current K is the concentration of half maximal activation and n is the Hill coefficient Current voltage relations were plotted using the data obtained from voltage jumps from 100 to 100 mV for 100 ms from a holding potential of 0 mV Data was normalized by dividing the values of the current at different voltages by the value of the current at 100 mV When pooled data are discussed in the text they represent the mean standard error of the mean SEM A Student s t test two tailed was performed on some data as discussed in the text The significance level was set at p 0 05 Mutagenesis A potential glycosylation site was identified by screening the predicted vanilloid receptor 1 VR1 channel amino acid sequence 9 A glycosylation consensus sequence of N X T S was found at positions 604 606 NNS A point mutant was constructed as outlined below to replace the asparagine at position 604 with a serine The mutant construct was designated as N604S The point mutation and deletion mutation were constructed by a method involving oligonucleotides synthesized to contain a mutation in combination with wild type oligonucleotides in PCR amplifications of fragments of the cDNA The product of the PCR reaction was then cut with two different restriction enzymes to generate a cassette containing the mutation The cassette was then ligated into the channel cDNA cut with the same two restriction enzymes After transformation of bacteria with the ligation product single isolates were selected and the entire region of the amplified cassettes was sequenced to check for the mutation and insure against second site mutations mRNA was synthesized in vitro using a standard reverse transcription kit mMessage mMachine Ambion Austin TX All constructs including VR1 were made in a background of a VR1 subunit in which the FLAG epitope DYKDDDDK had been spliced on to the C terminus The presence of this epitope was found to have no detectable effects on the electrophysiological properties of the channels data not shown SDS PAGE and Western blot Oocytes were prepared after the method of Rho et al 29 Typically 30 oocytes were lysed by trituration in 200 L of a solution containing 100 mM Tris HCl 100 mM NaCl 0 5 Triton X 100 0 05 mg mL pepstatin 0 05 mg mL leupeptin and 0 05 mg mL aprotinin pH 8 0 and the homogenate was incubated for 15 minutes on ice The homogenate was then centrifuged at 18 400 g for ten minutes at 4 C in a Jouan CR3i centrifuge The soluble portion of the homogenate was then transferred to a new tube for an additional centrifugation 10 L of supernatant was removed mixed with 20 L of Laemmli sample buffer containing mercaptoethanol 19 1 and incubated at room temperature for five minutes The samples were then subjected to SDS PAGE using NuPage 3 8 or 7 Tris Acetate precast gels Invitrogen Corp Carlsbad CA Proteins were then transferred to a PVDF membrane and Western blot analysis was performed For all blots except that shown in Figure 2B M2 anti FLAG primary antibody was used and for the blot shown in Figure 2Ba polyclonal antibody raised against the N terminal sequence of VR1 amino acids 4 21 RASLDSEESESPPQENSC was used Neuromics Inc Minneapolis MN Chemiluminescent detection was then carried out using the SuperSignal West Femto kit Pierce Rockford IL Chemiluminescent signals were captured with the Flourchem Imager Alpha Innotech San Leandro CA which has a linear range of 4 O D units Densitometry of bands on Western blots was done with the Flourchem software For comparison of the ratio of monomer to dimer we included both monomer bands in the monomer category Because of the large linear range of detection of our instrument we could compare this ratio with accuracy even if the amount of total protein varied between gels For SDS PAGE experiments on disulfide bonds the oocytes were treated as above except that the lysis buffer contained either 100 mM DTT or 20 mM Tris 2 Carboxyethyl Phosphine Hydrochloride TCEP Pierce Rockford IL To examine the effect of calcium and capsaicin on VR1 dimer formation four different conditions were tested For calcium free condition whole oocytes were rinsed three times with calcium free frog Ringer s solution 96 mM NaCl 2 mM KCl 2 mM EGTA 1 mM MgCl 2 5 mM HEPES pH 7 6 prior to incubation with or without 10 20 M capsaicin at room temperature for 30 minutes For calcium present condition whole oocytes were bathed in frog Ringer s solution with or without 10 20 M capsaicin for the same duration The oocytes were triturated according to the method described above except for the capsaicin present condition where 10 20 M capsaicin was included in the lysis buffer For experiments on transglutaminase inhibitors the oocytes were bathed for one hour in frog Ringer s solution containing either 20 mM cysteamine or 250 M MDC These are expected to be saturating concentrations of the transglutaminase inhibitors Oocytes were triturated according to the method above except that either 20 mM cysteamine or 250 M MDC were included in the lysis buffer
