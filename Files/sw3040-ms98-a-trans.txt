          well we uh taxes everyone thinks taxes are too high im sure but uh i think we do get quite a good value for the tax dollars we spend in most cases what do you think   uh yeah i i think so i i uh i i think im i think im uh a little out of the ordinary in that that i i uh i think im more worried about the deficit the national deficit than than uh a lot of other people are and think that we need to we need to either raise our taxes or or cutback on something and i dont know what to cutback on to to get to get that to get that settled and and uh   at this stage its hard to tell     and uh i know im a real a real uh out of it in terms of taxes so im not im uh think that the we really ought to seriously consider what an income tax might do that   yes   uh for Texas and and   well at this stage i think weve taxed property almost to the limit because like the the property taxes on the homes have reached the point that its precluding people from being able to own a home   yeah i think so   because of the cost of the taxes on them i know i live in Richardson and its up over two thousand dollars a year for taxes on my house   yeah yeah yeah yeah   but now were getting public services the schools the hospitals and if it werent for the taxes were putting in there uh look what the schools could cost you   yeah yeah yeah now im uh uh oh i wed when we moved to Richardson Richardson one of the reasons we chose it was for the uh for the schools and and realizing that that that quality of schools might well have higher taxes than other places but that we were willing to uh to go for that because we supported the   yeah then again the the community college system here is excellent for the dollar spent and the public colleges also the tuition has got to be among the lowest in the country   yeah yeah   uh one of the uh i believe i dont know which one it is uh down there whether its Hobby or uh the other exgovernor down there that are proposing doubling the tuition well if you double the tuition it would still be considerably less than the public school tuition in most other states   yeah i think thats right   yeah that would provide uh possibly some relief there to utilize some of the property taxes for other things see the so called sin taxes on liquor and the cigarettes and such as that generate a considerable amount but   yeah   i pay eventually i think you may tax people out of smoking even   i i dont i dont know about that i     yeah  well i quit ten years ago so   i i see okay no uh   i couldnt afford to start again   yeah well that that that would be true that would be true but   i know uh my children would give up eating before they gave up their cigarettes i think   huh   but all the various taxing authorities that come through i think the one tax i resent the most though is the additional sales tax for DART which is probably never going to be in existence in my lifetime   yeah and and even if it is isnt going to uh uh provide you with any any services in that its not doing to provide a route from your your home to a business for instance you know   well this this is a thing i think its like uh back east you had to start your public transportation when you started your cities you cant come in afterward and really be successful or economical at it if we had been like a Chicago or a New York City or Philadelphia or someone like that   yeah   and had a public transportation system starting in the horse and buggy days and when land was cheap and uh construction costs were cheap you could afford it but now digging tunnels under Central Expressway and things like that becomes cost prohibitive   yeah and yeah and the other thing is that when it when its the public transportation is established that early on then then the business uh business and residential patterns develop to take advantage of that whereas in in uh in Dallas here weve weve got uh   absolutely   those patterns were well established before before we really tried to tried to do the DART and uh   for instance all the all the the uh office buildings and stuff that are out here in in uh north Dallas as opposed to downtown uh to try to to try to provide efficient transportation from everywhere around the the metroplex to to uh both those centers of of business plus everything else thats scattered around here and there as opposed to having a concentrated business area   yeah   you know like New York does yeah   yeah just take like in Chicago where the people depend on the public transportation system to get them everywhere new York and some people dont even own a car and know how to drive a car   yeah yeah right right   someone made the analogy uh with Texans as being like the old cowboys and their horse an old cowboy would jump on his horse to go across the street well most Texans will jump in their car to drive across the street   yeah   and im just as guilty as anyone else   oh yeah yeah   i drive to work every day by myself uh without even even any thought of car pooling   yeah right   and uh most people are that way   yep   because theyre used to not having public transportation   yeah   so but i here again i think the thing i resented where they were collecting the sales tax for five years before they turned a spade of dirt   yeah yeah   so and doing all these studies and the things we saw about them traveling to San Francisco to see whether they wanted ten foot wide or twelve foot wide cars or something       i felt that was a little uh wasteful use of the tax dollars that we were paying   a little bit much oh yeah yep   you know   yep we could   well thats about all i can say at this time   yeah i think i think so i think that will probably do it so   okay its been real nice talking with you   good enough bye   bye
