 The Last Thing We Expected Joan Didion the journalist is a great believer in stories Joan Didion the novelist has a habit of distrusting them In her essays she has confidently found narrative everywhere in the worship of John Wayne in the empty governor s mansion in California in the Central Park jogger s fate But in her fiction Didion gets the jitters at the mere thought of spinning out a tale The anxious narrators of her disjointedly elliptical novels are always interrupting challenging undercutting themselves By fits and starts that is how they write a stylized stuttering that has become Didion s trademark delivery That is also how her characters live The Didion protagonist is a woman adrift in history her own and America s Her new novel The Last Thing He Wanted is about what else a woman adrift in history her own and America s Elena McMahon given to fast walks and clean starts fits the mold of her predecessors sensitive yet impassive females proficient at forgetting and at never looking far ahead She has learned how to evade her past like Maria Wyeth in Play It As It Lays 1970 and Charlotte Douglas in A Book of Common Prayer 1977 who cope with crisis by living only in the now never risking the backward glance Elena a course of radiation treatments for breast cancer behind her has distanced herself from her dying mother her rich ex husband her resentful daughter Now crisscrossing the country covering the 1984 presidential campaign for the Washington Post she feels a fatigue near vertigo at the daily round of spin counterspin rumors denials Like Inez Victor the wife of a vacuous politician in Democracy 1985 she is quickly mastering a capacity for passive detachment In fact on the day when the action of the novel begins she walks off the campaign without a clue as to what she plans to do next The Last Thing He Wanted also features a self consciously intrusive narrator nothing new here either This time the uneasy voice is that of a nameless California journalist who has written about administration policy in Central America during the 1980s she could in other words be Joan Didion herself The novel unfolds in the cinematic style that Didion has made her own flashbacks flash forwards crosscuts staccato bursts of dialogue now and then a montage music over The quest to assemble the shards of experience too is by now familiar One woman the narrator cross examines the inscrutable life of another woman Elena McMahon hoping but not really expecting to find meaning in it In short The Last Thing He Wanted looks like proof of what you may have suspected for some time that for all its restlessness about form Joan Didion s fiction is formulaic even contrived The exhilarating surprise of her new novel is that in it she masters one of the most contrived forms of all the thriller Followers of Didion s studiously anticlimactic fragmented fiction will find it hard to believe but her fifth novel has perfect pitch and pace and is hauntingly hard to put down The truth is that suspense and plot though never before part of the technique of Didion s fiction have always been its subject Novels are where she frets about narrative its possibilities and deceptions Her protagonists are enigmas to themselves the reader the narrator and not least the mysterious men who hover at the edge of their lives in love with them These male figures are plotters in a dimly lit world where the CIA corporate powers criminals and small time schemers do deals stage coups order up murders To what end they maneuver has never been clear and the women who in their remote way are drawn to them can t bring themselves to care The point has been that the suspense is endless that there is finally no meaningful plot Didion s parables about anomie in post Kennedy era America have implied that once history is forgotten identity dissolves and conspiracy and the suspicion of it is the only guide In The Last Thing He Wanted Didion gets to the bottom of the mystery for once and a parable that had long since begun to seem world weary becomes unexpectedly gripping Cut loose from the scripted charade of the campaign beat Elena McMahon gets caught up in the machinations of one of those male dealers in dangerous merchandise her father Dick McMahon In fact completely against type she acquires an active role in the operation Another clean start for Elena this one is launched in a customary Didion daze Elena barely knows what she is doing when she buys a ticket to see her father in Miami though then it dawns on her that she wants to persuade him of something that he like Elena herself seems to be having trouble absorbing that her mother his ex wife is now dead When the old man gets sick soon after her arrival the daughter who missed her mother s funeral has a chance to make amends for a lifelong habit of aloofness Finally a narrator who makes a motive clear Filling in for her father on his latest deal she accompanies a shipment of arms in a Lockheed L 100 from Miami to somewhere in Costa Rica where she has been told she will receive payment of 1 million The million dollar score the million dollar pop the million dollar payday is the way Dick McMahon puts it to her in a febrile panic This is the major deal he has been awaiting all his life Of course that is only the beginning of the story and by the time you ve pieced this much together the plot has deepened to involve Treat Morrison United States ambassador at large and American policy toward the Nicaraguan contras Elena McMahon has been propelled into a demimonde where as the narrator puts it in a knowing pastiche of official jargon those trying to create a context for democracy are maybe getting their hands a little dirty in the process or just opting out letting the other guy call it This is the realm where history such as it is Didion believes gets made exclusively and at random by people like Dick McMahon and his much more ruthless higher ups Scrutinized from the ground which is where the narrator and Elena McMahon are this history is not as random as it might seem It s an eerie blend of careful planning and pure chance impromptu schemes and long running designs As she plays out the process of converting humanitarian resupply into lethal resupply Didion seems to allude as she did in her book Miami to the theory that CIA trained anti Castro Cubans have been at work in more than a few dubious American exploits While the ambassador on an island near Nicaragua prepares to bring in the Special Forces in case of a full scale effort shadier men with terrorist friends and lots of experience in international subterfuge are busy plotting with the other guy to make such an effort occur So is a slick congressional foreign policy aide college buddy to the sons of Cuban exiles and Central American ambassadors The plot happens to be an assassination in which Elena McMahon soon figures Didion in other words has written a fast paced story not just her usual series of fractured stories As the narrator explains Every moment could be seen to connect to every other moment every act to have logical if obscure consequences an unbroken narrative of vivid complexity It is not overarching moral or political meaning that Didion has suddenly discovered No historically significant struggle of good against evil has dawned in her America where a frontier ethos has long since declined into corruption and cynicism It is emotional meaning that she registers with a vivid simplicity and in the unlikeliest of places Didion has always been an expert on coolness numbness in hot climates This time at the heart of a carefully constructed thriller is a romance which is no less tragic in fact is more tragic for being oblique It is born of another of those fated yet fortuitous connections in Didion s disorienting world this one between two people Elena McMahon and Treat Morrison who were equally remote As she tries to decipher the convoluted course of her Central American adventure Elena McMahon not one of those who saw in a flash how every moment could connect discovers memory and imagination faculties that Didion s previous heroines did their best to deny She has exchanged a hollow life for a heightened life and has tried to comprehend all its turns get its possibilities People who do that the narrator observes are at heart storytellers Didion should know after three decades of weaving her intricate essays In The Last Thing He Wanted Didion the novelist finally gives in to the narrative urge
