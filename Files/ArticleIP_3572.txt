 Drawing upon her rich experience of life Prudence Prudie to her friends responds to questions about manners personal relations politics and other subjects Please send your questions for publication to prudence slate com Queries should not exceed 200 words in length Please indicate how you wish your letter to be signed preferably including your location Dear Prudence Tipping waiters is easy enough 15 percent for adequate service 20 percent if they give me the post dinner coffee free But what of those other services that require tipping A day in the life presents this newly minted Manhattanite with any number of palms to grease hands extending from disparately different uniforms and expecting some coinage commensurate with the services their owners provide They re cabbies coffee shop waiters and even official looking guys in old timey police hats turning the revolving doors for me Recently my girlfriend began forcing me to forego my usual visit to the 12 a cut barber in favor of her hair artiste friend Raoul who wants not only the customary 50 for the half inch he shears with such aesthetic sensibility from my scalp but also a tip And bartenders have their own ideas about what it s worth to me to have them put a lime sliver and a tiny straw in my martini The question Prudie as you may have guessed is How much dough should I be shelling out If I make the bartender mad the vodka tonics start tasting less like vodka and more like tonic And if Raoul doesn t get his just deserts I m stuck with a 50 bowl cut Lately I ve been purposely overtipping just to be safe At least I think I m overtipping Is five bucks extra enough for an eight block cab ride The American economy we re reminded frequently these days is becoming increasingly service oriented And we know what that means More tips Please help Tip o the Hat the sober guy at the bar with the bad hair Dear Tip Your letter was so charming that Prudie almost forgot it was about a problem It was also a reminder that whereas the Hands Out Brigade used to be an issue mostly when traveling it is now a fixture of everyday life Prudie for starters thinks a 5 tip too extravagant for an eight block ride unless of course the driver provided wonderful therapeutic advice Most people Prudie has observed tipping taxi drivers tack on a couple of bucks no matter what the meter As for people you deal with regularly like doormen since you re a Manhattanite grease their palms once every several encounters or else you ll go crazy and broke With people like the artiste Raoul remain generous as with the bartender because some consequences of withholding tips are more noticeable than others In other words pick your spots while at the same time remembering that many service people rely on tips to get by Prudie balancingly Dear Prudence In your advice column you recently offered this particular bit of advice Prudie finds the appellation Ms ridiculous and crosses it out whenever possible believing that single women are Miss and married ones are Mrs The nice thing about divorce is that then you get to choose between the two forms of address MY GOD What sort of ancient sexist claptrap is this I my mother my grandmothers and my great grandmothers haven t been fighting for equality for the past 150 years just to have this dubious woman sweep our work under the rug I do support a woman who likes to take her husband s name and who likes hearing a solid Mrs in front of her name But in return I expect her support in keeping the stoic inscrutable Ms in front of mine Aries Keck charter subscriber P S to the editors Do yourselves a favor lose Prudence She s both insulting and inane Dear Ms Aries Keck charter subscriber Prudie is pained by your opinion as well as by your wish to have her sacked As for a dubious woman that may not be the word you intended Prudie does think however that insulting and inane were what you meant to say Please know that I meant no assault on you your mother your grandmothers and your great grandmothers Prudie pacifically Dear Prudence I am a member of the Knights of the White Kamellia of the Ku Klux Klan I am planning a wedding for my sister Laura in Chicago and I would like to invite some of my fellow members to the wedding What should we wear Cynthia Comeau in Toledo Dear Cyn Well certainly not sheets Had your name and entire address not been included Prudie would certainly have thought your letter a prank Since no rational person would wish to have her name attached to admitted membership in such a shameful group however I will answer the question you pose in the spirit in which it is asked People should wear whatever attire is appropriate for the time of the wedding Whether or not it is black tie is indicated on the invitation Prudie disapprovingly Prudie well floundered Fortunately her readers leapt in to educate her The error that elicited more letters than Prudie cares to reveal though all were polite had to do with a quotation from Thoreau Prudie will let Fussbudget From Parma Heights a k a Neil Swartz speak for all who wrote to set Prudie straight Dear Prudence In Slate s Sept 11 edition in your answer to Hope you discuss the meaning of the relationship between trout in the milk and circumstantial evidence You explain the relationship by saying that if you find a trout in your milk it is evidence that it was put there deliberately Either I am dense and missing some subtlety or you don t understand the origin of the quip Some unscrupulous farmers or merchants back then made a practice of diluting the milk they sold with water thus being able to sell water at the price of milk Finding a trout in the milk thus refers to the inference that this is good circumstantial evidence that water was added to the milk since the water presumably came from a stream not that someone deliberately put a fish in the milk Fussbudget From Parma Heights
