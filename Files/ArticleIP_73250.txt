 Jabberwiney Whenever I read that a wine is lush and creamy elegant lovely graceful generous luscious or smooth I gag These days I gag a lot I ve had cheesecake that s lush and creamy Tequila and whiskey divide into smooth and rough My wife is elegant lovely graceful and even luscious But contrary to what you read on the back of some bottles these terms are meaningless when applied to wine The label on Castlewood Grove s chardonnay claims that its wine has a superb nose White Oak chardonnay boasts a mouth filling richness McDowell s syrah is ripe flavored and appealing for immediate enjoyment Turnbull s cabernet sauvignon has legendary concentration and elegance and Truchard s version of the same grape has great character and distinction Others describe tannins as polished grapes as rubenesque and fruit flavors as forward abundant and bright Most wine critics similarly enjoy gyring and gimbling in the wabe Take this sentence about Napa Wine Co s sauvignon blanc excerpted from Connoisseur s Guide to California Wine and printed on one of those little cards that wine merchants put in front of bottles From the first sniff one is impressed by the precise deep but never bombastic aromas in which green apple and crenshaw melon scents sic and by a creamy vanillin accent of oak and it is wonderfully balanced on the palate with ripe richness set off by firming acids and brightness Why do these people write this way Is this what happens when your job requires you to drink before noon Ann Noble a sensory scientist flavor chemist in the viticulture and enology department at the University of California Davis would ban from the wine tasting lexicon whole pages of words that she deems imprecise vague or hedonic her word What the hell is stylish Noble asks me Is a Volkswagen stylish Is a Humvee stylish She hates harmonious disdains fragrant and despises dense which she says doesn t mean exactly anything Winemakers she says favor fuzzy terms for a reason The labels are for marketing an image she says Having researched how people assess wine Noble now teaches scientific techniques to describe it precisely To this end she has developed a lovely impressive and wonderfully balanced tool which she calls the wine aroma wheel The words found on Noble s wine aroma wheel do not make me sick to my stomach Noble divides her wheel into three rings The inner ring has the 12 specific and analytical words that she believes best describe wine aromas fruity vegetative nutty caramelized woody earthy chemical pungent oxidized microbiological floral and spicy The middle ring subdivides these 12 words into 29 more specific categories and the outer ring offers 94 still more precise descriptions A sophisticated nose might thus distinguish a fruity wine as smelling like citrus berry tree fruit tropical fruit or dried fruit The outer ring ups the olfactory ante again dividing these terms into such exact descriptions as strawberry jam vs strawberry Noble s main aim is not to teach wine appreciation Rather she strives for a standard terminology that cuts through the babble of winespeak Her undergraduate course Sensory Evaluation of Wines is the first step in this process teaching students how to link aromas to wine It s a kindergarten of the nose she says Noble s Web page contains the nose training workout that she uses in Sensory Evaluation of Wines First students pour wine into a bunch of glasses and then drop a different physical standard into each one For white wines the physical standards include clove bell pepper brine from canned asparagus and apricot puree The point of making these physical standards is to educate your nose to recognize these aromas in an undoctored glass of wine Next the students pour samples from a variety of white wines From this point on anything goes Smell the wines first smell the standards start to see which terms describe which wine writes Noble When I told Noble that I was tackling the workout she replied Your nose is going to start to talk to you because the contrasts really stand out Following Noble s instructions I put a little cheap white wine into 15 glasses and then spiked each one with a different physical standard peach puree apricot puree brine of asparagus strawberry jam wet cardboard fresh strawberry pineapple juice soy sauce green olive melted butter coffee grinds fresh lime juice cloves vanilla and shaved almonds I identified the contents of each glass with a label stretching plastic wrap over the tops to prevent aromas from escaping Into another set of labeled glasses I poured three different chardonnays which I expected to have dramatically distinct attributes one gew rztraminer and one Riesling After putting all 20 of the glasses on the dining room table I enrolled my wife and 9 year old daughter in the kindergarten of the nose As Noble instructed we sniffed each standard smelled the untainted wines and then went back and forth between the standards and the wines My nose isn t talking to me my wife said Next each of us wrote down descriptions of each wine s scent but limited our vocabulary to words that matched the scents wafting from the physical standards Our daughter who has great character and legendary intelligence was a bit dense this evening and instead of describing the wines aromas offered blunt descriptors such as I don t like it Fair enough Interestingly my wife and I listed different combinations of aromas for each of the five white wines under assessment But when we spoke about the choices we made resniffing the 20 glasses before us we agreed on descriptions for four of the five wines As a final exercise we shifted the labels identifying the white wines to the bottoms of the glasses where we couldn t read them and then tried to guess which wine was which Save for the gew rztraminer which I thought smelled of wet cardboard and my wife had called clovelike we failed the test misidentifying four of the five wines Had I lost my wine aptitude or was my nose just fatigued An hour later I retook the test and scored 100 I had heard my nose loud and clear Although my anecdotal evidence suggests that Noble s method works I don t expect winemakers to begin printing labels that brag about a gew rztraminer s wet cardboard finish The French will continue to eschew back labels altogether and the more conscientious American vintners will limit the label lingo to useful information about the winery s location the soil in which the grapes were grown and the climate And make no mistake a winery need not cram a label with absurd adjectives to sell a wine Recently I bought a bottle of Napa s Schuetz Oles on the strength of its label alone Planted in the early 1960s above Calistoga on a rattlesnake infested rocky hillside this Petit Sirah produces a dangerously red wine the label reads BE PREPARED DO NOT DRINK IF WEARING WHITE CLOTHING Now that s stylish
