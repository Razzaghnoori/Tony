 Background Taste receptor cells are specialized epithelial cells which are organized into discrete endorgans called taste buds Typical taste buds contain 50 100 polarized taste cells which extend from the basal lamina to the taste pore where apical microvilli protrude into the oral cavity The basolateral membrane forms chemical synapses with primary gustatory neurons Fig 1A In mammals lingual taste buds are housed in connective tissue structures called papillae Fungiform papillae are located on the anterior two thirds of the tongue and typically contain 1 2 taste buds each Vallate and foliate papillae are found on the posterior tongue and house several hundred taste buds each Taste transduction begins when sapid stimuli interact with the apical membrane of taste cells usually resulting in taste cell depolarization calcium influx and transmitter release onto gustatory afferent neurons Simple stimuli such as salts and acids depolarize taste cells by direct interaction with apical ion channels In contrast complex stimuli such as sugars amino acids and most bitter compounds bind to G protein coupled receptors initiating intracellular signaling cascades that culminate in Ca 2 influx or release of Ca 2 from intracellular stores 1 2 3 Inositol 1 4 5 trisphosphate IP 3 is an important second messenger in both bitter and sweet taste transduction In both pathways activation of taste receptors stimulates a G protein coupled cascade resulting in activation of phospholipase C PLC which cleaves phosphoinositol bisphosphate PIP 2 to produce the second messengers IP 3 and diacylglycerol DAG The soluble messenger IP 3 binds to receptors located on calcium store membranes causing release of calcium into the cytosol while DAG remains in the membrane where it can activate downstream effectors While little is known about the role of IP 3 in sweet taste transduction considerable data indicate that IP 3 plays an important role in bitter transduction The first evidence for the involvement of IP 3 in bitter transduction was obtained by Akabas et al 4 who used Ca 2 imaging to show that the bitter stimulus denatonium causes release of Ca 2 from intracellular stores More recently biochemical measurements have shown that several bitter compounds elevate IP 3 in taste tissue 5 6 7 8 Other studies however suggested that a decrease in cAMP rather than an increase in IP 3 mediated bitter transduction In 1992 a chemosensory specific G protein gustducin was identified in a subset of taste cells 9 Alpha gustducin which is closely related to the rod and cone transducins activates PDE to reduce intracellular levels of cAMP 13 Evidence for gustducin s role in bitter taste came from knockout studies in which a targeted deletion of gustducin resulted in mice with a reduced sensitivity for bitter compounds 10 More recently a variety of bitter compounds have been shown to activate gustducin in biochemical assays 11 12 causing a decrease in intracellular cAMP levels via activation of PDE 13 It is now known that individual bitter receptors modulate both the IP 3 and cAMP pathways Fig 1B Bitter compounds bind to a family of G protein coupled receptors called the T2R 14 15 or TRB 16 receptors which activate a heterotrimeric G protein consisting of gustducin and a complex containing 3 17 and 13 8 Alpha gustducin activates PDE to decrease intracellular levels of cAMP 13 while its partners stimulate PLC 2 to produce IP 3 and DAG 18 Although it is clear that IP 3 binds to receptors located on intracellular Ca 2 stores the specific identity of IP 3 receptors in taste cells is not known There are at least 3 known isotypes of IP 3 receptors encoded by different genes 19 Each protein product is about 300 Kda Four subunits assemble to form a functional channel Both homomultimeres and heteromultimeres have been reported 19 The N terminus of each subunit houses the IP 3 binding domain while the C terminus anchors the protein to the membrane is involved in the formation of the tetrameric protein and forms the Ca 2 pore region The general structure of each isoform is similar however they differ in primary sequence distribution regulation and IP 3 affinity 19 In this study we used immunocytochemical methods to determine which IP 3 R isoform is expressed in taste cells and to examine the expression patterns of IP 3 receptors relative to other proteins known to be important for taste transduction We report that the Type III IP 3 receptor is the dominant isotype expressed in rodent taste cells and that it is primarily found in the same subset of taste cells as other known signaling components of bitter transduction A preliminary account of this work was published in abstract form 20 Results IP 3Receptor Isotypes Forty micron thick rat sections containing circumvallate papillae were exposed to either anti IP 3 R1 anti IP 3 R2 or anti IP 3 R3 antibodies and appropriate secondary antibodies Laser scanning confocal microscopy of the resultant sections was used to examine the distribution of IP 3 receptor immunoreactivity in rat circumvallate taste buds Labeling for IP 3 R1 and IP 3 R2 was negligible Figs 2A B In contrast immunoreactivity to IP 3 R3 was robust and present in a large subset of taste cells Fig 2C Generally immunoreactivity extended throughout the cytoplasm of labeled cells Immunoreactivity was found only in taste buds and was not present in the lingual epithelium surrounding taste buds Primarily intragemmal taste cells were labeled proliferative basal cells of the taste buds did not appear to be labeled In addition gustatory nerve fibers did not appear to be labeled Controls in which the primary antibody was omitted showed no specific labeling Fig 2D Co expression of IP 3R3 with known bitter signaling components To determine if IP 3 R3 could be involved in bitter taste transduction we performed double label immunocytochemistry with antibodies to IP 3 R3 and components of the bitter signaling pathway For most experiments mouse as well as rat tissues were examined Exposure of tissue to antibodies against gustducin and IP 3 R3 showed that all gustducin immunoreactive IR cells were also immunoreactive for IP 3 R3 however a subset of IP 3 R3 IR taste cells lacked gustducin IR Fig 3 Further analysis with antibodies to other signaling components of the bitter transduction pathway are shown in Figs 4 5 Immunoreactivity for PLC 2 and IP 3 R3 showed nearly complete coincidence of labeling Fig 4 Immunoreactivity for PLC 2 extended throughout the cytoplasm as did immunoreactivity for IP 3 R3 However some taste cells appeared to differ in the degree of labeling for each antibody with some cells showing more intense label for IP 3 R3 and others for PLC 2 We also compared IP 3 R3 IR with 13 IR in rat and mouse circumvallate taste buds As shown in Fig 5 nearly complete co localization was again observed for both antigens Results from PLC 2 and 13 double label experiments were similar for mouse and rat taste buds Taken together these immunocytochemical data indicate that IP 3 R3 is the predominant isoform of IP 3 receptor expressed in taste cells and that it is found in the same subset of taste cells as other components known to be involved with bitter taste transduction Discussion IP 3 R3 is heavily expressed in a large subset of vallate taste cells of both mouse and rat suggesting that IP 3 R3 plays a similar role in both species IP 3 R3 appears to be located throughout the cytoplasm of taste cells consistent with its expected location on the smooth endoplasmic membrane 21 In other cells IP 3 receptors have also been found on the plasma membrane 19 but because of heavy cytoplasmic labeling we were unable to resolve whether it was also located on the plasma membrane One caveat is that antigen retrieval was necessary to observe IP 3 R3 labeling However using this method with gustducin PLC 2 and 13 antibodies did not alter their immunoreactivities similar results were obtained with and without antigen retrieval Thus we do not believe that antigen retrieval compromised our interpretation of the results Taste cells expressing IP 3 R3 have an elongate bipolar morphology suggestive of Type II taste cells 22 Indeed a subset of the IP 3 R3 immunoreactive taste cells is also immunoreactive for gustducin which has been identified exclusively in Type II cells 23 However whether IP 3 R3 is expressed exclusively in Type II cells awaits further investigation It is noteworthy that a subset of taste cells does not express IP 3 receptors This raises the question as to whether these cells have intracellular Ca 2 release mechanisms Ryanodine receptors also mediate release of Ca 2 from intracellular stores however a previous study showed no effect of ryanodine on bitter taste responses in Necturus taste cells 24 IP 3 R3 immunoreactivity was expressed in the same subset of taste cells as PLC 2 and 13 and by inference from other data 3 8 Antibodies against these proteins have been shown to inhibit IP 3 formation to bitter compounds in taste cells 8 17 18 suggesting that they are important components of the bitter stimulated IP 3 pathway It is of interest that only a subset of IP 3 R3 IR cells express gustducin a G protein known to be involved with bitter transduction These data suggest that alpha subunit s in addition to gustducin must be involved with the IP 3 signaling pathway in gustducin negative cells Several G protein alpha subunits have been identified in taste cells and are potential candidates for this role These include transducin 25 G i 2 G i 3 G s 26 and G 15 and G q 27 Further experiments will be required to identify the additional alpha subunits that couple to this pathway and the receptors that activate these G proteins In addition to its role in bitter transduction IP 3 is involved in the transduction of artificial sweeteners 28 Interestingly mice lacking gustducin are compromised in the detection of sweet compounds as well as bitter compounds suggesting that sweet receptors may also couple to gustducin 10 Approximately two thirds of the gustducin positive vallate taste cells express T2R TRB receptors 15 It is possible that the remaining gustducin positive vallate taste cells express receptors for synthetic sweeteners and that they couple to the IP 3 signaling pathway Thus IP 3 R3 may be involved with sweet as well as bitter taste transduction IP 3 R3 is widely expressed in cells in a variety of tissues including adult pancreatic islets kidney gastrointestinal tract salivary glands and brain 29 30 Many of these cell types including taste cells are polarized where Ca 2 signals are initiated on the apical membrane and must propagate long intracellular distances IP 3 R3 is particularly well suited for this function since it is the only IP 3 receptor isotype that is not inhibited at high Ca 2 concentrations 31 In fact under certain conditions Ca 2 can stimulate IP 3 R3 making it a likely candidate for participation in the propagation of Ca 2 oscillations In taste cells Ca 2 oscillations have been observed in response to bitter stimuli T Ogura and S C Kinnamon unpub observations and it s likely that IP 3 R3 participates in these Ca 2 oscillations Another interesting feature of IP 3 R3 is that cAMP dependent phosphorylation can inhibit its activity in pancreatic acinar cells 32 33 In these cells cAMP dependent phosphorylation decreases Ca 2 release from intracellular stores and slows the frequency of Ca 2 oscillations These data suggest a possible role for gustducin in bitter taste transduction Specifically activation of gustducin which decreases intracellular cAMP by activation of PDE 11 may lead to a decrease in the cAMP dependent phosphorylation of IP 3 R3 This would disrupt the negative control of the receptor and potentiate the Ca 2 response Interestingly G i 2 another alpha subunit heavily expressed in taste cells 26 also functions to decrease intracellular levels of cAMP and may lead to regulation of IP 3 R3 Further experiments will be necessary to clarify the role of these alpha subunits in regulation of the IP 3 pathway in taste cells Conclusions The principal finding in this study is the identification of IP 3 R3 as the dominant isoform of the IP 3 receptor in taste cells IP 3 has been shown to be an important second messenger in both bitter and sweet taste transduction and IP 3 R3 likely mediates the Ca 2 release from intracellular stores in response to IP 3 In bitter taste transduction many signaling components have been identified and IP 3 R3 is co expressed in the same taste cells Fig 6 Bitter stimuli bind to T2R TRB taste receptors coupled to a heterotrimeric G protein complex consisting of gustducin and its partners 3 and 13 Alpha gustducin activates PDE causing decreases in intracellular cAMP while its partners stimulate PLC 2 to produce IP 3 and DAG IP 3 subsequently binds to IP 3 R3 causing increases in cytosolic Ca 2 due to release from intracellular stores Fig 1B The unique properties of IP 3 R3 including its regulation by Ca 2 and cAMP dependent kinases are consistent with known characteristics of bitter signaling in taste cells Materials and Methods Animals Adult male Sprague Dawley Rats
