 Richard Nixon Is Still Dead This week 25 years after Richard Nixon resigned the presidency the conventional wisdom seems to hold that his once abysmal reputation has been largely rehabilitated It s a familiar story On Aug 9 1974 Nixon leaves Washington with a 24 percent public approval rating facing a possible prison sentence by Aug 9 1999 he has been transformed into a foreign policy visionary a domestic policy liberal and no worse a scoundrel than lots of other presidents What had seemed impossible in the summer of 1974 had happened his biographer Stephen Ambrose wrote 10 years ago already Nixon was respectable even honored certainly admired The historical irony is delicious and spurious Pundits and historians talk as if Nixon has already been rehabilitated and that s flat wrong To be sure there are favorable and critical views of him simple and complex ones But the most vivid and enduring remains the image of Nixon as our national political villain Tricky Dick lives on Even in his early career Nixon had a reputation as a comeback artist In 1952 he salvaged his spot as Dwight Eisenhower s running mate with the famous Checkers speech He did it again when he won the presidency in 1968 six years after ABC aired The Political Obituary of Richard Nixon And we ve been hearing about Nixon s latest rehabilitation practically since the resignation itself Yet too often it has turned out to be all hype and little substance Take his prime time TV interview with David Frost in 1977 Nixon believed that Frost s softball questions would allow him to tell the public his side of the Watergate story for the first time While the broadcast drew some 45 million viewers the same as an episode of the top rated Happy Days Nixon won few converts after the show more people lowered their opinions of him than raised them He remained Newsweek wrote in a typical review careless of the record heedless of the proper limits of power unable to plead guilty to anything much worse than screwing up and coming no closer in history to that final absolution in history he seeks Nine years later though it was Newsweek s turn to pronounce a return to respectability splashing Nixon s photo on the cover with a six page article a three page interview and a dozen photographs inside The former president the article noted had advised President Reagan written several books and made Rolling Stone s list of Who s Hot But again what the large print gave the fine print took away Those who took the time to read the article learned that Nixon s support came mostly from Republican circles and that die hard critics scoffed at his alleged foreign policy expertise An accompanying poll found that six in 10 Americans wished him to remain in exile from public life With the cover line He s Back the magazine s editors unwittingly helped create the very phenomenon they were supposedly just observing In the years following various episodes served as occasions for one pundit or another to declare Nixon s reputation restored Nixon would visit Capitol Hill or criticize George Bush s Russia policy in a strategically leaked memo or meet with President Clinton each time he was pronounced rehabilitated even as polls showed that he remained unpopular His death on April 18 1994 brought a new zenith of revisionism an outpouring of praise from President Clinton and other public figures Television and radio networks aired a relentless parade of fond reminiscences about Nixon news anchors drummed home the now familiar lines about his comeback again creating the fact they were ostensibly just reporting and the eulogies at the funeral itself never once mentioned Watergate Yet even this final rebound proved illusory No sooner had the tributes subsided than an equally vociferous chorus spoke up to denounce the media s kid gloves treatment Many of the nation s most esteemed political writers including Russell Baker David Halberstam and Garry Wills chastised their peers for soft soaping Nixon s life in death The publication of The Haldeman Diaries a month later with its reminders of Nixon s scheming sinister side confirmed that Watergate would hardly be forgotten soon Those proclaiming Nixon s return miss the subtext of their own proclamations Implicit and sometimes explicit in every story about Nixon s comeback has been the underlying story of his calculated efforts to come back He authored foreign policy books wined and dined journalists and waged court battles for control of the White House tapes These stories don t dwell on any glorious new achievements on Nixon s part Rather they underscore his campaign for rehabilitation and the public s alleged willingness to grant it In his book The Image historian Daniel Boorstin coined the term pseudo event to describe events that have no intrinsic news value but get treated as if they do Nixon s comeback is a classic pseudo event erected almost entirely on self fulfilling punditry a series of interviews a magazine cover a cascade of adoring eulogies This doesn t mean that no one is rethinking Nixon s achievements He continues to keep historians busy I m writing a book about him myself And most of the recent major Nixon books by Herbert Parmet Jonathan Aitken Joan Hoff Tom Wicker and this month Irwin Gellman have been quite sympathetic Yet they haven t made much of a dent in his overall reputation among scholars In the latest ranking of presidents by professional historians conducted by Arthur Schlesinger Jr admittedly no Nixon fan RN finished in the bottom tier alongside Andrew Johnson Ulysses Grant Warren Harding and Herbert Hoover Twenty of 32 historians surveyed judged Nixon s presidency a failure none called it great Besides even more telling than the views of academics are the images of Nixon in popular culture where he remains resentful paranoid and ruthlessly power hungry On The Simpsons for example Nixon has appeared in caricature at least 20 times according to the Simpsons Archive Web site He s almost always portrayed as the dark suspicious figure circa 1974 On various episodes he is a member along with Bluebeard and the Grim Reaper of the Jury of the Damned he takes part in a snake bludgeoning in a scandal exposed by a Bob Woodward book his enemies list is used for dastardly purposes even his dog Checkers is said to be bound for hell Nor do Hollywood movies show any sign of revising Nixon s image In 1995 Oliver Stone s Nixon gave us the familiar shadowy president emphasizing his most savage and conspiratorial qualities He s the darkness reaching out for the darkness Howard Hunt tells John Dean in the film Look at the landscape of his life and you ll see a boneyard The recently released Dick portrays the president as Stephen Holden wrote in the New York Times with his hunched shoulders darting paranoid gaze and crocodile grimace the quivering skulking embodiment of a single word guilty For now that remains the most vivid and pervasive image of Richard Nixon in the American mind And it s not likely to fade any time soon
