 Unclogging House Guests Please send your questions for publication to prudence slate com Dear Prudence Last weekend a friend and her husband came to visit me for a few days This is a friend I have known for 25 years and although we ve lived in different cities for the last 23 years we ve always kept in touch and stayed fairly close We had a great weekend saw the sights of the city ate out etc But the day after they left for home I found some damage had been done that they hadn t told me about The turntable in the microwave was chipped and the toilet in their bathroom was clogged Neither of these things in and of themselves bothers me What does bother me is that this lifelong friend didn t have the courtesy to let me know what had happened Should I just let these things go in the name of preserving the friendship If not what are my options C S Dear C The chums took the easy way out It was not classy or first rate but it saved them what they perceived to be embarrassment Avoidance is a rather common behavior some people decide it s easier to skitter away than to fess up Granted it s left footed social behavior Prudie is not going to argue with you there Your options however depend on how strongly you feel about letting them know you know If you just can t stand to let it ride then write a non accusatory note saying you were sad they didn t feel close enough to have mentioned the microwave or the sluggish toilet To lighten it up you could add that all the repairs have been made and you look forward to their return visit Think about it for a few days then decide how you want to play it Prudie tactfully Dear Prudence A year ago my husband s cousin and his wife moved in with us They were relocating from another state and needed a place to live for a few months while they got to know the area and found jobs and a place to live They agreed to pay half the rent and attendant bills Well they re still with us and they never pay anything on time They seem to think that junk food qualifies as their half of the groceries My husband and I keep the house supplied with good food but we can t afford to support two grown adults We also cannot stand their dog It s not housebroken and it s full grown We have made subtle hints and mentioned that they need to start looking for their own place But they aren t catching on How do we tell them to get out of our house without causing family problems We ve always been close and don t want to lose the friendship They are using us and I need help with this T M Dear T The visitors are indeed using you but you ve permitted it Family problems seem a small price to pay for evicting two junk food eating freeloaders with a dog that uses your house as a fire hydrant Subtle hints won t cut it guys You ve got to insist that the temporary situation now at 12 months and counting has run its course They have overstayed their welcome and must be told to leave Unless the name of your house is Ritz Carlton bag the subtle approach and give them a deadline for their departure And do ask for a settling of accounts as per the original agreement Prudie is sputtering on your behalf and wishes you tons of luck Prudie insistently Dear Prudie How long is a fair amount of time to date someone before getting engaged My girlfriend the love of my life for the last five years recently broke up with me because she felt our relationship had gone on too long without any sign of future commitment I always intended to marry her and always reminded her of this when the topic came up She feels that if I truly loved her I would take her now before anyone else did Since we are both only 24 years old I felt we shouldn t rush things since we have the rest of our lives to be together What do you think Left Long Before the Altar Dear Left Ah yes which came first the chicken or the engagement ring Five years with the love of your life whom you ve always planned to marry suggests that this would not be a rush job Prudie thinks a fair amount of time to date someone before getting engaged would be oh five years So hop to it and get her back with whatever kind of engagement ring you can afford Prudie romantically Dear Prudence I just bought a seersucker suit and was wondering if you could give me some fashion tips on the types of shoes ties shirts and belts I should wear with it Hot in Florida Dear Hot You obviously have Prudie confused with some other columnist but just so it shouldn t be wasted bandwidth by all means wear any shoes ties shirts and belts that don t clash with the suit Prudie nattily Dear Prudence I am 45 years old and a former accomplished gymnast in Texas During my years as a devoted gymnast I experienced several damaging landings and falls during practice Multiple surgeries have left me somewhat ambulatory impaired and unable to wear skirts dresses with high heels I am short in stature wear a brace on my right lower leg and have four stainless steel implants in my right ankle Wearing a skirt or dress without pumps looks pathetic on me and people tend to stare Well designed pantsuits and formal pant wear allow me to attend professional and social functions without the appearance of an obvious handicap My question Why do so many people take offense at my wearing pants to the many functions I must attend Thanks Female Athlete Dear Fem Anyone who believes women wearing pants is incorrect is antediluvian Even the stuffy dining rooms in Boston s most WASPy clubs allow them Plus Katharine Hepburn and Prudie have been wearing them for years so you are in good company Prudie stylishly
