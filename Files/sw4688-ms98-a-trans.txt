            well we in in in our family have been pretty remiss in trying to uh you know keep track of uh daily finances uh the uh way way back what twelve years ago or something when i got my first computer i did what everybody else does which is to put the whole family budget on the machine and put checks and you know checkbooks and all those kind of thing and we kept that going for about a month and it became so onerous that we gave up on it   umhum that sounds about right   you know so uh the only thing were you know that we do now is uh i keep a a little spreadsheet of uh what i call the net worth calculation which is just the the present value of various kinds of investments and so forth uh and i only update that oh i dont know maybe once every quarter or so every three months just basically when the statements come in   umhum   you know just to see whether or not were falling you know getting ahead falling behind or staying staying even or what   right   um thats really about you know the extent of uh of the kind of uh financial score keeping that were doing   uh       well its kind of difficult for me because right now um like most teachers im laid off   hm oh dear thats terrible   and  so um i spend most you know i substitute a lot   uhhuh   so its a lot its very hard on a nonfixed income because i dont know how many days im going to be called in and whether i am or not to try to keep track of finances   uhhuh   and but i know uh how much i have to bring in a month  and thats about it thats about as far as we go and then anything extra is you know more or less split up between all of us   uhhuh   and just thrown in the kitty more or less for a rainy day   oh i see are you are you married are you living with a bunch of with with people youre sharing expenses   um no im a single mother i have three children   oh i see uhhuh   so uh right now were on we get from you know aid from the state at this point because theres no other way to do it and my exhusband just sort of took off and doesnt pay child support   oh dear   so right now i know what im getting from the state and um i have to balance more or less what i get from the state with my bills and um you know try to work as many days as possible   umhum   any time they call me in but i still have to figure out if i work too many days then i lose all my state aid and if i dont work enough days then i dont get enough to meet the bills and its like a juggling act every single month   umhum   like this week ive been just holding my breath and hoping theyll call me in but they probably wont because next week the kids have school vacation   i see   so you know the four days before they only have a four day week and they usually dont need subs because everybodys pretty good about coming in   uhhuh i oh i see     they dont like to be absent before a vacation   oh sure   but were shopping around as far as well im shopping around as far as trying to get uh thats why im doing this to get some extra money   uhhuh   and um getting pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts my kids are in Boy Scouts so trying to get pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts because every penny i bring in is ten percent to me so  it sort of helps defray the costs a little bit but you know we do a lot of robbing Peter to pay Paul i guess were in the situation that a lot of Americans you know middle class Americans are in   uhhuh yeah youre the first you know uh my next door neighbor just lost his job in a you know one of these uh his company went broke   oh my Lord   i mean went you know bankrupt actually it was a subsidiary of a of an outfit called US Shoe or something  it was a computer subsidiary i dont know what a shoe companys doing running a computer company   really   but uh you know they just they just folded it up and um um told him to that they took the top management and gave them jobs   umhum   with the with the corporate uh at the corporate front office and everybody else was sent packing   ah   uh hang on one second ive got   sure          um somebody somebody was knocking on my door here um it sounds like in a certain sense at least at the present stage i mean it sounds sounds terrible to say but at the present stage you probably are even more in the market for a a budgetary thing than than than most people probably are might be terms of keeping keeping score of input and output   right umhum definitely   do you have a computer do you have a computer at home or   uh yes we do and we try to you know i keep track of every penny and more or less enter it in you know every single day im at the computer   uhhuh uhhuh i see   and its like okay what do we have left what do we have to pay what have we paid this month what hasnt come in yet you know     umhum yeah have you do you use a standard uh a standard spreadsheet or i mean
