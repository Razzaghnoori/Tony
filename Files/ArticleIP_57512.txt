 A Novel Predicament Please send your questions for publication to prudence slate com Dear Prudence An old and trusted friend Jane who lives in Los Angeles and works in television suggested I send her the manuscript of a novel I wrote because she had a friend who knows an agent who was looking for works by women about women I sent the manuscript and waited for a response Jane reported to me that her friend loved the book Months passed without further information This week Jane told me that the woman she gave my book to turns out to be a psycho and she doubts whether this woman even had an agent in mind when she requested my manuscript She apparently had a crush on Jane who says she has since cut off all contact with her My problem is that I want my manuscript back and while Jane apologized profusely for the way things went she refuses to retrieve it for me saying that the woman would misconstrue this as an overture I hesitate to contact the woman myself because I don t want to get in the middle of a weird situation I also get the impression that Jane thinks that her being upset supersedes any responsibility she has for getting my book back Bruised and Confused in the Big Apple Dear Bruise Guess what You ve been had Ditto for Jane As for getting your manuscript back it s pretty clear that Jane isn t going to ask and you don t want to so let s try Prudie s standby a lawyer letter Surely you have a friend who is an attorney who would write a formal letter to Psycho With a Crush requesting the return of the manuscript That way Psycho WAC will not have any information about how to reach you merely the address of a law firm Even nut cases usually pay attention to letters from lawyers This is your best shot Whether you choose to continue your friendship with Jane or not is another issue but Prudie wonders why you would let your one and only copy of a manuscript out of your hands Let s hope this experience has advanced your education from Psycho to Kinko Prudie hopefully Dear Pru This is kind of a different problem from what I ve seen in your column but here goes I am not yet 30 and continue to move up in my rather buttoned up company where most of the male executives are married to shall we say plain women The girl I am seeing now like the one before her has and this isn t politically correct a major pair of hooters You might say this is my type She is very well spoken has a good job and is not a bimbo by any stretch of the imagination She just has these well anyway they re attention getting What is the best way to deal with this Junior Exec Dear Junior You and your breasted American girlfriend to be politically correct need not feel there is anything wrong with her centerfold figure Prudie would suggest however since you are on your way up the corporate ladder in a buttoned up industry that your ladyfriend not dress them up so that undue attention is directed their way Conservative clothing at business related functions ought to put you both at ease Prudie modestly Prudie When a person in the process of seeking your advice reveals rather personal foibles should you not be alerted to the probability that such a person is quite apt to be a whacko weirdo misfit or plain loser Then again such a person could be a bright Yale student who is demonstrably adept at putting on advice columnists I guess my question really is How can you tell whether a letter is sincere or fraudulent R E L Shelbume Vt Dear R E You can t tell though some things have the ring of truth and others don t Let s call it instinct Prudie feels sure you would agree that whackos weirdoes misfits or losers have need of advice as do bright Yale students So what s the problem Prudie problematically Dear Prudence I need to address your answer to the grocery grazer question should have spoken to the store manager about the stealing We are trained to handle cases of this sort in the following way We would put a person within sight of the customer who s stealing without actually confronting her If she hesitates for anything we would then ask her if she needed any help again letting her know she is being watched without accusing her of anything Also the security cameras would be watching the whole time as well This procedure would be repeated whenever she is in the store This is designed to make her a little uncomfortable about stealing from us while at the same time keeping a paying customer in the store We cannot take any action without seeing the stealing ourselves If we didn t do it this way we would have more lawsuits than we could handle and lose a bunch of customers besides Neither of these things is good for business Thank you for listening to me Sincerely W D W Dear W D Prudie and countless readers who had something to say about this thank you for the information about how store people want to deal with this problem Many people wrote to say they believe the woman should have been reported and a few pointed out the hygiene aspect that scoops are there for a reason hands carry germs If enough customers become familiar with the way stores deal with grocery grazers perhaps these pilferers can be encouraged to cut it out Prudie gratefully
