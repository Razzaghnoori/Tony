 Background High affinity humoral immune responses to most protein antigens require cognate interactions between antigen specific T and B cells Antigen specific T cells encounter antigen presented by dendritic cells that migrate to the paracortical regions of draining lymph nodes after initial antigen contact 1 Only dendritic cells have the capacity to induce activation in resting peripheral T cells 2 3 Once activated differentiated T helper cells contact antigen specific B cells and provide signals for B cell differentiation via CD154 CD40 interactions as well as by the production of cytokines 4 5 6 Consistent with this general understanding of the induction of antibody responses to protein immunogens good antibody responses to synthetic peptide epitope constructs have been shown to depend on the presence orientation and multiplicity of the T cell epitope in the construct 7 8 9 10 11 As a confirmation of this finding with synthetic epitope constructs most protein immunogens studied to date contain multiple T cell epitopes for example 12 13 T helper epitopes have become common components of synthetic vaccine constructs due to their ability to provide immunological help for both humoral and cell mediated responses 11 14 15 16 T cell epitopes that can induce helper activity by binding to a wide range of HLA DR alleles have been developed by a number of investigators using various antigen systems 17 18 19 T cell epitopes that have the property of binding across a wide range of HLA DR haplotypes are necessary for the construction of synthetic vaccines that would be useful in the human population as a whole DNA and peptide based vaccines have become popular due to the comparative ease of construction the circumvention of potential safety issues around attenuated organisms and for their potentially enhanced immunogenicity compared to heat killed and subunit vaccines 20 21 22 DNA vaccines have the added attraction of efficiently priming both humoral and cytotoxic cell responses a property largely lacking in subunit and attenuated organism vaccines Priming of cytotoxic cell responses is necessary for the design of therapeutic cancer vaccines as well as for viral vaccines Multiple antigen peptide vaccines can also be designed to contain T and B epitope regions from numerous protein antigens derived from a complex infectious agent which could therefore confer broad protection without the potential dangers of an attenuated whole organism vaccine 16 However it is of note that occasionally a well designed peptide based vaccine can elicit strong antibody responses to the synthetic immunogen that do not confer protection from the parasite to which they were originally designed 23 This may be due to either the induction of an inappropriate antibody isotype in the mouse strain used or to an inadequate overall response While subunit vaccines have their inherent shortcomings they carry the added benefit of potentially inducing complex antibody responses to multiple sites on the whole protein immunogen Subunit vaccines are of interest in the prevention of parasite infection 24 and for a variety of infectious diseases 25 An ideal subunit vaccine for the induction of protective antibody responses would be a protein from the disease causing organism that was minimally modified from its original structure to retain a variety of potential B cell epitopes In addition the modified subunit vaccine would be designed to be highly immunogenic by the addition of promiscuous T cell epitopes To this end we have characterized the immune response of partially outbred Hartley strain guinea pigs to two related bacterial proteases The two bacterial enzymes studied represent important industrial enzymes used in a number of applications including serving as an additive for laundry products and animal feed processing These enzymes have been well characterized as to their activity and specificity by us and by others 26 27 While these two proteins are approximately 60 homologous at the amino acid sequence 26 one of the proteases was significantly less immunogenic than the other Reduced immunogenicity was characterized as significantly lower titers of antigen specific IgG when animals were immunized with the same amount of the enzymes We determined the T cell epitopes in both of the proteases using 15 mer peptides and splenocytes from immunized animals In order to be classified as an epitope the average proliferative response to a peptide had to reach a stimulation index of 3 0 Two regions met our criteria as epitopes in the immunogenic protease We tested a total of 20 guinea pigs and found no epitope regions in the less immunogenic protease A sequence comparison of the enzymes in the T cell epitope regions revealed that a single amino acid change could confer a T cell epitope onto the less immunogenic protease This variant was constructed and was found to be a functional and stable protease Immunization of Hartley strain guinea pigs showed that this single amino acid change created a T cell epitope where there was no detectable epitope before and the presence of this epitope correlates with an improved immunogenicity in the variant Finally we show that the variant induces broadly cross reactive IgG antibodies and that priming of animals with the variant protein results in higher titers of antigen specific antibody upon subsequent immunization with the parent enzyme Results IgG antibody titers from B lentussubtilisin and BPN Y217L guinea pig immunizations Female Hartley strain guinea pigs were immunized with two related bacterial proteases B lentus subtilisin and BPN Y217L These two bacterial enzymes share 60 homology at the amino acid level They are also comparable in their proteolytic activity and specificity 26 27 Animals were immunized every two weeks with a 20 ug dose of enzyme in adjuvant Serum samples were drawn prior to each immunization over a ten week period Serum samples were tested for antigen specific IgG antibodies by ELISA Titers were calculated for each animal s antibody response Averages for four animals are presented in Figure 1 The titers over time are presented as serum dilution B and as Log2 titers A Immunization with B lentus subtilisin induced higher titers of antigen specific IgG than BPN Y217L after 4 weeks The response to B lentus subtilisin reached maximal levels by about 6 weeks At the 6 to 10 week time points titers leveled off and the average titers induced by immunizations with B lentus subtilisin were about 10 fold higher than BPN Y217L B lentus subtilisin remained more immunogenic at doses from 1 to 20 g not shown Overall maximum titer levels vary but the difference in immunogenicity between B lentus subtilisin and BPN Y217L has been seen in three separate guinea pig studies This difference in immunogenicity has been noted by others using an intratracheal method of immunization 28 29 T cell epitope mapping of B lentussubtilisin and BPN Y217L Splenocytes from immunized guinea pigs were used to determine the position of T cell epitopes in B lentus subtilisin and BPN Y217L 10 animals were tested for each immunogen 15 mer peptides offset by 3 amino acids were used at 5 M and were tested at least in duplicate for each immunized animal Peptides eliciting a 3 fold or higher average proliferative response over the background response were considered T cell epitopes These epitopes are shown in bold in Figure 2 Two T cell epitopes were found in 5 of the 10 guinea pigs immunized with B lentus subtilisin but none meeting the criteria of a three fold increase in proliferation over the background were found in the 10 animals immunized with BPN Y217L in this experiment p 0 01 non parametric Student t test Notably the first B lentus subtilisin epitope has an analogous region in BPN Y217L only the first amino acid is different It was hypothesized that if the first valine in the analogous BPN Y217L sequence was changed to an isoleucine a T cell epitope analogous to the one found in B lentus subtilisin would be created A modified BPN Y217L V72I enzyme GP002 was prepared with this single amino acid change Figure 3 Enzyme activity and stability Enzymatic activity has been implicated as a source of the allergenic property of Der p1 the major dust mite allergen 30 31 32 In order to account for this variable the enzymatic activity of the variant protease GP002 was compared BPN Y217L Proteolytic activity was determined in a standard sAAPF hydrolysis assay The activity of GP002 was found to be approximately 80 of the parent BPN Y217L enzyme Figure 4 Another factor that could influence the immunogenicity of a proteolytic enzyme is the relative stability of the protease If the protease remains active for a longer period of time any effects of the activity would be comparatively magnified The half lives of both enzymes were tested at 37 C over a 74 hour time period to assess relative stability The assay was performed at physiologic pH 7 3 At various time points the proteolytic activity remaining in the samples were tested At 37 degrees and a pH of 7 3 BPN Y217L has a half life fifty five hours longer than GP002 These results indicate that the two enzymes have comparable stability and efficacy Comparable enzymatic activity and stability suggest that the variant molecule has a similar tertiary configuration as the parent T cell epitope mapping BPN Y217L versus GP002 Hartley strain guinea pigs were immunized with 5 g per dose of either BPN Y217L or GP002 every two weeks After 6 weeks epitope mapping was performed as described using the BPN Y217L 15 mer PepSet and splenocytes from the primed animals Figure 5 In addition proliferative responses to the intact inactivated BPN Y217L enzyme were tested Immunization with GP002 resulted in an increased proliferative response to whole protein BPN Y217L The average stimulation index proliferative response to enzyme proliferation in control cultures to 20 ug of whole protein was 23 versus an average stimulation index of 11 for the BPN Y217L immunized splenocytes Epitope mapping with splenocytes from BPN Y217L immunized guinea pigs revealed no epitope regions with an average stimulation index of 3 0 in any of the animals tested n 5 This is consistent with our previous results for this enzyme using splenocytes from animals immunized with 20 ug per dose of enzyme every two weeks for 10 weeks Four out of five of the GP002 immunized animals responded with stimulation indices of greater than 3 0 to the modified epitope region in BPN Y217L peptide 25 The average response to this peptide was approximately 4 0 Peptide 25 is offset from the T cell epitope described in B lentus by 2 amino acids This is a result of creating linear 15 mers from the two sequences where there is a 2 amino acid contraction in B lentus subtilisin as compared to the BPN Y217L sequence Primed splenocytes from guinea pigs also respond to peptide 24 that is 3 amino acids offset towards to N terminus and subsequently overlaps with the T cell epitope region The creation of a T cell epitope in BPN Y217L also resulted in the display of a complex set of weak epitopes in the molecule Peptides 25 and 75 induced average responses over the 5 animals that reached an S I of approximately 3 0 Five peptide regions induced average responses of approximately 2 5 Therefore creation of a strong T cell epitope in this protein initiates an immune response that leads to the diversification of T cell responses to other regions of the molecule Antibody titers with BPN Y217L and GP002 In order to test whether the modified enzyme could induce higher titers of antigen specific IgG now that it carried a strong T cell epitope guinea pigs were immunized with increasing doses of BPN Y217L or GP002 Serum samples were taken every two weeks and titers were calculated Average titers for four animals per group are shown in Figure 6 Immunization with the modified enzyme resulted in higher titers of antigen specific IgG at early time points in the immunization protocol Figure 6a At later points during the immunization protocol lower doses of the variant induced higher titers than the parent Figure 6b c d At four weeks the 20 ug dose GP002 induced an average serum dilution titer of 5 000 versus no detectable IgG in the BPN Y217L immunized animals This difference between GP002 and BPN Y217L has a p value of 0 03 when calculated using a two tailed non parametric Student s t test By ten weeks the difference is no longer detected at the 5 and 20 g doses but there is still a ten fold difference in titers at the lowest dose Linear B Cell Epitopes BPN Y217L v GP002 A potential explanation for the increase in antibody titers is that the modification in GP002 results in a conformationally distinct molecule with unique surface regions thereby increasing the total number of antibody binding sites Guinea pig serum samples from animals immunized with 5 g of enzyme were used to determine the position of linear B cell epitopes in BPN Y217L Figure 7 The serum samples were drawn at 8 weeks and whole protein titers are shown in Figure 6 Serum samples from four animals immunized with BPN Y217L and four animals immunized with GP002 were tested on biotinylated 15 mer peptides offset by 5 amino acids Serum was diluted 1 1000 for all tests Guinea pig IgG was detected with HRP conjugated anti IgG The average optical densities for each peptide were divided by the background The average result for each peptide is shown The linear B cell epitope regions recognized by both polyclonal serum samples are similar The amino acid modification in GP002 would be in the region of peptides 13 to 16 If the amino acid modification produced a B cell epitope at this site it does not cross react onto the unmodified peptide regions tested here The regions of the BPN Y217L molecule detected in this assay are predicted external loops Dr Richard Bott Genencor International personal communication The major regions recognized peptides 3 and 4 17 and 18 and 46 and 47 are equivalently recognized by both serum sets Of the 29 regions of the molecule showing an average two fold increase in IgG binding over the background 17 of these regions are detected more strongly by the GP002 sera 5 peptide regions are uniquely detected by the BPN Y217L serum and 7 are uniquely recognized by the GP002 serum There is a shift in one epitope region from peptides 38 43 where the GP002 antibody epitope runs from peptide 38 to peptide 41 and BPN Y217L s runs from peptide 40 to peptide 43 This 10 amino acid shift forward indicates a slight difference in protein folding This difference has little apparent effect on the other antibody epitopes delineated by this assay This assay demonstrates that GP002 specific IgG antibodies readily cross react with BPN Y217L linear antibody epitopes BPN Y217L and GP002 Priming Immunizations It was of interest to determine whether increased titers of IgG antibodies to BPN Y217L could be induced by priming animals with the T cell epitope containing variant Four sets of four guinea pigs were immunized with 5 g of enzyme over a six week period in series The animals were immunized three times once every two weeks This protocol was chosen to correspond with the titer data presented in Figure 6 Group A was immunized three times with BPN Y217L Group B was immunized first with the GP002 and then twice with BPN Y217L Group C was immunized the first two times with the GP002 and the third time with BPN Y217L Finally Group D was immunized all three times with GP002 Two weeks after the last immunization serum samples were taken and ELISAs were performed to compare titers All ELISAs were performed using the parent enzyme BPN Y217L as a plate coating reagent Results clearly show once again that immunization with GP002 induces over 10 fold higher levels of antigen specific IgG than the unmodified parent enzyme Figure 8 The difference between group A and D was highly significant p 0 01 In addition a single immunization with the T cell epitope modified variant GP002 is sufficient to induce higher levels of parent enzyme specific IgG after subsequent immunizations with the unmodified parent enzyme While the average titer increased by approximately two fold the difference between group A and B was not statistically significant Each group contained only four animals with appreciable scatter in the individual responses Two immunizations with GP002 prior to immunizing with the parent enzyme did not improve the titers as compared to a single priming immunization with GP002 This result suggests that priming with the variant enzyme can induce higher levels of cross reactive IgG antibodies than immunization with the unmodified variant alone This experiment also confirms that GP002 immunized animals produce high titers of IgG that cross react on the whole BPN Y217L molecule Discussion We have shown that a single conservative amino acid change in a bacterial subtilisin enzyme can create a strong T cell epitope in our guinea pig model Immunization of guinea pigs with this modified variant results in an improved cross reactive immune response to the unmodified parent enzyme in both antigen specific IgG antibody production and T cell proliferative responses The improved immunogenicity of the variant was not related to changes in the proteolytic capacity of the enzyme because the variant exhibited 80 of the activity of the parent enzyme The introduction of a single T cell epitope apparently allowed for the diversification of T cell responses to the protein because multiple epitopes were found in the BPN Y217L sequence after immunization of animals with the variant Figure 5 An increase in the complexity of the T cell response is consistent with an increase in overall antibody titer to the enzyme as more T cell helper activity is potentially available The antibody responses to the variant and parent enzymes were shown to be largely overlapping indicating that the increase in the antibody titers seen were not due to the addition of a novel structure capable of being recognized by unique antibody specificities This is shown by the last experiment where priming with the variant enzyme increased antibody titers to the parent enzyme upon subsequent immunizations It was of interest that the unmodified protease induces antigen specific IgG in the absence of detectable immunodominant T cell epitopes BPN Y217L may possess weak T cell epitopes that are below our limit of detection in our cell culture assay Our criterion for an epitope was an average stimulation index of 3 0 In addition it is notable that both of the immunogens tested display considerable proteolytic activity The proteolytic activity of the parent enzyme could be responsible for inducing T cell independent B cell differentiation via a number of different mechanisms 33 34 35 Finally we have seen than both chemically inactivated and an inactive variant of the parent protease used in these experiments are incapable of inducing IgG1 in a mouse model data not shown The proteolytic activity of these molecules also acts as an adjuvant for specific IgG production 36 The ability to induce improved immune responses by the subtle changes described here could have a number of potentially vital applications The use of a T cell epitope modified whole protein immunogen confers a number of advantages The first advantage is the priming of a diverse immune response to the protein that allows the generation of both a complex and robust T helper responses and secondly the concomitant affinity maturation of the antibody response to naturally occurring antibody epitopes This is especially relevant to the design of subunit vaccines for malaria and schistosomiasis where high titers of high affinity antibodies are usually the best defence against invading organisms 11 16 24 Creating T cell epitopes in expressed proteins has been demonstrated here for Hartley strain guinea pigs and for various inbred strains of mice 37 38 Interestingly the introduction of T cell epitopes from a hen egg lysozyme or ovalbumin into mouse TNF alpha also resulted in an increased cross reactive antibody response in mice 38 However the protein construct was no longer cytotoxic for L929 cells suggesting that the modified protein was not in the correct tertiary configuration Incorrect tertiary configuration could lead to the production of specific antibodies that do not cross react with the native molecule T cell responses to the variants were not well characterized In this paper and in the report from Tsujihata 37 T cell epitopes were created within the molecule of interest without affecting the activity of the enzyme We created a naturally occurring T cell epitope by comparison to a related protein In addition we found that the creation of a T cell epitope in BPN Y217L resulted in a complex pattern of T cell response to the enzyme The challenge of utilizing this technique for the creation of subunit vaccines for the human population will be to create T cell epitopes within a protein of interest that will not have deleterious effects on the activity or the stability of the protein of interest and that would be effective across a number of HLA DR haplotypes 39 The improved antibody response measured in this paper was increased titers of guinea pig polyclonal IgG We did not measure potential differences in guinea pig IgG isotypes Changing the interaction of peptide MHC class II molecules T cell receptors and other antigen presenting cell specific ligand interactions to foster stronger higher affinity T cell signalling has been shown in mice to skew T cell differentiation from Th2 to Th1 like patterns 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 Differences in Th differentiation patterns have downstream effects on the type of immune response mounted and in particular on the isotypes of antibody expressed This has been well documented for mice and humans but less is known about Th differentiation in Hartley strain guinea pigs In our system we cannot distinguish if the amino acid change we have created has its effects on binding to the guinea pig MHC interaction with the T cell receptor or more efficient processing of the epitope from the protein precursor 51 Any or all of these mechanisms could contribute to the enrichment for peptide specific proliferative responses seen in vitro The ability to up regulate antibody and T cell responses to whole protein immunogens by the modification of T cell epitopes suggests that the converse would also be possible Down regulation of T cell responses to functionally intact enzymes would have obvious implications for both existing and potential protein therapeutics Conclusions The immunogenicity of an enzyme can be increased while maintaining the majority of its stability and proteolytic activity by incorporating a single amino acid change The variant enzyme was found to have a major T cell epitope where none existed in the parent In addition to the increased cellular response humoral responses were increased at low doses and as well for high doses early in the immunization schedule Enhancing the T cell response to an enzyme in addition to the humoral response has applications in the construction of recombinant vaccines as well as in protein based therapeutics Materials and Methods Protease enzymes GP002 was created by site directed mutagenesis of
