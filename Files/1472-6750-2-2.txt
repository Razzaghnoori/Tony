 Background Agrobacterium vitis strains are causative agents of crown gall an economically important disease 1 2 A vitis F2 5 is an effective biological control agent against many A vitis tumorigenic strains 3 Strain F2 5 produces an antibiotic toxic to many A vitis strains in vitro However two lines of evidence suggest that this antibiotic plays a minor role in disease suppression Strains that are susceptible to the antibiotic in vitro such as A vitis strain CG78 are able to infect the plant in the presence of F2 5 3 and Tn5 mutants of F2 5 lacking F2 5 antibiotic production appear to be unaffected in crown gall biological control 4 Biological control by F2 5 is grape specific as F2 5 is not effective on non grapevine host plants such as Nicotiana glauca Furthermore F2 5 is not effective against all A vitis strains 3 Thus enhancing the F2 5 biological control phenotype and extending the host range of the efficacy of F2 5 beyond grape would be beneficial for disease control in field applications Agrobacterium rhizogenes strain K84 is the most studied crown gall biological control strain and is commercially utilized for crown gall disease control worldwide Strain K84 biological control is primarily due to production of two plasmid encoded antibiotics agrocins 84 and 484 encoded by genes on pAgK84 and pAgK434 respectively 5 Agrocin 84 an adenosine analog 6 is effective against tumorigenic strains carrying nopaline agrocinopine tumor inducing plasmids and requires the acc system in the target strain for activity 7 Agrocin 434 a di substituted cytidine analog is effective against and specific for a broad range of A rhizogenes strains 8 Curing of either agrocin encoding plasmid results in reduction of biological control activity 9 Thus K84 demonstrates the efficacy of antibiosis for crown gall biological control However the commercial application of the K84 biological control system is limited where Agrobacterium strains of certain crops are not inhibited by K84 As a result alternative biological control systems for crown gall disease are needed Trifolitoxin TFX is a peptide antibiotic produced by Rhizobium leguminosarum bv trifolii T24 Antibiotic production and resistance functions are encoded by the seven gene tfx operon and the unlinked tfuA gene 10 11 TFX is derived from post translational cleavage and modification of the tfxA gene product TFX effectively inhibits growth of members of the proteobacteria including strains of Brucella Ochrobactrum Rhodobacter Rhodospeudomonas Rhizobium and the etiological agent of crown gall disease Agrobacterium 12 TFX is highly specific for this group as demonstrated by a lack of observable effect on the majority of the bacterial population in the bean rhizosphere 13 This suggests that TFX could be used to control crown gall diseases of various plants with limited effects on non target bacteria outside of that very specific group of TFX sensitive proteobacteria TFX is rapidly degraded in nonsterile soil but is readily extractable from sterile soil inoculated with a TFX producing strain suggesting that TFX is sensitive to in situ proteolysis 14 Despite this rapid turnover TFX production confers enhanced nodulation efficiency upon TFX producing Rhizobium strains under field conditions 15 Degradation of antimicrobial peptides such as cecropin B and attacin E also has been observed in plant apoplastic fluids 5 16 17 This is likely due to apoplastic proteinases 5 16 Expression of antimicrobial peptides in plants has had mixed results for enhancing disease resistance For example cecropin expression in transgenic tobacco did not confer resistance to P syringae pv tabaci 18 likely due to low apoplastic peptide concentrations due to proteolysis 19 Therefore prior to this work it was not clear whether a peptide antibiotic could play a role in the inhibition of galling by tumorigenic Agrobacterium in planta Agrobacterium rhizogenes is capable of producing TFX by addition of the stable plasmid pT2TFXK which contains the tfx operon but not tfuA 11 12 20 This suggests that TFX production by crown gall biological control strains of Agrobacterium such as A rhizogenes K84 and A vitis F2 5 may be enhanced by TFX production These strains would be excellent delivery vehicles for TFX to the infection court Here we present experiments demonstrating the TFX sensitivity of a range of A vitis strains and the effect of the TFX production and resistance phenotypes on the expression of biological control of crown gall using the model plant Nicotiana glauca Strain F2 5 was chosen as the recipient of the TFX genes in this work because it is an avirulent strain that expresses a biological control phenotype on only one host As a result F2 5 is an ideal strain in which to test the ability of the TFX system to confer biological control of crown gall disease and to broaden the host range efficacy of a known biological control strain Results In vitroTFX antibiosis against A vitis Agrobacterium vitis strains Table 1 were tested for sensitivity to trifolitoxin As expected based on previous results 12 the tested Agrobacterium vitis strains were sensitive to TFX producing strains However the level of susceptibility was lower than predicted based upon previous TFX sensitivity measurements with CG48 and CG74 12 No zones of A vitis growth inhibition were observed around R leguminosarum T24 colonies and only relatively small zones were observed around R etli CE3 pT2TFXK which produces more TFX than T24 Furthermore one A vitis strain F2 5 was TFX resistant Because A vitis F2 5 produces an antibiotic to which most of the tumorigenic strains are sensitive 3 the effect of TFX on A vitis was assessed against TFX producing and non producing Rhizobium strains None of the tested strains were sensitive to R leguminosarum T24 which produces relatively low amounts of TFX All of the A vitis strains except for F2 5 were sensitive to R etli CE3 pT2TFXK as evidenced by zones of growth inhibition around the CE3 pT2TFXK colonies A vitis growth was not inhibited by a non TFX metabolite or nutrient competition by CE3 pT2TFXK as evidenced by the lack of a zone around the near isogenic tfxA mutant CE3 pT2TX3K colony Fig 1 Wild type F2 5 produces a zone of inhibition versus the other agrobacteria used in this work This occurred because of the antibiotic production previously observed by F2 5 These zones of inhibition were much larger when pT2TFXK was added to F2 5 and unchanged with the addition of pT2TX3K Evidence for TFX production by A vitisstrain F2 5 pT2TFXK Strain F2 5 pT2TFXK inhibited TFX sensitive R leguminosarum bv trifolii ANU794 but had no effect on ANU794 following addition of the TFX resistance genes provided by pT2TX3K Fig 2 Plasmids pT2TFXK and pT2TX3K confer resistance to TFX tetracycline and kanamycin with pT2TFXK also providing TFX production to a host strain 20 Since strains F2 5 and F2 5 pT2TX3K produced no zones of inhibition against ANU794 or ANU794 pT2TX3K data not shown F2 5 pT2TFXK is producing TFX In addition this shows that the agrocin like molecule produced by F2 5 does not inhibit ANU794 In plantabiological control of crown gall conferred by TFX production As expected F2 5 did not inhibit galling by tumorigenic A vitis strains on N glauca However a 10 1 ratio of A vitis F2 5 pT2TFXK pathogen caused a statistically significant reduction in mean gall size relative to the TFX non producing controls on N glauca stems for all three tested tumorigenic strains Figs 3and 4 High concentrations of F2 5 pT2TFXK also reduced gall incidence for CG435 and CG78 but not for CG49 Table 2 A 1 1 ratio of F2 5 pT2TFXK CG435 also resulted in a significant reduction in gall size and in gall incidence compared to controls A 1 1 ratio of F2 5 pT2TFXK CG49 or F2 5 pT2TFXK CG78 did not affect either incidence of galls or reduce gall size Similarly an excess a 1 10 ratio of any of the virulent strains to F2 5 pT2TFXK resulted in a high incidence of disease and large gall size Discussion As all strains of A vitis tested were sensitive to TFX both in this work and in a previous study 12 experiments were conducted to determine the effectiveness of a TFX producing avirulent strain of A vitis in the prevention of crown gall caused a three strains of A vitis Although A vitis F2 5 is an effective crown gall biological control agent against most tumorigenic A vitis strains when co inoculated with a tumorigenic strain it is not an effective against all strains of A vitis Where A vitis F2 5 is effective as a biological control agent its control is only effective when numbers of F2 5 are equal to or greater than the number of cells of the virulent strain 3 Strains that are resistant to F2 5 biological control are known For example strain CG78 is not controlled when co inoculated with F2 5 1 Two principle benefits of TFX production by F2 5 are demonstrated here Biological control is extended to a new host N glauca Furthermore biological control is extended to a strain that F2 5 fails to control CG78 These effects are due to TFX production as demonstrated by the lack of efficacy of F2 5 against CG49 CG435 and CG78 and by the lack of efficacy of the near isogenic TFX non producing F2 5 pT2TX3K against CG78 TFX confers biological control when the TFX producing strain is present in excess of the tumorigenic strain Thus F2 5 pT2TFXK effectively inhibited gall incidence by two of the three tested tumorigenic strains when co inoculated in approximately 10 fold excess F2 5 pT2TFXK inhibited gall size by more than 70 with third tumorigenic strain tested At 1 1 or 1 10 inoculum ratios of F2 5 pT2TFXK pathogen biological control was reduced or lost High ratios of biological control pathogen strain should be easily achieved in field situations by dipping the roots of planting stock in suspensions of the biological control strain or by directly applying the bacterial suspension to the planting bed Furthermore TFX is inhibitory towards all tested species of Agrobacterium 12 These results suggest that TFX production would enhance crown gall biological control for other biological control strains such as A rhizogenes K84 and on other host plants especially where a mixed inoculum of different tumorigenic Agrobacterium species occurs K84 biological control is thought to be primarily due to production of two plasmid encoded antibiotics each of which accounts for a portion of the observed disease control 9 This naturally occurring example suggests that pyramiding biological control mechanisms within one strain can enhance disease control Strain F2 5 also produces an A vitis specific antibiotic in vitro but this antibiotic is not involved in disease control 4 Thus the addition of TFX to F2 5 is a successful example of pyramiding unrelated disease control mechanisms and clearly demonstrates that individual antibiotics can be effectively developed as a mechanism of disease control Although plasmid borne traits are frequently unstable pT2TFXK contains the RK2 plasmid partitioning locus that confers a high degree of stability both in vitro and under field conditions 15 Stable TFX expression would be beneficial under field conditions when the biological control agent is inoculated on seeds or on roots dipped in a bacterial suspension prior to planting Trifolitoxin production enhances rhizosphere competitiveness of Rhizobium etli CE3 pT2TFXK in sterile soil and enhances nodulation efficiency in non sterile soil when compared to a TFX sensitive strain 20 Trifolitoxin production also increases bean nodulation competitiveness of Rhizobium etli CE3 in the presence of indigenous rhizobia under agricultural conditions 15 Field application of R etli CE3 pT2TFXK dramatically reduced the diversity of indigenous proteobacteria in the bean rhizosphere without affecting unrelated species 13 Thus TFX production by A vitis F2 5 should enhance the competitiveness and aid in establishment of this beneficial strain in the rhizosphere The ability to displace indigenous tumorigenic Agrobacterium strains would be beneficial in those areas already infested with the pathogen Compared to other treatments available for pathogenic agrobacteria the effects of TFX on non target species is very low Copper a broad spectrum bacteriocide is commonly used as a treatment of bacterial diseases Although no comprehensive studies have been published on the taxonomic range of bacteria inhibited by K84 it is known that K84 produces multiple antibiotics and that K84 can inhibit strains of Erwinia and Pseudomonas that are unaffected by TFX 23 24 25 TFX producing strains inhibit only a very specific group within the proteobacteria in culture and in the field 13 26 These observations suggest that a K84 producing strain may have a more serious impact on non target organisms than does a TFX producing strain However there has been no study of the effects of K84 on non target soil bacteria by culture independent means to compare the effects of K84 versus the TFX system in a natural system Conclusions TFX production effectively enhances crown gall biological control by Agrobacterium vitis F2 5 The host plant range and range of tumorigenic A vitis strains controlled by F2 5 are both broadened by TFX production In addition virulent strains of A vitis not previously controlled by F2 5 are controlled following the addition of the trifolitoxin production and resistance genes to F2 5 The plasmid used to confer trifolitoxin production and resistance pT2TFXK is stably maintained in the absence of selection pressure 20 This plasmid is not self transmissible but is mobilizable With the TFX system the biological control of Agrobacterium pathogens may be extended to many crops far beyond what is possible today with currently available commercial products Materials and Methods Bacterial and plant growth conditions strain construction Bacterial strains are listed in Table 1 The A vitis strains without pT2TFXK or pT2TX3K were obtained from Dr T J Burr Cornell University Bacteria were grown on BSM agar 21 media at 27 C A vitis F2 5 pT2TFXK and F2 5 pT2TX3K were constructed by triparental mating using standard procedures Transconjugants were selected on BSM media amended with 50 g ml kanamycin Trimethoprim 10 g ml was added to counterselect the E coli DH5 donor and helper strains The helper strain was E coli DH5a pRK2013 27 Strains containing the plasmids pT2TFXK and pT2TX3K were grown for routine propagation on BSM amended with 50 g ml kanamycin Prior to use in making inoculum suspensions for biological control assays these strains were grown overnight on BSM agar without kanamycin Plants Nicotiana glauca were grown in the greenhouse with supplemental illumination and fertilized as needed with a nutrient solution called CNS containing 2 mM CaCl 2 2H 2 O 0 5 mM MgSO 4 7H 2 O 2 mM KCl 0 4 mM KH 2 PO 4 2 5 mM NH 4 NO 3 0 065 mM FeSO 4 7H 2 O 2 3 M H 3 BO 3 0 9 M MnSO 4 H 2 O 0 6 M ZnSO 4 7H 2 O 0 1 M NaMoO 4 2H 2 O 0 11 M NiCl 2 6H 2 O 0

assessed using Rhizobium leguminosarum bv trifolii strain T24 and R etli strain CE3 pT2TFXK as producing strains Rhizobium leguminosarum bv trifolii T24 Tn5 1 and R etli CE3 pT2TX3K were used as TFX non producing negative controls In plantabiological control of crown gall by TFX producing strains Agrobacterium vitis strains were suspended in sterile distilled water prior to the determination of colony forming units CFU per ml These suspensions were adjusted to OD 650 0 10 approximately 10 8CFU ml using a Shimadzu UV 160 spectrophotometer and sterile distilled water and stored until inoculation at 4 C Actual inoculum viability and cell density were measured by dilution plating on BSM agar medium on the day that plants were inoculated 22 Prior to inoculation tumorigenic strains were diluted 10 fold with sterile distilled water to approximately 10 7CFU ml Strain F2 5 and its derivatives were left undiluted or diluted 10 fold for CG49 and CG435 experiments or 100 fold for CG78 experiments Thus the CFU ratios were approximately 10 1 and 1 1 or 1 10 avirulent tumorigenic strain Immediately prior to plant inoculation tumorigenic strains were mixed 1 1 vol vol with the appropriate biological control test strain Positive controls were diluted 1 1 vol vol with water Thus all plant inoculum contained approximately 5 10 6CFU ml of the tumorigenic strains Plants Nicotiana glauca were inoculated by wounding the stem with a dissecting needle Three or four inoculations were made per inoculum mixture on each of two plants Thus each of the two experiments included 6 to 8 repetitions per treatment A 5 l drop of bacterial suspension was placed on the wound and allowed to air dry Inoculation sites were wrapped loosely with Parafilm American National Can for 1 week post inoculation Gall diameter perpendicular to the long axis of the stem was measured 4 to 7 weeks post inoculation using a caliper and all measurements were included for statistical analysis Results were analyzed using ANOVA at the 0 05 level of significance Abbreviations TFX trifolitoxin
