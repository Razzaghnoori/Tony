 L A s Belated New Year Morning Matt although it s already afternoon there We Southern Californians experienced a really bad case of Last in the World syndrome when new Year s Eve marched flashily around the globe before finally timidly landing here Insult was added to injury when Todd Purdum in the Sunday New York Times took out after us for our lack of excitement resuscitating the laid back stereotype that I thought had been shipped off to Seattle a decade or so ago along with our laid off aerospace workers Left out of Purdum s piece because it vitiated his argument was the fact that millions of Southern Californians and our tourists do get excited a few hours after New Year s Eve by the Rose Parade which lasts a lot longer than a fireworks show and is slightly less inexplicable than the diaphanously costumed dancers who cavorted through Times Square last Friday Liddy Dole endorses George W Bush Knock me over with an earth mover buddy This should solve her lingering case of E D electoral dysfunction But I can t think of two more grating campaign personalities joined on a single ticket than Bush and Dole As to the Dems I had the opportunity yesterday to watch both their speeches and in each case after a few moments I opted instead to wash some long neglected dishes Analysts are wrong to say Gore is suffering from Clinton fatigue I already have a well developed case of Gore fatigue He was back to the blue suit though does that mean Naomi Wolf has taken another pay cut Re Clinton s taste in women I ve covered this in my book but yes man he s the president he s supposed to be banging movie stars I did see Monica on Larry King and the show left me with one burning question that hard hitting Larry failed to ask If you re a borderline nobody who s been given an hour of nationwide airtime with the King of Talk what in hell is so important that you have to leave 20 minutes early As for the Cuban boy I say send him to Mexico and let the lawyers fight it out Speaking of borders though isn t the alleged Algerian bombing conspiracy being teased out by the FBI reason enough to bite the bullet finally and close the damn Canadian border Couldn t an American have anchored ABC s 30 hours of millennium coverage just as well and at the end just as tearfully Harry Shearer
