 Address your e mail to the editors to slate msn com Number 9 Number 9 Number 9 Maybe it s because I m a dumb narrow minded conservative but I count nine reasons in the misnamed article Eight Reasons Not to Cut the Capital Gains Tax by Michael Kinsley Too bad none of them are very good reasons In reference to No 9 how do you get the 1 percent figure Do only 1 percent of all Americans own their own homes and think of selling them from time to time If so then I m more elite than I thought The truth is the capital gains tax affects a lot more than 1 percent of all Americans Other than that I enjoyed the article John T Tant The Editors Reply Kinsley counts it s his deputy who made the mistake We ve Found Reason No 9 Michael Kinsley missed a pretty good reason in his Eight Reasons Not to Cut the Capital Gains Tax Unless you can go back in time cutting the tax rate on existing capital gains cannot possibly increase investment in productive resources You cannot change individuals past investment decisions Those who claim to want a cut in the capital gains tax rate because it will increase investment and not because it is a handout to the rich could gain a lot of credibility if they advocated reducing the rate only on future capital gains Bill Nelson It s My Money I guess that one of the things I liked about the blast at capital gains tax cuts in Eight Reasons Not to Cut the Capital Gains Tax by Michael Kinsley was the writer s cheerful admission that he has written it all before I assume that he formed his convictions as a student when he had no investments and didn t even know what they were I am 79 and when I make money out of the market it is because I watch the ticker much of the morning study documents make guesses and take risks with money that I earned myself I could lose my shirt at any moment I have had noticeable losses and the feeling of humiliation that goes with them Kinsley thinks it is OK for Washington to take a third give or take of anything this retired research historian labors to make through entrepreneurial risk taking I don t Vaughn Davis Bornet Fair Play for Belgium I am not Belgian nor do I work for any Belgian company but I have lived happily in Brussels for the last 30 years and there is very little that I recognize in the highly subjective account I Have Seen the Future of Europe by Gregg Easterbrook He is apparently unable to provide accurate factual information and even contradicts himself For example Sabena is very far from being a state sanctioned monopoly as it is in competition with other carriers on all its routes except those with too little traffic to support a second operator If you want to find such a monopoly you need look no further than the rails where the national operator operates the world s fastest in cooperation with similar companies in the neighboring countries Also the standard off peak rate for local phone calls here is less than 2 U S cents per minute which scarcely makes dial up access to an ISP a luxury Although I could flag numerous other fundamental errors I think that these should be enough to make my point that Easterbrook s opinion of European telecoms and communication bureaucrats is far from the truth Alan F Reekie Get Out of Your Cocoon As a Eurocrat in my cubicle at the European Commission sitting on the ergonomic chair I borrowed from a secretary when mine collapsed last year I was wondering who got those plush suites with leather chairs that Gregg Easterbrook referred to in I Have Seen the Future of Europe Suddenly I got it He is referring to the Council of Ministers a separate institution where representatives of the 15 member states get together to make decisions mostly on proposals by the Commission Just because somebody can write and his or her spouse gets an assignment abroad does not mean they have insight on a whole continent I do not think Easterbrook had to relocate to write that piece Since Slate is distributed electronically

the Feb 19 Summary Judgment when reviewing the reviews of Roy Jenkins Gladstone you understandably fell afoul of those tricky British titles of nobility You called the author Lord Roy Jenkins which is not correct That would make him the younger son of a duke like Lord Randolph Churchill or Lord Peter Wimsey and not thereby actually a lord except in using that word in this courtesy title Instead he is a life peer with a barony of Jenkins Jenkins of Hillhead to distinguish him from some other Lord Jenkins So you can call him Lord Jenkins of Hillhead or Lord Jenkins for short or by his actual name Roy Jenkins since he still uses it but not Lord Roy Jenkins It is Margaret Thatcher or Lady Thatcher not Lady Margaret Thatcher James Callaghan or Lord Callaghan not Lord James Callaghan and so on This is worth pointing out because most retired top rank British politicians are in this position and an amazing number of writers even those for the Economist make this mistake I m sure most of the politicians who went to the Lords only so they d have a place to speechify after retiring from the Commons would rather do without this but it s part of the British schtick so at the least we ought to get the names right David Bratman Address your e mail to the editors to slate msn com
