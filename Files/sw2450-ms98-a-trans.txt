 so what kind of weather have you had in Dallas well it s been very windy and it s uh probably unseasonably hot for time right now really yeah see i didn t i don t i thought my uh i thought i live in Euless and i thought it was pretty normal but anyway but i guess you re right though it has been real hot because it um i ve had to use the air conditioner in March and that is pretty usual yeah we ve already had to use that and we ve had like i meant this is probably typical though uh with like tornado weather and tornado warnings and um uh huh so uh you know i i forget from year to year i m getting too old but the um it it the the the wind s blowing very hard but i guess uh you know we re just out of March and uh will bring the rain in April yeah yeah i know the trees are real pretty right now and everything and uh i don t know i know the pollen is real high but i think it s higher than usual isn t it yes it is seems very high it hasn t bothered me but i know the people that have allergies it seems to be a pretty high yeah i know it s been bothering me a lot but yeah i think normally i think the weather overall has been um probably like you said probably a little bit warm and so a little bit warm and a little bit uh blowy i think anyway so we basically live in the same area so it s real hard to really hard to make too big of uh different comparisons right yeah i know i just think it s been warm and it s been hot and i like it and it s beautiful and all the trees are pretty and i wish it would stay like this all the time yes i could stand this all summer so yeah i could too and uh gah i don t think we can say anything else really i don t think we can either let s cut off yeah that sounds like a good deal well you have a nice day and we ll talk to you later bye you too bye bye
