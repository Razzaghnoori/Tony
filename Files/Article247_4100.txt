 Eleven Twelfths of 1999 In Review When Chatterbox invited readers to nominate events significant deaths good and bad movies etc for 1999 a year likely to get little attention in the coming weeks as news organizations choose instead to review the entire century or millennium the response was overwhelming Chatterbox had promised to publish his official 1999 In Review item before Thanksgiving but some distant memory of a scruple persuaded him to wait till November was over Nothing ever happens in December OK that s not quite true Hordes of protesters in Seattle are making the World Trade Organization s meeting there a much more exciting TV story than anyone expected it to be Reader Dan Crist who finds Chatterbox s habit of referring to himself in the third person rather annoying and less than professional points out that Japan bombed Pearl Harbor in Dec 1941 Also Chatterbox moonlighting as Today s Papers columnist observed not quite one year ago that the House of Representatives cast its second presidential impeachment vote in U S history on Dec 19 1998 That same news filled day the U S ended an air war against Iraq and Bob Livingston said he d decided not to become House speaker after all Two months after the impeachment vote the Senate failed to convict the president a highly significant event of 1999 that for some bizarre reason slipped Chatterbox s mind until several indignant readers wrote in to remind him of it By now it should be clear that Chatterbox isn t much good at year in review journalism Fortunately Chatterbox s readers are very good at it He will now turn this survey over to them Disclaimer Although Chatterbox previously stated that he wouldn t include opinions he disagreed with that standard proved too confining Where Chatterbox has solid information or opinions to the contrary he occasionally interjects below Obviously stupid or unnecessarily sour reader comments were discarded but if you don t find your nominee below it doesn t necessarily mean that it was obviously stupid or unnecessarily sour Here are 20 important things that happened in 1999 1 Most Hated Celebrity Ever The New York Times reported on Nov 10 1999 that a new record had been set in the latest Times CBS poll Its highest negative rating ever scored by a person in the news The honor went to Reform Party candidate Donald Trump who managed to make an unfavorable impression upon some 70 percent of those polled The paper noted that this achievement far eclipsed the last comparably negative rating the 55 percent score attained by Linda Tripp Presumably this came as no surprise to Mr Trump who upon announcing the formation of a presidential exploratory committee on Oct 7 1999 had cited polls with amazing results a remark that was widely misinterpreted at the time Jodie Allen of U S News World Report and frequent Slate contributor 2 Most Foolishly Ignored Parts of the World in 1999 The dog that did bark but no one noticed the political turmoil in the three great South Asian nations of India Pakistan and Indonesia which now are well on the way to passing the three northern Asian nations of China Japan and Russia in population Indonesia is fourth Pakistan just passed Japan to seventh India will soon pass China to first But Americans are still fixated on northern Asia Clinton says he must deal with China because you can t ignore a billion people with nuclear weapons but his own policy toward India shows that you sure can Jim Chapin 3 Worst Best Films of 1999 Here s my nominee for worst movie of the year complete category should be Worst Movie of the Year That Assumedly Adult Male Reviewers Slathered Over There s Something About Mary a pathetically sophomoric penis obsessed mess that wouldn t even appeal to Larry Flynt Felicia Menlo Park Cal Chatterbox replies You ve got the wrong year That was 1998 Chatterbox didn t have the heart to add that he thought There s Something About Mary was pretty funny especially the joke about the franks or the beans Felicia replies Oops well then the best of 99 was The Red Violin lyrical magical musical wonderful Chatterbox hasn t seen it 4 Most Shameless and Unsuccessful Attempt To Have It Both Ways in 1999 Sen Arlen Specter citing Scottish law finds Clinton not proven on the impeachment charges Andrew Solovay 5 Rest in Peace in 1999 Stanley Kubrick multiple sources John Kennedy Jr multiple sources Susan Strasberg anonymous tipster Strasberg played Anne Frank in the original production of the Broadway adaptation which some people think wasn t Jewish enough Mel Torme Steve Reiness Mrs Whozit Chatterbox interjects her name was Anne Sheafe Miller the first person ever to be saved by penicillin Blair Bolles 6 1999 The Road Not Taken What an extraordinary year A right wing conspiracy topples the president and the governor of Texas reveals himself in a series of debates to be a natural leader with an innate gift for connecting with his audience a sure sign of his electoral success next year A new Thomas Harris book brilliantly takes us deeper into the mind of a serial killer a new Star Wars movie redefines the very nature of entertainment a new Stanley Kubrick film changes the whole national dialogue about sex and marriage a new TV series from the creator of SportsNight oh I can t even bring myself to bash that piece of do gooder twaddle If only McDonald s had come out with three more boldly adult flavored hamburgers it would have been a perfect year for dud megaevents all leading up of course to Y2K the limpest milestone in human history Mike Gebert 7 Children Behaving Badly in 1999 Don t forget Woodstock 1999 the concert of peace and love that ended in a literal blaze of glory when in an hours long tribute to the original Woodstock the mob started ripping down vendor booths and anything else that would burn and piling it onto the bonfires scattered about the scene Chatterbox interjects Didn t people get assaulted and raped too I m getting all sentimental just thinking about it You also left out all the shooting rampages Several were done in the name of God or love supposedly They were all committed by quiet shy people who mostly kept to themselves I ve started to hang around only loud obnoxious people Susan Hoechstetter 8 A Lunatic Rhapsody for the New York Yankees The Yankees can actually be referred to as the glue that held the century together Of course as the 1999 World Series champions they are a significant story of the year However this one singular achievement must be considered in a broader context 1999 represented the team s 25th championship of the century This beats by one the most championships any one team won during the century The Montreal Canadiens have won 23 Stanley Cups However the Yankees an American team playing in the City of the Century so called by me to reflect the amazing growth and transformation of one city during this period who play the National Pastime are truly an amazing story The team s first championship occurred in 1921 therefore they have won 25 of the last 78 years nearly one in three This level of sustained excellence is not matched in sports or in any other aspect of society The 1999 win is possibly the most unique With free agency expansion and three levels of playoffs it is much harder to win today than in past years In fact by winning three of the last four championships they are the first team to accomplish this feat during the eras of free agency and of divisional play The Sultan of Swat the Iron Man the Yankee Clipper the Mick and Yogi these strong masculine names are synonymous with the team the sport and American history They went hand in hand with two world wars Superman and America s superpower status The 1999 squad does not feature a name This team with its myriad of human interest stories its international roster and no star is representative of 90s man male sensitivity Pax American interests and the new political paradigm Jim Landau from North Potomac Md formerly of the Bronx 9 A Big Shot Calls for Decriminalizing Drug Use in 1999 New Mexico Gov Gary Johnson came out for ending drug prohibition Though this by itself has no immediate effect it makes it respectable for the first time for political leaders to discuss the subject and thereby brings closer the day when the vast majority of crimes will no longer be committed when billions of dollars will be freed to help the inner city instead of to ruin black people s lives and when we will stop as in Samuel Butler s Erewhon imprisoning people for the crime of being sick Henry Cohen Chatterbox interjects Didn t Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke do the same thing 11 years ago 10 Don t Worry in 1999 The Dalai Lama proclaimed that most important thing in the world is to be happy Margaret Taylor 11 The Athletic Bra Seen Round the World in 1999 Public interest and media attention to the women s World Cup in soccer Tom Horton 12 Another Overlooked Foreign Policy Event in 1999 Presidential primary elections for the first time ever in Mexico Tom Horton 13 Policing the World Is Shown To Work in 1999 I nominate as the most under reported story of the year and the last few years the continuing alarmist predictions by foreign policy and military experts about peacekeeping efforts which are then proved wrong and immediately forgotten This year the obvious one is Kosovo but the year is also ending with East Timor where the Aussies and their allies successfully stopped the slaughter with no casualties These followed Haiti Bosnia and Rwanda as places where the West delayed sending in troops because of alarmist predictions Jerry Skurnik 14 Barbara Walters Did This One on Her Year End Special But It s Still Good Don t forget Susan Lucci finally won an Emmy anonymous tipster 15 Annals of Justice in 1999 Matthew Shepard the despicable defense anonymous tipster 16 Get Me a New Century Quick A sitting president was accused of rape Ananda Gupta Chatterbox interjects Yes but the evidence was shaky something the Wall Street Journal s editorial page which broke the story was not very forthcoming about As Jack Shafer wrote in this column Ronald Reagan after he left office was also accused of having once committed rape The evidence there was shaky too 17 The Most Important Thing of All That Happened in 1999 In 1999 more than half of U S homes had a PC for the first time i e home PC penetration passed 50 percent Of course most of these PCs crashed all the time but it s still a significant development By the way Internet hookups in homes are still well below 50 percent Walt Mossberg Personal Technology columnist for the Wall Street Journal and occasional rock music historian for this column 18 All Dolled Up and Nowhere To Go in 1999 General Pinochet Jodie Maurer 19 Senate Endorses Nuclear Proliferation in 1999 The Senate rejected the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty thereby decapitating nuclear arms control and sending Iraq Iran and North Korea the message that the United States won t raise a big stink if they try to join India and Pakistan The president woke up to this possibility at about the moment it was realized and started lobbying for passage of the treaty a day after it became too late Josh Pollack 20 Unremarked Natural Disaster in 1999 The Indian Supercyclone is the biggest this century at least
