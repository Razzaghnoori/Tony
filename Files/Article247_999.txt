 Re If not discrimination what Katha Honestly I don t think that lower test scores among candidates from some minorities is a consequence of institutional racism at universities Do you At Berkeley And I don t think that race blind admissions policies is racism either So frankly I don t see the alleged problem of racial discrimination that we need to remedy The only discrimination I think we need to address is the recent attempt by many universities to deny many people admission purely because of their race Now there s discrimination But it s directed primarily against hard working newly immigrant Asian Americans The solution to lower test scores among blacks and Latinos is better public high school education and more engaged and dedicated parenting Period Like you I would like to see much more money spent on public education as long as the teachers unions don t throw it down the toilet And I think we should do all we can not to encourage family breakdown among minorities But even then I doubt whether we would have a perfectly balanced racial mix at our universities And frankly I don t see why we should care Why should we be concerned what race someone belongs to at college as long as there isn t any systematic system to prefer some races over others and as long as half way decent public high school education is also widely available This racial obsession is a legacy of past evils and decreasingly relevant to the polyglot multi racial century we re about to enter So I hope Proposition 209 is repeated across the country And I hope we make a better effort to educate black and Latino kids in the cities And I hope the black family recovers And I hope we stop the futile attempt to make amends for past injustice by wreaking new ones on innocent people As to an all male priesthood I do think it s an unconscionable and irrational form of institutional sexism and I oppose it on the same grounds that I oppose reverse discrimination And if we attempted to remedy it by instituting an all female priesthood for the next two millennia I d be equally opposed Two wrongs don t make a right cheers Andrew
