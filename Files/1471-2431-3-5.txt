 Background Breastfeeding is associated with a lower incidence of infant diarrhoea and respiratory disease particularly in less developed countries 1 A recent ecological study on breastfeeding showed that more than half of all infant deaths from diarrhoeal disease and acute respiratory infections in Latin America are preventable by exclusive breastfeeding in infants aged 0 3 months and partial breastfeeding throughout the remainder of infancy 2 The theoretical basis for this may be a combination of the nutritional and immunomodulatory effects of human milk 3 Since 2001 the WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding up to the age of 6 months World Health Assembly Resolution 55 25 based largely on work later published by Kramer and Kakuma 4 In Bolivia the exclusive breastfeeding rate in infants under 4 months of age has been found to be above 50 with 14 of infants still being exclusively breastfed when 6 9 months old 5 In contrast a later study in Bolivia found that no infants were exclusively breastfed at 4 months of age even if practically all were breastfed at 7 months 6 Infant nutrition in Bolivia and or infant and maternal health have been the topic of several studies 7 8 9 10 11 but none has focused on determinants of breastfeeding The main objective of the present study was to describe the breastfeeding pattern in a sample of Bolivian infants as well as the determinants of breastfeeding including socio economic religious and ethnic background Such data on socio economic determinants are seemingly lacking but have elsewhere been proven important 12 13 14 Reported breastfeeding duration was also compared with how Bolivian women thought infants should be breastfed To the author s knowledge no such comparison has yet been made and the notion that the actual and the desired durations of exclusive breastfeeding differ has not been substantiated At the time of the study the recommended duration of exclusive breastfeeding was four to six months 15 Methods Study area This study took place in La Paz Bolivia The interviews were conducted during a 10 week period in July through September 1995 at four of the La Paz El Alto hospitals Del Nino Number of infants 350 20 de Octubre n 98 San Gabriel n 46 and Obrero n 24 The Del Nino hospital was selected to contribute the majority of infants as it was the main paediatric hospital in La Paz At the time of the interviews there were ten hospitals in La Paz El Alto a number of these did however cater mainly to adults The children at the Del Nino represented all social and ethnic groups while the 20 de Octubre catered mainly to a native lower social class population Residents of the San Gabriel and Obrero hospital catchment areas were more well to do than the rest of the population All mothers visiting one of these hospitals on days when the author was present at the particular hospital were asked to participate in the study The sample of infants in this study n 518 constituted about 1 3 of all infants aged one year or younger who lived in the city of La Paz and El Alto in 1995 n 22 671 16 579 16 According to data from the Bolivian Institute of Statistics the total numbers of children under five years of age who visited the respective hospitals in 1995 were Del Nino 15 420 San Gabriel 7 713 and 20 De Octubre 6 331 16 No data were available for Obrero hospital The interviews were conducted in waiting halls consultant rooms and in the maternity wards Study population Inclusion criteria were Bolivian mothers with a child aged 1 year who came from the La Paz urban area or the villages within a four hour bus ride from the city No exclusion criteria were applied The basis for the selection criterion of within a four hour bus ride was that the three communities of Copacabana Sorata and Coroico were all within a four hour bus ride from La Paz Both mothers of well children and of sick children were interviewed The presence of illness in the child was not recorded in the questionnaire Out of 528 mothers 518 agreed to participate The 10 who declined to participate did so mainly because they did not speak Spanish The interviewed mothers were between 13 and 45 years of age n 512 mean 25 6 5 9 SD years and a total of 72 were teenagers Practically all the mothers were urban dwellers and the majority 76 were Catholic Table 1 Just over half were native women and the rest were of Latin origin In this study Latin ethnicity means largely of European ancestry while native ethnicity refers to those of indigenous origin A number of women were of mixed origin they were nevertheless classified as either Latin or Native Compared to women of native origin Latin women more often had five years of education 88 5 vs 46 p 0 0001 and were literate 99 vs 91 p 0 004 However gainful employment Latin 30 vs native 28 p 0 161 and urban origin Latin 97 vs native 95 p 0 2111 were equally common The average age of the infants was 4 2 3 6 SD months median 4 months One hundred and sixty eight infants were 1 month of age 21 were 10 months old 11 were 11 months old and 24 were 12 months old see legends to Figures 1and 2for complete data on age distribution of the infants Interviews The interviews were conducted using a structured questionnaire All subjects were interviewed in Spanish by the author No interpreter was used Some interviews were interrupted by the consulting doctor and therefore some of the questionnaires were not fully completed All the socio economic data are based on at least 500 of the 518 respondents except for ethnicity n 456 and social class n 458 The numbers in each calculation may be smaller than 500 because of missing values in other categories The following number of mother infant pairs were analysed in the univariate analyses prelacteal feeds and colostrum n 494 518 mother infant pairs perception of optimal breastfeeding duration n 455 487 number of breastfeeds per 24 hours n 449 455 and nighttime breastfeeding frequency n 388 435 Univariate statistics for breastfeeding patterns in previous infants were based on 221 mother infant pairs or 383 children some mothers had more than one previous child Definitions Exclusive breastfeeding was defined as not giving anything other than breast milk at the time of the interview In this definition of exclusive breastfeeding the maximum allowable intake of non breast milk fluid in the past week was set at 3 cucharillas teaspoons or 1 cuchara larger spoon or 1 2 fluid ounce Except for this amount of fluid and for prelacteal feed the absence of previous complementary foods or supplementary fluids totalling more than the above weekly amount since birth was demanded as proof of exclusive breastfeeding In those cases where the weekly intake of food fluid could not be specified the end of exclusive breastfeeding was set at the date of introduction of the food fluid in question The provision of vitamins did not preclude exclusive breastfeeding Hence the definition of exclusive breastfeeding used in this study differs from that suggested by Labbok et al 17 In all analyses of exclusive breastfeeding in the current paper a since birth perspective has been used Any breastfeeding included exclusive predominant and partial breastfeeding 17 Colostrum was defined as the breast milk produced in the first five days after delivery prelacteal feed as food liquid given to the infant before initiating breastfeeding for the first time and nighttime feeding as feeds between 10 p m and 6 00 a m The mothers were asked how many times they had breastfed their child over a 24 hour period during the last week before the interview an average number was recorded When defining a breastfeed no minimal duration was required However at least 30 minutes did have to elapse between two feeds for them to be considered as separate feeds On demand feeding was defined as the mother breastfeeding solely according to the needs of the infant Ethics The study design was presented to the directors of the four hospitals who were also briefed on the contents and objectives of the study after which permission to carry out the study was granted All women who took part in the study gave their informed consent Statistical analyses Univariate analyses Continuous variables were plotted against a normal distribution curve With the exception of number of breastfeeds per 24 hours and number of breastfeeds during the nighttime all continuous variables were deemed normally distributed normal distribution in the two non parametric variables was also rejected using the Kolmogorov Smirnov 1 sample test 19 Normally distributed variables were tested using Student s t test or ANOVA Proportions were compared using the Pearson Chi square test Determinants of breastfeeding frequency were analysed using the Mann Whitney U test or the Kruskal Wallis test p values corrected for ties are presented Kaplan Meier curves were used to establish the median duration of exclusive breastfeeding 20 Multivariate analyses The following main outcome measures and dependent variables were analysed using regression analyses use of prelacteal feed intake of colostrum exclusive breastfeeding duration duration of any breastfeeding in the previous child on demand feeding and desired exclusive breastfeeding duration The aim was to identify environmental and socio economic factors of importance to the dependent variables For that purpose multiple linear regression was used to analyse continuous variables logistic regression was used for proportions and Cox s regression for the duration of exclusive breastfeeding 19 The number of censored observations is given in the text or in Figure 2 Kaplan Meier curves were also used to evaluate the relationship between exclusive breastfeeding duration and socioeconomic determinants since Cox s regression may fail to detect clinically important but statistically insignificant relationships 19 Cox s regression and Kaplan Meier curves are so called survival analyses Survival analyses are often used when the variable of interest is the length of time that elapses before a certain event occurs This event may be death but it may also be the end of a particular condition In the current paper introduction of complementary feeding terminated exclusive breastfeeding and is therefore regarded as death Data on exclusive breastfeeding duration in children who had already been introduced to complementary foods fluids at the time of the interview were classified as uncensored as opposed to censored data in children who were still exclusively breastfed A backward stepwise mode was used in order to avoid dropping non significant variables that affected the model fitness In no analysis did the number of independent variables exceed n 10 variables according to recommendations by Altman 21 Independent variables Univariate analyses were carried out against the following variables sex of the infant hospital age of the mother urban rural residence religious affiliation social class ethnicity literacy educational level gainful employment work living with the infant s father and breastfeeding of previous infant All multivariate analyses initially included the above mentioned independent variables Giving colostrum and feeding the child prelacteal feeds were included among the independent variables in the multivariate analyses of on demand feeding and exclusive breastfeeding duration Dichotomous categorisation of the independent variables was performed in order to carry out logistic regression analyses Infants from the Del Nino Hospital n 350 were compared with infants from the other hospitals n 168 Mothers were divided into two groups according to median age 25 yr vs 25 yr More than five years of education was regarded as high education vs low education Religious affiliation n 515 was categorised as Catholic n 394 or non Catholic 121 including 31 Protestants and 67 atheists Social class was assessed by the interviewer on the basis of the mother s answers to the socio economic questions her language and appearance the work of her partner and her area of residence No weighting was used instead social class was based on an overall assessment In cases of uncertainty the mother in question was classified as being of middle class For purposes of the logistic regression analyses lower class and middle class mothers were collapsed into one category and then compared with upper class mothers Mothers who were cohabiting or were married were collapsed into one category before comparisons were made with single mothers in the logistic regression analyses Mothers who failed to read a sentence out loud in Spanish from daily life were classified as illiterate Work was defined as gainful employment yielding an income on a regular basis Mothers were not asked to specify the duration of work Results Exclusive breastfeeding The time pattern of exclusive breastfeeding could be split into four phases about 75 85 of the infants under 3 weeks of age were exclusively breastfed and during the following 1 2 months about 40 of the infants were exclusively breastfed Figure 1 The rate of exclusive breastfeeding then gradually declined reaching 20 25 among 6 month old infants Except for one 10 month old infant no infants were exclusively breastfed after 6 months of age The exclusive breastfeeding rate in infants under 4 months of age was 46 n 246 percentages were adjusted for the sizes of the age sub groups The median duration of exclusive breastfeeding was 3 months n

other types of drink to 1 and a special diet because of illness to 4 No data were recorded as to the amount of prelacteal feed given Use of prelacteal feed did not correlate with any of the independent variables in the model used in this study There was however a trend for illiteracy to correlate with the use of prelacteal feed p 0 0643 multivariate analysis Restricting the analyses to

determinants of the breastfeeding pattern in Bolivia It also presents data on the diurnal breastfeeding pattern in a less developed country and links actual breastfeeding behaviour with that perceived by the mother as optimal for the infant The use of only one interviewer increased the consistency of interview management and interpretation of the mothers answers In the current study the definition of exclusive breastfeeding allowed for prelacteal feed Prelacteal feed was not an exclusion criterion in the WHO definition of exclusive breastfeeding at the time in which the absence of food other than breast milk drops and syrups is required during the 24 hours preceding the enquiry page 2 http www who int child adolescent health New_Publications NUTRITION who_cdd_ser_91 14 PDF With that exception the rate of exclusive breastfeeding in this study was based on information on the current status and the absence of complementary foods including milks and other fluids at any time prior to the present interview It has recently been shown that data based on current status differ from data based on daily records of feeding 22 and that long term recall provides lower estimates of the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding in infants under 8 months of age when compared to one 24 h recall in cross sectional studies such as Demographic and Health Surveys 23 Different recall methods may be one reason why the data in this study differ from those of McCann et al 5 24 with lower rates of exclusive breastfeeding among infants below 4 months of age in the present study than in theirs 46 vs 58 Moreover most of the infants in this study were of urban origin This also restricts the possibility of extrapolating the descriptive findings to populations where many inhabitants live in the rural areas although data on exclusive breastfeeding from the present study correlate well with data from the whole of Bolivia data from Bolivian Demographic and Health Enquiry 16 Exclusively breastfed infants 1 month 61 JFL 64 2 3 months 48 JFL 37 4 5 months 27 JFL 27 6 7 months 5 2 JFL 11 8 9 months 2 8 JFL 0 and 10 11 months 0 JFL 3 1 Data from the present study JFL were pooled for the purpose of this comparison Data in this study may also differ from those of McCann et al 5 since data were obtained in different years This is a cross sectional and retrospective study hence no conclusions should be drawn regarding causal relationships Nevertheless some of the findings in this study such as the negative association between use of prelacteal feeds and duration of exclusive breastfeeding merit further research and if verified they could have important implications One possible drawback to the study is that both healthy and sick infants were included There are no data on whether the infants in this study visited one of the study hospitals in order to receive an immunisation to attend the well baby clinic or to seek assistance due to illness Although vaccination coverage was around 80 in Bolivia in the mid 1990s and only some 7 of infants in urban areas never received any vaccinations 16 there is a risk that the reasons for some visits were associated with their feeding pattern 25 The risk of bias may be especially great among the older infants who may have more frequently been brought to the hospital because of illness and thus for example were possibly less likely to be breast fed Many of the younger infants were still exclusively breastfed at the time of interview That was not the case for older infants This could increase the risk of bias since the values entered in Cox s regression of actual exclusive breastfeeding duration were more often censored in younger infants than in older infants More importantly this sample may not accurately reflect the situation in La Paz as a whole because it excluded mothers who did not bring their children to the clinics Illness in the child may also have worried the mother That could have affected the reliability of her answers A number of interviews were interrupted This caused incomplete data sets For that reason crude data and actual numbers have to a large extent been presented in the present article Interviews were interrupted at all hospitals and in all social classes and hence there is little reason to believe that the interruptions would have caused any of the observed associations it may rather be the case that they blurred the results This is an exploratory study where results are data driven rather than conceptually driven The purpose of the current study was to explore possible determinants of breastfeeding duration and to do that the stepwise backward regression approach was deemed appropriate Due to the large number of tests there is a risk that some statistical significance particularly those close to p 0 05 are due to random error rather than representing true findings Main findings The rate of exclusive breastfeeding was initially very high but then declined rapidly during the second month This is reminiscent of similar patterns seen in Mexico Brazil and Honduras 13 The radical decline is most unfortunate keeping in mind that the WHO recently decided to change the recommended duration of exclusive breastfeeding from 4 6 months to 6 months 26 In contrast the rate of any breastfeeding was very high in infants under 1 year of age and in no age sub group was it below 85 This is a very high level compared with reports from Mexico 27 and neighbouring Brazil 28 but it is in line with the high prevalence of any breastfeeding at 7 months in the Simondon et al study from Bolivia 6 and data from the Bolivian Demographic and Health Enquiry 97 out of 1115 La Paz women had breastfed their last child 29 In the present study there was no correlation between a range of socio economic and cultural factors and the duration of any breastfeeding in the previous child One reason for this may be that the rates of any breastfeeding are equally high in women from all socio economic strata in the study area These findings are in contrast to reports from other parts of the world indicating a significant correlation between breastfeeding duration and socio economic conditions 12 30 31 Alternative explanations may be the moderate sample size in the current study or lack of accuracy in recalled duration of any breastfeeding There is also a risk that the assessment used in the current study does not mirror the actual economic situation of the household Consumption of prelacteal feeds was strongly inversely related to the duration of exclusive breastfeeding These findings confirm the report of Perez Escamilla et al 32 where both milk based prelacteal feeds and prelacteal water were negatively associated with exclusive breastfeeding OR 0 18 and 0 19 respectively Similar data have also been presented for Mexico 33 The linkage between prelacteal feeds and short duration of exclusive breastfeeding has strong implications In the present study a relatively small percentage of the infants had been given prelacteal feeds compared with the results obtained for rural Bolivia by McCann and Bender 11 One reason for this discrepancy may be the rather restrictive definition of prelacteal feed used in the present study Whether prelacteal feeds are given before the very first breastfeed or between the second and third breastfeed is probably irrelevant regarding its impact on infant feeding patterns It is however evident that more knowledge is needed regarding the circumstances surrounding the use of prelacteal feeds The problem of prelacteal feeds must be confronted The discrepancy between actual exclusive breastfeeding behaviour and the perception of how long the infant should be exclusively breastfed is striking Regardless of the underlying mechanisms this discrepancy indicates a potential for increasing the rates of exclusive breastfeeding once the mothers underlying beliefs in this regard have been systematically elucidated To the author s knowledge this issue has not been studied previously Active promotion of breastfeeding may increase both any and exclusive breastfeeding rates with resulting effects on the risk of diarrhoea among other things 34 The author believes that efforts to inform expectant and breastfeeding mothers are important means for improving infant health both in Bolivia and elsewhere It has recently been shown that extra professional support is beneficial for both any breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding 35 All such strategies should also include the discouragement of prelacteal feeds without this action being culturally offensive and encouragement to feed infants colostrum Conclusions The present study showed a rapid decrease in exclusive breastfeeding rates in Bolivian infants during the first months of life There was also a discrepancy between the actual and the desired duration of exclusive breastfeeding Both avoidance of prelacteal feeding and use of colostrum seem to be associated with improved breastfeeding patterns This is however a cross sectional and retrospective study with a risk of recall bias Prospective
