 Background Mefloquine Lariam is a prophylactic antimalarial that is also used for malaria chemotherapy Adverse central nervous system CNS events have been associated with its use Severe CNS events requiring hospitalization occur in 1 10 000 and 1 200 1200 patients taking mefloquine for chemoprophylaxis and treatment respectively 1 Milder CNS events e g dizziness headache and insomnia are a more frequent occurrence occurring in up to 25 of those receiving chemoprophylactic doses and 90 of patients receiving therapeutic doses 1 Higher blood levels of mefloquine are reached under prophylactic as compared to therapeutic regimens 1 2 The relative incidence of adverse effects is therefore probably dose related although the concomitant effect of malaria during treatment cannot be dismissed It is likely then that the neurological events associated with mefloquine have a biochemical basis In this study an attempt was made to deduce a possible mechanism of action for mefloquine in rat neuronal cells using Affymetrix rat toxicology arrays Microarray analysis offers the unique potential to identify unknown targets of toxic agents as transcriptional responses of the entire genome can be measured in parallel 3 Ideally one should be able to identify new targets quickly confidently and without recourse to alternative methods Appropriate selection of a method for filtering gene expression data is therefore critical to this process One of the first definitions to emerge was the arbitrary designation of a particular level of usually two fold up or down regulation gene expression as representing significance 4 5 Such arbitrary definitions emerged from the observation that fold regulation of genes between control cultures with identical cell populations seldom varies by more than this level discussed by Ideker et al 6 However arbitrary designations cannot be considered significant in the traditional statistical sense unless experimental variance is taken into consideration An evolving method of analysis is to define significant changes in gene expression in terms of a particular P value after performing appropriate statistical tests that take into account the variability of gene expression data and sample size 6 7 8 9 10 However care must be taken to use appropriate statistical tests P value thresholds for significance and sufficient n otherwise variance based methods as with less rigorous fold change approaches will generate high error rates Recent studies have discussed the utility of the Z score the parametric t test and the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test for expression profiling 9 10 However the effects of inadequate sample size and P value correction methods are only beginning to be addressed 11 Due to restrictions on the type and availability of biological samples and the prohibitive cost of arrays many array studies have resorted to the use of extremely low sample sizes for a recent example see Lang et al 12 This is potentially problematic because the power of statistical tests decreases with sample size There is also the multiplicity problem 13 As the number of hypotheses being tested increases so does the number of type I errors false conclusions of significance This is of great concern in microarray studies given the number of statistical comparisons being made i e one test per gene on an array Therefore P value correction is essential in expression profiling to control an appropriate type 1 error rate although undue conservatism may result in the failure to detect transcriptional changes for some genes that might indeed be verifiable by other means As shown in this study adoption of an experimental design that incorporates an adequate sample size and appropriate selection of a P value filtering method is critical if genes with altered transcription are to be efficiently and effectively identified Materials and Methods Reagents and media Mefloquine was obtained from Walter Reed Army Institute of Research chemical repository Dulbecco s Modified Eagle Medium DMEM hypoxanthine aminopterin thymidine HAT medium supplement foetal calf serum FCS and gentamycin were purchased from Gibco BRL Rockville Maryland RNA STAT was obtained from Tel Test Friendswood Texas Cell maintenance NG108 15 mouse neuroblastoma rat glioma hybrid cells were maintained in 75 cm 2tissue culture flasks in DMEM supplemented with HAT 10 FCS and gentamycin 50 g ml in a humidified 6 0 CO 2 incubator at 37 C For the microarray studies 175 cm 2tissue culture flasks were seeded with 4 6 million NG108 cells in 49 6 ml culture medium 24 h prior to the experiments For cytotoxicity studies 25 cm 2tissue culture flasks were seeded with 0 66 million NG108 cells in 10 ml culture medium 24 h prior to the experiment Cytotoxicity of mefloquine in NG108 and primary rat neuronal cell cultures The cytotoxicity of mefloquine was assessed using 25 cm 2tissue culture flasks After overnight incubation of NG108 cells culture media were replaced with fresh DMEM containing mefloquine 2 5 40 M or 1 DMSO control After incubation of the flasks for 2 h the cells were washed twice and then resuspended in 5 ml phosphate buffered saline Total numbers of viable cells at each mefloquine concentration were determined using trypan blue exclusion as previously described 14 Viability was calculated using the following formula Viability viable cells in treated culture viable cells in control culture 100 Data shown represent the mean viability SEM for three experiments The cytotoxicity of mefloquine to primary embryonic rat neurons was assessed in 24 well tissue culture plates using the MTT assay as previously described 15 Data represent mean viability SEM for eight replicate experiments Fifty percent inhibitory concentrations IC 50 s were calculated using Prism software Design of microarray experiments cell harvesting and total RNA extraction On the day of the experiment the media was removed from the seeded flasks and replaced with 70 ml DMEM supplemented with either 0 25 DMSO controls or 10 M mefloquine in 0 25 DMSO treated The cells were treated with mefloquine or DMSO for 2 h This treatment regime reduces the viability of NG108 cells by approximately 35 Figure 1 After incubation media was removed and replaced with 15 0 ml RNA STAT Tel Test Friendswood Texas Total RNA was

transcription and fluorescent labeling hybridization staining and scanning of gene chips and assay monitoring Detailed procedures for preparation of cDNA and fluorescently labeled cRNA hybridization staining and scanning of gene chips and assay monitoring are outlined by Vahey et al 16 The platform chosen for global expression profile was the Rat Tox U34 Array Affymetrix Santa Clara California which contains probes for EST clusters and genes linked to a variety of toxic endpoints total of 1031 probe sets including controls RNA 10 g extracted from each individual flask was hybridized to a single gene chip i e a total of 16 chips were used Gene expression data analysis Affymetrix analysis software version 4 was used to generate average difference AD values for each gene for each treatment Affymetrix Santa Clara California AD values represent the difference in mean fluorescence between positive and mismatch probe cells for each gene All genes with mean AD levels 100 in either mefloquine or DMSO treated cultures were excluded This procedure eliminated most of the genes called absent by the Affymetrix software For simplicity an AD value is hereafter referred to as the expression value of a gene The expression values for each gene chip were imported directly into Parteck Pro 2000 No additional data normalization or scaling methods were employed as these procedures were performed previously by the Affymetrix software No additional filtering of data was conducted on the basis of either number of reporting probe cells or the present absent calls generated by the Affymetrix analysis software Paired t tests two sided df 7 were performed to compare the expression levels of each of the remaining genes 695 of 1031 in DMSO and mefloquine treated cultures The genes were then rank ordered in terms of their unadjusted P values This general approach to the analysis of Affymetrix expression data is outlined in Partek technical literature Fold changes FC in expression were mean mefloquine expression level mean DMSO expression level Expression data generated for this study is available from GEO Accession GSE39 for a summary of the experiment and GSM1654

Synthesis System oligo dT primer method according to the manufacturer s instructions cDNA was RNase treated E coli RNAse H at 37 C for 20 min and diluted to 400 l in molecular biology grade water prior to PCR For each gene 5 l of cDNA was incorporated into a 25 l PCR mixture containing 8 8 mM TrisHCL 44 mM KCl 1 3 mM MgCl 2 0 00088 gelatin 0 284 mM each deoxynucleoside triphosphate 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase Applied Biosystems Foster City CA and 1 78 M of each primer After an initial denaturation of 94 C for 5 min cycles consisted of 30 sec denaturation at 94 C 30 sec of primer annealing at

range of detection PCR products 20 l were electrophoresed on ethidium bromide stained 1 2 agarose gels revealed by UV illumination and analyzed densitometrically Gene specific primer sequences cycle times and annealing temperatures are outlined in Table 1 For each transcript raw densitometry data was subjected to paired t testing two sided df 7 to determine whether differences in expression existed in mefloquine and DMSO treated cultures P 0 05 Designation of a list of genes with altered expression The mefloquine data set was used to compare several P value correction and gene expression filtering methods The methods were compared in terms of their ability or failure to detect genes defined as having truly altered expression Genes with altered changes in expression were those with an array P 0 003 This threshold was selected because of the good correlation of microarray and RT PCR P values and because it represents the highest unadjusted P Value for which an associated mefloquine induced expression change was confirmed by RT PCR Descriptions of different gene expression filtering methods Genes were filtered on the basis of their unadjusted P values according to several different methods i The normal P 0 05 threshold i e P 0 05 for significance ii the modified Bonferroni s step down procedure of Holm or iii the Holm Bonferroni procedure applied in reverse with initial P values of 0 05 or 0 01 Applying the Holm step down procedure 13 the P value threshold for significance for each genes is determined on the basis of its rank according to the following formula P 0 05 total number of t tests or genes in array 1 gene rank Therefore the gene ranked 1 i e having the lowest P value in an expression set for which 695 statistical tests are to be conducted the threshold P value is 0 05 695 For the lowest ranked gene i e with the highest P value the threshold is 0 05 1 This method was also applied in reverse utilizing starting P values of 0 05 and 0 01 according to the following formula P 0 05 or 0 01 gene rank This approach is hereafter referred to as the reverse Holm procedure For comparison the expression data were also filtered using an ad hoc fold change method For the fold change method the expression ratios were calculated for each gene and a two fold change was used as the criterion for significance Power analysis using mefloquine data set In general when using statistical tests in this case a paired t test the required sample size to detect a particular change e g treatment versus control depends on the magnitude of the difference variability of the data the required statistical power and the acceptable type 1 error The mefloquine data set was used to assess the power and implications of sample size in terms of the minimum detectable average fold change in expression of the six genes defined as being truly upregulated by the drug First a publicly available power sample size calculator 17 available at http www mc vanderbilt edu prevmed ps was used to determine the power of the paired test two sided df 7 Then based on this level of power and the same critical values absolute change in expression was calculated at different sample sizes The critical values for the calculations were as follows The detectable difference was the absolute average changes in the expression values of the control group The standard deviation was the square root of the average variance of differences in expression of the six genes in individual pairs of DMSO and mefloquine treated cultures The type 1 error two sided was set at 0 003 which corresponded to the maximum P value for which expression changes were confirmed by RT PCR Absolute changes in expression at different sample sizes are presented as minimum detectable fold changes in expression using the following formula Minimum detectable fold change average expression value of the six upregulated genes in control cultures size of the detectable difference average expression value of the six upregulated genes in control cultures Results NG108 and primary embryonic rat neuronal cells were similarly susceptible to mefloquine The IC 50 s of the drug against NG108 cells and primary neurons were 12 and 6 6 M respectively and the overall shapes of the dose response curves were similar Figure 1 The eleven genes with the lowest array P values are presented in Table 2 The upregulation by mefloquine of transcripts encoding the transcription factors cJun and IkappaB IkB and the ER stress protein GADD153 were confirmed by RT PCR Table 2 Figure 2 All the genes listed in Table 2had P values for the microarray expression data substantially less than 0 05 However expression changes were only confirmed for those genes with array P values 0 003 Also there was a good correlation between P values for the microarray and RT PCR expression data r 0 97 P 0 002 Figure 3 Therefore the seven genes with array P values 0 003 were considered to have expression truly altered by mefloquine Table 2 The fold change and P value filtering methods were compared in terms of their ability to detect not detect genes differentially modulated by mefloquine Table 3 The fold change and P 0 05 filtering methods detected all seven differentially expressed genes but also identified many other genes which given their relatively high unadjusted P values are unlikely to be differentially expressed i e are probably false positives The Holm Bonferroni procedure failed to detect any differentially expressed genes Other conservative filtering methods described in the literature 13 performed similarly poorly e g the Sidak and Hochberg procedures The reverse Holm procedures detected more significant genes than the Holm Bonferroni method and generated fewer false positive results than the P 0 05 method However the more conservative reverse Holm method initial P 0 01 failed to identify two significant genes The effect of sample size on the ease of detection of mefloquine induced transcriptional changes was then examined The power of a paired t test capable of detecting the average change in expression of the six genes upregulated by mefloquine was found to be 50 The effect of sample size on the minimum fold change detectable using a test of such power is illustrated in Figure 4 The minimum detectable fold change increased with decreasing sample size Reduction of total sample size from 16 to 12 modestly increased the minimum detectable fold change from 3 0 to 3 8 At a total sample size lower than 10 the minimum detectable fold change exceeded the maximum change in expression induced by mefloquine Discussion The detection of differentially expressed genes depends critically on having adequate replication sample size and on the selection of appropriate filtering methods in the case of this study a P value filtering method In terms of their ability to detect genes differentially modulated by mefloquine the different P value filtering methods can be ranked in terms of their conservativeness as follows Holm Bonferroni reverse Holm initial P 0 01 reverse Holm initial P 0 05 no correction i e P 0 05 These results are not surprising if one considers the distribution of observed unadjusted microarray P values and that expected uniform if independent tests under the complete null hypothesis that all genes are unaltered Figure 5 Application of the reverse Holm procedures generates relatively few false positive results compared to no P value correction but detects genes more efficiently than if the Holm Bonferroni procedure is applied This of course begs the question as to whether it is appropriate to now conclude that the reverse Holm procedure is the most appropriate P value filtering method The answer of course depends on the goal of the proposed study If for example one wished to be certain that a gene is differentially expressed or does not wish to resort to laborious conventional techniques to confirm expression changes the only appropriate filtering method is the Bonferroni or other related procedure as the chance of generating false positive results using such methods is negligible However if one wishes to identify all differentially expressed genes and possesses the resources necessary to confirm all expression changes using traditional approaches the P 0 05 threshold or a fold change method might be the most appropriate However for many studies that do not fall at either of these extremes application of a reverse Holm procedure might be the most appropriate choice The choice of an appropriate sample size is also critical if true differentially expressed genes are to have a high probability of being detected A power analysis was conducted to determine whether the transcriptional changes induced by mefloquine might have been detectable using lower sample sizes There was a modest increase in the minimum detectable fold change of an average gene when the sample size was reduced to twelve from sixteen In theory then a modest reduction in sample size may still have allowed many significant genes to be detected However at sample sizes below ten the minimum detectable fold change exceeded the maximum transcriptional modulation of any gene by mefloquine implying that such changes would be extremely difficult if not impossible to detect These observations may be directly relevant for planning future studies in which transcriptional changes of similar magnitude and data sets with similar variance characteristics are expected However such a power analysis might be considered conservative for studies in which larger magnitude fold changes are expected Appropriate experimental design is also necessary to ensure that any changes in gene expression observed are relevant to the problem being investigated The choice of cell system toxicant concentration and exposure time must all be carefully considered In the present study an immortal NG108 cell line was selected as these cells are easier to maintain in vitro and large amounts of RNA can be routinely isolated Cell lines do not always respond in the same manner that untransformed cells would in an in vivo context therefore their use in experimental model systems may not always be appropriate However this does not appear to be the case for mefloquine since NG108 cells and primary embryonic rat neurons appear similarly susceptible to the drug Figure 1 The mefloquine concentration 10 M was selected on the basis of its physiological relevance 18 19 20 and ability to elicit a measurable physiological response without inducing maximum cell death Figure 1 A short exposure time 2 h was selected for two reasons Firstly shorter toxicant exposure time ensured that any changes observed in specific mRNA transcript levels were due to the direct cellular effects of mefloquine rather than secondary effects caused by changing culture conditions since drug treated NG108 cells divide less rapidly than DMSO treated cells Secondly a short in vitro exposure time is appropriate since the adverse neurological effects of mefloquine in vivo occur within 24 48 hours of the first 1 2 doses administered 21 22 Mefloquine induced changes in the expression of three genes GADD153 IkB and cJun CJun is a transcription factor upregulated in response to many forms of neurological injury 23 thus its modulation by mefloquine under conditions of cellular stress is unsurprising and does not imply a specific mechanism of action However this is not the case for GADD153 and IkB Two highly conserved responses are observed under conditions of endoplasmic reticulum ER stress the ER overload and unfolded protein responses 24 25 The unfolded protein response is characterized by generalized suppression of protein synthesis and the specific induction of ER resident proteins and GADD153 24 The transcription factor nuclear factor kB is activated during the ER overload response leading to the downstream induction of pro inflammatory proteins 25 Therefore the transcriptional modulation of GADD153 and IkB by mefloquine suggests that the ER might be a target of the drug In neurons GADD153 is selectively upregulated under conditions of endoplasmic reticulum ER stress arising from depletion of calcium stores 26 Here the upregulation of GADD153 was observed after mefloquine treatment in NG108 cells 10 M for 2 h In preliminary experiments utilizing primary rat neurons we have also observed an upregulation of GADD153 after mefloquine treatment unpublished data Mefloquine has been found to alter calcium flux into and out of isolated skeletal muscle and brain microsomes via an inhibitory effect of the compound on the ER calcium pump and calcium release channels IC 50 of 42 43 uM 27 28 Plasma mefloquine concentrations therapeutic dosing may reach 21 M 18 and the drug crosses the blood brain barrier accumulating to concentrations in excess of 50 and 90 M in the brains of humans and rats respectively 19 20 Therefore these biochemical effects occur at concentrations within a relevant physiological range Collectively these observations suggest that mefloquine disrupts neuronal function through a combination of disrupted calcium homeostasis and ER stress This hypothesis is currently under investigation in this laboratory Conclusions Adequate sample sizes and appropriate selection of P value filtering methods are essential for the efficient and effective detection of differentially expressed genes Mefloquine induced changes in the expression of genes encoding cJun IkB and the ER stress response protein GADD153 The upregulation of GADD153 by mefloquine suggests that the drug might affect the function of the ER in neurons perhaps by disruption of calcium homeostasis
