            so lets talk about the uh wonderful abuses in the State of Pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order and after the fact the State of Pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased as well as interest and penalties from the time that you bought it what do you think is Pennsylvania kind of out of line there   well actually i dont think theyre out of line Devils Devils advocate possibly but it you are trying to avoid paying taxes and whether whether or not you agree with that law it youre still circumventing it you are legal in in your circumvention of that law   what what if youre not doing it in order to circumvent the law though i mean what if you dont even realize that youre subject to paying um income tax on something that you purchase mail order   uh really i i i dont think thats a valid argument i think that most people are quite aware theyre not paying that six percent sales tax um some naturally some some things you just cant find in your local KMart or or  um Bryn Mawr stereo dealer um but then then then why not pay pay the sales tax to Pennsylvania corporations have to why should an individual just because its just because the state cant really find out about it be able to avoid paying sales tax   well i mean it seems to me that generally at least in my own experience when i purchase something mail order its not to circumvent paying sales tax to the State of Pennsylvania its because im sorry the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania uh its because i i cant find the item that i want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area so i go outside the area for that   yes   and i think that its not my responsibility to police myself and pay Pennsylvania what they believe they are owed even though you know the revenue stream went to another state i dont i dont think that thats my responsibility as a as a conscientious consumer   i ill agree it its not your responsibility but is but is it also legal for you to do that what what from from what i understand from various various various net readings it it it the federal government is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes um in into place in the next few years it is it is a lost revenue stream right now and states can can use all the revenue they can get with some with something like that will do your arguments still apply   well i think that if if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion then i dont argue with it because its not a burden on the consumer to remember that oh i bought this out of state i need  to Xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to Pennsylvania   which is exactly what businesses do at the present   right but the point is is that businesses do that the business that you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question thats a cost of doing business the burden shouldnt be placed on the consumer   and i i i was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then having having to pay sales tax on it   ah   thats my understanding of the way um the way it works usually the the person ordering it doesnt pay but the accounting department will uh suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay and there reasons there are some some substantial nasty penalties um if you if businesses try to avoid that   uh do you mean businesses from the point of view as of of selling things to a consumer and then being responsible for the sales tax   a as if no businesses um if   or purchasing   purchasing things mail order if i if im a computer consulting firm and i see these this great deal on forty eighty six motherboards uh from from say Utah um i i might buy the motherboards from Utah but then still have to pay some Pennsylvania sales tax my apartment accounting department will at the end of the month uh i think that  i think thats the way things work in Pennsylvania and i know they work that way in uh say here in DC   yeah see im unfamiliar with that because i dont i never see that end of the business   yeah   so my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer um but if thats the case if the business is responsible for policing themselves then i think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that um the opportunity for to forget that you owe sales tax for something uh can be avoided   thats true is is a real a big hole does exist right now uh in that consumers can just say oh i i forgot that there there is no well defined mechanism at all and and that it is a  a a loss i i think is that the federal government will try to establish a mechanism just just to do just that in order in order to gain the revenue thats being lost um and i i dont know if i agree with that but it but
