                            At some time almost  billion years ago nature likely was faced with a chemical        dilemma Nucleic acids had emerged as replicable information carriers and primitive        catalysts Joyce  yet their functional potential was constrained by their structural        homogeneity and lack of reactive groups These properties rendered nucleic acids well        suited for storing information but flawed for mediating the diverse chemistries required        to sustain and improve increasingly complex biological systems It is tempting to speculate        that translation emerged as the solution to this dilemma Translation defined here as the        conversion of an informationcarrying molecule into a corresponding encoded structure        enabled the expanded functional potential of proteins to be explored using powerful        evolutionary methods that depend on the unique ability of nucleic acids to replicate        A small but growing number of researchers have begun to tackle a modern version of this        dilemma While proteins and nucleic acids can be manipulated using powerful molecular        biology techniques that enable their directed evolution the size fragility and        relatively limited functional group diversity of biological macromolecules make them poorly        suited for solving many problems in the chemical sciences Ideally researchers would like        to apply evolutionbased approaches to the discovery of functional synthetic rather than        biological molecules A solution analogous to natures translation of mRNA into protein        could in principle address this contemporary problem Orgel  Gartner and Liu         If a laboratory system were developed that could translate amplifiable information carriers        such as DNA into arbitrary synthetic molecules the evolution of synthetic molecules using        iterated cycles of translation selection amplification and diversification would be        possible        The translation of DNA into synthetic molecules is conceptually distinct from the use of        DNA simply as a tag during the solidphase synthesis of a molecule that is part of a        combinatorial library Brenner and Lerner  The latter process uses DNA to record the        history of a series of chemical reactions by cosynthesizing a portion of a DNA        oligonucleotide during each step of a molecules solidphase synthesis As a result the        identity of compounds that pass screening can be inferred by PCR amplification and        sequencing of the DNA associated with a given bead Needels et al  The resulting        DNA however cannot redirect the synthesis of active compounds In contrast the        translation of DNA into synthetic molecules uses the sequence of nucleotides in a strand of        DNA to direct the synthesis of a nascent molecule As a result a complete cycle of        translation selection and amplification can be applied to the discovery of synthetic        molecules in a manner that is analogous to the processes that take place during biological        evolution        DNAtemplated organic synthesis DTS has emerged as one way to translate DNA sequences        into a variety of complex synthetic small molecules Gartner and Liu  Gartner et al         Li and Liu  In this approach starting materials covalently linked to DNA        templates approximately  nucleotides in length are combined in very dilute solutions        with reagents that are covalently linked to complementary DNA oligonucleotides Upon        WatsonCrick base pairing the proximity of the synthetic reactive groups elevates their        effective molarity by several orders of magnitude inducing a chemical reaction Because        reactions do not take place between reactants linked to mismatched noncomplementary DNA        DTS generates synthetic products in a manner that is programmed by the sequence of bases in        the template strand        In a series of three papers in this issue of         PLoS Biology  Harbury and coworkers describe an elegant new approach to        translating DNA into synthetic peptides called DNA display Their approach uses DNA        hybridization to separate mixtures of DNA sequences into spatially distinct locations The        first paper Halpin and Harbury a reports the development of resinlinked        oligonucleotides that efficiently and sequencespecifically capture DNA containing        complementary subsequences This immobilization process is efficient enough to be iterated        so that DNA sequences specifying multiple amino acids can be routed to the appropriate        miniature resinfilled columns during each step        In the second paper Halpin and Harbury b Harbury and coworkers detail solidphase        peptide synthesis performed on unprotected DNA mers bound to DEAE Sepharose        Optimization of amino acid sidechainprotecting groups and peptide coupling conditions        enabled a variety of amino acids to undergo efficient peptide coupling to bound        oligonucleotides containing an amine group        The third paper Halpin et al  integrates the routing and peptide synthesis        described above into the translation of a library of          DNA mers into a corresponding library of up to          synthetic pentapeptides To achieve chemical translation the DNA        library was subjected to iterated cycles of routing and solidphase peptide synthesis After        each routing step the appropriate amino acid was coupled to each DNAlinked subpopulation        DNA routing was therefore used to achieve the splitting step of splitandpool        combinatorial peptide synthesis The completed library of peptideDNA conjugates was then        subjected to in vitro selection based on the ability to bind an antibody with known        affinity for the Leuenkephalin pentapeptide TyrGlyGlyPheLeu After two rounds of        routing synthesis and selection followed by DNA sequencing the remaining        oligonucleotides predominantly encoded the TyrGlyGlyPheLeu sequence or close variants        thereof This result demonstrates that the DNA display method is capable of facilitating        the discovery of functional molecules by enabling in vitro selection methods to be applied        to molecules generated by splitandpool combinatorial synthesis        The fundamental distinctions between DTS and DNA display approaches to chemical        translation imply that these two strategies will be applicable to different types of        synthetic structures Because the DNA display approach separates the DNA hybridization step        from the chemical synthesis step it does not require the coupling of synthetic reagents to        oligonucleotides beyond the starting material and can use reaction conditions such as        high temperatures or high pH that may not be compatible with DNA hybridization These        features suggest that DNA display may be able to access structures that cannot be created        by DTS Likewise because DTS approaches use effective molarity rather than intermolecular        reactivity to direct organic synthesis they enable modes of controlling reactivity such        as using otherwise incompatible reactions in a single solution Calderone et al  and        classes of chemical reactions such as heterocoupling of substrates that preferentially        homocouple that cannot be accessed using splitandpool synthesis In principle these two        approaches are complementary and it is tantalizing to envision the use of both DNA display        and DTS to direct different steps during a single chemical translation        In order for either approach to fully realize its potential of truly         evolving libraries of diverse synthetic molecules rather than simply        enriching libraries that already contain at the outset the most fit molecule researchers        must develop sophisticated library syntheses that generate remarkable complexity vast        numbers of different compounds in a relatively modest number of DNAcompatible synthetic        steps True evolution takes place when the theoretical complexity of a population exceeds        the number of different molecules that can be created in a single library translation step        and when diversification is required to access compounds in later generations that are more        fit than any member of the starting pool        To my knowledge no synthetic library to date contains this degree of complexity        indeed the total size of the Chemical Abstracts Service database of known chemical        substances is presently less than          compounds However because so few copies of a DNAlinked synthetic        molecule are required for in vitro selection Doyon et al compared with the        relatively large quantities of material that are required for conventional screening        approachesthese chemical translation methods offer the first hope of achieving such        synthetic complexity without requiring an impractical amount of material or storage space        For comparison a conventionalformat synthetic library containing  g of each of          different structures would represent  kg of material not including        the mass of beads or plates associated with the library while a chemically translated        library containing  copies of          different species represents less than  g of total material        While significant remaining challenges face efforts to develop and apply chemical        translation the promise of marrying evolution and organic synthesis is an irresistible        combination for some researchers The work of Harbury and coworkers described in this        issue represents the latest approach to the very ancient problem of translating replicable        information into functional structures
