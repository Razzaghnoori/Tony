                        PREFACE            We present the narrative of this report and the recommendations that flow from it to                the President of the United States the United States Congress and the American                people for their consideration Ten Commissionersfive Republicans and five                Democrats chosen by elected leaders from our nations capital at a time of great                partisan divisionhave come together to present this report without dissent            We have come together with a unity of purpose because our nation demands it                September   was a day of unprecedented shock and suffering in the history of                the United States The nation was unprepared How did this happen and how can we                avoid such tragedy again            To answer these questions the Congress and the President created the National                Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States Public Law  November                             Our mandate was sweeping The law directed us to investigate facts and circumstances                relating to the terrorist attacks of September   including those relating                to intelligence agencies law enforcement agencies diplomacy immigration issues                and border control the flow of assets to terrorist organizations commercial                aviation the role of congressional oversight and resource allocation and other                areas determined relevant by the Commission In pursuing our mandate we have                reviewed more than  million pages of documents and interviewed more than                 individuals in ten countries This included nearly every senior official from the                current and previous administrations who had responsibility for topics covered in                our mandate We have sought to be independent impartial thorough and nonpartisan                From the outset we have been committed to share as much of our investigation as we                can with the American people To that end we held  days of hearings and took                public testimony from  witnesses            Our aim has not been to assign individual blame Our aim has been to provide the                fullest possible account of the events surrounding  and to identify lessons                learned            We learned about an enemy who is sophisticated patient disciplined and lethal The                enemy rallies broad support in the Arab and Muslim world by demanding redress of                political grievances but its hostility toward us and our values is limitless Its                purpose is to rid the world of religious and political pluralism the plebiscite                and equal rights for women It makes no distinction between military and civilian                targets Collateral damage is not in its lexicon            We learned that the institutions charged with protecting our borders civil aviation                and national security did not understand how grave this threat could be and did not                adjust their policies plans and practices to deter or defeat it We learned of                fault lines within our governmentbetween foreign and domestic intelligence and                between and within agencies We learned of the pervasive problems of managing and                sharing information across a large and unwieldy government that had been built in a                different era to confront different dangers            At the outset of our work we said we were looking backward in order to look forward                We hope that the terrible losses chronicled in this report can create something                positivean America that is safer stronger and wiser That September day we came                together as a nation The test before us is to sustain that unity of purpose and                meet the challenges now confronting us We need to design a balanced strategy for                the long haul to attack terrorists and prevent their ranks from swelling while at                the same time protecting our country against future attacks We have been forced to                think about the way our government is organized The massive departments and                agencies that prevailed in the great struggles of the twentieth century must work                together in new ways so that all the instruments of national power can be combined                Congress needs dramatic change as well to strengthen oversight and focus                accountability            As we complete our final report we want to begin by thanking our fellow                Commissioners whose dedication to this task has been profound We have reasoned                together over every page and the report has benefited from this remarkable                dialogue We want to express our considerable respect for the intellect and judgment                of our colleagues as well as our great affection for them            We want to thank the Commission staff The dedicated professional staff headed by                Philip Zelikow has contributed innumerable hours to the completion of this report                setting aside other important endeavors to take on this allconsuming assignment                They have conducted the exacting investigative work upon which the Commission has                built They have given good advice and faithfully carried out our guidance They                have been superb We thank the Congress and the President Executive branch agencies                have searched records and produced a multitude of documents for us We thank                officials past and present who were generous with their time and provided us with                insight The PENTTBOM team at the FBI the Directors Review Group at the CIA and                Inspectors General at the Department of Justice and the CIA provided great                assistance We owe a huge debt to their investigative labors painstaking attention                to detail and readiness to share what they have learned We have built on the work                of several previous Commissions and we thank the Congressional Joint Inquiry whose                fine work helped us get started We thank the City of New York for assistance with                documents and witnesses and the Government Printing Office and WW Norton                 Company for helping to get this report to the broad public            We conclude this list of thanks by coming full circle We thank the families of                 whose persistence and dedication helped create the Commission They have been with                us each step of the way as partners and witnesses They know better than any of us                the importance of the work we have undertaken            We want to note what we have done and not done We have endeavored to provide the                most complete account we can of the events of September  what happened and why                This final report is only a summary of what we have done citing only a fraction of                the sources we have consulted But in an event of this scale touching so many                issues and organizations we are conscious of our limits We have not interviewed                every knowledgeable person or found every relevant piece of paper New information                inevitably will come to light We present this report as a foundation for a better                understanding of a landmark in the history of our nation            We have listened to scores of overwhelming personal tragedies and astounding acts of                heroism and bravery We have examined the staggering impact of the events of  on                the American people and their amazing resilience and courage as they fought back We                have admired their determination to do their best to prevent another tragedy while                preparing to respond if it becomes necessary We emerge from this investigation with                enormous sympathy for the victims and their loved ones and with enhanced respect                for the American people We recognize the formidable challenges that lie ahead            We also approach the task of recommendations with humility We have made a limited                number of them We decided consciously to focus on recommendations we believe to be                most important whose implementation can make the greatest difference We came into                this process with strong opinions about what would work All of us have had to                pause reflect and sometimes change our minds as we studied these problems and                considered the views of others We hope our report will encourage our fellow                citizens to study reflectand
