 Introduction IL 1 has been implicated as a pathogenic mediator in numerous inflammatory and degenerative conditions including rheumatoid arthritis RA and osteoarthritis OA 1 The IL 1 receptor antagonist IL 1Ra a naturally occurring inhibitor of the biologic actions of IL 1 has obvious therapeutic potential in such diseases 2 indeed recombinant human IL 1Ra anakinra has recently been approved for use in patients with RA as the drug Kineret Amgen Inc Thousand Oaks CA USA Limitations of IL 1Ra as a pharmaceutical include its lack of oral availability and its short biologic half life This is why in clinical application Kineret must be administered by daily subcutaneous injection Even then it remains unlikely that a therapeutic concentration of IL 1Ra will be maintained between injections 3 IL 1Ra is rapidly eliminated in the kidney resulting in a serum half life of 4 6 hours following intravenous injection into healthy human volunteers This problem is exacerbated by the pronounced spare receptor effect of IL 1 According to the literature 4 5 6 it is necessary to maintain an IL 1Ra IL 1 molar ratio of 10 100 or more to achieve a strong inhibitory effect We have proposed IL 1Ra gene transfer as a means of overcoming these problems 7 The advantages of IL 1Ra gene delivery include its ability to engender the continuous production of therapeutic concentrations of IL 1Ra at defined anatomic locations for extended periods of time potentially for life Moreover it is theoretically possible to regulate levels of IL 1Ra gene expression in a manner commensurate with disease activity 8 IL 1Ra gene therapy has been evaluated in a number of different animal models of RA and OA with extremely promising results 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Indeed a phase I human study of IL 1Ra gene therapy in RA 19 was recently successfully completed During the preclinical development of IL 1Ra gene therapy we often noticed that transfer of the IL 1Ra gene provided a far greater biologic effect than administration of the recombinant protein An example is provided by the treatment of antigen induced arthritis in rabbits Lewthwaite and coworkers 20 reported that repeated injection of recombinant human IL 1Ra had no effect in this model of RA beyond inhibition of the synovial fibrosis occurring in the chronic stage of the disease Otani and colleagues 16 in contrast observed a dramatic beneficial effect on cartilage matrix metabolism and a moderate anti inflammatory effect when administering IL 1Ra locally to joints via ex vivo gene transfer There exist several possible explanations for the improved effectiveness of IL 1Ra when delivered as a gene rather than as a recombinant protein The most likely of these are as follows First gene transfer results in continuous rather than intermittent protein delivery thus maintaining a constant supply of IL 1Ra at a concentration sufficient to inhibit the biologic actions of IL 1 Second gene delivery produces a molecule that has been subjected to authentic post translational processing Because the recombinant molecule lacks glycosylation and has an extra amino terminal methionine the native molecule may have greater biologic potency than the recombinant one The present study was designed to compare quantitatively the relative effectiveness of these two avenues of protein delivery under controlled conditions in vitro Cultures of primary human synovial fibroblasts HSFs were treated with human IL 1Ra either administered as the recombinant protein or by co culture with fibroblasts genetically engineered to express and secrete human IL 1Ra in a constitutive manner Stimulation from human IL 1 was then provided by addition of recombinant IL 1 protein or by co culture with fibroblasts genetically engineered to constitutively secrete high levels of human IL 1 21 Using prostaglandin E 2 PGE 2 levels in conditioned media as a readout of IL 1 stimulation in the respective cultures protection from IL 1 stimulation by each method was evaluated under static and dynamic culture conditions the latter of which were designed to resemble more closely the circumstance of an arthritic joint in which IL 1 is chronically produced The data suggest that the recombinant and transgenic molecules are similarly potent Although the gene delivery procedure may benefit marginally from increased concentration at the cellular level the advantage of gene transfer as a means of drug delivery arises from the sustained availability of IL 1Ra that this method permits Materials and method Materials Ham s F12 medium Dulbecco s modified Eagle medium DMEM fetal bovine serum FBS penicillin streptomycin type II collagenase dispase and Geneticin were supplied by Gibco BRL Rockville MD USA Zeocin was obtained from Invitrogen Carlsbad Ca USA Recombinant human IL 1 and IL 1Ra were purchased from R D Systems Minneapolis MN USA ELISA kits for PGE 2 and IL 1Ra were purchased from Dynatech Ann Arbor MI USA and R D Systems respectively ELISA kits for human IL 1 were purchased from Endogen Woburn MA USA Reporter cell cultures Human synovial tissues were recovered from joints of OA patients undergoing total joint replacement surgery HSFs were isolated by sequential digestion of synovial fragments with 1 5 dispase for 2 hours at 37 C and 0 2 collagenase for 2 hours After washing in phosphate buffered saline the cells were cultured in 25 cm 2dishes in DMEM with 10 FBS and 1 penicillin streptomycin After the third passage the type B synovial cells were trypsinized counted and cultured at a density of 5 10 5cells per well in 24 well plates with 1 ml DMEM supplemented with 10 FBS and 1 penicillin streptomycin Engineered cell lines To generate a cell line that provided a source of constitutive production and secretion of transgenic IL 1Ra the rabbit synovial cell line HIG 82 22 was cultured in 25 cm 2flasks containing 4 ml Ham s F12 medium with 10 FBS and 1 penicillin streptomycin Cells were grown to approximately 75 confluence and incubated in the presence of 8 g ml polybrene with 2 ml supernatant containing amphotropic retrovirus DFG IRAP zeo rcontaining the human IL 1Ra and Streptoalloteichus hindustanus bleomycin resistance Sh ble zeo r genes The latter allowed positive selection of the transduced cells in medium containing Zeocin at 0 5 mg ml These cells HIG 82 IL 1Ra were found to secrete approximately 3 g IL 1Ra ml per 10 6cells over 24 hours The HIG 82 cells were chosen for this purpose because they do not produce PGE 2 in response to IL 1 Non transduced HIG 82 cells used as negative controls were cultured in Ham s F12 medium with 10 FBS and 1 penicillin streptomycin To generate cells that constitutively expressed human IL 1 skin was first harvested from a euthanized Wistar rat Charles River Laboratories Wilmington MA USA minced with a scalpel and digested for 2 hours at 37 C under gentle agitation with 0 2 clostridial collagenase Dermal cells were recovered by centrifugation of the digestion mixture at 5000 rpm in a table top centrifuge and then cultured in 25 cm 2flasks in DMEM with 10 FBS and 1 penicillin streptomycin Adherent cells were transduced with an amphotropic retrovirus DFG hIL 1 neo which encodes the mature form of human IL 1 fused to the leader sequence of human parathyroid hormone to enable efficient secretion and neomycin phosphotransferase 21 Retroviral transductants were positively selected in complete DMEM containing Geneticin at 0 5 mg ml These cells were found to secrete approximately 250 ng human IL 1 ml per 10 6cells over 24 hours IL 1 receptor antagonist and IL 1 treatment Human IL 1Ra or IL 1 was delivered as a recombinant protein or by expression of its cDNA from genetically modified cells For the addition of cells cultures of HIG 82 IL 1Ra or dermal fibroblasts secreting IL 1 were trypsinized washed in PBS and resuspended in complete DMEM The cells were then counted using a hemocytometer and the appropriate number suspended in 50 l DMEM for subsequent addition to the multiwell HSF cultures Biological assays PGE 2 IL 1 and IL 1Ra concentrations in conditioned media were measured using ELISA according to the manufacturers instructions These assays do not show any cross reactivity with other prostanoids or rabbit and rat forms of IL 1 or IL 1Ra Under certain culture conditions such as those described in Figs 2 3 4 5 approximately 1 20 or 50 l of the media volume was removed periodically and replaced in order to allow analysis at strategic time points without significantly altering the evolving culture conditions Statistical analysis All results are presented as means SD Statistical analyses were performed using an unpaired Student s t test and P 0 05 was considered statistically significant Results To quantitatively compare the ability of recombinant r IL 1Ra and IL 1Ra provided by genetically modified cells i e transgenic t IL 1Ra to inhibit the effects of IL 1 we performed a series of experiments using both static and dynamic conditions of IL 1 stimulation Because the synovium is an important contributor to pathogenesis in arthritis primary cultures of HSFs were used as target cells and concentrations of PGE 2 in media conditioned by the HSFs were used as a measure of IL 1 stimulation In our initial experiments we compared the inhibitory activity of rIL 1Ra to that of HIG 82 IL 1Ra cells a cell line engineered to constitutively express human IL 1Ra when each was added to HSF cultures simultaneously with IL 1 For this 5 ng IL 1 was added to 5 10 5HSFs accompanied by either a range of doses of rIL 1Ra or increasing numbers of HIG 82 IL 1Ra cells Forty eight hours later the conditioned media were analyzed for IL 1Ra and PGE 2 concentrations A plot of IL 1Ra concentration versus PGE 2 production of the IL 1Ra treated cells relative to PGE 2 levels of control HSFs incubated with IL 1 alone is shown in Fig 1 Over a wide range of doses the recombinant and transgenic sources of IL 1Ra were similarly capable of blocking the effects of the added IL 1 For each source of IL 1Ra 50 IL 1 inhibition was extrapolated to a concentration of approximately 230 ng ml IL 1Ra and complete inhibition at approximately 800 ng ml This translated to IL 1Ra IL 1 ratios of approximately 46 1 and 160 1 respectively In control experiments levels of PGE 2 produced by IL 1 challenge of co culture of HSFs with nontransduced HIG 82 cells were found to be identical to those of HSFs alone data not shown Relative to the end point concentrations of IL 1Ra there was no apparent difference in the effectiveness of the two sources By adding the recombinant protein and the modified cells at the same time as IL 1 the concentration of rIL 1Ra would be at its maximum at the time of initial IL 1 stimulation That of the tIL 1Ra however would be essentially zero and would not reach its maximal concentration until 48 hours later at the time of media harvest Using this rationale we compared the effectiveness of rIL 1Ra and tIL 1Ra under conditions in which the concentration of each would be similar at the time of IL 1 stimulation To allow sufficient time for the IL 1Ra producing cells to adhere and begin transgenic expression we performed experiments similar to that above but added the IL 1 24 hours after addition of the range of doses of rIL 1Ra or tIL 1Ra producing cells to the HSF cultures The conditioned media were analyzed at the time of IL 1 addition and 48 hours later for PGE 2 and IL 1Ra content A plot of the IL 1Ra concentrations versus PGE 2 production relative to IL 1 stimulated controls is shown in Fig 2 To illustrate the change in IL 1Ra concentration over time in the wells receiving the IL 1Ra producing cells we plotted the final PGE 2 concentration versus the IL 1Ra concentration at the time of IL 1 stimulation and at the end of the 48 hour incubation Because these values represent the starting and end point IL 1Ra concentrations the effective tIL 1Ra dose should lie somewhere between and is represented by the shaded area between the two curves As might be expected of a competitive inhibitor preincubation of the HSF with IL 1Ra for 24 hours before IL 1 stimulation significantly reduced the 50 inhibition level for each source of IL 1Ra For the recombinant protein 50 IL 1 inhibition was extrapolated to 50 ng ml IL 1Ra and for the tIL 1Ra 50 inhibition fell between 10 and 50 ng ml For complete inhibition approximately 950 ng ml rIL Ra was required whereas for the tIL 1Ra between 400 and 700 ng ml was necessary The previous experiments provided evidence that the two molecules rIL 1Ra and tIL 1Ra were functionally similar and equally capable of blocking the effects of IL 1 They also suggested that time was a factor critical to comparing the effectiveness of rIL 1Ra and IL 1Ra constitutively produced by genetically modified cells Thus in several additional experiments we monitored the relationship between IL 1Ra and IL 1 stimulation daily over a 96 hour interval For these experiments three doses of rIL 1Ra or HIG 82 IL 1Ra cells were used which from Fig 2provided either low approximately 10 15 medium approximately 25 50 or high level approximately 70 80 inhibition of IL 1 HSFs were cultured in the presence of the various doses of cells or protein followed 24 hours later by the addition of 5 ng IL 1 At 24 hour intervals IL 1Ra and PGE 2 were measured in the conditioned media As shown in Fig 3 under these static culture conditions there was little meaningful change in the levels of PGE 2 production over time At the low and medium doses rIL 1Ra had little protective effect but relative to the 24 hour time point a significant increase in IL 1 stimulation was seen in the wells receiving the high dose by day 4 In the wells receiving the HIG 82 IL 1Ra cells protection from IL 1 stimulation was maintained over time Although the mean levels of PGE 2 were reduced over the 4 days of the experiment this was not statistically significant Thus under these conditions there were no dramatic differences between a single dose of rIL 1Ra and the tIL 1Ra producing cells It has been shown in vivo that agents injected into the joint space can be cleared from the synovial fluid in as little as 30 min suggesting a steady egress of solutes from the joint Thus to compare the effects of rIL 1Ra and tIL 1Ra producing cells under more dynamic conditions perhaps closer to those that might be encountered in the joint in vivo experiments were performed identically to that described for Fig 3except that one half of the culture media was replaced every 24 hours for 4 days Analysis of media recovered at each day showed that the medium and low doses of rIL 1Ra provided a marginal level of protection over time and in wells receiving the highest dose initially high levels of protection were steadily lost Fig 4 In stark contrast the HSFs incubated with the IL 1Ra producing cells exhibited a sharp reduction in PGE 2 production throughout the course of the experiment For these groups HSF cultures receiving even the lowest dose of HIG 82 IL 1Ra cells showed approximately 70 inhibition of IL 1 at 96 hours The previous experiment was intended to evaluate the effects of IL 1Ra under dynamic conditions following a single stimulus of IL 1 To establish a situation of chronic IL 1 stimulation as might be encountered in an arthritic joint experiments were designed like that described for Figure 4 but in this case the source of IL 1 was provided by the addition of dermal fibroblasts genetically modified to constitutively secrete mature human IL 1 As shown in Fig 5 using these conditions the single dose of rIL 1Ra was unable to block the effects of persistent IL 1 production Even at the highest dose the steady dilution of rIL 1Ra in the presence of constant IL 1 synthesis rapidly lost its protective effects In this milieu however the potency of gene transfer as a method of drug delivery was perhaps most effectively illustrated The maintenance of and gradual increase in IL 1Ra concentration provided by ongoing synthesis by the genetically modified cells at all doses provided sustained and increased protection from chronic synthesis of IL 1 over time Discussion For the treatment of arthritis gene therapy has the theoretical advantage over protein therapy of sustained delivery of the therapeutic product to a discrete site Although its feasibility and effectiveness in animal models are now well established 13 14 16 17 18 19 23 24 25 no direct study of the intrinsic merits of using genetically modified cells as a mechanism for protein delivery has been reported We postulated several potential benefits that could arise including natural protein processing and intercellular presentation of the transgene product Indeed it is known that anakinra the recombinant form of human IL 1Ra differs from its naturally occurring counterpart by possessing an additional amino terminal methionine residue and lacking glycosylation 26 In the first part of the present study similar end point levels of transgenic and recombinant IL 1Ra were necessary to inhibit fully the response of synoviocytes to a single challenge with IL 1 Furthermore and in agreement with earlier literature on this subject 4 5 27 both forms of IL 1Ra required a molar excess over IL 1 of at least two orders of magnitude to exercise an inhibition of 100 Altogether these data suggest that the biochemical alterations of the recombinant IL 1Ra do not significantly affect its ability to antagonize the responses of synovial fibroblasts to human IL 1 From the data presented in Fig 2 however a modest increase in the effectiveness of tIL 1Ra is suggested when one considers the relative concentrations of recombinant and transgenic IL 1Ra with time In experiments in which IL 1 was added at the same time as the source of IL 1Ra similar end point concentrations of IL 1Ra were found to provide corresponding inhibitory effects despite the fact that the recombinant protein was at its maximal concentration at the time of IL 1 stimulation whereas that from the modified cells was zero In other experiments in which prior to IL 1 stimulation time was allowed for the IL 1Ra producing cells to establish concentrations equivalent to that of the recombinant the inhibitory curve was shifted slightly to the left indicating a slight increase in the effectiveness of IL 1Ra when provided as a transgene product This may arise from increased concentrations of the IL 1Ra gene product in the cellular microenvironment where the protein is locally synthesized and secreted Interestingly following extended culture under static conditions largely unremarkable differences in activity were observed between the constitutively produced tIL 1Ra and rIL 1Ra Significant differences between the two methods of protein delivery were only found under dynamic conditions in which the concentration of rIL 1Ra was reduced with time In these situations such as that reported in Figs 4and 5 the importance of maintaining the local level of IL 1Ra became dramatically apparent as were the advantages of gene transfer as a means of protein delivery In the face of continual dilution the constitutive production of the IL 1Ra gene product was able to maintain effective protein levels and was able to sustain and increase protection of the HSFs from IL 1 stimulation as time progressed This was even more pronounced under conditions of continuing IL 1 production in which the rIL 1Ra was readily overwhelmed It should be noted that all of the experiments performed in this study used HSFs derived from OA patients It remains possible that the amplitude of the responses to IL 1 and IL 1Ra may vary somewhat between HSFs from OA RA and nondiseased individuals however the overall result will probably remain the same In rodent models of RA maximum therapeutic effects are only achieved when pumps are used to maintain a constant supply of large amounts of recombinant IL 1Ra Under these conditions IL 1Ra has both antierosive and anti inflammatory effects in collagen induced arthritis As discussed by Bendele and coworkers 3 constant serum concentrations of approximately 1 g IL 1Ra ml are antierosive but it is necessary to achieve serum concentrations of approximately 5 g IL 1Ra ml before important anti inflammatory effects are seen A single subcutaneous injection of 150 mg recombinant IL 1Ra in humans achieves a peak plasma concentration of only about 1 6 g IL 1Ra ml and concentrations superior or equal to 1 g IL 1Ra ml exist only for about 14 hours Local intra articular gene delivery of IL 1Ra could produce enough protein with only a single injection of vector to trigger both antierosive and anti inflammatory local effects This is of real interest because the clinical response to Kineret is modest and might be explained by these circumstances Moreover its antierosive effect is more pronounced than the anti inflammatory one probably because of the low local concentrations As suggested by our results maintaining higher in vivo concentrations of IL 1Ra in a sustained manner may be key to realizing the full therapeutic potential of this material Gene delivery may offer the greatest chance of early success Recent data from our laboratory have shown that the synovial lining is capable of maintaining therapeutic levels of transgene expression for at least 6 months 28 providing increased optimism for the use of gene transfer in the treatment of chronic articular disease Indeed IL 1Ra gene therapy has demonstrated impressive efficacy in animal models of RA and OA and a phase I human trial has recently confirmed that the human IL 1Ra cDNA can be safely transferred to and expressed within human rheumatoid joints 19 A planned phase II study will determine the efficacy of this procedure Conclusion Recombinant human IL 1Ra and human IL 1Ra synthesized transgenically in mammalian cells are equipotent antagonists of human IL 1 Our data indicate that the greater efficiency noted for transgenic IL 1Ra in previous animal gene therapy investigations reflects the ability of gene delivery to maintain higher in vivo concentrations of IL 1Ra in a sustained manner This property was particularly striking under experimental conditions that resemble those found during chronic inflammatory conditions in which IL 1 is produced continually and the concentration of rIL 1Ra administered as a single bolus progressively falls These findings are relevant to the clinical use of Kineret and the possible future use of IL 1Ra gene therapy to treat joint diseases Competing interests None
