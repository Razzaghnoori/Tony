 The Business of Net Campaigns Twelve years ago I worked at a small left leaning think tank in New York City As the 1988 presidential primary election approached we thought the voters might want to differentiate between the various candidates So we drew up 15 questions covering everything from reflagging oil tankers in the Persian Gulf a hot issue at the time to gay and lesbian rights We then mailed letters to the dozen or so declared candidates from both parties and requested position statements from their campaigns We deliberately cc d the issues managers figuring that this clever move would expedite the responses It didn t The Republicans practically ignored us The Democrats had to be wooed cajoled and mildly threatened before they coughed up their answers Ultimately we printed a decent sized booklet and sold several thousand copies at 10 apiece It was a modest contribution to the cause of an informed electorate and it yielded an equally modest return on the investment of our 100 or so hard worked hours Today it would take just a couple of hours for a person with a Web connection and a printer to produce a similar document for the 2000 presidential race Each of the declared presidential candidates maintains a sophisticated Web site that details positions on a wide range of critical issues Granted if you visit http gopatgo2000 org click on Issues and read Pat Buchanan s statement on the environment you may find the air a bit thin But this is presidential politics and vague positions are hardly unique to cyberspace As with other areas of the Net e mail is the great connector Any campaign can now take a press release that at one time would have gone to a few dozen political reporters and e mail it to tens of thousands even millions of Internet users That remarkable development helps to bind a portion of the electorate more tightly to the campaigns But we re still talking about a press release and any reporter will tell you that the value of such releases is inversely proportional to the volume received That s just one illustration of how the Net s contributions to American Democracy remains nascent and hard to define While the 2000 campaign will be the first presidential contest in which the Web plays a significant role it is unclear how profound that role will be see Jacob Weisberg s accompanying piece One of the premises of the Standard is that the Internet has seeped into and changed every important business in the United States and will soon have the same effect around the world Politics is not exempt Although it s all too often overlooked as a business American politics is a multibillion dollar industry that employs millions So it s the Standard s job to cover how the Internet will shape it And that s the mandate for our once a week contribution to Net Election Politics Meets E commerce What does politics as Net business mean In the most salient case campaigns themselves are businesses albeit short lived ones that cannot legally make a profit As of mid July more than six months before anyone could cast a vote for Bill Bradley the former basketball star had raised more than 240 000 through his Web site That s only about 2 percent of his contributions But the site wasn t operational until January Moreover it wasn t until June that the federal government said it would match online credit card contributions with public funds just as it matches money raised the old fashioned way With that decision every campaign has been rethinking its Internet fund raising strategies We ll be closely examining their renewed efforts One question that leaps to mind is Are there viable forms of e commerce that play off of a political audience To date the answer is essentially no Sure you can connect to the Arizona Democratic Party s online gift shop But how many donkey Beanie Babies do you think have been sold there eBay is not yet disturbed Still the tip of political e commerce is beginning to poke up through the Web s surface In May Texas Gov George W Bush tried to quash the parody site www gwbush com saying infamously There ought to be limits to freedom The result The site got 6 million hits in a month Net logic holds that eyeballs equal dollars and sure enough the controversial site was soon peddling T shirts and bumper stickers featuring Bush s quote Another site looking to cash in on the campaign is www gore2000 com It s not officially affiliated with the Gore campaign but the site sells a wide array of Gore paraphernalia everything from buttons to gourmet coffee And it gives a package of free collectibles to any Webmaster who picks up its banner Online Advertising Gets Political The Internet has already begun to transform the general advertising industry and it will soon hold sway over the tens of millions of dollars spent every electoral season on television and radio ads Web advertising holds the strange position of being almost entirely unregulated Fraud and defamation laws presumably apply to Net advertising just as they do to all advertising But the specific sections of communications law that constrain political speech in the electronic media including provisions for equal time for all candidates do not apply to the Internet Consider how such loopholes can alter the electronic media landscape Each weekday Steve Forbes records a brief commentary about his pertinent issues The Forbes campaign claims that more than 160 stations in 45 states carry this commentary Just because they carry it of course doesn t mean they actually play it five times a week According to federal regulations beginning 45 days before a primary any radio station that carries a prepared audio message from a presidential candidate is required to give equal time to any other candidate who requests it As a practical matter most radio stations in that situation would simply drop the Forbes editorials But his Web site can continue to pump out a Netcast with no interference Changes like these should spur Net piggybacking throughout the 2000 race Here s how it works Say a candidate is adamantly opposed to any form of new taxes regardless of whether they are advocated by the opponent So the candidate crafts a 15 second TV spot that does not directly attack her opponent but warns viewers of an ominous high tax future and instructs them to punch up www nonewtaxes com where they ll find a complete history of the opponent s record on taxation Viewers might be asked to fill out petitions with their ZIP codes and e mail addresses which would be used to alert them to the ad s next installment These techniques have already been used in a number of Senate and congressional campaigns Finally we ll also be watching the Net polling Net focus groups and Net organizing that follow the flow of money around an election Our goal shared with editorial partner Slate is to capture the way the unfolding 2000 presidential race looks from the Web Whether you re a political junkie or not we hope you ll find Net Election informative enlightening and fun At least as much fun as presidential politics will allow
