 Background The ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria to infect and replicate inside host mononuclear phagocytes is key to its ability to establish an infection and cause tuberculosis To elucidate the mechanisms used by tubercle bacilli to survive in macrophages researchers at several laboratories are studying mycobacterial genes specifically expressed during growth in macrophages 1 2 3 4 5 6 Among the genes specifically expressed during intracellular growth are genes encoding two extracytoplasmic function sigma factors SigE E and SigH H 3 4 5 Sigma factors play critical roles in the recognition of promoters by RNA polymerase In several systems individual sigma factors are known to regulate the differential expression of sets of genes involved in specific processes such as genes involved in the heat shock response or those required for sporulation in Bacillus subtilis 7 8 Identifying a differentially expressed sigma factor can provide a means to identifying other differentially expressed genes genes whose expression are controlled by the sigma factor To identify sigma factor regulated genes we developed a method termed I TRAP for the i dentification of t ranscriptional r egulator a ctivated p romoters I TRAP takes advantage of the fact that some genes will be differentially expressed in the presence and absence of a transcription regulatory protein To identify transcription factor dependent promoters a genomic DNA library is generated in a promoter trap plasmid containing two reporter genes The library is transformed into strain expressing the transcription factor and recipients with plasmids containing an active promoter are selected by virtue of expression of one of the reporter genes The plasmids are recovered and transformed into a strain that does not express the transcription factor Promoters dependent on the expression of the regulator are differentiated from other promoters by screening for lack of reporter activity in bacteria not expressing the regulatory protein To illustrate the development and use of the I TRAP approach we describe here the construction of the vectors host strains and library necessary to identify E regulated genes of M tuberculosis Methods Bacterial strains and growth condition Bacterial strains are listed in Table 1 Escherichia coli strains were grown in Luria Broth LB or on LB agar

potassium phosphate buffer pH 7 4 Results Experimental strategy The basic I TRAP approach Figure 1 uses a genomic DNA library in a plasmid vector containing a promoterless operon with two reporter genes One reporter gene the aph gene which confers resistance to kanamycin allows for selection of active promoters and a second reporter gene the xylE gene which encodes catechol 2 3 dioxygenase allows for screening for loss of promoter activity In the first step of the I TRAP approach the recombinant plasmid library is transformed into bacteria expressing the transcriptional regulator Transformants containing plasmids with active promoters are isolated by selection on kanamycin containing media A subset of the active promoters will be those whose expression depends on the transcriptional regulator To differentiate between promoters dependent on the regulator and other promoters plasmid DNA from a pool of the kanamycin resistant transformants is transformed into bacteria that do not express the transcriptional regulator The hygromycin B resistant transformants are screened for XylE expression by spraying colonies with catechol Yellow colonies arise from bacteria that contain a plasmid with a transcriptionally active promoter White colonies arise from bacteria that contain a plasmid with a promoter that is inactive in the absence of the transcriptional regulator To develop the I TRAP method for identifying M tuberculosis promoters dependent on the expression of E a strain of M smegmatis over expressing the M tuberculosis E a Emutant strain of M smegmatis and a M tuberculosis promoter trap library were created Construction of E over expressing strain of M smegmatis The E over expressing strain of M smegmatis was made by transforming M smegmatis LR222 bacteria with pSEint 2 Figure 2 The pSEint 2 plasmid contains an oriE for plasmid replication in E coli the mycobacteriophage L5 integrase and attP site to allow integration into the M smegmatis chromosome two selectable genes ble bleomycin or zeocin resistance and amp ampicillin resistance and the M tuberculosis RV1221 ORF cloned downstream of the M tuberculosis hsp60 promoter In this strain the M tuberculosis sigE gene is maintained in a single copy in the genome and is constitutively expressed from the hsp60 promoter This strain is designated M smegmatis LR222 SEint 2 Table 1 Construction of sigEmutant strain of M smegmatis The suicide plasmid pSEKO 4 Figure 3 was constructed to interrupt the M smegmatis sigE gene by gene replacement 14 pSEKO 4 contains the M smegmatis sigE gene interrupted with a gentamicin resistance gene and the lacZ gene The pSEKO 4 DNA 1 g was UV irradiated in a UV Stratalinker 1800 Stratagene at 100 mJ cm 2and electroporated into M smegmatis cells Following outgrowth at 37 C for 4 h transformants were recovered by plating on TSA containing gentamicin and X Gal 24 white transformants were analyzed by PCR using primers 7997 and 7998 that bind to the sigE gene on either side of the aacC1 gene Table 2 Of the 24 transformants 11 had the M smegmatis sigE gene disrupted by aacC1 9 had only a single recombination event and 4 only had a wild type copy of sigE data not shown One transformant was chosen as the M smegmatis sigE mutant strain and designated LR222 sigE Table 1 Construction of a library in the promoter trap plasmid pSE 4 Figure 4 is a promoter trap plasmid containing a promoterless aph gene and xylE gene an E coli rRNA transcriptional terminator upstream of the reporter genes an oriM for plasmid replication in M smegmatis an oriE for plasmid replication in E coli and a hyg gene for selection in E coli and M smegmatis bacteria The plasmid contains a unique Bam HI site upstream of the promoterless reporter operon for cloning of potential promoters To generate fragments of the M tuberculosis H37Rv genome 3 0 g of genomic DNA was digested with 1 U Sau 3AI in 20 l total volume for 2 min at 37 C and the reaction stopped by heating at 65 C for 10 min This generated fragments between 100 and 6 000 bp data not shown Sau 3AI was removed from the reaction by phenol chloroform extraction DNA was ethanol precipitated and resuspended in 20 l Tris buffer pH 7 4 Approximately 470 ng digested genomic DNA was ligated with 200 ng pSE 4 DNA that had been digested with Bam HI and phosphatased DNA was ethanol precipitated from the ligation reaction and resuspended in water 200 ng DNA was electroporated into Electromax DH5 cells Recipient bacteria were spread on LB agar containing hygromycin B After overnight incubation at 37 C 50 colonies were selected at random plasmid DNA was harvested and genomic DNA inserts were sequenced using primer TN5 9R Table 2 All plasmids contained a unique M tuberculosis DNA segment and had an average insert size of approximately 200 bp data not shown To generate a library of recombinant plasmids 200 ng of the ligated sample were electroporated into Electromax DH5 cells The entire mixture was plated on 117 150 mm LB agar plates containing hygromycin B About 117 000 transformants were collected and pooled by flooding each plate with 2 ml LB and scraping the colonies off the plate Plasmid DNA was harvested from the pooled E coli transformants ethanol precipitated and resuspended in water Promoter selection and scoring To recover plasmids containing active promoters the plasmid library DNA was electroporated into M smegmatis LR222 SEint 2 bacteria which constitutively express the M tuberculosis sigE gene To determine the proportion of active promoters in the library a portion of the transformation mixture was spread on medium containing hygromycin B all recipients and a portion was spread on medium containing kanamycin recipients with an active promoter 1 93 10 6hygromycin B resistant colony forming units CFUs ml and 3 75 10 4kanamycin resistant CFU ml were recovered therefore approximately 1 9 of transformants contained an active promoter fragment When the initial pool of kanamycin resistant colonies sprayed with catechol the colonies were light to dark yellow indicating a wide range of XylE activity To differentiate between E dependent and independent promoters approximately 40 000 kanamycin resistant transformants were pooled and plasmid DNA was isolated and electroporated into M smegmatis LR222 sigE bacteria in which the wild type copy of the sigE gene had been disrupted with the gentamicin resistance gene Transformants were plated on hygromycin B and assayed for catechol 2 3 dioxygenase activity by spraying colonies with 0 5 M catechol About 20 000 colonies were sprayed with catechol and a range of color intensity from white to bright yellow was observed A total of 360 white and light yellow colonies were recovered Overall about 1 8 of hygromycin B resistant colonies were white or light yellow To confirm the phenotypes of plasmids recovered in this two step procedure plasmids were recovered from 18 white colonies and individually transformed into M smegmatis LR222 SEint 2 SigE expressing and M smegmatis LR222 sigE bacteria All 18 plasmids generated only white colonies when transformed into the E mutant strain However although all 18 plasmids generated yellow colonies when transformed into E expressing bacteria some plasmids produced a mixture of white and yellow colonies These white colonies were consistently white on retesting and their plasmids usually contained deletions that removed the cloned M tuberculosis sequence Replating of the yellow colonies produced a mixture of white and yellow colonies suggesting that the expression of the xylE or aph gene in the SigE expressing strain may be detrimental to the cell and may lead to plasmid instability A preliminary analysis of the sequences of the inserts in the 18 clones identified 6 inserts that had matches with the SigE consensus sequence 6 Interestingly none of these genes were identified as being SigE induced genes in microarray studies 6 although the expression of one of the genes Rv3223c sigH is thought to be SigE regulated 5 Discussion A key feature of the I TRAP method is that it allows two degrees of promoter analysis i e with and without a transcriptional regulator The first step allows selection of all active promoters under one condition and the second step sorts promoters by activity dependent on a second condition In the study reported here we used this method to identify potential E induced genes The basic I TRAP approach might also be used to identify promoters repressed by a particular protein The transformation steps are reversed so that the promoters are selected in the mutant background first i e no repressor and then screened for loss of activity in the presence of the repressor protein The I TRAP method might also be used to characterize promoter activity in two environmental conditions in a manner similar to the IVET approach 16 This is useful because in some cases the factor necessary for transcriptional activation during a particular environmental condition is unknown In this case after exposing bacteria containing the recombinant library to an environmental condition e g a heat shock or acid shock or growth in medium A antibiotics could be added to the medium to kill any bacteria that had not expressed the antibiotic resistance reporter gene during the exposure For mycobacteria a two hour treatment with kanamycin would be sufficient to kill bacteria that had not expressed the kanamycin resistance gene during the stress The resistant bacteria would then be grown in a second medium or in the absence of a stress and colonies scored for lack of promoter activity in the second condition by expression of the xylE reporter gene White colonies would contain a plasmid with a promoter that is active only during the first condition Using I TRAP for this purpose may provide a means to identify promoters dependent on any of several regulatory proteins that may be active during the stress and to obtain a global overview of gene expression during the stress In the I TRAP method the recipient strain can be the native bacterium or a surrogate host We used M smegmatis as the host because it grows much more rapidly than does M tuberculosis generation time of 3 hrs vs 24 hrs does not require BSL 3 facilities and is more easily manipulated genetically than M tuberculosis One possible advantage of using a surrogate host is that studies could be focused on one particular regulator which might avoid complications due to other regulatory proteins in the cell that may be able to recognize promoters in the library Of course the surrogate host must not have a regulatory protein that recognizes the same promoters as the regulator being studied In our studies the M smegmatis Eprotein has 92 homology with the M tuberculosis Eprotein 17 While this suggests that the M tuberculosis Eprotein should be able to interact properly with the M smegmatis RNA polymerase it also suggests that the M smegmatis Ehomolog might be able to recognize M tuberculosis E dependent promoters Because of this we constructed an M smegmatis host strain that lacked any functional Eprotein An assumption of the I TRAP approach is that the sequences cloned in the plasmids will be recognized by transcriptional regulatory proteins in the same manner as the intact sequences in the genome The cloning process might generate false positive or false negative results because of the cloned sequences being recognized out of the context of the surrounding genomic sequences Another assumption of the I TRAP approach is that over expression of a transcriptional regulator will be sufficient to induce gene expression from its regulated promoters This suggests that proteins such as PhoP that require activation to promote transcription may not be approachable with this method unless the over expressed regulatory protein can also be activated Also certain regulatory proteins may not be suitable for study in a surrogate host bacterium 18 For proteins that require the presence of additional factors such as N or interaction with host proteins to be active such as Ewith RNA polymerase use of the native bacterium or closely related surrogate host may be required to ensure the presence of the necessary interacting proteins 19 Some of these additional factors however may only be expressed or active under a particular growth condition and therefore may also need to be conditionally expressed along with the transcription factor Promoters that require both a positive transcription regulator and the absence of a repressor protein may be missed because expressing the positive transcription factor alone may not be sufficient to induce transcription at such promoters Another limitation of the I TRAP method is that some transcription factors may not be stably maintained in the bacterium or may be lethal to the bacterium when over expressed To avoid this problem an inducible promoter could be used to promote transcription of the gene encoding the transcription factor Another possible complication of this approach is that expressing a foreign protein may turn on the stress response of the host bacterium Transcription factors mediating the stress response to the expressed foreign protein may be able to recognize promoters within the library and promote transcription of the reporter genes thus producing the false positives in the two step screen Because the first step of the I TRAP method involves selection for active promoters one could easily begin with a library containing recombinants representing all possible promoters in a bacterial genome Unfortunately the recombinant DNA library used in this study contained only 65 of the genome in the correct orientation upstream of the reporter genes which will limit the number of different promoters we can recover using this library For the screening step we used the xylE gene because catechol 2 3 dioxygenase activity is easily measured by spraying colonies with catechol and the amount of color produced is a rough measure of promoter activity 10 In our screen white pale yellow and bright yellow colonies were observed indicating a wide range of promoter activity Pale yellow colonies may represent weak E independent promoters or promoters that are recognized by another sigma factor in addition to E providing a low level of constitutive expression These possibilities could be distinguished by transformation of plasmids from individual clones into the E over expressing strain and directly comparing of XylE activity in the presence and absence of E Unfortunately it appears that expression of XylE in M smegmatis may be detrimental and may lead to plasmid instability and loss of the inserted DNA This raises the possibility that some white colonies may arise in the second step of I TRAP by loss of a promoter fragment from a plasmid recovered in the first step Nonetheless the I TRAP method should greatly enrich for promoters with the desired activities As is generally true for genetic screens it is essential to study any identified promoters in their native state to understand the regulation of their expression Conclusions The I TRAP method is a versatile and useful method for characterizing promoter activity under a variety of conditions and in response to various regulatory proteins In our study we isolated 360 clones that may contain plasmids carrying SigE regulated promoters genes of M tuberculosis The analysis of these clones will be reported elsewhere Competing interests No competing interests for either author Authors contributions The work is a portion of MA
