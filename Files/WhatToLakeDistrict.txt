 condition there are walks or gentle strolls in the valley bottoms and        around the lake shores The paths around Derwent Water and Buttermere        are particularly relaxing They often take in areas of forest such as        at Grizedale or grassland and park land as at Mirehouse or Lingholm        Short walks to panoramic viewpoints should be a part of everyones        itinerary Try Loughrigg and Loughrigg Terrace easily reached from        Grasmere village for superb views of Windermere and Grasmere lakes On        these walks youll never be far from a caf or pub so its always        possible to break for lunch or refreshments        For those who want a slightly more challenging walk but        without a lot of hills to walk up and down there are a number of        routes in the Lake District with little or no gradient Paths along the        windswept bracken fells are for the most part flat and offer        spectacular views of surrounding peaks Examples include routes along        Wrynose bottom around Wast Water the path along the stream bed at        Watendlath or the course around Blea Tarn in the Langdale Fells the        latter two routes are especially beautiful These walks are a little        more off the beaten track and require advance planning in terms of        parking the car and obtaining refreshment but theyre rewarding        because of the rich variety of landscapes they cover        Very fit experienced walkers enjoy the peak walks which        involve steeper climbs and lead to the very highest points of the Lake        District These require a little more thought good equipment and some        form of refreshment such as a packed lunch these can often be prepared        by your hotel as they often take an entire day to complete The        easiest walks in this category are the ones up the popular peaks of        Helvellyn or Skiddawhere youll find well marked paths and most        times of the year plenty of company The most challenging area of all        is high above Wasdale Scafell Great Gable Pillar and Kirk Fell        offer challenge and excitement even to the professionals        Once you assess your own

Social Events        Agricultural shows        Every farming community in the Lake District has one day in        the year when it comes together to celebrate its way of life and        compete at various events These are a traditional part of country        lifetheyre not staged as tourist attractions but visitors are        always welcome Local farmers bring their livestock and engage in        serious rivalry for the champion rosettes The prizes are often mere        trinketsthe real payoff is when the animal comes to market since a        prize ram for example can make a lot of money at market later in the        year Family pride mixes with economics at these events Farming can be        a lonely life and even in modern times it is rare for the families to        take time off from the hard work and socialize These agricultural        shows offer families the opportunity to get together and have fun and        they offer visitors a rare chance to chat with the local farming        community        Sheepdog trials        The way sheepdogs do their job is a source of fascination        for visitors and of pride to the farmers who breed and train them Each        summer local farmers and their dogs get together for a friendly        competition the dog and farmer maneuver sheep around a set course        Both speed and accuracy are assessed to decide the winner Remember as        you watch these skillful operators that they cheerfully perform the        same tasks in snowdrifts and the thickest fog and cloud in the depths        of winter        Lakeland Sports Days        The men of the Lakes hard working and abstemious have        always found ways to enjoy themselves and this more often than not        involved means physical competition A number of sporting contests have        become part of Lakeland tradition Before the advent of cars it was        common to see hundreds of people walking towards the showgrounds and        often the best sportsmen from neighboring valleys came over the fells        to compete        The sports days are still taken as seriously by competitors        today as they were one hundred years ago Winners still become local        celebrities and their reputation reaches to the very corners of the        Lakes        One of the sports that developed in the Lake District is a        unique form of wrestling Two men stand face to face with their arms        wrapped around each others body hands clasped tightly together behind        the others back The men then try to unbalance their opponent The        first man to hit the ground with a part of the body other than the feet        loses the contest        Fell running also tests the mettle Competitors simply run        up and down the side of a fell taking obstacles like bogs streams        and rocks in their stride The fastest man wins        Hound trailing also once a part of daily life remains a        popular sport This is how it works in todays competitions an        aniseedscented trail is laid on the morning of the race and the dogs        are sent off across the fells to follow it disappearing out of sight        through the bracken Although the prize money is negligible you would        not think so when the dogs reappear and the enthusiastic owners call        whistle and wave them home        Hunting for live prey is still an important part of country        life but less popular than in John Peels day see page  Lake        District hunters follow the pack on foot rather than using horses        because the incline of the fells is too difficult for horses        Summer Festivals        The towns not to be outdone by the agricultural shows        also hold annual festivals such as the popular Victorian Festival at        Keswick or the Medieval Festival in Kendal both are in late May and        both feature crafts food stalls and artists and entertainers in        period costumes Many of the country houses also hold special events        such as antiques or crafts fairs or fun days with fair rides        throughout the summer months Check with the tourist information        centers for details about these and similar events at Dalemain Holker        Hall and Muncaster Castle        Rush Bearing        Rushes taken from the lakes were traditionally used to        carpet church floors in the Lake District and once a year to refresh        this floor covering children from the village would ceremonially carry        a new batch of rushes into the church This tradition has survived        though today in many places the children bear flowers or fruit rather        than rushes Two good places to witness the rushbearing ceremony are        St Marys Parish Church in Ambleside  July and Grasmere Parish        Church in Grasmere  August        Shopping        Natural raw materials found in the area have been used for        centuries to make beautiful decorative objects Slate horn wool and        wood were always used to make tools and implements but these materials        are now also being used in the production of interesting souvenirs        Favorite items that will help preserve your memories of the rugged        Lakeland countryside are clothing or blankets made from the local        Herdwick wool coasters of polished slate or walking sticks with        ramshorn handles        Crafts such as ceramics and potterymaking woodturning        and glassblowing are also popular Many individual craftspeople work        in the Lake District and as you wander youll find signs leading you        to their studios in converted barns and other outbuildings The prices        are not necessarily low but the quality of these handcrafted objects        is high Although every town has shops that sell these items a good        place to start would be the Made in Cumbria shop situated in the        Tourist Information Centre in Windermere they stock a wide range of        locally produced handicrafts        Visual artists find the natural beauty of the Lake District        inspiring and their paintings or photographs make fitting souvenirs        Youll find galleries in all the major
