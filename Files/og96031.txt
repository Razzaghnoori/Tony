Counsel Enclosure cc Michael R Taylor Administrator Food Safety and Inspection Service Page 2 GAO OGC 96 31 ENCLOSURE ANALYSIS UNDER 5 U S C 801 a 1 B i iv OF A MAJOR RULE ISSUED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE FOOD SAFETY AND INSPECTION SERVICE ENTITLED PATHOGEN REDUCTION HAZARD ANALYSIS AND CRITICAL CONTROL POINT HACCP SYSTEMS RIN 0583 AB69 i Cost benefit analysis The Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS prepared a cost benefit analysis which concludes that the costs associated with the rule are far outweighed by the public health benefits to be derived The analysis concludes that the 20 year industry costs are estimated to be 969 to 1 156 million and the 20 year cost to the government to be 56 5 million The analysis considers data for average wages the cost of specific processing equipment and the cost of conducting specific laboratory analyses The potential health benefits resulting from the elimination of the four pathogens is estimated to be 7 13 to 26 59 billion over 20 years The range of benefits occurs because of the current uncertainty in the estimates of the number of cases of foodborne illness and death attributable to the pathogens that enter the meat and poultry supply at the manufacturing stage ii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 U S C 603 605 607 and 609 The Administrator of FSIS has concluded that the rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and an initial regulatory flexibility analysis and final regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared and included in the notice of proposed rulemaking and the final rule notice respectively as required by sections 603 and 604 The analyses comply with the informational requirements of the sections including the classes of small entities subject to the requirement and alternatives considered to reduce to the burden on the small entities The final regulatory flexibility analysis discusses the comments received from both the industry and the Office of Advocacy Small Business Administration and the changes made to the proposed rule to grant regulatory relief to the small entities including the sequencing of implementation by establishment size GAO OGC 96 31 The analyses use both quantifiable and general descriptions of the effects of the rule on small entities as required by section 607 and small entities in addition to the actions required by 5 U S C 553 participated in the numerous meetings forums and conferences held in connection with the preparation of the final rule as required by section 609 iii Agency actions relevant to sections 202 205 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 2 U S C 1532 1535 Based on the cost benefit analysis performed by FSIS the rule will impose an unfunded mandate on the private sector of 99 6 to 119 8 million annually and therefore the rule is subject to the requirements of the Act As required by section 205 FSIS considered several regulatory alternatives to the imposition of the mandatory HACCP but determined that the requirements expressed in the final rule constituted the most cost effective and least burdensome alternative that would meet the objective of the rule To fulfill the requirements of section 204 regarding providing an opportunity for input from State local and tribal governments a Federal State Relations Conference was held and the numerous comments received from these entities were considered and are discussed in the preamble and the final Regulatory Impact Analysis Finally FSIS considered the comments of several state government officials that the rule imposed an unfunded mandate on State inspection programs because of the need for these programs to remain at least equal to the Federal inspection program FSIS concluded that because of the necessary restructuring and reprogramming of the State inspection programs FSIS assistance and the flexibility provided under the equal to provisions most states should be able to complete the modifications to their programs with minimal additional cost Moreover any additional costs would be eligible to receive up to 50 percent Federal matching funds iv Other relevant information or requirements under Acts and Executive orders Administrative Procedure Act 5 U S C 551 et seq The rule was promulgated using the notice and comment procedures of 5 U S C 553 A

State conference and a Food Safety Forum In addition to the information gained through these meetings and conferences 6 800 comments were received in response to the Federal Register notice The preamble to the final rule contains an extensive discussion of the comments received and the changes to the proposed rule which were made was a result Paperwork Reduction Act 44 U S C 3501 3520 The rule requires establishments to document their compliance with the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points HACCP Systems first in the development of a plan and thereafter in a continuous record of process performance The information collection requirements were discussed in the preamble to the proposed rule making published on February 3 1995 60 Fed Reg 6832 At the same time public comments to both FSIS and the Office of Management and Budget were requested In the preamble to the final rule FSIS notes that the Office of Management and Budget has approved its information collection requirements system under OMB No 0583 0103 with an annual burden of 14 371 901 hours However in view of comments received and a reevaluation of the requirements by agency subject matter experts and private consultants FSIS has reduced the annual burden to 8 053 319 hours a 6 318 582 hour reduction This reduction was obtained through more accurate burden estimates and the elimination of certain requirements including time and temperature reports and personnel resumes of establishment employees FSIS has submitted these changes in the information collection requirements to OMB for its approval and certified to OMB that the information collection complied with each of the objectives identified in 44 U S C 3506 c 3 Statutory authorization for the rule This rule is promulgated under the
