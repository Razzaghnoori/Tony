 Background Central venous catheters CVCs are widely used in critically ill patients throughout the developed world They permit hemodynamic monitoring and allow access for the administration of fluids blood products medications and total parenteral nutrition TPN Estimates of their use in the United States alone suggest that over five million CVCs are inserted annually 1 2 Although CVCs have significant benefits in many clinical situations the increase in their use over the last 20 years has been associated with at least a doubling of resultant nosocomial infections 3 4 A number of factors may contribute to the risk of catheter related infections CRI 5 6 7 8 9 Although a common problem the descriptive epidemiology pathophysiology risk factors and best means of diagnosing CRI have not yet been fully elucidated We undertook a prospective study of all new CVCs inserted into patients in the intensive care units ICU in order to identify the risk factors and to determine the effect of glycopeptide antibiotics on CRI Patients and Methods Human research ethics committee approval was obtained for the study As there were no interventions requirement for written patient consent was waived All patients admitted to medical neurosurgical and surgical ICUs of Istanbul Faculty of Medicine between January 2001 and December 2001 who submitted to a CVC were included in the study The catheters used were nontunneled noncuffed triple lumen and made of polyurethane material Arrow Erding Germany All catheters were inserted via new percutaneous puncture in intensive care units by experienced anaesthetists under strict aseptic techniques After washing hands and forearms with antiseptic soap drying with a sterile towel maximal sterile barrier precautions sterile gloves longsleeved sterile gown mask cap and large sterile sheet drape were observed prior to catheter insertion Povidone iodine was used as antiseptic for cleansing the CVC insertion site After catheter insertion the site was covered with sterile gauze Every 48 hours the dressing was removed the site was inspected and cleansed with povidone iodine and a new dressing was applied Catheters were followed for the duration of their insertion and data were obtained daily on inflammation of the catheter sites by a single observer The catheters were removed at the end of the day seven as scheduled replacement is followed in the ICUs of our hospital Catheters were removed in less than seven days when the patient had no more need for central line and suspected to have CRI There was provision for discretionary clinical judgement to leave the catheter longer than seven days Each CVC was withdrawn aseptically using sterile forceps after the area of insertion was washed with povidone iodine solution The distal 5 cm of the catheter was cut off using sterile scissor and sent aseptically to the clinical microbiology laboratory where it was cultured by semiquantitative method 10 When blood cultures were indicated 10 mL of venous blood was drawn from catheter and from two peripheral veins following skin preparation with povidone iodine Data were also obtained on patients age gender unit

was used to determine the significant differences between categorical variables Mann Whitney U test was used for the continuous variables The variables that were found to be significant p 0 05 in the univariate analysis catheter insertion site duration of catheterization and glycopeptide usage were taken into logistic regression The software package used for statistical analysis was SPSS for Windows Release 10 0 SPSS Inc Chicago IL U S A Results During the study period 300 patients with CVCs were assessed One hundred and seventy six 58 6 of the patients were from the general ICU 92 30 7

patients were as follows 81 27 cardiorespiratory failure 72 24 trauma 72 24 postsurgical and 75 25 others CVCs were inserted either into jugular vein n 132 44 or into the subclavian vein n 168 56 Twenty eight 9 3 patients were receiving TPN The mean length of time the catheter was kept in place was 7 2 8 days Two hundred and one 67 CVCs were kept in place for seven days or less and the other 99 33 CVCs were kept in place for more than seven days Eighty four 28 of them at the time of catheter insertion a total of 113 37 6 patients were using glycopeptide antibiotic during catheterization The other 187 62 4 patients were not using glycopeptide antibiotic at the time of catheter insertion and for the duration of insertion Table 1 Ninety one 30 3 of the CVCs were colonized and the CRI

odds ratio of 3 01 95 CI 1 49 5 51 p 0 005 One hundred and fourty eight organisms were isolated as the cause of catheter colonization or CRI Seventy nine 53 4 Gram positive cocci 66 44 5 Gram negative bacilli and three 2 1 yeasts were isolated The most commonly isolated organism was Staphylococcus aureus n 52 37 1 followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa n 27 19 3 Staphylococcus epidermidis n 26 18 6 and Acinetobacter spp n 21 15 Table 3 Of the 50 cases of CRI most of the organisms causing infection were Gram positive cocci n 38 76 with the most commonly isolated organism being S aureus n 32 64 Table 3 All of the Staphylococcus spp were resistant to methicilline The etiology of CRI was predominantly Gram positive cocci n 32 71 1 in patients who were not using glycopeptide antibiotic during catheterization In contrast in patients who were using glycopeptide antibiotic during catheterization Gram positive cocci was only responsible from one 20 CRI This difference was significant p 0 01 Discussion Many different risk factors for CRI in intensive care patients have been reported in the literature 3 4 8 9 11 12 13 These include insertion site duration of catheterization type of dressing type of catheter frequent manipulations improper aseptic techniques number of catheter lumens type of topical antiseptic solution used and use of the catheter for TPN The relative importance of one risk factor over another is diffucult to assess given that in most studies only univariate analysis has been performed and estimates of the risk of each factor has not been attempted We performed a logistic regression to assess the major determinants of CRI and found that the independent predictors of CRI were catheter insertion site duration of catheterization and antibiotic glycopeptide usage In our study infection rates of catheters inserted into jugular vein and subclavian vein were 22 7 11 9 respectively p 0 005 The CVCs inserted to the jugular vein were associated with approximately two and a half times the risk of infection compared with CVC inserted to subclavian vein in the multivariate analysis It is also reported in other studies that colonization and infection is more likely in catheters inserted to jugular vein than in catheters inserted to subclavian vein 1 3 14 Reasons for the higher infection rate in the jugular vein site is thought to be related to difficulty keeping the dressing in place and contamination with oropharyngeal secretions Therefore for catheters inserted to jugular vein the manipulations should be done with more caution and the oropharyngeal secretions should be prevented to contaminate the catheter Most of the phycians select the jugular vein for catheter insertion because it is easier to insert the catheter and due to low mechanical complication rate According to our study and other reports subclavian vein approach has a significant advantage with respect to insertion site colonization and infection 6 15 16 Therefore we suggest that the subclavian approach be utilized preferentially for catheterization provided a serious bleeding diathesis is not present and risk of pneumothorax is not excessive In our study the CRI rate was higher for CVCs kept in place for 8 days 24 2 in comparison to catheters kept in place for 7 days 12 9 p 0 03 The CVCs kept in place for 8 days were associated with approximately two times the risk of infection compared with catheters kept in place for 7 days The practise of routinely changing catheters according to some defined time period to reduce the risk of CRI is commonly referred to as scheduled replacement 3 7 There is little or no support from the literature for scheduled replacement even though it continues to be a common clinical practice Cook et al looked at the evidence for scheduled replacement using guide wire exchanges and or new site replacements 17 They found no evidence that scheduled replacement using either of the replacement techniques at three days or seven days had any advantage over a replacement based on clinical indication The other studies also failed to prove any reduction of CRI rates by scheduled replacement 18 19 While catheter tip colonization and CRI may increase with CVC duration controversy still exists regarding scheduled changes We found that the incidence and risk of CRI was lower in patients using glycopeptide antibiotic during catheterization in comparison to patients who were not using these antibiotics p 0 005 Gram positive cocci particularly coagulase negative Staphylococci CNS and S aureus are responsible for at least two thirds of the CRI 12 20 Glycopeptide antibiotics are active against Staphylococci including methicillin resistant isolates which was also the most frequently isolated organism in our study Therefore we searched the effect of these antibiotics against CRI There is a lack of clarity in the literature about the definition and influence of antimicrobial use There are only a few reports that antimicrobials administered at the time of or immediately after insertion of a CVC may reduce the incidence of CRI 21 22 23 Other trials demonstrated no benefit of such prophylaxis 24 25 26 According to our results it seems that their use may prevent catheters from infection especially with Gram positive cocci The glycopeptide antibiotics the patients were using during the catheterization seems to have prophylactic effect This study also concludes that patients using antibiotics effective against Gram positive cocci during catheterization Gram negative organisms should also be suspected as the cause of CRI and antibiotics which are also effective against these pathogens should be started empirically Further studies are needed to assess the additional benefit afforded by antimicrobials in reducing CRI In this prospective study the rate of CRI was found to be 16 7 The rate of catheter related bloodstream infections CRBIs and exit site infection was 12 and 5 6 respectively Of the CRBIs 28 77 8 were diagnosed as D CRB and the other 8 22 2 were diagnosed as P CRB P CRB was diagnosed when bacteremia and clinical manifestations of sepsis resolved after removal of implicated catheter in case of the organism causing bacteremia not identified at any other site that is possible source As stated in the definition of P CRB we could not isolate the responsible organisms causing bloodstream infection from the catheter tip in approximately 22 of the CRBI It is possible for organisms to originate from the internal surface or the hub of the catheters The method which we used to culture the catheter tip semiquantative method has a limitation in that it can take samples only from the external surfaces of catheters and may not retrieve organisms from the internal surfaces of the catheters 10 Quantitative culture techniques including the sonication and vortexing methods 27 28 29 have the advantage of isolating organisms from the external and internal surfaces of the catheters and possibly releasing organisms embedded within the biofilm layer Other reports comparing semiquantitative catheter segment culture with quantitative culture methods supports the superiority of quantitative culture methods 30 Thus although the semiquantitative catheter segment culture is one of the least expensive tests for a clinical microbiology laboratory to perform and the most frequently used method in hospital laboratories quantitative culture methods should be preferred for catheter tip culture A number of investigators have examined the microbiology of CRIs S epidermidis were the most common organism growing followed by P aeruginosa yeasts enterococci S aureus and Enterobacter spp 29 In our study the leading organism causing CVC colonization and CRI was S aureus followed by P aeruginosa K oxytoca S epidermidis and Acinetobacter spp Although the ratio of Gram positive cocci to Gram negative rods isolated from all catheters was approximately 1 the ratio increased approximately three fold in CRI The finding that Staphylococcus spp was the most common positive catheter tip isolate seems to support the current view that infection originates either from the patients own skin flora or that of medical personnel or from hub colonization Conclusion Duration of catheterization and catheter insertion site were independent risk factors for catheter related infection We found that the incidence and risk of CRI was lower in patients who were using glycopeptide antibiotics during catheterization in comparison to patients who were not using these antibiotics It seems that use of glycopeptide antibiotics during catheterization has a protective effect against catheter ralated infection but further studies are needed to assess the benefit Although the semiquantitative catheter segment culture is one of the least expensive tests for a clinical microbiology laboratory to perform and the most frequently used method in hospital laboratories quantitative culture methods should be preferred for catheter tip culture List of abbreviations used CVC Central venous catheter CRI Catheter related infection CFU
