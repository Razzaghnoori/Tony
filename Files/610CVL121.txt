 The Clinton Birthplace Foundation offers full membership privileges to those who pay only 10 00 per year This enables you to become a member of the foundation If you choose to go this route you will receive a quarterly newsletter annual pass to the center and birthplace and notification of upcoming events I encourage you to do this because the 10 00 is considered a tax deduction and you will get so much in return This also means that you will be invited when President Clinton returns for any event You may send a check payable to the Clinton Birthplace Foundation Thank you Beckie Moore Executive Director Clinton Birthplace Foundation
