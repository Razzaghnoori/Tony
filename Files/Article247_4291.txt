 The Jenny Craig World Tour Morning Harry D you catch Monica Lewinsky on Larry King last night I ve had this reaction before but I couldn t help but have it again What was Clinton thinking Of all the sex options open to a president this was a helluva pick This I realize is not exactly a stunning insight but since the Jenny Craig World Tour has begun I couldn t help feeling it I also couldn t help but feel pity for the gal She s got a bazillion dollars in legal bills thanks to the Scarlet Letter Special Counsel and she has to do this humiliating weight gig with Jenny Craig in order to pay off the bills I believed her when she said that this was the most tasteful of the offers she got By the way my favorite line from the scandal which I think reduces the whole thing to one sentence is the line from Clinton in which he said to Monica I m not making this up You can always say you were bringing me pizza I see the administration is getting ready to let Elian Gonzalez the cuban boy political football go back to his native land The Washington Post reports that they re going to cut a deal in which the father comes here and picks the kid up I fear this whole thing will get even more bizarre Won t anti Castro groups in South Florida try to hide the kid Then we ll have months of MSNBC on Where s Elian I don t have particularly strong feelings about where he belongs Did the father have any real role in the kid s life What kind of home is he in now I ve got doubts about any home that invites camera crews and congressmen in to meet with the boy The Gore Bradley race I see is heating up with each tossing out charges that the other one is a mere tinkerer and not bold enough Neither guy is exactly a poster child for radical change it seems to me It s only January and I m already tired of Bradley s pedantic tone and Gore s you voted for vouchers 20 years ago tone Anything interesting in the Los Angeles Times this morning
