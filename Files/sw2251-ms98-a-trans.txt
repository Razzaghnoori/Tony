          an interesting uh point about sentencing by the judge alone doing away with a jury i dont know if id be willing to accept the um abuses that would come along with that and that the it would be relatively easy to get some bad decisions or to even get to the judge from a standpoint of bribery but   yeah   or even if he just through years of being on the bench just becomes uh out of touch with uh the population and he only sees the bad side of life so much that he just ends up making bad decisions however the complexity of some of these uh cases its just they spend more time educating the jury up to the point where they can make a decision   umhum   then it would take if the judge just made the decision especially when it is purely um noncriminal uh litigation type uh whatever you want to call it the term civil uh suits as it were or even some corporate uh law when theres not any individual involved and some of those are solved without a a jury but uh some some do choose to go before it   umhum yeah   um what do you think about the aspect of unanimous jury when they do have a jury must all six or twelve uh agree before the the topic be final or or the verdict be final   yeah that that is uh a tough situation i mean because you know i mean some sometimes i feel like maybe some of them are just kind of pressured or not really into you know and and you know uh people go home and the jury duty is always like you know kind of whining about it all seems like if people were were really you know into the subject and uh i dont know i mean i guess if there if it was more people it would be better if it was just like you know the majority but i guess the smaller number of that if it was like six or twelve which there usually are so um and i guess unanimous uh yeah i kind of agree with that   okay if it the only thing that i was thinking about as far as having if you had one holdout out of say twelve   yeah   then is it reasonable or is it or could you assume that there must be some reason for that person to be holding out and obviously the other eleven or five cannot convince this person   uhhuh   that uh they should vote it one way or the other so maybe it is worth having that extra little or going to the the very farthest uh safeguard that can be done and uh   yeah   trying not to get a wrong decision   yeah i can see that   the uh system as it stands now i think if if the juries were done away with the judge could render a decision much quicker uh and youd youd feed more people through the courts as it were dont know where wed put them once we got them through your courts but uh   yeah   i think the rate of processing is just about uh reached the rate of housing anyway so keep the keep the normal as it is cant upset the system very much   yeah yeah i heard about um is is there true that theres a if a lawyer takes a a case to court and its what do they call it um frivolous is that is there still a frivolous law that they can   probably yeah i would imagine the judge could throw it out   yeah but do you think he would fine the lawyer   i would imagine thats left up to the judge i i would assume he could consider it a contempt of court and and uh but anything he wanted whatever his limits are on contempt of court   oh yeah i never i didnt realize until recently that there was actually a fine they could pretty interesting though   certainly makes sense because some of this stuff is you know you youre just doing this to do this you know its   yeah     just doesnt make sense   yeah   so thats pretty bad  a friend of mine is a is a judge here in the well actually you know it McKinney because were in Collin County   uhhuh   and he is uh just recently changed from hearing all the the DWI type stuff to uh doing what they call more of a family court where he gets to go listen to all the divorces so it wasnt much of a step up as it were   oh really oh really   oh   um its really tough he says in a lot of cases where he has to make the decision so i guess in a lot of those cases its its all up to him as oppose to a jury   oh gosh   and theres just no good choice as to where to put the kids sometimes or   yeah   and of course there couples get kind of spiteful at times and   oh that would be really tough     and you hear it all through the worst side of people throughout the whole time   yeah you really do   well let me think here um as far as the judge making the decision   yeah i mean because seems like i dont know i mean theres so many different different types of cases that come in i mean it seems like just general people i mean who are live in the community and do different things you know you have different opinions kind of just one judge who sits there and listens to cases all the time would would get it start thinking a certain way and go go nuts   uhhuh yeah thats true but then look at the group that tends to accept jury duty       you you either have the person who who is uh the type of individual who can work for a large corporation that can afford to pay them you know let them go   yeah   and and those are shall we say blue collar that that your work the assembly line type or technician some engineering uh you may not have the the selfemployed businessman willing to go because he though he may be   yeah   current on all you know several social issues and have opinions on things like that he just doesnt want to take his time to go to the jury duty so he probably doesnt vote either so he doesnt get called in some counties   yeah yeah   so it i dont know whether it would be wiser to have an educated judge even though he may get uh out of touch after a while or whether it would be uh worth it to stick to the class of people that end up there   yeah that is hard to say   though i have had a judge fact this very judge friend of mine say that he uh does not like to have people on the jury that are from uh the electronics industry   uhhuh   and i said well me being from the electronics industry ill bite why why dont you like it and he said well         he said the majority of them uh tend to dive into their little world of of electronics and be very technically minded and be very absorbed with what their field is and they usually dont um read outside their field they dont read social type uh papers they dont theyre not up to date on various uh current affairs as it were and   oh i hadnt ever thought of that really   and i said well that thats quite possible i said ive discussed some topics with people even over this situation and and discovered some views that i hadnt thought of in a while i just wondered if i got out of my little realm         if i wouldnt run into people with some more diverse views   yeah   but uh my realm is pretty well technical and those who you know friends i have are usually we discuss technical items and we dont uh try to follow the worlds problems   yeah   i guess its too frustrating   yeah it does     so   gosh   well i think weve managed to kill a little time on the topic and well go ahead and   yeah   well go ahead and call you another day maybe   all right well groovy its been cool talking to you see you around bye   okay bye
