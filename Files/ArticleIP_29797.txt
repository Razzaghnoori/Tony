on the cover every year since 1939 only this time it s really really about to happen says the BBC Earlier flying cars were simply conventional vehicles with wings bolted on top which had to be dismantled before they could run on roads But Paul Moller s Skycar M400 operates with four pairs of engines with power fans that simply lift the car into the air Moller a former engineering professor at the University of California at Davis has been working on the technology for a flying car since 1963 His company Moller International has spent 100m developing the flying car which he calls a volantor The car would have to take off from what Moller calls a vertiport Noise levels and safety risks make it impractical to take off in the middle of the street but he believes that in the future vertiports could be as common as corner shops The M400 will not be cheap The first models will cost up to a 1m but Moller believes that a mass produced model could cost as little as 60 000 And the flying car is not easy on petrol either It does only 8km per liter Next up superintelligent dogs that farm the ocean floor on Neptune Entrepreneurial Extra When I need shampoo or a stereo or a piece
