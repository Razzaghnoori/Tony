 Background Psoriasis is a common skin disorder affecting 1 to 3 percent of the world s population 1 2 Treatment of the disease results in costs that range between 0 7 to more than 4 billion dollars annually in the US alone 3 One of the most cost effective forms of potential treatment for the disease is the use of antithyroid thioureylenes such a propylthiouracil We previously reported the effectiveness of thioureylene treatment in patients with plaque psoriasis 4 5 6 7 a finding since confirmed by others 8 The mechanism of action of antithyroid thioureylenes in psoriasis remains unclear The drugs have been studied with relation to their effect in Graves hyperthyroidism which like psoriasis is an autoimmune disorder 9 10 11 12 Antithyroid thioureylenes of which propylthiouracil methimazole and carbimazole are used in clinical practice have known immunomodulatory properties 13 14 and in the case of psoriasis also have antiproliferative effects as demonstrated by their ability to produce a decline in markers of cellular proliferation such as proliferative cell nuclear antigen PCNA 15 Skin antigen presenting cells Langerhans cells appear to play an important role in the initiating events that lead to the cytokine cascade that results in keratinocyte proliferation and development of psoriatic lesions 16 17 18 Effective therapeutic approaches to psoriasis treatment such as psoralen UV A therapy PUVA which result in depletion of APCs in the skin 19 20 and UV B 21 lead to one of the most sustained improvement in psoriasis IL 12 a product of Langerhans cells and skin monocytes plays a pivotal role in T cell activation that leads to formation of the psoriatic plaque 22 IL 12 levels are also significantly raised in patients with Graves hyperthyroidism and are reduced following treatment with propylthiouracil 23 CD1a is expressed in differentiated antigen presenting cells and monocytes and is used as a marker for the presence of these cells in the skin 24 25 26 The CD1 molecules are the products of five CD1 genes located on chromosome 1 The genes are closely related to the mixed histocompatibilty complex MHC genes indicating origin from a common precursor 27 CD1 molecules however have limited sequence homology to MHC class I and II molecules and unlike the MHC molecules are also capable of binding non protein antigens 28 29 The present study was performed to examine the effect of propylthiouracil treatment of patients with plaque psoriasis on CD1a expression in their psoriatic lesions in order to determine whether this form of therapy resulted in depletion of APCs from affected skin that could account for the therapeutic benefit of PTU in this disorder Methods Patients Six patients 4M 2F with stable plaque psoriasis were recruited for study The patients ranged in age from 21 to 63 years mean SD 44 16 years None of the patients was taking any form of topical or systemic treatment other than emollients for psoriasis for at least six weeks prior to entry into the study Pregnant women and patients with thyroid dysfunction determined by pre enrollment screening thyroid function tests were excluded from the study The Institutional Review Board of the University of California Irvine approved the study Clinical Scoring Clinical evaluation was performed by the same dermatologist VSN at the time of patient entry into the study and monthly intervals until completion of the study Scoring was based on the PASI scoring system 30 Biopsy Samples Biopsy samples were taken from patients at the start and after 3 months of PTU treatment from the same psoriatic lesion Skin samples were obtained using a 5 mm punch biopsy under aseptic conditions with local anesthesia The biopsies were frozen and stored at 70 C until processed Indirect immunoperoxidase staining was used to identify CD1a Histological Scoring Biopsy specimens were viewed by a dermatopathologist RJB Histological scoring was made with a 5 point scoring system graded from 0 to 4 0 normal 1 slight 2 moderate 3 severe 4 very severe based on criteria noted below after examination of four consecutive high power fields Histological scoring took into account hypogranulosis parakeratosis and the inflammatory infiltrate in the epidermis and superficial dermis The total score reported was the sum of the individual parameters Epidermal hyperplasia was measured with an oculomicrometer from top of the epidermis to the base of the ridges Laboratory Tests Thyroid function tests were performed in all volunteers prior to entry into the study and again at monthly intervals until study completion at twelve weeks The tests consisted of measurement of serum free T 4 FT 4 and thyroid stimulating hormone TSH Complete blood counts CBC were also obtained at the same time intervals Immunoperoxidase Staining Tissue samples from biopsy specimens stored at 70 C were taken and embedded in paraffin 4 m sections were coated onto slides and allowed to dry overnight at 55 C An RBC block 2 5 ml 30 H 2 O 2 in 100 ml methanol was applied for 40 min after which the slides were washed in tap water until clean Following a series of washing with PBS the slides were washed with blocking serum 5 horse serum for 20 min after which antibody for CD1a 1 100 dilution was applied for 30 minutes The slides were washed with PBS for 5 min after which anti mouse antibody 1 200 dilution was applied and the slides washed again in PBS for 5 minutes Tertiary antibody ABC kit was added for 30 min and the slides were then washed for with PBS DAB was applied in the dark 10 min the slides were washed in distilled water 5 min counterstained with hematoxylin washed with tap water dehydrated and mounted Quantification Results were expressed as the absolute number of positive staining dendritic cells counted over a 1 mm length of the epidermis Only cells with clearly defined nuclei present in the suprabasal layers of the epidermis were counted Statistical Analysis The results are expressed as mean SD Statistical analysis was performed using the t test for paired observations Level of significance was p 0 05 Results Clinical Response and PASI Scores All patients showed some improvement in their psoriasis with near complete resolution in 4 patients PASI scores declined from 21 40 6 81 at baseline to 7 85 4 35 at completion of the study p 0 004 Clinical improvement became apparent about three weeks after therapy Histological Scores Histological scores also declined significantly from 7 17 2 78 at baseline to 3 00 2 61 at the end of 12 weeks PTU treatment p 002 Epidermal thickness decreased from 0 52 0 17 mm to 0 26 1 11 mm p 0 007 Serum TSH FT 4and CBC CBC remained normal 7 85 0 53 vs 8 05 1 31 cells L p ns during the entire study with no patient demonstrating any leucopenia Serum TSH concentrations remained within the euthyroid range with no patient exhibiting clinical signs or offering complaints suggestive of hypothyroidism Serum free thyroxine FT 4 showed no significant change Serum TSH slowed a slight rise in some patients with the group as a whole showing no significant elevation of TSH 1 72 0 98 U ml vs 2 73 1 43 U ml p ns The rise did not exceed the normal range and all patients remained clinically euthyroid Expression of CD1a in Psoriatic Plaques As expected CD 1a with characteristic stellate profiles typical for Langerhans cells were readily seen in the epidermis in all pre and post treatment biopsy samples The number of CD 1a staining cells showed an apparent increase after propylthiouracil therapy The number of such cells rose from 5 67 4 08 pretreatment to 10 00 4 20 post treatment P 0 02 Fig 1 2 Discussion The efficacy of antithyroid thioureylenes as agents in the treatment of plaque psoriasis is well established 4 5 7 8 The mechanism of action of these agents in psoriasis remains unclear The drugs can potentially act by reducing the cytokine signals that lead to keratinocyte proliferation or by reducing keratinocyte proliferation A key element in the generation of the cytokine signals responsible for formation of a psoriatic plaque is the skin antigen presenting cell or Langerhans cell Therapeutic modalities deplete such cells that often lead to improvement in psoriasis The best example of such an approach is treatment with UV A and psoralens as well as UV B which result in depletion of APCs and produce one of the most long lasting remissions of the disease which might last in some instances for as long as 6 months 31 32 A key antigenic marker of skin APCs is CD1a Langerhans cell precursors arise from CD34 positive monocytes macrophages in the marrow 33 34 They circulate in the blood before localizing in the skin primarily in dermal connective tissue In the dermis the Langerhans precursors are strongly HLA DR Ia positive and are relatively non phagocytic indeterminate cells CD1a expression is not pronounced in the precursors and is not significantly expressed until the cells become differentiated 35 36 37 38 Differentiated cells localize to the midepidermis demonstrate characteristic Birbeck granules and exhibit dendritic appendages These differentiated cells although usually stable sometime exhibit proliferative activity and increase in many cutaneous immune response states 23 39 40 The inability of PTU to reduce CD1a expression in biopsy samples of patients with psoriasis suggests that the mechanism of action of this drug is psoriasis is not due to any effect on skin antigen presenting cells or production of IL 12 a motive cytokine that is responsible for initiation and maintenance of the cytokine stimulatory cascade that leads to formation of the psoriatic plaque 16 In support of this argument is the fact that circulating IL 12 did not show any significant change with PTU treatment submitted Additional studies are being performed which address whether PTU treatment of patients with plaque psoriasis leads to reduced in situ IL 12 expression alters production of the IL 35 or IL 40 components of the IL 70 heterodimer as well as exerts an effect by enhancing apoptosis in the proliferated keratinocytes that make up the psoriatic plaque which would result in clinical improvement Competing Interests None declared
