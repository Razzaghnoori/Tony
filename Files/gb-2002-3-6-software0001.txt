 Rationale Microarray technology has radically changed the way researchers address many biological questions It is now possible to measure messenger RNA levels quantitatively for thousands of genes or even entire genomes using DNA arrays microarrays or chips 1 2 Researchers can in a fairly straightforward fashion examine the overall transcriptional response of thousands of genes in normal cells and tissues in disease states in response to biological genetic or chemical stimuli such as drugs or during normal biological processes such as cell cycle progression and embryonic development 3 4 5 Two of the most commonly used microarrays for gene expression measurements are oligonucleotide GeneChip expression arrays made by Affymetrix and custom made cDNA arrays Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays are created by a combination of DNA synthesis and photolithographic techniques whereas cDNA arrays are constructed by spotting or printing PCR products or oligonucleotides onto glass slides 6 7 8 9 Affymetrix arrays contain sets of multiple 25 mer oligonucleotide probes specific for each gene or expressed sequence tag EST whereas spotted arrays generally contain longer cDNA probes usually 500 to 1 000 bases or oligonucleotide probes usually 25 to 60 bases for each gene The large amount of information generated from microarrays has been a great strength but is sometimes seen as a frustrating weakness 10 A significant obstacle in microarray research has been the inability to process experimental data easily assess the data quality manage multiple data sets and mine the data with user friendly tools that can be quickly learned and applied for routine analysis by laboratory scientists 11 Two HTML based microarray filtering and analysis programs were written one for the Affymetrix platform Bullfrog and one for the cDNA platform Spot to address common data analysis needs Our aim in creating Bullfrog and Spot is to provide simple tools that enable researchers at all levels to analyze their data in multiple ways without having to use more complex software without having to call in bioinformatics experts and without having to learn to program in scripting or database languages Bullfrog and Spot were built with an easy to navigate user interface and adjustable analysis criteria and were written to run quickly allowing multiple microarray experiments to be filtered in several seconds They were created to provide the bench researcher with uncomplicated tools that help focus microarray data from thousands of genes to a relatively small number of high confidence differentially expressed candidates The programs are not intended for high level statistical or other complex analyses but they do make it easy to export filtered data to GeneSpring or other visualization and clustering programs Lastly the programs are freeware made publicly available to the research community in the hope of accelerating functional genomics research Manipulating data sets in Bullfrog Bullfrog and Spot can be used to select genes probes probe sets or spots that behave in specific ways across multiple experiments by using a combination of more than 20 different qualitative and quantitative criteria Figure 1 To illustrate a few of Bullfrog s capabilities we use data obtained in gene expression studies of the adult mouse brain using Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays 12 A simple question to ask is what genes are differentially expressed between two different regions of the brain for example the cerebellum and the amygdala in a 129S6 SvEvTac 129SvEv inbred mouse strain As in most experiments it is important to first estimate the false positive rate for this type of comparison between brain regions The best way to realistically approximate the false positive rate is to perform and analyze independent experimental replicates of the same brain region from multiple different mice We used RNA from the cerebellums of two different mice with samples prepared separately and hybridized to two different chips Ideally replicate comparisons from well controlled experiments would show no differentially expressed genes However experimental noise and biological variation may lead to genes being scored as differentially expressed between replicates For example small differences in the brain dissections or differences in the exact time of sacrifice can affect gene expression patterns It is very important to estimate the false positive rate for the particular experimental system being studied and to set analysis filter criteria that lead to appropriate levels of false positives without sacrificing sensitivity to low abundance mRNA transcripts or subtle changes in gene expression To estimate the false positive rate a comparison between the data for independent replicate 129SvEv cerebellums was made that is expression data from mouse 1 cerebellum versus expression data from mouse 2 cerebellum This comparison file saved as text from the Affymetrix GeneChip MAS 4 0 software was loaded into Bullfrog and the filter criteria were selected A number of different criteria may be selected but our default criteria for calling a gene differentially expressed are as follows a qualitative difference call of Increase I Marginal Increase MI Decrease D or Marginal Decrease MD a fold change expression ratio of greater than 1 8 an average difference change of greater than 50 after scaling to a mean signal or target value across the entire array of 200 and an absolute call of Present for the probe set in either or both replicate cerebellums The use of multiple filter criteria reduces the risk of erroneously assigning a gene as differentially expressed while maintaining sensitivity to rare mRNAs and small differences in expression 13 14 When applied to the cerebellum replicate data the filter criteria yielded 36 probe sets scored as differentially expressed out of 6 529 a false positive rate of approximately 0 6 We have carried out a large number of analyses using a combination of qualitative and quantitative filters and consistently observe false positive rates of less than 1 0 between well controlled independent duplicates using the default selection criteria 7 12 13 For example 34 duplicate comparisons for data from different brain regions and different strains of mice were analyzed using the default qualitative and quantitative criteria The number of probe sets out of 6 529 that were scored as differentially expressed ranged from 1 to 64 0 02 to 1 0 of the total considered with a mean value of 26 SD 17 and a median value of 24 For the cerebellum data decreasing the fold change cut off from 1 8 to 1 4 increased the number of selected probe sets to 52 A lower false positive rate was achieved at the expense of sensitivity by increasing the average difference signal change requirement from 50 to 200 and maintaining the qualitative criteria and the fold change threshold at 1 8 The average difference signal is proportional to mRNA abundance 15 and the average difference change is the difference between the signal intensity for a probe set on chip 1 and the signal intensity for that same probe set on chip 2 Raising the average difference change threshold to 200 which corresponds to about 3 5 copies of the mRNA transcript per cell on average 16 yielded 11 genes scored as differentially expressed producing a very low false positive rate of less than 0 2 A common mistake when analyzing gene expression data from oligonucleotide arrays is to ignore the qualitative calls absolute and difference calls and focus solely on the quantitative values for example the average difference fold change and average difference change The qualitative calls are important however because they provide an assessment of the consistency of the behavior across the multiple probes in a probe set The use of the qualitative calls enables one to determine not only whether there is a signal or a signal change but also whether the signal or the signal change is due to the gene for which the probe set was designed 14 15 Signals or signal changes that are not consistent across a probe set should not be interpreted with confidence Ignoring the qualitative calls in an analysis of the replicate 129SvEv cerebellum data and using only quantitative thresholds a fold change greater than 1 8 and an average difference change greater than 50 yielded a long list of 715 genes scored as differentially expressed In other words ignoring the qualitative calls increased the false positive rate by a factor of 20 To maintain the low false positive rate obtained with the combination of qualitative and quantitative criteria approximately 0 6 using only the quantitative fold change and average difference change criteria the thresholds would have to be set very high for example fold change greater than ten and average difference change greater than 200 Fold change and signal change thresholds this high result in a tremendous loss in sensitivity This example demonstrates that an effective way to preserve a low false positive rate while maintaining high sensitivity is to use a combination of both qualitative and quantitative filters Bullfrog is designed to help researchers apply these types of multiple criteria analyses The best way to reduce the false positive rate is to combine the filtering criteria described above with the use of multiple independent experimental replicates Inclusion of expression measurements for cerebellar mRNA from two additional 129SvEv mice cerebellums from mouse 3 and mouse 4 further reduces the false positive rate To include data from more mice a file for the comparison between independent replicate cerebellums from mouse 3 and mouse 4 was created in GeneChip Cb3 versus Cb4 This comparison file was loaded into Bullfrog along with the comparison between the data for mouse 1 and mouse 2 Figure 2 The filter criteria were set to select genes that scored as differentially expressed in both comparisons I MI D or MD fold change 1 8 average difference change 50 and P present in at least one measurement Directional consistency was also imposed on the two comparison files Directional consistency means that the direction or sign of a change is the same in both comparisons Adding the additional replicates and using these filter criteria yielded only 3 genes out of 6 529 indicating a very low false positive rate with only moderately stringent selection criteria again consistent with what we usually observe 7 12 13 Once analysis criteria and an estimate of the false positive rate had been established it was possible to confidently assess differences in the gene expression patterns between the cerebellum and the amygdala Pairwise comparisons between cerebellum Cb1 and Cb2 and amygdala Ag1 and Ag2 samples were made in GeneChip for example Cb1 vs Ag1 and Cb2 vs Ag2 Both of these comparisons were loaded into Bullfrog and filtered using the criteria that yielded the very low false positive rate I MI D or MD fold change 1 8 average difference change 50 and P in at least one measurement An analysis of the cerebellum amygdala comparisons with these criteria yielded 230 differentially expressed genes In the list of 230 genes cerebellum specific genes such as Purkinje cell protein 2 PCP 2 and N methyl D aspartate NMDA receptor NR2C subunit were identified as being specifically expressed in the cerebellum and not the amygdala consistent with expectations 17 18 On the basis of careful analysis of independent replicates a high percentage of the 230 genes are likely to be correctly identified as differentially expressed Therefore Bullfrog provides the bench researcher with a way to quickly identify differentially expressed genes for further analysis and follow up Manipulating data sets in Spot Many of the features available in Bullfrog for oligonucleotide arrays are available in Spot for cDNA arrays To illustrate the specific capabilities of Spot we use experimental data from a time course study of wild type and mutant mouse thymus C J Winrow D G P C T Vibat T J Bowen M A Callahan D J L A J Warren B S Hilbush A Wynshaw Boris K W Hasel Z Weaver and C B unpublished observations The mutant mice typically acquire T cell lymphomas at age 3 4 months 19 The cDNA array experiment compared gene expression in the thymus of the mutant and wild type mice at four different times 4 weeks 5 weeks 8 weeks and 9 weeks As with Affymetrix experiments cDNA microarray experiments require meaningful independent replicates to determine the false positive rate and to confidently identify genes that are differentially expressed It is recommended when performing cDNA microarray experiments with the standard two fluorophore co hybridization reactions that all experiments and replicates be performed in fluorophore reversed pairs Reversal of fluorescent labeling in which the two samples to be compared are labeled once with one fluorophore and once with the other helps compensate for differential incorporation of the fluorescent dyes and other sources of fluorophore related systematic errors or bias 20 Newer labeling strategies such as amino allyl based labeling reduce some of the bias associated with differential fluorophore incorporation but it is still important to use fluorophore reversal 21 22 Fluorophore reversal results in two measurements for each pair of samples a forward measurement fluorophore 1 experimental sample fluorophore 2 control sample and a reverse measurement fluorophore 1 control sample fluorophore 2 experimental sample To estimate the false positive rate for the cDNA experiment described above RNA samples from two independent thymuses from wild type mice at age 16 weeks were compared using fluorophore reversal replicates The array data were background subtracted normalized and analyzed with the custom cDNA normalization program described below The forward measurement file was loaded into Spot together with the reverse measurement file saved from the custom cDNA normalization program Application of the standard filter criteria a difference call of I MI D or MD fold change 1 8 signal change 50 in both files after scaling to a mean signal or target value across the entire array of 100 an absolute call of P in at least one measurement and directional consistency yielded 1 gene scored as differentially expressed out of 4 608 To increase sensitivity the fold change threshold was decreased to 1 4 and the scaled signal change cut off to 25 This more sensitive filter yielded only 2 genes out of 4 608 indicating a low and satisfactory false positive rate Once the false positive rate had been estimated the time course comparisons were filtered for differences between mutant and wild type mice For this cDNA microarray experiment there were four time point comparisons of mutant to wild type mouse thymus 4 weeks 5 weeks 8 weeks and 9 weeks First we looked for differentially expressed genes wild type vs mutant at each individual time point Using the criteria established above 48 genes were found to be significantly different at 4 weeks five genes at 5 weeks four at 8 weeks and nine at 9 weeks None of these genes was common to all time points However three genes were common to the 4 and 5 week time points two genes to 4 and 8 weeks and one gene to 4 and 9 weeks Both Bullfrog and Spot allow the user to apply the filtering criteria to a subset of the loaded files done by checking the Filter box for the relevant files only Bullfrog and Spot display the results for all loaded files but the filter criteria are only applied to checked files It is often useful to filter using only a subset of the files while viewing the results across all the files For example in the time course experiment it is possible to identify the 48 genes that were differentially expressed in the first time point while also monitoring how those same genes behaved in the other three time points Using this feature eight candidate genes were found that were directionally consistent for all time points but were slightly below at least some of the thresholds for some time points Similar to Bullfrog Spot quickly identified a list of differentially expressed genes for further analysis and follow up To determine all this information including estimating the false positive rate and testing the selection criteria required less than ten minutes Further features of Bullfrog and Spot Double tiered filters In addition to the commonly used filters described above Bullfrog and Spot have several double tiered filters located on the right in Figure 1 An example of their use is to select genes that are differentially expressed with a fold change greater than 1 3 in six of six files AND with a larger fold change of greater than 3 0 in at least one of the six files Bullfrog and Spot also contain a simple logical Venn function The Venn function taken from Venn diagrams allows two or more lists of probe sets or spots to be compared to find common occurrences within the lists The Venn function lets the user quickly identify the genes in common between lists generated from different measurements or using different filtering criteria In addition Bullfrog and Spot allow the user to save the results of a filtering operation and reload them for further filtering Attaching gene information Once a filtered list of genes has been generated gene information can be attached to the list This information can include GenBank accession numbers UniGene numbers with direct hyperlinks to UniGene Resources Locus Link IDs gene names gene descriptions BLAST hits protein products functions chromosomal locations and known associations with particular phenotypes The gene information is stored in tables created in Microsoft Excel and must contain these columns comma separated in the following order probe set or spot identifier accession number UniGene ID gene title and map location Additional information may be added past these columns To append gene information to a filtered list in Bullfrog or Spot the browse button next to the Enter Probe Set Description From File statement at the bottom of the filter criteria table is pressed Figure 3 The user can choose to show or hide gene information by

experience it is often helpful to pre filter data sets using Bullfrog and Spot before hierarchical or k means clustering 24 Program architecture of Bullfrog and Spot Bullfrog and Spot are Internet Explorer 5 0 client applications running on Windows NT operating systems They are written using a combination of C HTML and Scripting code VBScript and JScript They are relatively small programs 1 1 MB and 1 2 MB respectively and are easy to install Double clicking the setup bat module registers Bullfrog and Spot onto the hard drive The C module Atlprov dll performs the computationally intensive functions such as parsing and filtering the Affymetrix or cDNA data files This module makes the data files accessible as a Microsoft OLE DB data source allowing script code to communicate through Microsoft s Active Data Objects ADO interface Atlprov dll is a C Windows Dynamic Link Library developed with Visual Studio 6 0 The ADO Interface uses the Active Template Library ATL to implement the appropriate Component Object Model COM Interfaces as provided by the Visual Studio Wizard for creating an OLE DB data provider The Bullfrog htm and Spot htm modules have scripting code that uses the ADO interface to query the C module as if it were a database These modules are a combination of static HTML VBScript and JScript that produce HTML on the fly DHTML and use ADO commands and Recordsets They were developed and debugged using Microsoft s Visual InterDev and Visual Studio NET The static HTML provides a simple and familiar user interface for loading files and choosing filtering options The user interface has scripts to dynamically create and modify the page s HTML DHTML such as occurs when displaying a results table Bullfrog and Spot require that data from experiments be saved as specific file types before loading Bullfrog requires that the data from chp comparison files be saved as txt files tab delimited text refer to the user s manual for complete instructions Spot requires

Complete Summary Table button displays relevant hybridization and data analysis information To download the user s manual see the online version of this article or 23 Features and architecture of the cDNA normalization program The custom cDNA normalization program is a Microsoft Excel macro and was written in Visual Basic for Applications VBA using Microsoft s Visual Basic Editor The program background subtracts and normalizes raw cDNA data before data analysis and filtering in Spot The normalization program output includes quantitative information and qualitative calls similar to those used for Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays Raw median pixel intensities for each gene are loaded into Microsoft Excel Median pixel intensities are used because they are less likely to be affected by small artifacts or slight imperfections in spot morphology The regional background is calculated by dividing the cDNA array into 24 equal sections and the average of the lowest 4 of spot intensities in a section is considered the section background a section typically contains 384 to 418 spots The background signal is the result of nonspecific hybridization binding of the fluorophores to the glass surface and fluorescence and reflection from the surface of the cDNA array The lowest 4 of spots typically 15 17 spots was chosen as a balance between using multiple spots at different locations that accurately reflect nonspecific signals and not including too many spots that contain real signals A separate background value is calculated for each section to help correct for background that may be uneven The background is subtracted from each spot in a particular section before further scaling or processing of quantitative results For more information on background subtraction please review the Salk cDNA analysis algorithm guide in the user s manual folder available with the online version of this article or at 23 After background subtraction the cDNA array signals are linearly scaled and normalized to compensate for non biological variation for example differential fluorophore incorporation different amounts of labeled sample array to array variability Background subtracted signals are scaled to an overall average target value that can be set by the user the default value is 100 The scaling factor is calculated on the basis of the total signal intensity after ignoring the lowest 60 and the highest 10 of signals We determined empirically by analyzing large amounts of cDNA array data and testing different combinations of high and low exclusion percentages that ignoring the bottom 60 and top 10 of signals led to scaling factors that were consistent and well behaved for example the mean and median of the resulting distributions were approximately equal More important scaling factors calculated in this way consistently resulted in the smallest number of genes scoring as differentially expressed between replicates To identify scaled signals that are detectable above background and to accurately estimate fold changes ratios a threshold is set using the scaled background values Scaled signals that are less than the threshold are considered undetectable and are set equal to the threshold value For more information on scaling and the setting of the thresholds please review the Salk cDNA analysis algorithm guide in the user s manual folder available with the online version of this article or at 23 The custom cDNA normalization program generates a file in Microsoft Excel that provides a single printable summary sheet for each experiment Table 1 The file includes information on the cDNA array background the raw average signal intensity the scaling factors the thresholds the percentage of genes scored as present the number of genes with fold changes ratios above certain thresholds and several correlation coefficients This file provides an assessment of the overall quality of the data and a summary of the experimental results for each cDNA array At the top of the summary file not shown in Table 1 are several user entered parameters that define the experiment If controls were spotted on the cDNA array a control summary is also created In addition to the data summary the detailed results for each spot on the microarray are provided in a table for further analysis with Spot or other programs The results for each spot or gene include an absolute call of present P or absent A a call of present indicates that the signal was greater than the regional background AND greater than the local background measured in the four corners surrounding the individual spot the scaled intensity the difference between the scaled fluorophore intensities the fold change or ratio of the two color intensities expression ratio and a qualitative difference or change call of I MI D or MD change calls are based on the fold changes across the duplicate spot data The spot by spot results are easily exportable to other programs for further visualization or clustering Once the cDNA data are normalized and in a systematic format similar to the normalized Affymetrix data the data are ready for further analysis in Spot To download

adjustable filter criteria we have established valuable research tools for microarray users Bullfrog Spot and the custom cDNA normalization program were not designed to do complex statistical analyses and visualization Rather they were designed to help the researcher narrow their search from tens of thousands of gene candidates to several hundred or fewer that meet specific but adjustable criteria
