                            Compared with malaria dengue fever has a rather lower profile in the public mind        although to those who have had it it leaves a great impression The name dengue fever is        derived from the Swahiliwords         Ki denga pepo it is a sudden overtaking by an evil spirit which        gives an idea of the rapid onset of the disease The dengue virus is carried by the        mosquito         Aedes aegypti  and the disease often occurs as epidemics        Although the classic illness is a fairly benign acute febrile syndrome it may be very        painfulhence the English nickname breakbone fever The virus can also cause a much more        serious illness known as dengue hemorrhagic fever which can progress to dengue shock        syndrome There are four main serotypes of the dengue RNA virus dengue hemorrhagic fever        is more likely to occur during dengue infection in people with preexisting active or        passive eg maternally acquired immunity who are exposed to a different dengue virus        serotype In contrast to classic dengue the hemorrhagic fever and shock syndromes are        mostly diseases of children and if untreated have a mortality of around         Around twofifths of the worlds population are now at risk of the disease one estimate        is that  million people are infected each year The number at risk will increase as        population growth urbanization international travel and climate change influence        transmission of the disease Understanding how all these factors interact is important in        planning for disease outbreaks However the incidence of dengue is not easily predictable        varying with season and also between years For example although dengue is most prevalent        in the wet season dengue epidemics have also been associated with drought in some        countries El Nio is the best known climatic event affecting climate between years and        some research already suggests that there is a relationship between the timing of dengue        epidemics and El Nio in the Pacific Islands and in other countries        Previous research has uncovered traveling waves of dengue in Thailand but the cause of        these has been obscure In a paper in this months         PLoS Medicine Bernard Cazelles and colleagues looked at the details of        the relationship between dengue incidence and El Nio in Thailand Their results based on        complex mathematical analysis do not provide easy answers for those who might want to plan        for dengue outbreaks though they do go some way to helping to understand the complex        interplay between the various factors In essence the researchers found that there was a        significant association between El Nio oscillations climate variables and dengue        hemorrhagic fever incidence with a  to year repeat for both Bangkok and the rest of        Thailand However this association was significant only for the years  and        outside these years factors other than climate were probably responsible for triggering the        disease outbreaks
