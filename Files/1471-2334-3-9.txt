 Introduction Smallpox while not found in the world s population at present remains a potential health hazard especially due to the possibility of its use as a bioweapon 1 2 3 4 5 There is currently no accepted treatment for smallpox although a number of agents have been evaluated 6 Therefore new therapeutic or virucidal agents could have great utility in slowing both the progression and spread of the disease in an epidemic situation In the present study we have investigated the potential of porphyrins Por and phthalocyanines Pc to prevent infection by vaccinia virus in cell culture Materials and Methods Porphyrins and phthalocyanines Porphyrins were obtained from Midcentury Chemicals Chicago Illinois or Frontier Scientific Logan Utah and used as received Porphyrin designations are as follows PP protoporphyrin IX HP hematoporphyrin IX TPP meso tetraphenylporphine TNapPS sulfonated 5 10 15 20 tetra naphthalen 1 yl porphyrin TAnthPS sulfonated 5 10 15 20 tetra anthracen 9 yl porphyrin Other porphyrins are tetraphenylporphyrin derivatives e g TPP2F is tetraphenylporphyrin with a fluoro group at the 2 position on each phenyl ring An S at the end of the name indicates that the parent porphyrin was sulfonated In most cases these are mixtures with variable numbers of sulfonates and or positions of the sulfonates on the ring The sulfonated copper phthalocyanine sold as CuPcS 3 4 4 4 was purchased from Aldrich Cell lines and virus strains CV 1 BSC 40 and TK 143B cells were maintained in Dulbecco s modified Eagle s medium DMEM supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum FBS and incubated at 37 C 5 CO 2 CV 1 cells were utilized for virus titer determinations and TK 143B cells were used in virus stock preparations HeLa S3 cells were grown at 37 C in RPMI 1640 culture medium supplemented with 10 FBS and the antibiotics penicillin and streptomycin Growth of vaccinia virus VV Two strains of vaccinia virus VV were used in this study the Western Reserve WR and International Health Department J IHD J strains The WR strain produced by Virotech International Rockville MD was a gift from Dr Mark Feinberg Emory University The IHD J strain was grown as described previously 7 TK 143B cells grown in roller bottles were infected with the WR strain of the virus and incubated for 2 days at 37 C The cells were collected resuspended in a buffered solution of 10 mM Tris HCl pH 9 and homogenized with 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer Large debris and nuclei were sedimented by centrifugation at 1 400 rpm for 5 min The supernatant was collected and trypsin 250 g mL added This was then loaded on a 36 sucrose cushion and the virus pelleted by centrifugation at 13 500 rpm for 80 min using a Beckman SW28 rotor Extracellular particles of IHD J were obtained by infecting TK 143B cells After 24 h incubation at 37 C the culture medium was pre cleared and the virus was concentrated by centrifugation at 13 500 rpm for 80 min in a SW28 rotor and resuspended in 1 mM Tris HCl pH 9 Prevention of virus infection A plaque assay was used to determine the ability of test compounds to prevent infection Compound stock solutions 5 mg mL were diluted 10 fold in DMEM without FBS and mixed with virus particles to five final concentrations 50 10 2 0 4 and 0 08 g mL After 1 h incubation in the dark the virus drug mixture was diluted 10 fold in DMEM without FBS to 500 L and 100 L added to each well of confluent CV 1 or BSC 40 cells grown in 24 well plates This afforded 200 pfu well 1 10 3pfu cell Following virus drug adsorption onto the monolayer 1 h at 37 C cell monolayers were washed twice PBS to remove residual virus drug mixture New growth medium supplemented with 2 5 FBS was then added to each well A plaque assay was used to determine the quantity of infectious particles remaining after drug treatment Two days after infection the growth medium was removed and the cells washed twice with PBS A solution of 0 1 crystal violet 10 formaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline PBS was then added to the wells After 30 min incubation the stain was removed and the wells washed with PBS and allowed to dry The number of plaques was then determined and activity calculated based on the reduction in average number of plaques in wells where the compound was pre incubated with the virus compared to the control wells inoculated with untreated virus As an alternative to the liquid overlay agar overlays were also investigated Similar results were obtained with both assays Hence further plaque assays were done using liquid overlays EC 50 values were calculated as response min max min 1 10 exp log drug logEC 50 using Kaleidagraph Synergy Software Reading Pennsylvania Reported EC 50 values are the average and standard deviation of three separate determinations each replicated three times Inhibition of virus yield Confluent monolayers of CV 1 cells were infected with 5 10 5pfu well 2 5 pfu cell of WR for 2 h at 37 C The cells were then washed twice with PBS to remove any residual virus Compound stock solutions 5 mg mL were diluted in DMEM with 2 5 FBS to final concentrations of 50 or 25 g mL This media containing compounds 500 L was then added to the cells At 16 h post infection cell monolayers and culture medium were harvested and subjected to several cycles of freeze thawing to release intracellular and extracellular virus particles A plaque assay on CV 1 cells was used to determine the virus titer CV 1 cells were infected with the virus inoculum for 1 h the growth medium was removed and 2 5 FBS in DMEM added to the cells After 2 days the cells were washed with PBS and later stained with a solution of 0 1 crystal violet 10 formaldehyde in PBS and the viral plaque number was counted To determine if viral inactivation occurs after cell lysis the cell monolayers were washed three times with DMEM to remove the compounds then harvested and subjected to several cycles of freeze thawing to release intracellular virus particles Cell proliferation assay Cell proliferation was measured by 3H thymidine uptake 8 HeLa S3 cells 3 10 4cells well were incubated in 96 well plates in the presence of varying concentrations of the tetrapyrroles for 2 days at 37 C after which 3H TdR 1 Ci well was added The cells were further incubated for 16 h then harvested and 3H TdR incorporation monitored by using a liquid scintillation counter Data are from a single experiment Cytotoxicity of active tetrapyrroles CV 1 and BSC 40 cells were seeded at a concentration of 3 5 10 4cells well in a 96 well plate and allowed to attach overnight after which they were 80 confluent Compounds in DMEM with 10 FBS were added to the cells After 2 days a trypan blue viability assay 9 was performed The 50 cytotoxic concentration CC 50 is the concentration required to reduce viable cell numbers by 50 relative to untreated control cell numbers This was determined by incubation in growth medium containing serial dilutions of compounds in the range of 50 2000 g mL for 2 days after which the viable cell numbers were determined To determine the effect of the compounds on cell proliferation after 24 h incubation the cells were washed and further incubated in the absence of the compounds for 1 day and then a trypan blue assay was done Data are from a single experiment Cytostatic activity CV 1 cells were seeded at 3 5 10 3cells well in growth medium in a 96 well plate and allowed to attach overnight the compounds in growth medium were then added Following a 24 h incubation the cells were counted Results Initial screening of porphyrins and phthalocyanines Figure 1 involved more than 100 different compounds These compounds were pre incubated with the virus and then the mixture was inoculated on CV 1 cells and residual virus titers were determined by plaque assay Based on the results obtained we were able to determine the most active compounds that is compounds at 50 g mL that inactivated the virus completely no plaques seen Figure 2 These were chosen as candidates for further study Approximately 20 natural porphyrins based on the protoporphyrin ring skeleton of hemin were evaluated In general structures with the hematoporphyrin ring i e hydroxyethyl groups at the 2 and 4 positions see CuHPIX in Figure 1 were found to be more active than structures with the protoporphyrin see ZnPPIX in Figure 1 mesoporphyrin deuteroporphyrin or deuteroporphyrin disulfonic acid rings ethyl hydrogen or sulfonate at positions 2 and 4 respectively CuHPIX and ZnPPIX were evaluated in more detail CuHPIX was more active than ZnPPIX e g EC 50 values of 1 5 vs 25 7 g mL for IHD J in CV 1 cells but neither was as active as the sulfonated porphyrins vide infra The ability of these compounds to prevent infection was also compared in BSC 40 cells Generally the EC 50 data obtained from both cell lines were of the same order of magnitude however in the BSC 40 cell line the WR strain of the virus showed a hundred fold greater sensitivity to CuHPIX as compared with CV 1 cells Table 1 A large number of sulfonated tetraphenylporphyrin derivatives was also evaluated A series of 15 metal chelates of tetraphenylporphyrin tetrasulfonate TPPS4 was tested but none showed more than 50 activity at 50 g mL using either the WR or IHD J strains these candidates therefore were not pursued A series of 12 tetraphenylporphyrin derivatives made via sulfonation of the 2 F Cl and Br the 3 F and Cl and the 4 F and Cl tetraphenylporphyrins was evaluated Many of these derivatives completely blocked infection by both strains at concentrations of 50 g mL Figure 3 TPP2ClS and TPP2FS were studied in more detail These two derivatives had similar activities within a factor of 4 in the WR and IHD J assays A series of sulfonated derivatives of the 2 6 difluoro and 2 6 dichlorotetraphenylporphyrins was also studied The parent compounds and the Co III chelate of the difluoroporphyrin completely inhibited infection at 50 g mL the Co III chelate had EC 50 values of 1 6 CV 1 and 0 74 g mL BSC 40 in the WR assay and 0 44 g mL CV 1 in the IHD J assay The other compounds tested were less active i e at 50 g mL they inactivated the virus by less than 50 Four non halogenated porphyrin derivatives with aryl side chains TNapS TAnthS TPP 2 6 OH 2 and TPP4OMeS had high activity Table 1 All of these had EC 50 values of 5 g mL in both assays TNapS and TAnthS were more active against the IHD J than WR strain Table 1 using CV 1 cells TPP 2 6 OH 2 also had high activity EC 50 values were 0 17 CV 1 and 0 19 BSC 40 g mL for the WR assay and 0 7 CV 1 and 0 32 g mL BSC 40 in the IHD J assay TPP 2 6 OH 2 is a neutral compound with eight hydroxyl groups Figure 1 this may give it amphiphilic properties that could play a role in blocking infection Approximately 25 sulfonated phthalocyanines PcS were evaluated Only the copper and chromium PcS were able to inhibit viral infection The copper phthalocyanine sulfonate only had an EC 50 of approximately 50 g mL in the WR assay in both cell lines It was somewhat more active in the IHD J assays but the sulfonated phthalocyanines were not studied further Since there are major differences in surface antigens and presumably in the host cell receptors between the intracellular and extracellular particles of VV 10 11 12 we also compared the sensitivity of the two forms to the compounds to be tested Generally the compounds tested were highly effective against both forms Table 1 Comparison of the intracellular mature virion IMV third column in Table 1 and extracellular enveloped virion EEV forms of the IHD J strain showed differences in activity of some compounds in blocking infection by the two forms of the virus These results suggest that the tetrapyrroles may be binding to different components on the surface of the two forms of the virus and thus show differences in efficiency of preventing virus infection The active compounds exhibited very low to moderate toxicity in assays for their effects on cell viability Table 2 Therapeutic ratios calculated as CC 50 EC 50 were found to be in a range from 64 1400 with the exception of ZnPPIX for which the ratios were in the range of 1 3 The compounds were also tested in CV 1 cells and a human cell line HeLaS3 for their effect on cell growth Table 3 The compounds tested generally inhibited CV 1 cell growth at high concentrations and 3H thymidine uptake in HeLa cells by 50 only at concentrations above 20 g mL except for Co III TPP 2 6 F2 S CC 50 5 g mL The ability of a number of tetrapyrroles to inhibit virus replication was determined in CV 1 cells infected with the WR strain in the absence of compounds Following virus adsorption 2 h compounds in growth medium were added to the cells After 16 h post infection cells and media were collected virus was released by freezing and thawing and virus yields determined by plaque assay Reduction of virus yield was observed with all compounds assayed Table 4 with most compounds resulting in 95 99 reduction at 50 g mL These results indicate that infectious virus production is being inhibited by these compounds These results were compared to those of other experiments in which the compounds were removed before viral titration was done Table 5 The effect on viral yield was found to be significantly reduced when the compounds were removed prior to harvest indicating that the inhibitory effect occurs predominantly after viral release Using a lower moi 0 001 pfu cell and removing the compounds before the viral harvest resulted in reduction of viral yields by as much as 98 Table 6 indicating that the compounds block multiple cycle replication of the virus Inhibition of virus spread by these compounds has also been observed when the tetrapyrroles were included in the overlay medium in a plaque assay After 44 h the cell monolayers were stained and the plaque numbers determined We observed substantial reductions in plaque numbers and size data not shown indicating inhibition of both virus infection and spread Discussion Photoinactivation of viruses by diamagnetic porphyrins and phthalocyanines has been widely studied 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 Photoactivation involves absorption of light by the tetrapyrrole with resulting production of free radicals and singlet oxygen In the current study inhibition of vaccinia infection is not due to photoactivation of the tetrapyrroles as shown by two aspects of the experiments First there was little exposure to light during experiments with no additional irradiation Second we observed that the extent of inactivation was not a function of the spin state diamagnetic or paramagnetic for metal chelates of the porphyrins and phthalocyanines Only diamagnetic tetrapyrroles are able to inhibit viruses via photoinactivation the excited states of the paramagnetic derivatives have short half lives and do not give significant amounts of free radicals or singlet oxygen Tetrapyrroles previously have been reported to inhibit certain other viruses by mechanisms not involving photoactivation A cationic phthalocyanine was reported to inhibit human rhinovirus type 5 RV 5 infection 21 Selected porphyrin derivatives inhibit specific viral targets including retroviral reverse transcriptase 22 23 24 25 26 and HIV 1 protease 27 In previous studies of the antiviral effects of porphyrins Song et al investigated the antiviral effects of Fe meso tetrakis 3 4 disulfonatomesityl porphyrin FeTMPS and meso tetra 4 carboxyphenyl porphyrin TPPC and its iron and nickel chelates for a variety of viruses 28 EC 50 s were generally 20 g mL or greater for VV VSV HSV 1 HSV 2 Coxsackie virus B4 and poliovirus 1 FeTMPS showed activity in this range also for parainfluenza 3 reovirus 1 and Semliki forest virus FeTMPS was more active for sindbis virus VZV and CMV with EC 50 s of 5 to 25 g mL Fe and Ni TPPC were also quite active against CMV Porphyrins and metalloporphyrins have also been shown to have antiviral activity against HIV 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 Previous studies indicated that some porphyrins inhibit the interaction between the virus envelope protein and its receptors 28 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 We have shown also that porphyrins block infection by HIV 1 and that this activity appears to be a result of an interaction with the envelope protein 38 In this regard the compounds that were active in blocking infection by HIV 1 tended to be sulfonated compounds or other negatively charged compounds In the present study it is of interest that the uncharged molecule TPP 2 6 OH 2 was one of the most active compounds tested This result indicates that the activity of this compound with VV is not merely a reflection of an interaction between a negatively charged molecule and positively charged sites on the viral surface but that other structural features are important for interaction with viral proteins Although the WR and IHD J strains exhibited similar sensitivity to most of the compounds tested some differences in their relative sensitivity was observed The WR strain was 3 to 6 fold less sensitive than IHD J to several compounds including TAnthPS CuHPIX and TPP2FS but was about 3 fold more sensitive to inhibition by TPP 2 6 OH 2 These results support the conclusion that the compounds block infection by interacting with specific viral protein s and that strain specific differences in protein structures determine the differences in sensitivities to specific compounds The sensitivity of the activity to relatively small structural changes in our work indicates either that amphiphilicity and steric and specific axial ligand effects significantly control binding to the virion target or that more than one mechanism of inhibition is operational EC 50 data obtained from both viruses studied ranged from 0 05 to 40 M This range is comparable to that observed for other compounds active against vaccinia For example cidofovir an acyclic nucleoside with activity against a variety of DNA viruses used clinically in some instances 39 has been shown to be effective against a number of poxviruses with the following EC 50 values 2 3 M camelpox 46 2 M vaccinia 27 M monkeypox and 58 M cowpox 40 41 Other classes of compounds have been tested for their effectiveness against vaccinia virus including the IMP dehydrogenase inhibitors EC 50 4 100 g mL OMP decarboxylase inhibitors 0 02 15 g mL and polyanionic compounds 0 1 20 g mL 6 In conclusion we observed that both porphyrins and phthalocyanines have substantial antiviral activity against vaccinia virus Examples of the natural porphyrin sulfonated tetraphenylporphyrin neutral tetraphenylporphyrin and sulfonated phthalocyanine classes were all found to be active These results as well as the high therapeutic ratios observed indicate that these compounds represent attractive candidates as antiviral agents to control poxvirus
