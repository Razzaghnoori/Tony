                    Introduction        Epithelial apoptosis in the gastrointestinal tract is        normally restricted to superficial cells but in        pathological states of inflammation or infection apoptotic        cell death can be far more expansive Under these        conditions apoptosis may result from the production of        cytokines     cell activation       infective        agents    and adverse responses to pharmaceuticals             Depending on the agonist or eliciting milieu apoptotic        cell death is accompanied by the activation of various cell        death pathways including caspases ceramide altered gene        expression mitochondrial dysfunction and consumption of        ATP eg with DNA repair that result in        histoneassociated DNA fragmentation      Many of        these cell death pathways are also associated with the        secondary production of oxidants    which appears to        contribute to the magnitude of cell death For example        overexpression of antioxidants like intracellular SOD        reduces cell death     or alternatively depletion of        antioxidant reserves exacerbates cell death to a variety of        stimuli            Despite the knowledge that apoptosis is increased in gut        inflammation either from idiopathic causes like        inflammatory bowel disease     or associated with        infections like         H pylori     little has been        done to examine the effects of antioxidants on epithelial        cell death We have previously demonstrated an excessive        degree of apoptosis in patients with gastritis induced by         H pylori  and that the degree of        apoptosis could be reduced by dietary supplementation with        vitamin C irrespective of whether the infection was        cleared or not     This observation was suggestive        that dietary antioxidants could limit the gut pathology by        limiting cell death mechanisms We have also demonstrated        that mesalamine aminosalicylic acid used as a        frontline treatment for inflammatory bowel disease could        prevent apoptotic epithelial cell death in response to        peroxynitrite     Peroxynitrite is a potent oxidant        formed from two free radicals  nitric oxide and superoxide         that catalyzes the nitration of tyrosine residues The        resultant nitrotyrosine is used as a marker of        peroxynitrite or at least nitration reactions in gastritis            inflammatory bowel disease     as well as        general inflammation     While we have demonstrated        that peroxynitriteinduced apoptosis of macrophages and        colon epithelial cells is reduced by ascorbic acid            it is not known if other dietary antioxidants exert similar        benefits or if they are present in epithelial cells from        the upper gastrointestinal tract However flavonoids and        related phenolic compounds have been described to be more        effective than vitamin C in limiting DNA damage induced by        nitratingnitrosating species in cell free systems                   Altered intracellular redox balance with depletion of        antioxidant reserves is associated with the activation of        transcription factors like NFB and genes TNF IL        associated with apoptosis proliferation and inflammation               Indeed dietary antioxidants like resveratrol            green tea     cucumin    and cats claw            have been shown to inhibit gene expression        associated with inflammation and states of immune        activation From this one could postulate that the benefits        of diets rich in antioxidants could be in part due to a        reduction in signals leading to apoptosis and cell        activation This possibility was addressed in this study by        examining the ability of three antioxidants vitamin C and        two decoctions commonly used in Asia and South America        green tea and cats claw to limit epithelial cell        apoptosis in response to a variety of oxidative stresses        The latter two forms of antioxidants were chosen because        the antioxidant and antiinflammatory phytochemical        constituents polyphenols flavanols are distinct from        ascorbate but yet there is a growing appreciation for their        role in managing disorders associated with oxidative        stress                    Methods                  Cell culture          AGS or IEC cells were obtained from the American          Type Culture Collection Rockville MD The cells were          grown in DMEM high glucose  FCS and supplemented          with  mM HEPES pH   mM Lglutamine  gml          penicillin  gml streptomycin and  gL NaHCO             Cell cultures were maintained in a          humidified  CO            incubator at C Harvested cells          were plated in well microplates    cellswell          and allowed to grow to confluence over  h before use          Baseline effects on cell proliferation by the          antioxidants ie without oxidant coadministration was          followed for  hours          In the experiments evaluating antioxidantsoxidant          interactions on cell number MTT assay the antioxidants          were added to the culture media  hour before the oxidant          being evaluated with incubation for an additional           hours At the conclusion of this incubation period either          cell number was determined by the MTT assay          The cytoprotection activity of antioxidants cats          claw green tea and vitamin C was investigated against          the toxicity of the oxidants DPPH H            O             and peroxynitrite using acridine          orange staining as a means of confirming the absence or          presence of apoptosis by morphological criteria Cells          AGS or IEC were seeded in well plates             cellswell and treated in a similar manner as described          above for the DNA fragmentation ELISA Briefly cell          suspensions  l were mixed with acridine orange           gml and from this mixture an aliquot of  l was          dropped on to a microscope slide Cells were visualized          for nuclear fragmentation under bluegreen fluorescence          using a phasecontrast inverted microscope DMIRB Leica          Mikroscopie und Germany Induction of apoptosis with          the oxidants was confirmed qualitatively as well as          reduction in the extent of the apoptotic response with          antioxidants Quantification of these events was achieved          with the Cell Death ELISA DNA fragmentation assay                          DPPH radical scavenging          The DPPH radical scavenging capacity as previously          reported    was modified as follows The aqueous          extract of freezedried cats claw            Uncaria tomentosa or           Uncaria guianensis  vitamin C or          green tea was standardized to give a stock solution           mgml and filtered at  m using a Whatman paper N           Aliquots  l were placed in a cuvette and an          ethanolic solution of DPPH  M was added to a final          volume of  ml The decrease in absorbance at  nm was          determined continuously with data capturing at  sec          intervals with a spectrophotometer UV PC Shimadzu          Corporation Japan The degree of DPPH radical          scavenging activity of the antioxidants was calculated as          percentage of inhibition  inhibition by the following          expression  inhibition  A           control  A           sample   A           control    where A control is the          absorbance at time   and A           sample is the absorbance of the sample          at time   min An EC            value was determined as the          concentration that elicited a halfmaximal response                          Hydrogen peroxide scavenging          Hydrogen peroxide levels were monitored          spectrophotometrically at  nm in a manner similar to          what is described above for DPPH Reductions in H            O            concentration from an initial  M          were calculated from the reduction in the absorbance          signal after subtracting any inherent signal associated          with the antioxidant          Quenching of peroxynitrite was not evaluated as it can          only be effectively studied at a severe alkaline pH          given the lability of peroxynitrite at neutral pH          Peroxynitrite was synthesized as previously described              Briefly solutions of a  M NaNO              M H            O            and b  M HCl were pumped using          a syringe infusion pump Harvard Apparatus South Natick          MA at  mlmin into a Yjunction and mixed in a           mmdiameter by  cm silica tube The mixture was          collected in a beaker containing a  M KOH solution To          eliminate the excess of H            O             the peroxynitrite solution was          filtered in a column containing MnO             g The prepared solution          contained  mM peroxynitrite as determined by          absorbance at  nm A fresh solution of peroxynitrite           mM was prepared in  mM KOH for each experiment and          filtered at  m                          Cell death photometric enzyme linked immunosorbent          assay ELISA          To investigate the protection cytotoxic effects of          oxidants DPPH H            O             and ONOO  cells AGS and          IEC were seeded in well plates             cellswell Cells were treated with DPPH  M H            O             M peroxynitrite  M          andor supplemented with  gml of each antioxidant          cats claw green tea ascorbic acid and incubated for           h Apoptosis was quantified by a cellular DNA          fragmentation ELISA Cell death was characterized by          measuring DNA fragments released into the medium early          necrosis and late apoptosis and apoptosis DNA          fragments in the cytoplasm The assay is based on the          principle of incubating cells with the nonradioactive          thymidine analogue BrdU which is added to the cells an          media at the time of seeding and incorporated into the          genomic DNA BrdUlabeled DNA fragments are released from          the cells into the cytoplasm during apoptosis or into the          cell culture medium during cellmediated cytotoxicity          The DNA fragments were detected immunologically by the          ELISA technique using an antiDNAantibody coated          microplate to capture the DNA fragments and an          antiBrdUantibody peroxidase conjugate to detect the          BrDU contained in the captured DNA fragments The degree          of apoptosis cytosolic DNA fragments and early necrosis          DNA released into the medium was quantified following          the manufacturers recommendations Roche Molecular          Biochemicals Nutley NJ                          Cell membrane integrity Necrosis          The degree of cellular necrosis cell membrane          integrity in AGS and IEC cells was determined by          measuring the level of lactate dehydrogenase LDH          released into culture media LDH release was quantified          using a commercially available colorimetric kit Sigma          St Louis MO Cells AGS or IEC were seeded into          well plates    cellswell and allowed to          adhere for  hours Cells were then exposed to oxidants          at the previously stated concentrations for an additional           hours In experiments evaluating antioxidantoxidant          interactions antioxidants were added to the culture          media  hour prior to oxidants Following a  hour          incubation culture plates were centrifuged at             g for  minutes and a  L          aliquot transferred to a clean well plate The amount          of LDH released into the culture media was quantified          according to the protocol outlined by the manufacturer          Data were expressed as the percent of LDH released          compared to control cells                          Statistical analysis          Results were analyzed by ANOVA with post hoc analysis          where appropriate by the Dunnetts test using a          commercial statistical software package Instat  Data          is expressed as the mean  SEM with a minimum of three          experiments performed for each variable                            Results                  Cell proliferation and antioxidants          At the concentrations studied addition of          antioxidants to either AGS Figure  or IEC cells          Figure  failed to affect cell proliferation over           hours                          Cell death in response to DPPH          In response to the addition of DPPH  M to the          culture media there was a marked induction in apoptosis          as determined by ELISA and acridine orange assessment          This response was attenuated by the antioxidants in the          following order of potency green tea  cats claw           ascorbic acid for AGS cells Figure  Similar          reductions in apoptosis were observed in IEC cells          although in contrast to AGS cells differences between          antioxidants in their cytoprotective actions were not          significant Table           In both AGS and IEC cells DPPH  M produced a           reduction in cell viability Table  and           This reduction in cell viability was unaffected by          antioxidants with the exception of green tea which          protected against this loss in cell number P            Using media release of BrdUlabeled DNA fragments as an          index of early stage necrosis it was noted that DPPH           M did not raise rates of necrosis above that evident in          untreated control AGS cells Table  Antioxidants did          not change this response with the exception of cats          claw which reduced this assay of early stage necrosis P            when compared to either control untreated          values or the cells treated with DPPH          LDH release into the media was used as an index of the          integrity of cell membranes or necrosis in response to          the oxidant burden Neither peroxynitrite or H            O            at the concentrations chosen          affected LDH levels in either AGS or IEC cells          indicating that cell death by necrosis was minimal DPPH          had no effect on media LDH levels in AGS cells but          significantly raised levels in IEC cells Table           This response was attenuated by cats claw or green tea          P   but not ascorbic acid Table                           Cell death in response to hydrogen peroxide          Hydrogen peroxide  M elicited a marked increase          in apoptosis in AGS Figure  and IEC cells Table           confirmed by acridine orange morphological          assessment Ascorbic acid treatment was less effective          than either green tea or cats claw in attenuating          hydrogen peroxideinduced apoptosis in AGS cells P            In a manner similar to that seen with DPPH in          IEC cells all antioxidants displayed comparable          antiapoptotic actions against H            O            in IEC cells Table           Using the release of BrdUlabeled DNA assay for early          stage necrosis it was noted that hydrogen peroxide           M increased necrosis in AGS cells by approximately           Figure  The induction or necrosis by H            O            in AGS cells was prevented by cats          claw green tea and ascorbic acid P   In          contrast the MTT assay did not reveal changes in cell

     IEC cells by peroxynitrite P   quantified          by ELISA and confirmed morphologically by acridine          orange In AGS cells ascorbic acid caused a reduction in          the apoptotic response to peroxynitrite P            However both cats claw or green tea treatment were more          effective than ascorbate in reducing the apoptotic          response to peroxynitrite P   Figure  Values          for apoptosis for green tea or cats claw but not          ascorbate were lowered to a level that was          indistinguishable from control untreated cells Using          the media release of BrdUlabeled DNA as an index of          early necrotic cell death it was observed that          peroxynitrite treatment induced necrosis in AGS cells P            This effect was reduced by either cats claw          P   or green tea P   but not          ascorbic acid Figure  In contrast in IEC cells          all three antioxidants produced similar degrees of          cytoprotection limiting peroxynitriteinduced apoptosis          Table                           DPPH radical and Hydrogen Peroxide quenching          The DPPH radical was quenched by the antioxidants as          indicated by an acceleration of the decay of the          absorbance signal  nm Ascorbic acid was          significantly more potent than green tea or cats claw P            with green tea being more effective than          cats claw P   The EC            activities for these antioxidants          against DPPH are summarized in Table  This rank order          of potency contrasts the rank order of potency in          protecting epithelial cells form DPPHinduced          apoptosis          The hydrogen peroxide signal determined by          spectroscopy at  nm was quenched by ascorbic acid but          not by the decoctions green tea or cats claw Results          are summarized in Table                             Discussion        From this study it is clear that concentrations of        oxidants that elicit minimal to minor degrees of epithelial        cell necrosis can promote significant apoptotic cell death        This result is not specific to a particular oxidant as a        comparable response was observed with the three distinct        oxidants  peroxynitrite hydrogen peroxide and the free        radical DPPH In each case these oxidants caused        significant apoptosis and cell death which was dramatically        reduced by the addition of dietary antioxidants With the        exception of vitamin C the potency of these antioxidants        as cytoprotective antiapoptotic agents appears to        exceed their inherent ability to quench the specific        oxidant stimulus In other words at concentrations of        green tea or cats claw that had minimal quenching effects        on the oxidant signal itself a significant benefit to        cellular systems was seen This may reflect the combined        contributions of intracellular antioxidants with the        exogenous antioxidant However if that were the sole        explanation the rank order of potency would not change        when switching from cell free to cellular systems        Ascorbate would remain more effective rather than being        the weakest of the antioxidants studied to limit apoptosis        in AGS cells It appears that other factors influence the        antiapoptotic activity of antioxidants        We chose to evaluate cats claw and green tea for        several reasons Beyond being extracts and hence they are        made up of a collection of phytochemicals in contrast to        vitamin C these teas are used for health maintenance in        various cultures Recently both green tea and cats claw        have been reported to reduce the expression of inflammatory        genes responses that are linked to apoptosis and        proliferation         Indeed cats claw has        been described as a potent inhibitor of the transcription        factor NFB activation preventing the expression of TNF        and inducible nitric oxide synthase      These        immuneinflammatory products are associated with gastritis        and epithelial cell death       and hence cats claw        may have utility in limiting gut inflammation            Indeed this matches its ethnomedical use in South America        where it is used to treat gastritis and other forms of        chronic inflammation like arthritis     Green tea and        its constituent polyphenols has been associated with        reduced expression of inflammatory genes and signal        transduction processes leading to cell death                      We focused on epithelial cells of the upper        gastrointestinal tract because the sites of highest        epithelial exposure to these dietary antioxidants would be        the stomach and small intestine following ingestion While        it is likely that these antioxidants are absorbed and exert        actions from the vascular space systemically hence        applications in arthritis knowledge of their        pharmacokinetics is limited Given that gastritis whether        it is induced by infection with         H pylori or toxicity responses to        NSAIDs is associated with NFB activation TNF        expression and apoptosis in epithelial cells              strategies to limit these responses may have significant        therapeutic potential This is particularly true if the        therapeutic modalities are available to a wide section of        the population for little expense However the doses of        antioxidants used in this study are above that noted with        diet or simple tea consumption and are more reflective of        therapeutic intervention based on dietary        supplementation        Gastritis associated with persistent         H pylori infection is associated        with an increased incidence of gastric cancer Whether        dietary antioxidant supplementation retards this expression        has been an appealing hypothesis Several lines of evidence        support this contention Correa et al    have clearly        shown in a large trial conducted over six years that        dietary antioxidant supplementation alone vitamin C or        betacarotene without antimicrobial therapy can limit        the progress of gastric cancer and actually may promote        regression of precancerous states Additionally it appears        that the population subgroups at greatest risk for gastric        cancer have a limited ability to secrete ascorbic acid from        the plasma through the mucosal and into the gastric lumen            In a related study supplementation with vitamin C        reduces the degree of apoptosis and nitrotyrosine        immunohistochemistry     a marker of peroxynitrite        formation     NFB is activated in gastric epithelia        with         H pylori infection and clearance of        this infection reduced NFB levels as well as expression        of inducible nitric oxide      thereby reducing the        mucosal burden of nitric oxide and possibly peroxynitrite        While clearance of the infection is curative much of the        worlds population cannot afford the therapy and further        clearance of the infection with antimicrobial therapy is        not guaranteed Thus treating the host response to the        infection with common readily available antioxidants may        afford some degree of protection In contrast a recent        study in Japan indicated that the consumption of green tea        was not associated with either a reduction or an increase        in gastric cancer rates     This raises concern as to        the ability of polyphenols derived from green tea to afford        protection from mutagenic substances or limit the        progression of established cancer However the discrepancy        is more likely a reflection that higher doses of        polyphenols are required to achieve benefit than that which        is achieved with simple ingestion of tea This is evident        when one evaluates the concentrations required to achieve        anticancer cytoprotective actions in vitro                More recently in the         Apc minmouse model of familial        adenomatous polyposis a condition with a massive induction        of polyps in the gastrointestinal tract green tea extracts        reduced polyp load and potentiated the effects of sulindac        a cyclooxygenase inhibitor used to treat gastrointestinal        cancer     This further affirms the potential of this        strategy in managing disorders characterized by epithelial        cell death and transformation        The gastric mucosal responses to nonsteroidal        antiinflammatory drugs also involve the activation of        NFB generation of cytotoxic cytokines like TNF and        epithelial apoptosis      Administration of low        concentrations of nitric oxide by an ester linkage reduces        this effect suggesting that nitric oxide was offering        benefit by quenching other radicals involved in cell        activation Under these circumstances could        coadministration of dietary antioxidants also limit the        toxicity of the pharmaceutical If so this approach could        offer significant cost savings over the use of newer        cyclooxygenase  COX inhibitors In a recent paper by        Laine     it was calculated that although COX        inhibitors reduced the incidence of gastrointestinal damage        when compared to nonselective COX inhibitors these        benefits were achieved at a significant increase in health        care costs approximately  per patient per year In        contrast we have reported that cats claw prevents the        significant enteropathy associated with sustained use of        indomethacin a nonselective COX inhibitor     and        this combination could alleviate the gastrointestinal        damage without the high costs of COX inhibitors        In the present study oxidant stress was induced by        signals that are largely hydrophilic In other words        apoptosis was not provoked with lipid peroxides As the        chosen antioxidants were hydrophilic a significant        interaction was anticipated However these antioxidants        may be less effective against a lipid peroxide generating        system and under those conditions an antioxidant like        vitamin E may be more effective However lipid        hydroperoxideinduced apoptosis is accompanied by an        alteration in the intracellular redox balance leading to a        depletion of intracellular thiols and subsequent activation        of caspases and PARP cleavage     responses that would        be attenuated by hydrophilic antioxidants        Peroxynitrite is a potent oxidant that can induce lipid        peroxidation and as such may provide important insight        However endogenous production of peroxynitrite remains        controversial Nitration of tyrosine residues is used as an        index of peroxynitrite formation but it is not specific            However the purpose of using peroxynitrite in this        study was to address the effects of a potent oxidant and        not to evaluate the role of peroxynitrite in pathological        states Indeed some oxidants may be environmental and not        produced endogenously but yet antioxidant supplementation        may provide therapeutic utility        In the present study AGS cells human gastric        epithelial cells were used AGS are a transformed cell        line consequently one could argue that dietary        antioxidants could prevent the elimination of these        transformed cells by the mucosal immune response Indeed        that is a concern that has been raised following the        failure of prospective antioxidant trials in smokers to        limit the incidenceprogression of lung cancer    and        the recent epidemiological analysis of gastric cancer        incidence and green tea consumption     However other        evidence has indicated that the antioxidants vitamin E or        Nacetylcysteine enhanced the ability of the        chemotherapeutic agent fluorouracil to induce apoptosis        in colon cancer cells     These in vitro observations        are supported by the         Apc minanimal model    and        sustained clinical trial in patients with         H pylori gastritis    suggesting        that dietary antioxidants do not exacerbate precancerous        states but may indeed promote regression In addition        cells of a lymphoid origin where NFB is constitutively        activated inhibition of NFB confers complete protection        to hydrogen peroxide and pervanadate but rendered HeLa        cells more susceptible to apoptosis induced by TNF                               Conclusion        Dietary antioxidants confer significant protection to        gut epithelial cells from proapoptotic oxidant stress The        phytochemical mixtures found in the teas cats claw and        green tea appear to be more effective than vitamin C in        some cell lines and at concentrations that suggest that        they may be acting at levels distinct from the mere        scavenging of the oxidant signal Diet supplementation with        these or related antioxidants may prove valuable in        limiting the pathophysiology of numerous disorders        associated with gut inflammation                    Competing interests        There are no
