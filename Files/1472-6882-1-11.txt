 Introduction Epithelial apoptosis in the gastro intestinal tract is normally restricted to superficial cells but in pathological states of inflammation or infection apoptotic cell death can be far more expansive Under these conditions apoptosis may result from the production of cytokines 1 cell activation 2 3 4 infective agents 5 and adverse responses to pharmaceuticals 6 7 Depending on the agonist or eliciting milieu apoptotic cell death is accompanied by the activation of various cell death pathways including caspases ceramide altered gene expression mitochondrial dysfunction and consumption of ATP e g with DNA repair that result in histone associated DNA fragmentation 8 9 Many of these cell death pathways are also associated with the secondary production of oxidants 10 which appears to contribute to the magnitude of cell death For example over expression of antioxidants like intracellular SOD reduces cell death 11 or alternatively depletion of antioxidant reserves exacerbates cell death to a variety of stimuli 12 Despite the knowledge that apoptosis is increased in gut inflammation either from idiopathic causes like inflammatory bowel disease 8 9 or associated with infections like H pylori 13 little has been done to examine the effects of antioxidants on epithelial cell death We have previously demonstrated an excessive degree of apoptosis in patients with gastritis induced by H pylori and that the degree of apoptosis could be reduced by dietary supplementation with vitamin C irrespective of whether the infection was cleared or not 13 This observation was suggestive that dietary antioxidants could limit the gut pathology by limiting cell death mechanisms We have also demonstrated that mesalamine 5 aminosalicylic acid used as a frontline treatment for inflammatory bowel disease could prevent apoptotic epithelial cell death in response to peroxynitrite 14 Peroxynitrite is a potent oxidant formed from two free radicals nitric oxide and superoxide that catalyzes the nitration of tyrosine residues The resultant nitrotyrosine is used as a marker of peroxynitrite or at least nitration reactions in gastritis 13 inflammatory bowel disease 15 16 as well as general inflammation 17 While we have demonstrated that peroxynitrite induced apoptosis of macrophages and colon epithelial cells is reduced by ascorbic acid 18 it is not known if other dietary antioxidants exert similar benefits or if they are present in epithelial cells from the upper gastrointestinal tract However flavonoids and related phenolic compounds have been described to be more effective than vitamin C in limiting DNA damage induced by nitrating nitrosating species in cell free systems 19 Altered intracellular redox balance with depletion of antioxidant reserves is associated with the activation of transcription factors like NF B and genes TNF IL 1 associated with apoptosis proliferation and inflammation 3 4 8 9 Indeed dietary antioxidants like resveratrol 20 green tea 21 cucumin 22 and cat s claw 23 24 have been shown to inhibit gene expression associated with inflammation and states of immune activation From this one could postulate that the benefits of diets rich in antioxidants could be in part due to a reduction in signals leading to apoptosis and cell activation This possibility was addressed in this study by examining the ability of three antioxidants vitamin C and two decoctions commonly used in Asia and South America green tea and cat s claw to limit epithelial cell apoptosis in response to a variety of oxidative stresses The latter two forms of antioxidants were chosen because the antioxidant and anti inflammatory phytochemical constituents polyphenols flavanols are distinct from ascorbate but yet there is a growing appreciation for their role in managing disorders associated with oxidative stress Methods Cell culture AGS or IEC 18 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection Rockville MD The cells were grown in DMEM high glucose 10 FCS and supplemented with 25 mM HEPES pH 7 4 4 mM L glutamine 40 g ml penicillin 90 g ml streptomycin and 1 2 g L NaHCO 3 Cell cultures were maintained in a humidified 5 CO 2 incubator at 37 C Harvested cells were plated in 96 well microplates 5 10 4cells well and allowed to grow to confluence over 24 h before use Baseline effects on cell proliferation by the antioxidants i e without oxidant co administration was followed for 72 hours In the experiments evaluating antioxidants oxidant interactions on cell number MTT assay the antioxidants were added to the culture media 1 hour before the oxidant being evaluated with incubation for an additional 24 hours At the conclusion of this incubation period either cell number was determined by the MTT assay The cytoprotection activity of antioxidants cat s claw green tea and vitamin C was investigated against the toxicity of the oxidants DPPH H 2 O 2 and peroxynitrite using acridine orange staining as a means of confirming the absence or presence of apoptosis by morphological criteria Cells AGS or IEC 18 were seeded in 96 well plates 1 5 10 4cells well and treated in a similar manner as described above for the DNA fragmentation ELISA Briefly cell suspensions 100 l were mixed with acridine orange 5 g ml and from this mixture an aliquot of 25 l was dropped on to a microscope slide Cells were visualized for nuclear fragmentation under blue green fluorescence using a phase contrast inverted microscope DMIRB Leica Mikroscopie und Germany Induction of apoptosis with the oxidants was confirmed qualitatively as well as reduction in the extent of the apoptotic response with antioxidants Quantification of these events was achieved with the Cell Death ELISA DNA fragmentation assay DPPH radical scavenging The DPPH radical scavenging capacity as previously reported 24 was modified as follows The aqueous extract of freeze dried cat s claw Uncaria tomentosa or Uncaria guianensis vitamin C or green tea was standardized to give a stock solution 25 mg ml and filtered at 20 m using a Whatman paper N 4 Aliquots 25 l were placed in a cuvette and an ethanolic solution of DPPH 100 M was added to a final volume of 1 ml The decrease in absorbance at 515 nm was determined continuously with data capturing at 30 sec intervals with a spectrophotometer UV 1601 PC Shimadzu Corporation Japan The degree of DPPH radical scavenging activity of the antioxidants was calculated as percentage of inhibition inhibition by the following expression inhibition A control A sample A control 100 where A control is the absorbance at time 0 and A sample is the absorbance of the sample at time 5 min An EC 50 value was determined as the concentration that elicited a half maximal response Hydrogen peroxide scavenging Hydrogen peroxide levels were monitored spectrophotometrically at 240 nm in a manner similar to what is described above for DPPH Reductions in H 2 O 2 concentration from an initial 50 M were calculated from the reduction in the absorbance signal after subtracting any inherent signal associated with the antioxidant Quenching of peroxynitrite was not evaluated as it can only be effectively studied at a severe alkaline pH given the lability of peroxynitrite at neutral pH Peroxynitrite was synthesized as previously described 14 Briefly solutions of a 0 7 M NaNO 2 0 7 M H 2 O 2 and b 0 6 M HCl were pumped using a syringe infusion pump Harvard Apparatus South Natick MA at 25 ml min into a Y junction and mixed in a 2 mm diameter by 0 5 cm silica tube The mixture was collected in a beaker containing a 1 5 M KOH solution To eliminate the excess of H 2 O 2 the peroxynitrite solution was filtered in a column containing MnO 2 4 g The prepared solution contained 40 mM peroxynitrite as determined by absorbance at 302 nm A fresh solution of peroxynitrite 5 mM was prepared in 5 mM KOH for each experiment and filtered at 0 2 m Cell death photometric enzyme linked immuno sorbent assay ELISA To investigate the protection cytotoxic effects of oxidants DPPH H 2 O 2 and ONOO cells AGS and IEC 18 were seeded in 96 well plates 1 5 10 4cells well Cells were treated with DPPH 3 M H 2 O 2 50 M peroxynitrite 300 M and or supplemented with 10 g ml of each antioxidant cat s claw green tea ascorbic acid and incubated for 6 h Apoptosis was quantified by a cellular DNA fragmentation ELISA Cell death was characterized by measuring DNA fragments released into the medium early necrosis and late apoptosis and apoptosis DNA fragments in the cytoplasm The assay is based on the principle of incubating cells with the non radioactive thymidine analogue BrdU which is added to the cells an media at the time of seeding and incorporated into the genomic DNA BrdU labeled DNA fragments are released from the cells into the cytoplasm during apoptosis or into the cell culture medium during cell mediated cytotoxicity The DNA fragments were detected immunologically by the ELISA technique using an anti DNA antibody coated microplate to capture the DNA fragments and an anti BrdU antibody peroxidase conjugate to detect the BrDU contained in the captured DNA fragments The degree of apoptosis cytosolic DNA fragments and early necrosis DNA released into the medium was quantified following the manufacturer s recommendations Roche Molecular Biochemicals Nutley NJ Cell membrane integrity Necrosis The degree of cellular necrosis cell membrane integrity in AGS and IEC 18 cells was determined by measuring the level of lactate dehydrogenase LDH released into culture media LDH release was quantified using a commercially available colorimetric kit Sigma St Louis MO Cells AGS or IEC 18 were seeded into 96 well plates 1 5 10 4cells well and allowed to adhere for 24 hours Cells were then exposed to oxidants at the previously stated concentrations for an additional 24 hours In experiments evaluating antioxidant oxidant interactions antioxidants were added to the culture media 1 hour prior to oxidants Following a 24 hour incubation culture plates were centrifuged at 250 g for 4 minutes and a 100 L aliquot transferred to a clean 96 well plate The amount of LDH released into the culture media was quantified according to the protocol outlined by the manufacturer Data were expressed as the percent of LDH released compared to control cells Statistical analysis Results were analyzed by ANOVA with post hoc analysis where appropriate by the Dunnett s test using a commercial statistical software package Instat Data is expressed as the mean SEM with a minimum of three experiments performed for each variable Results Cell proliferation and antioxidants At the concentrations studied addition of antioxidants to either AGS Figure 1 or IEC 18 cells Figure 2 failed to affect cell proliferation over 72 hours Cell death in response to DPPH In response to the addition of DPPH 3 M to the culture media there was a marked induction in apoptosis as determined by ELISA and acridine orange assessment This response was attenuated by the antioxidants in the following order of potency green tea cat s claw ascorbic acid for AGS cells Figure 3 Similar reductions in apoptosis were observed in IEC 18 cells although in contrast to AGS cells differences between antioxidants in their cytoprotective actions were not significant Table 1 In both AGS and IEC 18 cells DPPH 3 M produced a 20 30 reduction in cell viability Table 2 3and 4 This reduction in cell viability was unaffected by antioxidants with the exception of green tea which protected against this loss in cell number P 0 05 Using media release of BrdU labeled DNA fragments as an index of early stage necrosis it was noted that DPPH 3 M did not raise rates of necrosis above that evident in untreated control AGS cells Table 4 Antioxidants did not change this response with the exception of cat s claw which reduced this assay of early stage necrosis P 0 01 when compared to either control untreated values or the cells treated with DPPH LDH release into the media was used as an index of the integrity of cell membranes or necrosis in response to the oxidant burden Neither peroxynitrite or H 2 O 2 at the concentrations chosen affected LDH levels in either AGS or IEC 18 cells indicating that cell death by necrosis was minimal DPPH had no effect on media LDH levels in AGS cells but significantly raised levels in IEC 18 cells Table 4 This response was attenuated by cat s claw or green tea P 0 05 but not ascorbic acid Table 4 Cell death in response to hydrogen peroxide Hydrogen peroxide 50 M elicited a marked increase in apoptosis in AGS Figure 4 and IEC 18 cells Table 1 confirmed by acridine orange morphological assessment Ascorbic acid treatment was less effective than either green tea or cat s claw in attenuating hydrogen peroxide induced apoptosis in AGS cells P 0 01 In a manner similar to that seen with DPPH in IEC 18 cells all antioxidants displayed comparable anti apoptotic actions against H 2 O 2 in IEC 18 cells Table 1 Using the release of BrdU labeled DNA assay for early stage necrosis it was noted that hydrogen peroxide 50 M increased necrosis in AGS cells by approximately 34 Figure 5 The induction or necrosis by H 2 O 2 in AGS cells was prevented by cat s claw green tea and ascorbic acid P 0 01 In contrast the MTT assay did not reveal changes in cell number in response to hydrogen peroxide in either AGS or IEC 18 cells Tables 2and 3 Cell death in response to Peroxynitrite Peroxynitrite 300 M exposure reduced cell number MTT assay that was not significantly altered by antioxidant therapy in either AGS or IEC 18 cell types Tables 2and 3 Apoptosis was induced in both AGS and IEC 18 cells by peroxynitrite P 0 001 quantified by ELISA and confirmed morphologically by acridine orange In AGS cells ascorbic acid caused a reduction in the apoptotic response to peroxynitrite P 0 01 However both cat s claw or green tea treatment were more effective than ascorbate in reducing the apoptotic response to peroxynitrite P 0 05 Figure 6 Values for apoptosis for green tea or cat s claw but not ascorbate were lowered to a level that was indistinguishable from control untreated cells Using the media release of BrdU labeled DNA as an index of early necrotic cell death it was observed that peroxynitrite treatment induced necrosis in AGS cells P 0 001 This effect was reduced by either cat s claw P 0 001 or green tea P 0 01 but not ascorbic acid Figure 7 In contrast in IEC 18 cells all three antioxidants produced similar degrees of cytoprotection limiting peroxynitrite induced apoptosis Table 1 DPPH radical and Hydrogen Peroxide quenching The DPPH radical was quenched by the antioxidants as indicated by an acceleration of the decay of the absorbance signal 515 nm Ascorbic acid was significantly more potent than green tea or cat s claw P 0 05 with green tea being more effective than cat s claw P 0 05 The EC 50 activities for these antioxidants against DPPH are summarized in Table 5 This rank order of potency contrasts the rank order of potency in protecting epithelial cells form DPPH induced apoptosis The hydrogen peroxide signal determined by spectroscopy at 240 nm was quenched by ascorbic acid but not by the decoctions green tea or cat s claw Results are summarized in Table 5 Discussion From this study it is clear that concentrations of oxidants that elicit minimal to minor degrees of epithelial cell necrosis can promote significant apoptotic cell death This result is not specific to a particular oxidant as a comparable response was observed with the three distinct oxidants peroxynitrite hydrogen peroxide and the free radical DPPH In each case these oxidants caused significant apoptosis and cell death which was dramatically reduced by the addition of dietary antioxidants With the exception of vitamin C the potency of these antioxidants as cytoprotective anti apoptotic agents appears to exceed their inherent ability to quench the specific oxidant stimulus In other words at concentrations of green tea or cat s claw that had minimal quenching effects on the oxidant signal itself a significant benefit to cellular systems was seen This may reflect the combined contributions of intracellular antioxidants with the exogenous antioxidant However if that were the sole explanation the rank order of potency would not change when switching from cell free to cellular systems Ascorbate would remain more effective rather than being the weakest of the antioxidants studied to limit apoptosis in AGS cells It appears that other factors influence the anti apoptotic activity of antioxidants We chose to evaluate cat s claw and green tea for several reasons Beyond being extracts and hence they are made up of a collection of phytochemicals in contrast to vitamin C these teas are used for health maintenance in various cultures Recently both green tea and cat s claw have been reported to reduce the expression of inflammatory genes responses that are linked to apoptosis and proliferation 23 24 25 26 27 Indeed cat s claw has been described as a potent inhibitor of the transcription factor NF B activation preventing the expression of TNF and inducible nitric oxide synthase 23 24 These immune inflammatory products are associated with gastritis and epithelial cell death 5 6 7 13 and hence cat s claw may have utility in limiting gut inflammation 23 Indeed this matches its ethnomedical use in South America where it is used to treat gastritis and other forms of chronic inflammation like arthritis 28 Green tea and its constituent polyphenols has been associated with reduced expression of inflammatory genes and signal transduction processes leading to cell death 21 25 26 27 We focused on epithelial cells of the upper gastrointestinal tract because the sites of highest epithelial exposure to these dietary antioxidants would be the stomach and small intestine following ingestion While it is likely that these antioxidants are absorbed and exert actions from the vascular space systemically hence applications in arthritis knowledge of their pharmacokinetics is limited Given that gastritis whether it is induced by infection with H pylori or toxicity responses to NSAIDs is associated with NF B activation TNF expression and apoptosis in epithelial cells 5 6 7 strategies to limit these responses may have significant therapeutic potential This is particularly true if the therapeutic modalities are available to a wide section of the population for little expense However the doses of antioxidants used in this study are above that noted with diet or simple tea consumption and are more reflective of therapeutic intervention based on dietary supplementation Gastritis associated with persistent H pylori infection is associated with an increased incidence of gastric cancer Whether dietary antioxidant supplementation retards this expression has been an appealing hypothesis Several lines of evidence support this contention Correa et al 29 have clearly shown in a large trial conducted over six years that dietary antioxidant supplementation alone vitamin C or beta carotene without antimicrobial therapy can limit the progress of gastric cancer and actually may promote regression of precancerous states Additionally it appears that the population sub groups at greatest risk for gastric cancer have a limited ability to secrete ascorbic acid from the plasma through the mucosal and into the gastric lumen 30 In a related study supplementation with vitamin C reduces the degree of apoptosis and nitrotyrosine immunohistochemistry 13 a marker of peroxynitrite formation 15 NF B is activated in gastric epithelia with H pylori infection and clearance of this infection reduced NF B levels as well as expression of inducible nitric oxide 5 13 thereby reducing the mucosal burden of nitric oxide and possibly peroxynitrite While clearance of the infection is curative much of the world s population cannot afford the therapy and further clearance of the infection with antimicrobial therapy is not guaranteed Thus treating the host response to the infection with common readily available antioxidants may afford some degree of protection In contrast a recent study in Japan indicated that the consumption of green tea was not associated with either a reduction or an increase in gastric cancer rates 31 This raises concern as to the ability of polyphenols derived from green tea to afford protection from mutagenic substances or limit the progression of established cancer However the discrepancy is more likely a reflection that higher doses of polyphenols are required to achieve benefit than that which is achieved with simple ingestion of tea This is evident when one evaluates the concentrations required to achieve anticancer cytoprotective actions in vitro 19 21 25 26 27 More recently in the Apc minmouse model of familial adenomatous polyposis a condition with a massive induction of polyps in the gastrointestinal tract green tea extracts reduced polyp load and potentiated the effects of sulindac a cyclo oxygenase inhibitor used to treat gastrointestinal cancer 32 This further affirms the potential of this strategy in managing disorders characterized by epithelial cell death and transformation The gastric mucosal responses to non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs also involve the activation of NF B generation of cytotoxic cytokines like TNF and epithelial apoptosis 6 7 Administration of low concentrations of nitric oxide by an ester linkage reduces this effect suggesting that nitric oxide was offering benefit by quenching other radicals involved in cell activation Under these circumstances could co administration of dietary antioxidants also limit the toxicity of the pharmaceutical If so this approach could offer significant cost savings over the use of newer cyclo oxygenase 2 COX2 inhibitors In a recent paper by Laine 33 it was calculated that although COX2 inhibitors reduced the incidence of gastrointestinal damage when compared to non selective COX inhibitors these benefits were achieved at a significant increase in health care costs approximately 560 per patient per year In contrast we have reported that cat s claw prevents the significant enteropathy associated with sustained use of indomethacin a non selective COX inhibitor 23 and this combination could alleviate the gastrointestinal damage without the high costs of COX2 inhibitors In the present study oxidant stress was induced by signals that are largely hydrophilic In other words apoptosis was not provoked with lipid peroxides As the chosen antioxidants were hydrophilic a significant interaction was anticipated However these antioxidants may be less effective against a lipid peroxide generating system and under those conditions an antioxidant like vitamin E may be more effective However lipid hydroperoxide induced apoptosis is accompanied by an alteration in the intracellular redox balance leading to a depletion of intracellular thiols and subsequent activation of caspases and PARP cleavage 33 responses that would be attenuated by hydrophilic antioxidants Peroxynitrite is a potent oxidant that can induce lipid peroxidation and as such may provide important insight However endogenous production of peroxynitrite remains controversial Nitration of tyrosine residues is used as an index of peroxynitrite formation but it is not specific 13 However the purpose of using peroxynitrite in this study was to address the effects of a potent oxidant and not to evaluate the role of peroxynitrite in pathological states Indeed some oxidants may be environmental and not produced endogenously but yet antioxidant supplementation may provide therapeutic utility In the present study AGS cells human gastric epithelial cells were used AGS are a transformed cell line consequently one could argue that dietary antioxidants could prevent the elimination of these transformed cells by the mucosal immune response Indeed that is a concern that has been raised following the failure of prospective antioxidant trials in smokers to limit the incidence progression of lung cancer 35 and the recent epidemiological analysis of gastric cancer incidence and green tea consumption 32 However other evidence has indicated that the antioxidants vitamin E or N acetylcysteine enhanced the ability of the chemotherapeutic agent 5 fluorouracil to induce apoptosis in colon cancer cells 36 These in vitro observations are supported by the Apc minanimal model 32 and sustained clinical trial in patients with H pylori gastritis 30 suggesting that dietary antioxidants do not exacerbate precancerous states but may indeed promote regression In addition cells of a lymphoid origin where NF B is constitutively activated inhibition of NF B confers complete protection to hydrogen peroxide and pervanadate but rendered HeLa cells more susceptible to apoptosis induced by TNF 37 Conclusion Dietary antioxidants confer significant protection to gut epithelial cells from pro apoptotic oxidant stress The phytochemical mixtures found in the teas cat s claw and green tea appear to be more effective than vitamin C in some cell lines and at concentrations that suggest that they may be acting at levels distinct from the mere scavenging of the oxidant signal Diet supplementation with these or related antioxidants may prove valuable in limiting the pathophysiology of numerous disorders associated with gut inflammation
