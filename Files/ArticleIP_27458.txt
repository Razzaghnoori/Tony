 Bathing Suit vs Birthday Suit Please send your questions for publication to prudence slate com Dear Prudie Here s the scoop Our female boss she s in her 40s like the 15 guys and gals who work for her is installing a new rather large hot tub at her and her husband s secluded home All 15 of us have been invited to a picnic hot tub grand opening party to use her words She said Of course nobody will be wearing suits so don t bother bringing them We feel pressured to attend and partake in the nude socializing in and outside the tub Some of us are completely comfortable others are less sure Your thoughts Wondering Dear Won Do not naked into that hot tub go Your boss must have oatmeal cookies for brains as well as a complete lack of judgment It sounds to Prudie as though you are not the only one feeling uncomfortable with the birthday suit event Luckily you have options You and the crew from the office can all agree to bring suits and so inform Nature Girl If you re not all in agreement which may be the case because you say Some of us are completely comfortable then you can decline either with an explanation or without one If you totally chicken out about stating your reservations there is always the 24 hour flu Prudie assures you there is no need to feel pressured There can be no retaliation for employees who choose not to socialize in the altogether with their co workers As Prudie s aunt used to say The very idea Prudie resolutely Dear Prudie My girlfriend is perfect but Ah it s always the big but What s my big but Fun smart beautiful but my girlfriend just won t give me any space If we don t spend seven evenings a week together if we don t talk on the phone each day during work if I want to spend any time alone my girlfriend pouts and gets angry or cries We have talked about this over and over again and almost broke up over it several times and she is getting better but I put my foot down and insisted that there are just times I need to be by myself and while she accepts that in principle I often feel on my guard as she often gets extremely upset with little provocation if I don t give her enough attention Can this hostile dependency be cured Can I should I even expect her to change I hate the idea that I love her except for this one thing I want to change but really she is absolutely wonderful Except that too much of a good thing is still too much Sated and Then Stuffed Dear Sate It is interesting that you write Prudie that your inamorata is demanding and wants to spend every minute together which is not what you want but that she is absolutely wonderful This is like saying the souffl is the most delicious one ever save for the ground glass mixed in Lovers are not reform schools and you will not get your perfect but girlfriend to change this aspect of her personality This leaves you two choices You can accept her possessiveness and kiss time to yourself goodby or ring off now and preserve some autonomy If you choose the first option Prudie predicts your hostility will build until you wind up choosing the latter This woman s demands suggest an underlying jealousy and immaturity that time will most likely aggravate It s your call Prudie honestly Dear Prudie I have a very close friend we were in junior high together in 1984 who seems to have just dropped out of society He doesn t look for work having been let go from his last job He rarely washes smokes and drinks too much amongst other similar vices and spends the time he s not watching infomercials until 4 a m pining over a girl who broke up with him long ago He s living off unemployment and that s going to run out soon Oh did I mention He s living on my couch To his credit he s not hard to live with He cleans up after himself gives me my space and doesn t eat too much of my food and when he does he eventually replaces it Plus he s great company We ve got very similar sense of humor and we have great conversations I guess what kills me is that he s a talented smart able guy and he s just tossing it away without a care He doesn t hit me up for money but I m a little worried with the government funds ending in a month I ve tried hints from subtle to overt that I don t really approve of what he s doing but I don t want to kick him out Any advice Friend in Need Dear Fren And you are a friend indeed You are also clearly conflicted Your roommate is an unemployed unmotivated slovenly vidiot who smokes and drinks while being fixated on a long gone girlfriend He is also depressed You find him however a good humored chap who s a great conversationalist as well as someone who replenishes the groceries When you say he is tossing it away without a care you are telling Prudie you would give anything to redo this guy s thinking But alas you can t We each get a life to make of it what we will and this is what he s doing with his You say you don t want to kick him out and also mention that his unemployment benefits are soon to end Be prepared for this sad fellow to become your ward if you don t insist he get some mental health help and leave your nest to make a life Prudie realistically Dear Prudence I m an 18 year old student majoring in psychology I like psych but don t love it What I really want to be is a singer but my parents are against it I know I ll never be as happy as a psychologist as I would be as a singer I have the talent but not the moral support I have been tempted many times to run away from home because my parents are unsupportive of my ambition I m embarrassed because I can t stand up for myself Carpe Diem Dear Carp Prudie too is for seizing the diem so give your dream a try and go for it You are only 18 after all which gives you a few years to play with Prudie is taking you at your word that you have talent though sometimes even that isn t enough to achieve your goal But forget your parents opposition and trust your instinct Whether you make it or not as a singer you will not have to look back and regret that you never tried And P S It is not considered running away from home when one is 18 That is the age after all when people go to college or into the military If good fortune strikes send Prudie a CD Prudie melodically Dear Prudie I think I hate my job I must hate my job because I dread getting up every weekday morning I have used all my personal days and my sick days which is making me feel trapped and frantic What should I do Freaked Dear Freak You ve used up all your sick days Well you could always call in Dead Then you should quit Prudie can imagine nothing more sad making than to loathe one s job Use an employment agency the want ads friends anything but find a more satisfying way to keep body and soul together Prudie gainfully
