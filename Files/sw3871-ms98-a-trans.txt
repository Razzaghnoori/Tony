                well what do you think about recycling   well its uh certainly would would help things out uh i dont see a terribly lot of it going on uh here   i dont see a lot of it here either   i was actually quite surprised i went to uh San Francisco recently uh to Berkeley and and uh   uhhuh   they actually have mandatory recycling well no theirs theirs is not mandatory im sorry uh but you know it was just incredible to see  everybody with you know with with ten bags of things and they they have a community recycling center uh where rather than than having monetary incentives for the the people that actually bring stuff into recycling theyre just doing it to help out the city and then the city can use that money you know any money that they can get from that goods that are recycled   well i think if they had some place up up in your area like i know they dont here   yeah no i would i would be glad to but you know we have no place convenient at all i mean i am not really concerned about making money off it um   yeah   you know i mean that that the amount of money that would come out of it is not really enough to make it worthwhile   thats true   its just the recycling per se uh we do very little uh recycle newspapers  but other than that kind of a shame   yeah we we do our cans and stuff but um um you know i dont know if there is someplace close by where you could take everything i know in our neighborhood every so often every few months theyll put in our subdivision theyll put out um like dump trucks so you can get rid of your trash and garbage in your yard and theyll haul it off for you and it is all free if they did something like that and they theyll get a chipper you know like in the spring and in the fall   umhum umhum umhum right   if they did the same thing for recycling i think that would go over real well   yeah i i i think you know i think that if they would have sort of neighborhood or or semi neighborhood recycling centers that is what i saw in Berkeley was it was real interesting it just had uh bunches of bins and and uh in different in each for different thing uh uh you know they even had a specific specific of course being in wine country they they even had wine bottle recycling so you take the wine bottles and the the the wineries would actually buy you know take those bottles back directly   uhhuh wow and recycle them   yeah not and not to have to melt them down they just reuse them uh but they had things for for different types of paper and they had things for the aluminum and then for plastics and   were they all over the community   apparently yeah there there you know there is only a matter of maybe ten fifteen blocks away from where these friend of my lived and and they just save everything up and took a trip over there and they they didnt get anything for it but but um   uhhuh right   you know the thing is that a center like that i am sure it would be self supporting if uh you know just off the proceeds from from recycled things   well it couldnt like glass companies buy the glass back from uh the city or something like that   yeah thats what i am saying you know they could pay for it you know if they have to have someone there occasionally to kind of keep an eye on things or do stuff you know that that salary could easily be paid out of the money that comes from uh selling glass or or aluminum or whatever   right   and uh you know they even had uh they even had a little little shelf area for recycled books where people brought books they didnt want put them on the shelf and people just come and take anything you wanted off the shelf and   yeah well ill be   it was uh quite quite an operation   well thats pretty neat maybe itll catch on all over but i havent really seen it around here hardly at all   yeah no no i   um i have seen where one um i think trash company will put out you put out a bin but it it was never explained what you put in it   umhum   you know and do they really you know i havent seen a special kind of a truck oh in this area now ive seen them uh around Austin uh some theyre theyre like three division trucks you know it has three compartments   yeah oh oh i havent seen those now i i i think i have seen them actually going with like a sack on the side where they are picking up aluminum cans people put them out separately and theyll theyll toss those in a in a bag on the side of the truck or something but   huh   hm yeah i i i think that there is a little bit of you know of of you know i think that they the emphasis on making money from recycling   yeah   is is a is a little bit wrong certainly there is money and value to somebody but i think that the average consumer probably doesnt want to spend the time and it is not enough money to make it really interesting anyway and so   right   um you know i think they they ought to make more of an emphasis on on convenience as opposed to to uh you know to trying to give people money for it   yeah i know i know if they did something like that at work you know if they separated paper where i work they dont even separate the paper   oh now that we do we where i work we we recycle the cans and bottles and and paper but theres a lot of computer paper generated so its you know generally clean white paper   yeah yeah   and uh   now see they dont even do it where i work for a private laboratory and you know that uh ordinary office paper which they go through a lot of it and they they shred all of it   umhum oh   you know and i would think you know and i see them carry them out
