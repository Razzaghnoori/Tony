 Baby It s Cold Outside Tim I don t know what it s like outside your midtown New York hotel room but in downtown New York it s cold As in 11 degrees cold As in so much for global warming cold As in Slate doesn t pay me nearly enough to go outside and freeze my private parts off to get the newspaper cold So that leaves me without much in the way of research as I try to comment on the day s events But fortunately I have a copy of yesterday s New York Daily News crumpled up in my gym bag Let s see the front page story is it s cold outside OK well I covered that in the paragraph above Hmmmm not much else on the news front so let s see what my horoscope says Quiet time between you and your mate is very important A new flame may break a date but try to be forgiving Well that s no problem because if my new flame stands me up I ll have more time to spend with my mate instead of running off and cheating on her See this is the problem with reading yesterday s horoscope it never makes any sense OK maybe I should try the Internet A USA Today CNN Gallup poll finds that with no dominant issue amid an economic boom this year s election could turn on candidates personal qualities as more than half the likely voters say a candidate s leadership skills and vision are what counts The story goes on to say that if the election turns on personal characteristics the Republicans should get a boost in the wake of the Clinton scandal Huh Wasn t that what they said in 1996 when let s see there were no issues amid an economic boom and the nation had supposedly grown tired of all the scandals surrounding Clinton Yeah we got so tired of him and his philandering ways we put him right back into office and we knew what we were getting into OK I didn t predict the whole impeachment thing but Clinton getting caught in a second term sex scandal had about all the shock value of your typical episode of Scooby Doo The article then quotes a retired banker in Amherst who said he was angry at the poor example Clinton has set for children and that since he is making character his top priority he s voting for George W Bush Um since George W Bush is at best a reformed party boy cokehead who didn t work very hard in school wouldn t a super nerdy overachiever like Bill Bradley or Al Gore fulfill the whole character requirement a little better OK now I m off to the Fray to be the first to note that this entry is just another example of the Breakfast Table s pseudo misinformed political commentary masquerading as humor but before I go I would like to leave you with this quote from Charlize Theron on filming in Canadian in this week s Entertainment Weekly Vancouver is very clean and very lovely You have to use Canadian money there though It s very strange I m not sure but I think the rest of the quote was I mean just look at it points to picture of Queen Elizabeth Who s this lady How come Canadites don t worship George Washington like we do Weird Very weird
