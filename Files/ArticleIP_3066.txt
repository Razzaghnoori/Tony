 Goings On About Town One of the funniest moments in Brendan Gill s 1975 memoir Here at The New Yorker comes during a luncheon at the now vanished Ritz in Manhattan At the table are Gill William Shawn then editor of The New Yorker and the reclusive English writer Henry Green Green s new novel Loving has just received a very favorable review in The New Yorker Shawn with his usual hushed delicacy of speech and manner inquires of the novelist whether he could possibly reveal what prompted the creation of such an exquisite work Green obliges I once asked an old butler in Ireland what had been the happiest times of his life he says The butler replied Lying in bed on Sunday morning eating tea and toast with cunty fingers This was not the explanation Shawn was expecting Gill tells us Discs of bright red begin to burn in his cheeks Was Shawn blushing out of prudishness as we are meant to infer This was after all a man renowned for his retiring propriety a man who sedulously barred anything smacking of the salacious from lingerie ads to four letter words from the magazine he stewarded from 1952 until 1987 five years before his death But after reading these two new memoirs about Shawn I wonder He longed for the earthiest and wildest kinds of sexual adventures Lillian Ross discloses in hers adding that he lusted after Hannah Arendt Evonne Goolagong and Madonna As for Ved Mehta he reports that Shawn s favorite thing to watch on television was people dancing uninhibitedly Soul Train one guesses I suspect Shawn did not blush at the cunty fingers remark out of prudery He blushed because it had hit too close to home Both these memoirs must be read by everyone everyone that is who takes seriously the important business of sorting out precisely how he or she feels about The New Yorker then and now Of the two Mehta s is far and away the more entertaining This may seem odd for Mehta is reputed to be a very dull writer whereas Ross is a famously zippy one Moreover Mehta writes as Shawn s adoring acolyte whereas Ross writes as his longtime adulterous lover Just knowing that Mrs Shawn is still alive adds a certain tension to reading much of what this Other Woman chooses to divulge Evidently Bill and Lillian loved each other with a fine pure love a love that was more than love a love coveted by the winged seraphs of heaven We had indeed become one she tells us freely venting the inflations of her heart Shawn was managing editor of The New Yorker when he hired Ross in 1945 as the magazine s second woman reporter the first was Andy Logan He was short and balding but had pale blue eyes to die for As for Ross I was aware of the fact that I was not unappealing During a late night editorial session she says Shawn blurted out his love A few weeks later at the office their eyes met Without a word even it seems to the cab driver they hied uptown to the Plaza where matters were consummated Thereafter the couple set up housekeeping together in an apartment 20 blocks downtown from the Shawn residence on upper Fifth Avenue and stoically endured the sufferings of Shawn s wife who did not want a divorce Now Ross seems like a nice lady and I certainly have nothing against adultery which I hear is being carried on in the best circles these days But the public flaunting of adultery especially when spouses and children are around well it brings out the bourgeois in me It also made me feel funny about William Shawn whom I have always regarded as a great man I loved his New Yorker The prose it contained the gray stuff around the cartoons was balm for the soul unfailingly clear precise logical and quietly stylish So what if the articles were occasionally boring It was a sweet sort of boredom serene and restorative not at all like the kind induced by magazines today which is more akin to nervous exhaustion Besides the moral tone of the magazine was almost wholly admirable it was ahead of the pack on Hiroshima civil rights Vietnam Watergate the environment and this was very much Shawn s doing I do not like to think of him in an illicit love nest eating tea and toast with cunty fingers Happily Ross has sprinkled her memoir with clues that it is not to be taken as entirely factual To say that Shawn was a man who grieved over all living creatures is forgivable hyperbole but later to add that he mourned for Si Newhouse when Newhouse unceremoniously fired him in 1987 a couple of years after buying the magazine well that s a bit much Even Jesus had his limits Elsewhere Ross refers to her lover s very powerful masculinity only to note on the very next page that if he suffered a paper cut on a finger and saw blood he would come into my office looking pale She declares that Bill was incapable of engendering a clich in deed as well as in word But then she puts the most toe curling clich s into his mouth Why am I more ghost than man Or We must arrest our love in midflight And we fix it forever as of today a point of pure light that will reach into eternity File that under Romantic Effusions We Doubt Ever Got Uttered Nor is Ross incapable of a melodramatic clich herself Why can t we just live just live she cries in anguish when she and Shawn walking hand in hand out of Central Park chance to see Shawn s wife slowly making her way down the block with a burden of packages And what does she think of Mrs Shawn I found her to be sensitive and likeable Plus she could do a mean Charleston There is nothing more poignant than the image of an openly cheated upon and humiliated wife doing a mean Charleston William Shawn s indispensability as an editor is amply manifest in Ross memoir Word repetition Whatever reporting Bill asked me to do turned out to be both challenging and fun For me reporting and writing for the magazine was fun pure fun It was never work for me It was fun Even in praising his skill as an editor she betrays the presence of its absence All writers of course have needed the one called the editor who singularly almost mystically embodies the many faceted unique life force infusing the entire enchilada Nice touch that enchilada When cocktail party malcontents mocked Shawn s New Yorker in the late 70s and early 80s they would make fun of such things as E J Kahn s five part series on Grains of the World or Elizabeth Drew s supposedly soporific reporting from Washington But Ved Mehta was always the butt of the worst abuse Shawn was allowing him to publish an autobiography in the pages of the magazine that was mounting up to millions of words over the years and the very idea of it seemed to bore people silly After the publication of two early installments Daddyji and Mamaji each the length of a book one critic cried Enoughji But it kept coming And I for one was grateful Here was a boy growing up in Punjab during the fall of the Raj and the Partition a boy who had been blinded by meningitis at the age of 3 roller skating through the back streets of Lahore as Sikhs slaughtered Hindus and Hindus slaughtered Muslims and civilization was collapsing and then decades later having made his way from India to an Arkansas school for the blind to Balliol College Oxford to The New Yorker re creating the whole thing in Proustian detail and better than Proustian prose Mehta s multivolume autobiography titled Continents of Exile has loss as its overarching theme loss of sight of childhood of home and country and now with this volume loss of Mr Shawn s New Yorker The memoir takes us from the time the author was hired as a staff writer in the early 60s up to 1994 when he was terminated by the loathed Tina Brown in her vandalization of his cherished magazine Mehta evidently loved William Shawn at least as much as Lillian Ross did although his love was not requited in the same way He likens the revered editor to the character Prince Myshkin in The Idiot innocent and vulnerable someone who must be protected And long suffering one might infer He was so careful of not hurting anyone s feelings that he often listened to utterly fatuous arguments for hours on end Like Ross Mehta struggles to express William Shawn s ineffable virtues It is as if Mehta he were beyond our human conception Janet Flanner tells him once to calm him down At times I wondered whether the author in his ecstasies of devotion had not inadvertently committed plagiarism His words on Mr Shawn sound suspiciously like those of Mr Pooter on his boss Mr Perkupp in The Diary of a Nobody Compare Mehta on Shawn His words were so generous that I could scarcely find my tongue even to thank him Pooter on Perkupp My heart was too full to thank him Mehta I started saying to myself compulsively I wish Mr Shawn would ring at the oddest times of the day or night How I longed for the parade of proofs the excitement of rewriting and perfecting Pooter Mr Perkupp I will work night and day to serve you I am not sure I have made it sound this way so far but Mehta s book is completely engrossing the most enjoyable book I think I have ever reviewed It oozes affection and conviction crackles with anger and is stuffed with thumping good stories Many are about Mehta s daft colleagues at The New Yorker such as the guy in the next office His door was always shut but I could hear him through the wall that separated his cubicle from mine typing without pause Even the changing of the paper in the typewriter seemed somehow to be incorporated into the rhythmic rat tat tat year after year went by to the sound of his typing but without a word from his typewriter appearing in the magazine Or the great and eccentric Irish writer Maeve Breenan who fetched up as a bag lady Or the legendary St Clair McKelway whose decisive breakdown came when he hailed a cab and prevailed upon the driver to take him to the New Yorker office at 24 West 43 rd St O K Mac if that s what you want He was in Boston at the time McKelway later told Mehta that if the cabby had not called him Mac his nickname an alarm might have gone off in his head Mehta s writerly persona a disarming mixture of the feline and the naive is perfect for relating the little scandals that worried The New Yorker in the late 70s plagiarism frozen turbot the drama of finding a worthy candidate to succeed the aging Shawn as editor the purchase of the magazine by the evil Si Newhouse We all took fright and the resultant plague of Gottliebs and Florios visited upon it and what he sees as the final debacle Tinaji Lillian Ross by contrast takes a rather cheerful view of the Brown dispensation Indeed the new editor even coaxed Ross into re joining the magazine just as she was booting Mehta out I found that she possessed under the usual disguises her own share of Bill s kind of naivete insight and sensitivity Ross says of Brown She too got it A few months after Brown was appointed editor Shawn died at the age of 85 He had long since stopped reading his beloved magazine in sorrow and relief That s if you believe Mehta Ross assures us that Mr Shawn was reading Tina Brown s New Yorker with new interest in the weeks prior to his death Has Tina Brown betrayed the legacy of William Shawn as Mehta fiercely believes or has she continued and built upon it as Ross is evidently convinced Have the changes she has wrought enlivened a stodgy magazine or vulgarized a dignified one or both These are weighty questions and one is of course loath to compromise one s life chances by hazarding unripe opinions in a public forum such as this
