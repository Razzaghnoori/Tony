 WHERE TO GO You ll need to plan carefully for a thorough exploration of Berlin with a total area of 880 sq km 340 sq miles it is more than eight times the size of Paris Since the reorganization of the municipal transport system virtually the whole of the city is accessible via underground U Bahn overhead S Bahn railways bus or tram You should have no difficulty in reaching the outlying areas including Spandau the museums in Dahlem the parks and lakes in the Grunewald and the summer palaces in Potsdam by public transport Busy traffic and the inevitable parking problems make car rental a less attractive and quite unnecessary option A good orientation exercise is to start with an organized sightseeing tour by bus for instance departing from the eastern end of the Kurf rstendamm Cruises on the Landwehrkanal or Spree and Havel rivers offer a more leisurely way of taking in areas of eastern and western Berlin that are not normally covered by the tour buses The area on and around the Kurf rstendamm is probably the best place to begin as it s very well served by information centers and other tourist facilities Your first port of call should be the Berlin Tourist Office which can be found at the Budapester Stra e side of the Europa Center and is open every day the helpful multi lingual staff will assist you with maps leaflets and other useful information Around Kurf rstendamm Berlin s main thoroughfare literally Prince Elector s Embankment is known to Berliners as the Ku damm It extends for 3 1 2 km about 2 miles through the center of the city forming a triangular area enclosed by Lietzenburger Stra e Hardenbergstra e Leibnizstra e and Tauentzienstra e Here you ll find a vast array of shops caf s restaurants theaters cinemas and art galleries as well as no frills fast food stands and the inevitable souvenir sellers Impressed by the prolongation of the Champs Elys es in Paris to the Bois de Boulogne Bismarck wanted to extend the Ku damm out as far as the Grunewald forest However such pretentions were never realized and finally the avenue linked Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church to nothing grander than the Halensee railway station When you are in the center of Tauentzienstra e notice the intertwined steel tubes of the Berlin sculpture which were designed for the city s 750th anniversary in 1987 The two halves are tantalizingly close to each other yet fail to touch poignantly symbolizing the once divided city At the far end of Tauentzienstra e Wittenbergplatz is a large populous square and contains one of Berlin s many memorials a stark sign outside the U Bahn station which reminds passers by of the Nazi concentration camps The station itself is a beautifully restored Art Deco delight with lovely wooden ticket booths period posters and a central standing clock More than just a department store KaDeWe Kaufhaus des Westens located on the edge of Wittenbergplatz has achieved the status of a monument since its foundation in 1907 The food emporium on the sixth floor is extraordinary Here gourmet globetrotters can perch on a bar stool and sample not only food from all over Germany but also Chinese Japanese Russian French and Swiss cuisine One floor up the Wintergarten is a vast food court in the glass roofed atrium where shoppers can help themselves to less exotic but equally tasty fare It s an ideal spot for a hearty breakfast before a day s shopping The toy department is also well worth a visit Breitscheidplatz is the big pedestrianized area at the base of the Europa Center and a busy gathering place for shoppers and sightseers during the day In the center of the square is Joachim Schmettau s granite Weltkugelbrunnen or Fountain of the World which locals have gaily christened the aquatic dumpling Soaring above it is another very powerful symbol of the city the Kaiser Wilhelm Ged chtniskirche The 1943 bombing combined with artillery fire at the end of the war left the tower with the broken stump of its spire 63 m 206 ft compared with its original 113 m 370 ft as a monumental ruin recalling the city s destruction Flanking it a modern octagonal church to the east and a chapel and hexagonal tower to the west represent the city s post war rebirth Stained glass from Chartres set in walls of molded concrete casts a mysterious bluish glow over the Ku damm at night Built between 1891 1895 to honor Wilhelm I the remains of this Neo Romanesque church constitute a memorial hall to celebrate the Hohenzollerns pious monarchism A mosaic representing Christ the King is set above friezes and reliefs of Prussian monarchs from Friedrich I 1415 1440 to the last crown prince Friedrich Wilhelm On one wall Wilhelm I confers with Chancellor Bismarck and Field Marshals Moltke and Roon With their taste for irreverent nicknames Berliners have deflated the monuments imperial or pacifist intentions by dubbing the original church the broken tooth and the two main additions the lipstick and powder compact Beyond the church is the enormous Europa Center between Tauentzienstra e and Budapester Stra e The center was built in the 1960s and houses scores of shops restaurants a hotel and a casino amid artificial ponds and waterfalls A new multi media experience in the Ku damm Karree Ku damm 207 208 dramatically relates 800 years of the city s history Visitors to The Story of Berlin begin their fascinating journey in a nuclear blast proof underground bunker and finish 15 floors up where there is a stunning view over Berlin The Zoo entrance on Budapester Stra e has one of the most varied collections of animals in Europe Beyond the colorful and pagoda arched Elefantentor Elephant Gate are 35 hectares 86 acres of parkland where you will be able to observe Indian and African elephants giant pandas from China and the rare single horned rhinoceros from India Sooner or later everybody comes to promenade along the Ku damm and a suitable vantage point from which to survey them is Caf Kranzler a Berlin institution at the corner of Joachimstaler Stra e It s now decidedly bourgeois although the original Kranzler at the west end of Unter den Linden between Friedrichstra e and the Brandenburg Gate was a hotbed of radical intellectuals in 1848 The avenue lost almost all the Jugendstil architecture of its Wilhelminian heyday during World War II but a vestige can be seen in the elegant Caf M hring just across the road Otherwise the street is resolutely modern gleaming glass steel and an occasional touch of marble but still a magnet for fashionable shopping Like so much of the city this area is in a constant state of redevelopment The Berlin Panoptikum Waxworks opens in 2001 and a stunning 36 story building known as The Zoo Window is being erected Off the Ku damm at Fasanenstra e 79 you will find the J disches Gemeindezentrum Jewish Community Center Framing the entrance is the domed portal from the synagogue which was burned during the fateful Kristallnacht of 1938 see page 21 The modern building serves as a cultural center for the 15 000 Jews still living in Berlin today in 1933 they numbered some 170 000 The Noah s Ark restaurant inside the Community Center serves up substantial kosher fare as well as holding a marvelous Tuesday night buffet At Fasanenstra e 24 stands the intimate K the Kollwitz Museum containing sketches and sculptures by Berlin artist K the Kollwitz housed in an elegant villa It s worth exploring some of the other side streets off the Ku damm As well as Fasanenstra e you will discover many other elegant tree lined boulevards studded with beautiful balconied villas antiques shops art galleries and exclusive designer boutiques A little to the north fashionable Savignyplatz provides a focus for first class art and architecture bookshops and art galleries located in the arches beneath the overhead S Bahn railway line Here you will find an abundance of literary caf s bistros and bars with plenty of outside seating Tiergarten Area Despite its name the Tiergarten literally animal garden is not another zoo For the Hohenzollern princes it was a forest for hunting deer and wild boar After Frederick the Great cut down the woods to create a formal French garden for his brother August Ferdinand it was replanted with trees in the 19th century and transformed into a landscaped park Following World War II the Berliners stripped away the trees again for fuel Everything you will see here today has been planted since 1950 among pleasant ponds caf s and various monuments The Englischer Garten beside Altonaer Stra e financed by British donations was laid out by the Shropshire Horticultural Society and forms part of the grounds of Schlo Bellevue This white Neo Classical style palace is the official residence of the German President On the northwest side of the Tiergarten is the Hansaviertel a chic though slightly dated residential neighborhood rebuilt by architects for the International Building Exhibition of 1957 Among the winners were Bauhaus founder Walter Gropius H ndelallee 1 9 the Brazilian Oscar Niemeyer Altonaer Stra e 4 14 and Alvar Aalto from Finland Klopstockstra e 30 Their names are inscribed along with the locations of their projects on a map on Klopstockstra e Nearby at Hanseatenweg 10 the Akademie der K nste Arts Academy distinguished by the splendid Henry Moore sculpture outside holds concerts plays and exhibitions of avant garde art At the center of the park on the circle of the Gro er Stern the soaring Siegess ule Victory Column is an unabashed monument dedicated to Prussian militarism It was completed in 1873 two years after the victory over the French and also commemorates successes against Denmark and Austria in 1864 and 1866 respectively A climb of around 285 steps takes you to the top of the 67 m 220 ft column for a breathtaking view over the city from beneath the gilded bronze statue of Winged Victory On the north side of the Gro er Stern are monuments honoring the architects of that first unification the Field Marshals Moltke and Roon and Chancellor Bismarck Follow the River Spree to the east along Spreeweg until you reach the Kongre halle built by the Americans as their country s contribution to the 1957 International Building Exhibition Officially renamed Haus der Kulturen der Welt House of World Cultures the striking design with its curved concrete roof which was rebuilt after collapsing in 1980 led Berliners to dub the building the pregnant oyster The vast space inside is used for temporary exhibitions on global cultures and non European avant garde art and there s also a conference room restaurant caf and theater In front of the building the pond features a sculpture in bronze by the ubiquitous Henry Moore and is attractively illuminated at night An austere black structure stands on the corner of Gro e Querallee near the Kongre halle Built in 1987 the 42 m 138 ft tall tower contains a 68 bell carillon played by hand on a special keyboard which chimes daily at noon and six The Reichstag A few minutes walk from the Kongre halle you ll find the Reichstag building its huge new glass dome with its mirrored central funnel visible from much of the city The parliamentary home of Wilhelminian and Weimar Germany displays the proud dedication Dem deutschen Volke To the German People on a Neo Classical fa ade built in 1894 by Paul Wallot This appeal to patriotism and democracy set above six Corinthian columns outlasted the burning in 1933 and the bombs of World War II and was given renewed significance when Berlin resumed its former role as the seat of government of a unified Germany Today the dome is a major attraction for Berliners and tourists alike They endure lengthy lines to be able to travel to the top gazing out at the city and down into the Bundestag chamber By the end of 2003 the area in front of the Reichstag currently a vast construction site will be transformed with the completion of all the new government district buildings including the Federal Chancellery An enormous new Berlin Central Train Station is being erected at Lehrter Bahnhof and new S and U bahn lines are being built to further extend the city s already splendid public transport system South of the Siegess ule stands the elegant modern shared complex which houses the embassies of Denmark Finland Holland Norway and Sweden the architecture a stunning showcase for Scandinavian design and materials The stylized industrial curves of the Bauhaus Archiv see page 73 on the Landwehr canal were designed by Walter Gropius founder of the hugely influential Bauhaus school of architecture art and design Note Emil Fahrenkamp s gracefully curved travertine clad Bewag Building on the corner of Stauffenbergstra e and Reichpietschufer It was built originally for Shell Oil in 1932 The Gedenkst tte Deutscher Widerstand is a memorial to German resistance against Fascism within the Bendlerblock the former German military headquarters A bronze statue depicting a young man with bound hands stands in the courtyard where Graf von Stauffenberg and other army officers who conspired to blow up Hitler on 20 July 1944 were shot An excellent exhibition in the historical rooms of the building where the attempted coup was planned contains more than 5 000 photographs and historical documents charting the tragic course of resistance At the corner of Potsdamer Stra e Bauhaus master Mies van der Rohe s design for the Neue Nationalgalerie of 20th century art see page 76 is a square glass wall structure with a vast black steel roof supported by eight massive steel columns This work of characteristic elegant simplicity was completed in 1968 a year before the architect s death It stands on a rather windswept raised granite platform that serves as a sculpture court for huge outdoor pieces like Henry Moore s Archer as well as providing a playground for skate boarders Kulturforum Beyond the Nationalgalerie in dignified isolation is the fine steepled Neo Romanesque St Matth iskirche built in the Italian Renaissance style in 1846 by August St ler It is the only pre war building hereabouts to survive Albert Speer s redesign of Berlin and forms the nucleus about which the concert halls and the museums of the city s Cultural Forum are clustered The quality of exhibits in the museums here is simply outstanding The Gem ldegalerie is home to a remarkable collection of German and European paintings from the 13th to the 19th centuries The Kunstgewerbemuseum displays a wide range of the most exquisitely executed arts and crafts from medieval gold and silver church treasuries to Baroque glass and ceramics to 20th and 21st century furniture and clothes See page 74 for a description of the museum s contents The prints and watercolors that comprise the impressive Kupferstichkabinett Engravings Collection were transferred from Museumsinsel and Dahlem to a new home in Matth iskirchplatz in mid 1993 Eclipsed by the sober international style imposed by the Bauhaus in the 1920s of which the Neue Nationalgalerie is a prime example architect Hans Scharoun was at last able to indulge his taste for Expressionistic free form structures His first design the controversial ochre and gold Philharmonie owes its tent like shape to the demands of the concert hall s acoustics and sight lines The home of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra was designed from the inside out from the orchestra to the walls and roof Viewed from across Tiergartenstra e the nearby Musikinstrumentenmuseum is reminiscent of an open card index file and houses an extensive collection of instruments from the 16th century to the present The nearby Staatsbibliothek State Library Potsdamer Stra e 33 was also designed by Scharoun Despite its formidable dimensions the library is a model of peace and harmony A quite ingenious network of staircases leads to multi level reading rooms and easily accessible stacks It s one of the largest modern library buildings in Europe and regularly holds documentary and photographic exhibitions as well as concerts Potsdamer Platz Reduced by war and the Wall to a bleak no man s land the square that was at one time the busiest in Europe has burst back into life in the most invigorating fashion What was once a scar on the landscape epitomizing the division of the city and country is now a thriving arts entertainment shopping and business center The impact of the towering modern buildings made almost predominantly from glass is breathtaking Investment from corporations such as Daimler Chrysler and Sony has resulted in the construction of shopping malls a theater casino a splendid hotel cinemas and a film museum Almost 100 000 people a day come here to marvel at the striking architecture and explore the latest attractions in this ever changing city The Sony Center is a vibrant entertainment complex contained with a central courtyard under a glass ceiling Technophiles can check out the latest gadgets at Sony s first European department store while film buffs will be intrigued by the exhibits at the excellent new Film Museum Berlin A fascinating contrast to the futuristic architecture and technological content can be found in the elegant remains of the old Grandhotel Esplanade now preserved behind glass walls The nearby Arkaden shopping center became a firm favorite with city shoppers as soon as it opened in 1998 and the caf s casino and theater in Marlene Dietrich Platz pay tribute to the city s most famous daughter The Martin Gropius Bau situated nearby at Stresemann Stra e 110 was originally built between 1877 and 1881 by Martin Gropius great uncle of the Bauhaus s Walter Gropius with the help of Heino Schmieden as an arts and crafts museum The lavish red and gold building is now a spacious exhibition site housing art and architecture exhibits in and around its skylighted inner courtyard area Adjacent to the Martin Gropius Bau is the site of Prinz Albrecht Stra e 8 the former School of Applied Arts and Design which served as the headquarters of the SS Gestapo and other Nazi institutions Excavations in 1987 revealed the cellars where thousands of victims were imprisoned and tortured The building constructed above the underground quarters of the SS guards houses the Topographie des Terrors an exhibition of photographs and documents which movingly illustrates the lives of those who resisted the Nazi terror Berlin has many reminders of its dark past but this has particular impact Further along at Askanischer Platz is the sad but graceful arcaded ruin of Anhalter Bahnhof By an irony of latterday history the old railway station was the work of Franz Schwechten the architect who created the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church that other noble ruin see page 31 Mitte The area east of the Brandenburg Gate known as Mitte Middle is the historic center of Berlin and was at one time the center of the capital of the German Democratic Republic The city s most important museums theaters government buildings and churches were constructed here between the 18th and 20th centuries Many buildings including the Friedrichswerdersche Kirche now home to the Schinkel Museum see page 58 and Schinkel s Altes Museum Old Museum see page 76 were carefully restored by East Germany after air raid bombing of World War II and several quarters were rebuilt in the Old Berlin style notably Gendarmenmarkt formerly Platz der Akademie and Museumsinsel see page 76 Today the area s principal avenue Unter den Linden has regained its former importance as the main focus of the capital s cultural and political life while nearby Friedrichstra e is once again becoming a fashionable shopping artery with the opening of several new shopping complexes When you talk to people here however it s worth bearing in mind that eastern Berlin did not turn into a bastion of anti Communism overnight Although the city voted in a conservative mayor in December 1990 the successor party to the Communists did exceptionally well in the old eastern boroughs still a solid left wing stronghold Brandenburg Gate In spite of it attracting occasional protest marches from those who support the political Far Right this formidable symbol of the united city generally appears at last to be realizing the vision of Johann Gottfried Schadow the sculptor who crowned the Brandenburg Gate with the Quadriga a copper statue of Winged Victory in her four horse chariot Schadow had wanted the gate to be known as the Friedenstor Gate of Peace in keeping with the relief of the Procession of Peace that he himself had sculpted beneath Victory s simple chariot The gate itself designed by Carl Gotthard Langhans was built between 1789 and 1791 With two rows of six Doric columns forming the gateway proper it was inspired by the Propylaeum gatehouse leading to the Parthenon in Athens To go all the way Hitler had even planned to hoist the gate onto an artificial hill in an attempt to create a mini Acropolis Forming part of the city wall the gate was intended by the more pragmatic Prussians not so much as a triumphal arch as an imposing tollgate for collecting duties The gate was left isolated in no man s land when the Wall went up and subsequently became the scene of quite ecstatic celebrations when it came down though now you would scarcely believe it as Berliners cross nonchalantly from east to west through Brandenburg s mighty central arch The new US Embassy is being built nearby on land originally occupied by that country s pre war embassy and a large stretch of ground leading towards Potsdamer Platz has been designated as the site of a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust Unter den Linden Sweeping eastwards from the gate this grand 61 m 200 ft wide avenue literally named Beneath the Linden Trees was Berlin s showcase boulevard Frederick the Great saw it as the center of his royal capital and it became the most prestigious address in town Some of its splendor fell victim to 19th century building speculation but the avenue remained fashionable until the bombs of World War II reduced it to rubble Now the trees have been replanted and the most important buildings restored Its western end is dominated by the Russian Federation Embassy on the right as you come from Brandenburg Gate Close by is the smartest hotel in town the supremely elegant Hotel Adlon was recently built on the site of the original hotel of the same name which was a 1930s Berlin legend Continuing east you pass the unprepossessing modern fa ade of the Komische Oper one of Berlin s most important opera companies The ugly exterior is the result of post war reconstruction happily the magnificently over the top original gilded interior has been retained East of Charlottenstra e beyond the patched dark stone of the Deutsche Staatsbibliothek German State Library built between 1903 and 1914 but damaged during the Second World War is Frederick the Great s architectural complex known as Forum Fridericianum An imposing statue of the monarch on horseback 1851 the work of Christian Daniel Rauch stands in the avenue s central strip To recreate the cultural climate that his grandfather had brought to Berlin during the 17th century the king commissioned a new building to house the Royal Academy a library an opera house and a palace for his brother Prince Heinrich The result was Heinrich s palace 1748 which is now beautifully restored and forms part of Humboldt Universit t Founded in 1810 by brothers Alexander and Wilhelm Humboldt the institution counted among its professors and students Hegel Engels Marx and Einstein as well as the Grimm brothers Opposite its rather severe classicism is the curving Baroque fa ade of the Alte Bibliothek Old Library It stands beside the open square named Bebelplatz formerly Opernplatz which was the scene of book burning by Nazi students in 1933 Across Bebelplatz you will find the grand Palladian style Deutsche Staatsoper German State Opera designed in 1742 by Knobelsdorff Frederick the Great s favorite architect To the east of the square the Operncaf is housed in the Prinzessinnenpalais the Prussian princesses Baroque town house Its open air terrace is one of the most popular places to meet in the eastern part of Berlin while inside there is an elegant caf and a restaurant to be enjoyed Beside the university the old Prussian army guardhouse the Neue Wache New Guardhouse known as the Mahnmal was Karl Friedrich Schinkel s first important Neo Classical design completed in 1818 It was rebuilt at the end of World War II as a memorial to victims of Fascism and militarism Next door is the handsome Baroque Zeughaus once arsenal for the Prussian Army as the sculpted suits of armor testify along the roof The artist Andreas Schl ter provided the military sculpture but was able to assert his pacifist views with poignant sculpted masks of dying warriors 1696 in the inner courtyard named after him the Schl terhof Since the early 1950s the Zeughaus has been home to the Deutsches Historiches Museum An extensive program of refurbishment is due to be finished by late 2001 In the meantime the collection which includes art and social history exhibits can be found in the splendid Kronprinzenpalais located directly across Unter den Linden To the south of the Staatsoper on the corner of the square is St Hedwigs Kathedrale from 1747 a huge domed structure built for the Catholics incorporated into Protestant Prussia by Frederick s conquest of Polish Silesia The celebrated architectural ensemble south of Unter den Linden on the Gendarmenmarkt has been almost completely restored after near total destruction during World War II The square is bordered by bookshops and caf s set in delightful arcades The imposing Schiller Denkmal 1868 a monument sculpted in Carrara marble surrounds the writer with the muses of philosophy poetry drama and history It stands in front of Schinkel s Ionic porticoed Konzerthaus Originally called the Schauspielhaus Playhouse this is now a concert hall The edifice links two identical churches the Franz sischer Dom or French Cathedral to the north built for the immigrant Huguenots and the Deutscher Dom German Cathedral to the south Both were built in the early 18th century The twin domes were added in 1785 Step inside the Franz sischer Dom to visit the Huguenot museum or look up the stairwell to the Glockenspiel a dizzying 48 m 159 ft above The Turmstuben restaurant on the fourth floor is the place to calm your shattered nerves The Deutscher Dom now houses a fascinating exhibition Fragen an die deutsche Geschichte German History Under Question which was previously in the Reichstag This frank examination of Germany s social and political history cleverly combines documents photographs and radio broadcasts to chronicle the rise of Fascism and the development of democracy The descriptive panels are all in German but audio guides and information booklets are available in English and French A short stroll leads to Friedrichstra e where over 100 000 m of GDR architectural monstrosity have been demolished and replaced by a very elegant development of designer shops offices and apartments French lan has come to Berlin in the form of a branch of the famous department store Galeries Lafayette at Quartier 207 The sophisticated Art Deco styling of Quartier 206 home to some very exclusive designer boutiques is the work of Americans Pen Cobb Freed and Partners Walking along Friedrichstra e you can only marvel at the changes that have been made here since reunification Nowhere is this brought home more strongly than at Checkpoint Charlie that infamous border crossing between East and West Today the barbed wire and barriers are gone but the memories remain housed in the fascinat ing Haus am Checkpoint Charlie Museum Memories of human tragedy on an even wider scale can be found at the new J disches Museum on Lindenstra e Even the architecture has been designed to symbolize the devastation of Jewish life in the Holocaust Daniel Libeskind s building was drawing huge crowds even before the exhibits of Jewish art and history were installed Oranienburger Stra e On the north side of the River Spree Oranienburger Stra e is the heart of the old Jewish quarter In the 1920s a diverse community of Jewish professionals and Bohemian artists and writers lived worked and thrived here After the devastation of the war and the grim sterility of its aftermath the area has now regained much of its former vibrancy with cultural centers and Jewish restaurants rubbing shoulders with off beat caf s and alternative art venues beneath the magnificent black and gold leafed dome of the Neue Synagogue The biggest synagogue in Germany designed by Eduard Knoblauch and completed in 1866 it was gutted during the anti Semitic attacks of Kristallnacht on 9 November 1938 see page 21 and then later destroyed by Allied bombing It has now been beautifully restored and is used for services once more In addition exhibits from the adjacent center of Jewish studies Centrum Judaicum are displayed here Nearby Hackesche H fe is a fascinating complex of early 20th century interconnecting courtyards This has recently been restored and is now a lively spot with bars art galleries shops and offices complete with its own theater Karl Liebknecht Stra e Linking Unter den Linden to Karl Liebknecht Stra e is the 19th century Schlo br cke Palace Bridge designed by Schinkel in 1820 1824 and decorated with fierce warriors and victory goddesses Beyond the bridge look left to the imposing Neo Classical fa ade of the Altes Museum at the far end of the Lustgarten Pleasure Garden which forms a grand entrance to Museumsinsel the site of eastern Berlin s most important museums see page 76 On the opposite side of the Lustgarten stands the area once more known as Schlossplatz Under the GDR its name was changed to Marx Engels Platz and it became a focus of Communist May Day military parades and rallies The war damaged Stadtschlo City Palace of the Hohenzollerns once stood here However in 1950 Walter Ulbricht decided to raze it as symbolizing German imperialism despite protests from art historians that it was the city s outstanding Baroque building You can see a model of the palace in the historical apartments at Schlo Charlottenburg see page 55 The palace balcony from which Spartacist leader Karl Liebknecht proclaimed his doomed Socialist Republic in 1918 was added to the front of the Staatsrat Council of State building on the east side of the square while the monstrous bronze glass and steel Palast der Republik once not so very long ago the seat of East Germany s parliament replaced what remained of the royal residence Recent budget cuts have postponed the demolition of the Palast and there is a movement afoot to preserve it as an historic monument On the opposite side the exterior of Kaiser Wilhelm II s Berliner Dom has been completely restored and its interior beautifully renovated despite sustaining heavy bomb damage during the Second World War The cathedral acts as a place of worship as well as a museum and has a crypt containing 95 Hohenzollern sarcophagi Continue along Karl Liebknecht Stra e as far as the Marienkirche 13th century on Neuer Markt a haven of sober Gothic simplicity amid the prevailing bombast Inside see Schl ter s Baroque marble pulpit 1703 and a late Gothic fresco of the Dance of Death 1484 in the tower hall The Neo Renaissance Berliner Rathaus also known as the Rotes Rathaus Red Town Hall owes its nickname to its red clinker masonry not its ideology Built between 1861 and 1869 it is now the seat of the city s governing mayor and is decorated with an interesting terracotta frieze chronicling the history of Berlin up to the time of the building s construction Beyond the huge Neptunbrunnen Neptune s Fountain a rather elaborate affair decorated with four figures representing the rivers Rhine Elbe Oder and Weichsel you can hardly miss the Fernsehturm Television Tower rising up above Alexanderplatz It was built in 1969 and at 365 m 1 197 ft absolutely dwarfs western Berlin s Funkturm see page 59 which was the object of the exercise Not for the fainthearted an observation deck at 207 m 679 ft affords an excellent view over the city while the revolving restaurant provides refreshment Alexanderplatz Alex as the huge square is known was once the undisputed heart of pre war Berlin and its vibrancy was celebrated in Alfred D blin s great 1929 novel Berlin Alexanderplatz later filmed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder Today the square is a rather bleak and desolate place with a fountain and a circular World Clock surrounded by grim graffiti ridden Communist architecture However plans are afoot to knock down and rebuild part of the area and restore some of the square s former vitality The crumbling fa ades of apartments hotels and bargain basement shops line Karl Marx Allee leading southeast from Alex Walk up and down it if only to remind yourself what soulless buildings Stalinist architects could produce Until 1961 the street was known as Stalin Allee To the north of Alexanderplatz behind the Volksb hne theater Sch nhauser Allee is one of the most characteristic avenues of Old Berlin leading to the center of Prenzlauer Berg the 19th century working class quarter now a lively bohemian area with colorful nightlife On Husemannstra e a number of buildings from the age of Kaiser Wilhelm II have been pleasingly restored Nikolaiviertel South of the Rotes Rathaus the neighborhood of Nikolai was restored for Berlin s 750th anniversary celebrations in 1987 as a clean example of Old Berlin The site of Berlin s earliest settlement it clusters around the city s oldest parish church the twin steepled Gothic style Nikolaikirche The church was built in 1230 and now forms part of the M rkisches Museum see page 79 devoted to the city s history Among the buildings resurrected here is the Gastst tte zum Nu baum the favorite tavern of cartoonist Heinrich Zille The Knoblauchhaus at Poststra e 23 is an elegant house rebuilt in Neo Classical style in 1835 and containing some fine Biedermeier furniture More stately is the reconstructed Ephraimpalais Poststra e 16 a rococo mansion built for Friedrich II s financier Veitel Heine Ephraim in 1765 Besides providing a delightful setting for chamber music recitals it is also used for exhibitions of 18th and 19th century art and Berlin history Schlo Charlottenburg The carefully restored palace an exemplary piece of Prussian Baroque and rococo architecture and decoration is the city s only surviving major Hohenzollern residence To do the palace grounds and surrounding museums full justice you will need to spend at least a day here Badly damaged in a World War II air raid Schlo Charlottenburg became the target of extensive post war reconstruction and now functions as a major museum complex The Galerie der Romantik Gallery of Romantic Art and the Museum f r Vor und Fr hgeschichte Museum of Primeval and Early History are housed in the east and west wings respectively while the Sammlung Berggruen a collection of contemporary art and the gyptisches Museum Egyptian Museum are in identical guardhouses opposite the palace You will find the Br han Museum dedicated to Art Deco and Art Nouveau in a former infantry barracks opposite the Egyptian museum A detailed description of each museum is given on page 68 Schlo Charlottenburg was conceived as a summer retreat for the future Queen Sophie Charlotte in the 1690s when the site beside the River Spree west of the Tiergarten lay well outside the city limits It was a small palace scarcely one fifth of the huge structure you see today and only with the addition of a majestic domed tower with the goddess Fortune as its weathervane the Orangerie to the west and a new east wing did it become big enough for Frederick the Great If he ever had to leave his beloved Potsdam this was where he came In the palace courtyard you will find an equestrian statue of the Great Elector Friedrich Wilhelm designed by Andreas Schl ter in 1697 One of many art works lost in World War II it was finally recovered from Tegel Lake in 1949 where it had sunk with the barge that was taking it to safety To try and recapture the interior s rather gracious rococo atmosphere furniture and decorations from other Prussian palaces built in the 18th century have been used to replace what was destroyed here during World War II In the Gobelinzimmer notice the fine 18th century tapestries by Charles Vigne The rays of light on the ceiling of the Audienzzimmer Reception Room and bright yellow damask walls in the Schlafzimmer bedroom imitate the motif of the Sun King Louis XIV the Prussian rulers hero Chinoiserie is the dominating feature of the opulent Porzellankabinett filled to the ceiling with hundreds of pieces of Chinese and Japanese porcelain The relatively sober Japanische Kammer contains some prized lacquered cabinets and tables The tapestries depict landscapes of China in spite of the chamber s name Chamber music recitals can be heard in the Eichengalerie Oak Gallery and the Eosander Kapelle chapel which boasts an extravagant rococo decor that makes it more a theater than a place of worship Designed for Frederick the Great by Georg von Knobelsdorff the Neuer Fl gel new wing also the east wing subtly combines dignified late Baroque fa ades with exuberant rococo interiors Part of the ground floor is given over to the Galerie der Romantik see page 69 which boasts the Prussian monarchy s collection of 19th century art The ceremonial staircase which leads to Frederick the Great s state apartments has an abstract modern ceiling fresco by Hann Trier in place of the original decor which was destroyed by fire Trier also painted the ceiling of the Wei e Saal throne room and banquet hall The finest achievement of Knobelsdorff at Schlo Charlottenburg is the splendid 42 m 138 ft long Goldene Galerie This rococo ballroom with its marble walls dripping with gilded stucco leads to two rooms containing a fine group of Watteau paintings Frederick the Great was somewhat amused by the French artist s insolent Enseigne du Gersaint a shop sign for art dealer Gersaint in which a portrait of Louis XIV is being packed away rather unceremoniously Among various other superb works by Watteau you will find L amour paisible Quiet Love and Les Bergers The Shepherds Take a break for coffee or lunch at the Orangerie then head off and explore the Schlo park Among the many buildings in the grounds nearest to the palace is the Italian style Schinkel Pavillon 1825 As well as a collection of Schinkel s drawings and plans the building contains early 19th century Berlin paintings and porcelain Upstairs take a look at an amusing panorama of 1830s Berlin by Eduard Gaertner North of the carp pond the elegant Belvedere once a teahouse now houses a collection of quite exquisite 18th and 19th century porcelain West of Charlottenburg Built for the Games of 1936 Hitler s Olympiastadion was spared bombardment to serve as headquarters for the British Army The structure s bombastic gigantism is an eloquent testimony to the F hrer s taste in architecture Viewed from the main Olympic Gate it appears to be very low slung until you see inside that the field itself has been sunk 12 m 40 ft below ground level The 76 000 capacity stadium still stages sporting events and from May through October is open daily to the public except on event days It is currently undergoing extensive refurbishment in preparation for its role as the venue for the 2006 Soccer World Cup Final To the west of the stadium take the lift up the Glockenturm bell tower for a magnificent view over the Olympic site Beyond the bell tower a pathway will lead you to the Waldb hne an open air amphitheater which is a summer venue for concerts and films On Messedamm southeast of the stadium stands another colossus the famous ICC International Congress Center One of the biggest convention centers in the world the complex is also used for staging cultural events Next to it on the equally huge Messe und Ausstellungsgel nde Trade Fair and Exhibition Area the Funkturm Radio Tower is positively tiny 150 m 492 ft to the tip of its antenna half the height of eastern Berlin s Television Tower see page 53 For breathtaking views take the elevator to the restaurant 55 m 180 ft up or to the observation platform all the way at the top The Outskirts Northeast of Charlottenburg the Gedenkst tte Pl tzensee in H ttigpfad is a stark and moving memorial to the victims of Nazi persecution take bus 123 from S Bahn Tiergarten to Pl tzensee On the opposite side of the road a lane leads to the site of the prison where thousands of people were tortured and executed between 1933 and 1945 including many of the officers involved in the Stauffenberg plot The dark sheds where executions were carried out have been preserved and outside a stone urn filled with soil from concentration camps stands in a corner of the paved yard In one of the sheds you will find a small and poignant exhibition of historical documents which includes death warrants and pictures of leading members of the German resistance There is an information office where you can obtain free booklets in English Russian and French Grunewald and Wannsee On the western edge of Berlin the dense pine forest which was largely stripped for fuel in 1945 has been replanted adding to the 18 million pines around 6 million chestnut linden beech birch and oak trees The lush wooded areas form a reserve for deer wild boar marten foxes and rabbits but there are also plenty of green meadows for picnics and the forest paths are extremely popular with both cyclists and joggers The easiest and most direct way to get to the Grunewald is to take the S Bahn from Bahnhof Zoo to Grunewald S Bahn station Alternatively you could combine your trip with a visit to the museums at Dahlem the Br cke Museum is only a 20 minute walk from the eastern edge of the forest Drivers take the Avus and turn off on the H ttenweg to Grunewaldsee a lake offering swimming and sandy beaches On the east shore in an attractive lakeside setting of beech trees you will find the Jagdschlo Grunewald a hunting lodge built in 1542 for Prince Elector Joachim II Situated in a cobbled courtyard the lodge has been restored to its original Renaissance appearance Inside is displayed a rather curious collection of early German hunting portraits and landscapes among which can be found some remarkable paintings in particular a series of panels depicting the Passion Cycle by Lucas Cranach Other German and Dutch works of note are those by Jordaens Rubens and Bruyn There are marvelous views over the lake from the first and second floor rooms and the period porcelain furniture and wooden floors add rustic charm The nominal admission charge includes entry to the small hunting museum Jagdmuseum on the opposite side of the courtyard A short walk down the path outside the lodge brings you to the rather grand Forsthaus Paulsborn where you can dine in splendor overlooking the lake On the Grunewald s west side along Havelchaussee the Grunewaldturm Grunewald Tower is a Neo Gothic tower built in 1897 to commemorate the 100th birthday of King Wilhelm I You can climb the 205 steps to reach the 55 m 180 ft high observation platform for views as far as Potsdam Ferry stations in the area offer boat rides on the River Havel and forest lakes and the east bank of the Havel is lined with sandy beaches as far as the Wannsee lakes The waterfront near Wannsee S Bahn station is a crowded spot where city dwellers come and let their hair down on warm spring and summer days The water bustles with pleasure boats and ferries and you can cruise all the way to Spandau and Potsdam from here Strandbad Wannsee is Berlin s biggest beach and the longest inland one in Europe West of the Gro er Wannsee K nigstra e crosses Berliner Forst an extension of the Grunewald to Glienicke Park Its whimsical landscaping of little hills bridges and ponds was the work of Peter Josef Lenn in the early 19th century Schlo Glienicke 1828 is a rather austere Neo Classical edifice but the nearby cloister villa and garden houses add a romantic touch A ferry links Pfaueninsel Peacock Island a delightfully tranquil nature reserve in the Havel towards the northern edge of Berliner Forst The island menagerie was used to stock the Berlin Zoo but the bird sanctuary still has much to offer the nature lover including of course peacocks At the southern tip half hidden in the trees is Schinkel s Swiss Cottage but the island s principal curiosity is the fake ruin Schlo Pfaueninsel built in 1797 as a hideaway for Friedrich Wilhelm II and his lover the Countess Wilhelmine von Lichtenau The white wooden fa ade imitates granite blocks and the delightful turrets are joined together at the top by a pretty bridge K nigsstra e extends as far as an illustrious relic of the Cold War Glienicker Bridge once a restricted border crossing between West Berlin and East Germany where the KGB and CIA exchanged spies Spandau With a history longer than Berlin s Spandau northwest of Berlin still remains fiercely independent minded and was the most reluctant of the townships to be annexed by the metropolis in 1920 The town is easily reached by U Bahn and if you have time to spare is well worth visiting for its old restored quarter and 16th century citadel the venue for regular summer festivals of jazz and classical music The Altstadt old town was less damaged by bombing than the rest of Berlin and has been restored to much of its former charm You will see pretty gabled houses Renaissance fa ades and even traces of the 14th century town wall along Hoher Steinweg east of Falkenseer Platz Spandauers claim that St Nikolaikirche situated at the heart of Reformationsplatz is where Prince Joachim II converted to Protestantism The Gothic structure has an imposing Renaissance altar The 16th century Zitadelle citadel in the River Havel was the scene of heavy fighting in the Napoleonic Wars Its walls enclose the old Juliusturm a castle keep from prior medieval fortifications It was the repository for gold coins paid by the French as reparations after the Franco Prussian War and returned as part payment for reparations following World War I The Heimatmuseum Local History Museum in the Zitadelle contains an exhibition of Jewish gravestones found during excavations here which date back to the 13th century A mock medieval tavern within offers good solid fare in authentic surroundings If you re thinking of looking for it don t the famous Spandau prison was razed to the ground to make way for the building of a community center after the death in 1987 of its last and latterly sole inmate convicted war criminal Rudolf Hess To the north of the borough Spandauer Forst is half the size of the Grunewald but equally beautiful The forest contains nature reserves where you will find rare plants protected in their wild state Teufelsbruch for example which regularly records the coldest winter temperatures in Berlin provides a natural shelter for shrubs and flowers from the sub Arctic tundra Just to the east of Teufelsbruch summer bathing and camping are popular at B rgerablage beach on the Havel K penick With its delightful Altstadt old town of 18th and 19th century houses the borough of K penick lies on the southern outskirts of eastern Berlin and is easily accessible by S Bahn line S3 The town is rapidly becoming a fashionable place to live and many of its crumbling old houses have been restored Affluent shops have opened their doors and there are plenty of restaurants caf s and art galleries Like Spandau in the west K penick has a longer history than Berlin itself having been a Slav settlement on an island in the Spree in the 9th century It has a similarly independent minded history Socialist before the proclamation of the Weimar Republic the town led the counter assault which put an end to the right wing Kapp Putsch of 1920 see page 18 Resistance to Hitler by the town s workers in May 1933 resulted in the K penicker Blutwoche bloodbath in which storm troopers killed 91 workers A memorial to the event is in the former Prussian official jail at Puchanstra e 12 To reach Schlo K penick take tram 86 along Bahnhofstra e to Schlo platz The magnificent 17th century palace occupies its own little island in the River Dahme and is the occasional setting for open air summer concerts The palace houses a Kunstgewerbemuseum Arts and Crafts
