 Men at Work Dear Shoshana Let me first comment on the end of what you say about the British echoes of Faludi s findings This shouldn t surprise you Maine has no global reach Los Angeles does When British men feel out of it by comparison to those sleek buffed males merchandized globally the merchandise that oppresses and obsesses them comes from Los Angeles and New York In a way you are unfair to Faludi her interviews reach beyond the style epicenters But I think you are right on target in pointing to the immense divide between wired up screwed up America which is where the money is and a quieter America where men may suffer far less from identity crises because they are trying to get by rather than get ahead When I lived in New York it drove me crazy listening to people complain about making only 100 000 a year they suffered from epicenter envy of people who made 200 000 and spent 300 000 There s no gendering these days in epicenter envy the Manhattan female hotshot is as obsessed about the people who stand above her as the male of this species which again is why I think the story Faludi has told is about men in capitalism rather than men as such What her interviews show is a new chapter in the subject Americans never talk about class Many of the men Faludi interviewed are being lumped into a new synonym for class they are losers In the last generation as we know the gap between winners and losers has grown the wealth of the top 20 percent has expanded the wealth of the middle 60 percent stagnated or declined the resources those in the bottom 20 percent can command has declined As our society becomes more unequal however the imagery of how people ought to live the ideals of self and mutual respect are increasingly defined by behavior and possessions at the top Thus the gnawing sense of being out of it that surfaces among the ordinary people Faludi interviewed the fear of falling behind This is how class works in America a shared imagery of taste and behavior a stark inequality of material educational and social means in measuring up to the image of how you ought to be And this is why when Faludi uses the word emasculation what I think she is evoking is a fear of diminished potency which is more economic than sexual You attack Shoshana the argument Faludi makes that men suffer in large part from a crisis of masculinity because they have failed role models in their fathers i e My father never taught me to be a man I have to confess that this argument which I ve heard for years applied to blacks makes me like you deeply uneasy though in my case for quite personal reasons I was raised by a resolutely single mother who in the 1950s was subjected in Minnesota to the widespread prejudice that by not living in a nuclear family she was doing me untold psychic harm In my own case this didn t prove so but the prejudice in favor of nuclear families is deeply engrained in American life Do you think Faludi is reviving it As you say the myth of the strong father is one thing the reality is often quite another often tyrants who are intimidating rather than encouraging My own experience of parenting is that adult firmness coupled with irony and occasional bouts of silliness makes for sturdy children Perhaps what Faludi was hearing when people told her in one way or another My father never taught me to be a man was a complaint about American childhood I know of no country in which children lead more lonely isolated lives isolated from social contact with children unlike themselves and from adult society You can t be taught just by rules how to be a man or a woman you learn adulthood for yourself and to learn adulthood well you need far more exposure to real life its horrors and difficulties as well as its pleasures than American society makes available to children This is why I think Americans often remark about European children that they seem older more self possessed My question to you about this book is if American men are in the trouble Faludi thinks they we are what s to be done about it You ve written about cooperation in the workplace Do you think the ills she recounts might be righted if in communities there were more opportunities for men to cooperate Faludi seems in part to believe a more interactive society less oriented to displays of potency would ease crises of masculinity My own views head off in another direction but I ll save that until I hear what you have to say
