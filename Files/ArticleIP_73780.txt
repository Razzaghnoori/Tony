 Mac Attack Subject Culturebox Yellow Journalist Re From Kevin MacDonald Date Tue Jan 25 Judith Shulevitz s article Evolutionary Psychology s Anti Semite is so outrageous a piece of yellow journalism that I am surprised that a prominent magazine like Slate would run it It bears about as much semblance to what I ve written as a creationist tract attacking evolution bears to Darwin s Origin of Species It is so outrageous one almost yearns for British laws on libel so that I could force her to prove her claims such as that I am evolutionary psychology s anti Semite or that my ideas about Jews represent the broadest ugliest and most vicious anti Semitism passing for scholarship in this country today Some of her statements are simply overly general others simply false while others are incomplete or take my thoughts entirely out of context In general Shulevitz fails to even once indicate that I have adduced a great deal of evidence for my claims and that I have developed a fairly elaborate theory based on evolutionary biology and evolutionary social psychology To read the rest of MacDonald s post click here to read Culturebox s followup to Evolutionary Psychology s Anti Semite

Fri Jan 21 I want to thank Judith Shulevitz for her report on how business media makes men feel inadequate It s always been my goal to make other people regardless of their sex feel less adequate This makes me feel bigger and better no matter how I m actually doing The news that I am laying waste to an entire generation of men exceeds my greatest ambition in this regard Here I thought they were just a bunch of losers Instead I now understand it s my fault As I see it they have two choices They can drop out of the entire rat race and become folk singers or something or they can belly up to the bar and play in the real world where money is generally the accepted way we keep score If they re tired of feeling inferior to the latter task I highly recommend my new book What Would Machiavelli Do buy it here which might not be germane to this discussion but will help me make more money which is of course one of my most important resolutions Thanks for mentioning me in this august setting And anyone who reads my stuff without knowing I am frequently attempting to achieve irony should probably feel as inadequate as they do To reply click here Stanley Bing writes a column for Fortune Subject Hack Magic Re From Gersh Kuntzman Date Wed Jan 19 As the Gersh Kuntzman mentioned in today s Breakfast Table on the tabloids I feel I must object to the glowing review Tim Carvell gave me I believe he called it the magic of Gersh Kuntzman Never forget that Gersh Kuntzman is a hack of the highest tabloid order Sure his MetroGnome column every Monday is the best in the city but the fact that he can spin dross like the retirement of a Plaza doorman into gold does not mean he deserves awards or even praise Job offers however are another issue Thanks for reading To reply click here

certain Chatterbox knows why and you owe it to your readers to tell them Mr Klayman sued his mother successfully to recover money that she and her husband embezzled from Klayman s maternal grandmother Altogether a different story eh To reply click here Subject Properties of Net Privacy Re From Todd Zubler Date Thu Jan 20 In response to my post Lawrence Lessig writes I don t get what s revolutionary about giving people control over data about them Some don t care much about data about them Others do But that s the benefit of a property system people can be different and the system can respect their differences It is always the government s role to establish property regimes Even my antagonist in The Book Club Richard A Epstein argues that So why not property to protect this if it will help assure more control over private data But that s just my point we already have property rights in our personal data No website can steal my data unless I voluntarily agree to deal with that website Some people will deal with any website regardless of privacy practices Others will choose to deal only with websites that establish privacy guarantees The market in other words is already working to accommodate consumer preferences and maximize social welfare with only minimal intrusion by the government Epstein hits it on the head in his final Book Club response T he standard set of legal techniques from contract to legislation to constitutional protection carries over well to the Internet even after it ceases to be organized as vast public space as it was at its outset Of course there will be problems on the Net just as there will be problems in any space to which any of have to venture No one should be Pangloss or Cassandra To reply click here Subject Re Properties of Net Privacy Re From Lawrence Lessig Date Thu Jan 20 A property right in our personal data I don t know what you mean Of course a web site is not allowed to break into your house and read your diary That s because of the law of trespass not a law giving you a property right to personal data If you go to a web site it can take information about where you were where you look what kind of machine you use how long
