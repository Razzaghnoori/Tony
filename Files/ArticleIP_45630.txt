 Gore s Internet Problem Al Gore has an Internet problem No it s not that silly remark about him having invented it Gore s real problem is that Net surfers apparently think his site is too dull to visit A recent study by Direct Hit the Massachusetts based company that operates a popularity search engine revealed that for five days in late October almost no one searching the Web for information about Gore actually made their way to Gore s official Web site By a large margin Web surfers preferred going to a Gore parody site or an anti Gore site to the real thing Direct Hit tracked the paths of about 1 400 Web surfers who entered the names Al Gore or Bill Bradley into search engines from Oct 22 to Oct 27 These were the days leading up to the town hall meeting between Gore and Bradley in New Hampshire Direct Hit has partnerships with a large number of Web companies including Microsoft Network Lycos InfoSpace LookSmart and others The company claims that it tracks some 71 percent of all Web users over the course of a month The good news for Gore is that more Web surfers were looking for his name than Bradley s by a factor of 57 percent 793 surfers to 43 percent 597 The bad news is that when the search results came up there was no indication that anyone during those five days used the results to visit Gore s authorized site The official site didn t even make the top 50 choices of those who searched for Gore s name according to a Direct Hit executive Instead Web surfers presented with a variety of options were more likely to visit a joke or parody site Gore s site in Spanish was among the 30 sites most often visited by those searching for his name but Direct Hit executives say that after the top 10 there s no significant traffic worth measuring By contrast Bradley s official site was the most common destination of those who entered Bradley s name into a search engine according to Direct Hit The Bradley campaign declined to comment on the study Roger Salazar a spokesman for the Gore campaign says that he has not seen the Direct Hit study It doesn t really surprise me Salazar says The vice president is much better known than his opponent and so it makes sense that more people would be looking for first time information that way Salazar says his campaign is focused on making Gore s site as comprehensive and informative as it can be and estimates that the site attracts several thousand unique visitors per week Direct Hit says that while it cannot detect the identity of individual Web users it can track their movements with unprecedented precision We process the data from our partners on a daily basis says Gary Culliss Direct Hit s chairman and co founder The process is similar to that used to track banner advertising on the Web Culliss added that the popularity rankings also take into consideration the amount of time that visitors spend on a given site Some of the Gore related sites that Direct Hit said were visited most by those searching for Gore material are out of date and thinly visited The third most visited Gore site according to Direct Hit is an Al Gore joke repository posted on the home page of a GeoCities member and sponsored by the Ripon College Republicans The site is actually no longer at the address that Direct Hit found to be most visited a common problem with search engines Now on a Tripod home page the site itself claims to have been hit only 1 110 times since December 1998 Nothing currently on the site is going to hurt Gore very much Sample joke Topping the list of top 20 shortest books of the century Al Gore The Wild Years Of course the Direct Hit study doesn t mean that no one is going to the Gore site Loyal visitors probably already know the URL or have it bookmarked in their Web browsers And it s possible though statistically unlikely that large numbers of Web surfers using search engines not measured by Direct Hit were flocking to the Gore site Most important with the first primaries still months away the Gore campaign hasn t advertised much to bring newcomers to the site It s also possible that the problem is not Gore s alone but rather is common to front runners Although Direct Hit has yet to produce a similar traffic study for the Republican candidates a search on its Web site shows that George W Bush s official site is also not among the top 10 sites surfed by those entering Bush s name However upstart John McCain s official site like Bradley s is the most popular destination for those who ve entered his name into a search engine
