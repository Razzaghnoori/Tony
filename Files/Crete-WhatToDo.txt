What to Do SportsBeach ActivitiesC rete has hundreds of beaches from tiny coves to lengthy strands You can choose to spend your day with hundreds of other people or have the sand all to yourself at a remote spot Beaches in the main resorts have wellorganized watersports facilities with jetskis and water rides kayaking and parasailing behind speed boats The best are at gios Niklaos Hersnissos Mlia Aga Pelaga and Rthymnon on the north coastSouth coast resorts tend to be more low key than their northern counterparts Beaches tend to be smaller in bays rather than in long stretches of shoreline Youll find the most diverse range of beach activities at Mtala Aga Galni and PlakisV in the far northeastern corner is considered the best beach on the island and for this reason it gets busy in summer Out of the way beaches where you can find some solitude tend to lie down narrow tortuous roads in remote parts of the island Try Xerkampos south of Zkros or head east from Mon Prveli to the sandy stretches around tiny Aga FotiniWalking and HikingThis is an ideal island to put on your walking boots and take to the countryside You will be wellrewarded with small remote villages hidden churches and a rural lifestyle to explore Though Cretans are bemused as to why anyone would want to hike without any purpose but the pleasure of it they have a genuine welcome for travelers on foot Itineraries can range from easy flat short walks to steep mountain hikes though its not advisable to head into the high peaks without a guideGorge walks are particularly popular the Samari is the busiest and the longest Other gorge walks include Imbros near Samari and the Valley of the Dead at Zkros on the eastern coast The peninsulas off the northwest coast present dramatic and interesting walks Akrotri is the most populated though not as rugged as Gramvossa and Rodpou which are wild and windswept Shorter itineraries could include the walk from Agii Dka to Grtis from Mlia to the Minoan site to the east or from village to village in the Amri valleyDiexodos is a company that organizes guided hiking tours either by the day or longer They can supply equipment and extra insurance if you need it Contact them at Telfax  BikingMany of these same itineraries can be covered on two wheels as well as on two feet and mountain biking and bike touring are becoming more popular Once into the hinterland however you will need some stamina to make it up the hills and mountain passes Diexodos also organizes bike tours see details above or you can rent equipment in all the major resorts and plan your own itinerary Diving and SnorkelingThe waters around the island offer some interesting diving and snorkeling opportunities for water lovers with all levels of underwater experience Although the Mediterranean Sea is rather overfished and the waters are not warm enough to support brightly colored tropical fish there are still numerous varieties to spot in the rocky shallows including octopi that make their homes in tiny crevices The remains of many ancient sites lie just off the coastline At Elonda you can explore the remains of lous and Mtala has a port and harbor pier The Greek government is concerned that archaeological treasures do not disappear and for this reason diving is only allowed with a qualified dive company that will oversee underwater locations and activitiesIf you have never scubadived before each dive center is registered by the Greek government to offer training in addition to dive supervision for qualified divers All centers are affiliated with one of the major certifying bodies PADI Professional Association of Diving Instructors is the most common The basic qualification the Open Water certificate takes five days to complete Many centers also offer an introductory session commonly known as the Discover SCUBA Program This involves a morning or afternoon of theory and shallow water work giving you the chance to try out the basic techniques before you decide to do the full open water courseEntertainmentA huge number of fairs and festivals take place throughout the year Your local Tourist Office will have details of whats taking place during your stay on Crete Each community celebrates its own Saints Day or panagiraie when the sacred statue is paraded through the streets After a solemn religious service the rest of the day is given over to revelry These are the best places to see traditional Cretan dances and live music and join in with local people having some fun Each village has one at some time during the year so theres sure to be an opportunity to take part Zorba the Greek Music and DanceFor many the image of Greek music and dance is inexorably linked to the film Zorba the Greek Anthony Quinn performs the syrtki dance in fact an amalgam of several different traditional dances to the sound of the bouzoki a stringed guitartype instrument that produces melodic slightly metallic sounds When played live it has a haunting melody but taverna owners do have the irritating habit of playing it at high decibels through overloaded speakers This does a great disservice to the Greek musical tradition which is rich varied and goes back for hundreds of years The tradition is still particularly strong on Crete where traditional musicians and singers are held in high regard Musical rhythms were traditionally matched to the complex cadences of the epic poetry of Greece These are very different from the four beats to a bar that characterizes the western musical tradition and therefore it is sometimes difficult for Western listeners to follow Songs have traditionally been sung by menrelating the hard life of the farmer or fisherman and including an element of sentimentality rarely expressed in other areas of a Greek males lifeEach region of Greece has its own particular songs and dances The music of the southern islands is called nisiotika while in the northern Aegean there is a style called sandouri Most regions also have a syrtos dance steps performed in the roundCretes main traditional musical instrument is the lyra a Ushaped stringed instrument This is usually accompanied by the laouto a variation of the mandolin the askomantoura Cretan bagpipes and the habioli the shepherds flute The instruments are brought together in mantinada songs with rhyming couplets of lyrics Many of these have been passed down through generations of Cretans The fighters of the western mountains had their own songs the rizitika with lyrics praising bravery and patriotism The mountain men also have their own dances The steps of the tsamko are slow and grand reinforcing the status of these heroic figures Rthymnon has its own dance the sosta with hopping steps You can also try the pendozalisChanting epic poetry is also a Cretan tradition that has been carried through the generations This would have strengthened the bonds of lonely and frightened young fighters and stirred their blood before action The thcentury Erotkritos written by Vinztzos Kornros is the most popular of these Rthymnon holds a number of festivals throughout the summer with the municipal gardens and fortress the usual venues The July Music Festival is followed by the Renaissance Festival in August This includes numerous classical performancesThe larger hotels will usually hold a Greek evening on one night each week The music and dance is usually of a high standard though the surroundings can be less than authentic The settlement of Ano Hersnissos just inland from the resort holds a weekly Greek evening in the village square Its full of atmosphere and there is a selection of tavernas where you can enjoy a meal while watching the show Dionysos Restaurant at Limnes near gios Niklaos also holds music and dance eveningsShoppingShopping is one of the delights of a trip to Crete and souvenirs abound in all ranges of price and quality Many souvenir shops in the major resorts tend to cater to the popular however you dont need to look far to find locally produced goods that make wonderful remembrances of your trip and the narrow streets of the old towns are the perfect places to browse for hoursPrices can be

find a number of galleries displaying work by local and international artists in the narrow alleyways of the vrika QuarterA more Greek form of art is that of the icon An icon is a religious portrait usually of a saint or apostle These were a development from the fayum paintings that covered the face of the dead in the sarcophagi of Egyptian mummies Icons lie at the heart of Byzantine or Orthodox worship and they form a focus for prayer The characteristic gold leaf used in their production symbolized the glory of God For centuries they were popular souvenirs of the grand European Tour or religious pilgrimage However modern production methods including thin artificial canvas and gaudy synthetic colors saw them lose favorIn recent years there has been a rebirth in icon painting using traditional methods both for church renovations and for commercial sale This timeconsuming work is exquisite and correspondingly expensive Most monasteries on Crete create certified copies of their most celebrated icons and you can also find them in jewelry shops and specialty stores in the townsJewelryBoth gold and silver are sold by weight with relatively little extra cost for workmanship so
