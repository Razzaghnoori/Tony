 What to Do Sports Beach Activities C rete has hundreds of beaches from tiny coves to lengthy strands You can choose to spend your day with hundreds of other people or have the sand all to yourself at a remote spot Beaches in the main resorts have well organized watersports facilities with jet skis and water rides kayaking and parasailing behind speed boats The best are at gios Nik laos Hers nissos M lia Ag a Pelag a and R thymnon on the north coast South coast resorts tend to be more low key than their northern counterparts Beaches tend to be smaller in bays rather than in long stretches of shoreline You ll find the most diverse range of beach activities at M tala Ag a Gal ni and Plaki s V in the far northeastern corner is considered the best beach on the island and for this reason it gets busy in summer Out of the way beaches where you can find some solitude tend to lie down narrow tortuous roads in remote parts of the island Try Xer kampos south of Z kros or head east from Mon Pr veli to the sandy stretches around tiny Ag a Fotini Walking and Hiking This is an ideal island to put on your walking boots and take to the countryside You will be well rewarded with small remote villages hidden churches and a rural lifestyle to explore Though Cretans are bemused as to why anyone would want to hike without any purpose but the pleasure of it they have a genuine welcome for travelers on foot Itineraries can range from easy flat short walks to steep mountain hikes though it s not advisable to head into the high peaks without a guide Gorge walks are particularly popular the Samari is the busiest and the longest Other gorge walks include Imbros near Samari and the Valley of the Dead at Z kros on the eastern coast The peninsulas off the northwest coast present dramatic and interesting walks Akrot ri is the most populated though not as rugged as Gramvo ssa and Rod pou which are wild and windswept Shorter itineraries could include the walk from Agii D ka to G rtis from M lia to the Minoan site to the east or from village to village in the Am ri valley Diexodos is a company that organizes guided hiking tours either by the day or longer They can supply equipment

becoming more popular Once into the hinterland however you will need some stamina to make it up the hills and mountain passes Diexodos also organizes bike tours see details above or you can rent equipment in all the major resorts and plan your own itinerary Diving and Snorkeling The waters around the island offer some interesting diving and snorkeling opportunities for water lovers with all levels of underwater experience Although the Mediterranean Sea is rather overfished and the waters are not warm enough to support brightly colored tropical fish there are still numerous varieties to spot in the rocky shallows including octopi that make their homes in tiny crevices The remains of many ancient sites lie just off the coastline At Elo nda you can explore the remains of lous and M tala has a port and harbor pier The Greek government is concerned that archaeological treasures do not disappear and for this reason diving is only allowed with a qualified dive company that will oversee underwater locations and activities If you have never scuba dived before each dive center is registered by the Greek government to offer training in addition to dive supervision for qualified divers All centers are affiliated with one of the major certifying bodies PADI Professional Association of Diving Instructors is the most common The basic qualification the Open Water certificate takes five days to complete Many centers also offer an introductory session commonly known as the Discover SCUBA Program This involves a morning or afternoon of theory and shallow water work giving you the chance to try out the basic techniques before you decide to do the full open water course Entertainment A huge number of fairs and festivals take place throughout the year Your local Tourist Office will have details of what s taking place during your stay on Crete Each community celebrates its own Saint s Day or panagiraie when the sacred statue is paraded through the streets After a solemn religious service the rest of the day is given over to revelry These are the best places to see traditional Cretan dances and live music and join in with local people having some fun Each village has one at some time during the year so there s sure to be an opportunity to take part Zorba the Greek Music and Dance For many the image of Greek music and dance is inexorably linked to the film Zorba the Greek Anthony Quinn performs the syrt ki dance in fact an amalgam of several different traditional dances to the sound of the bouzo ki a stringed guitar type instrument that produces melodic slightly metallic sounds When played live it has a haunting melody but taverna owners do have the irritating habit of playing it at high decibels through overloaded speakers This does a great disservice to the Greek musical tradition which is rich varied and goes back for hundreds of years The tradition is still particularly strong on Crete where traditional musicians and singers are held in high regard Musical rhythms were traditionally matched to the complex cadences of the epic poetry of Greece These are very different from the four beats to a bar that characterizes the western musical tradition and therefore it is sometimes difficult for Western listeners to follow Songs have traditionally been sung by men relating the hard life of the farmer or fisherman and including an element of sentimentality rarely expressed in other areas of a Greek male s life Each region of Greece has its own particular songs and dances The music of the southern islands is called nisiotika while in the northern Aegean there is a style called sandouri Most regions also have a syrtos dance steps performed in the round Crete s main traditional musical instrument is the lyra a U shaped stringed instrument This is usually accompanied by the laouto a variation of the mandolin the askomantoura Cretan bagpipes and the habioli the shepherd s flute The instruments are brought together in mantinada songs with rhyming couplets of lyrics Many of these have been passed down through generations of Cretans The fighters of the western mountains had their own songs the rizitika with lyrics praising bravery and patriotism The mountain men also have their own dances The steps of the tsam ko are slow and grand reinforcing the status of these heroic figures R thymnon has its own dance the so sta with hopping steps You can also try the pendozalis Chanting epic poetry is also a Cretan tradition that has been carried through the generations This would have strengthened the bonds of lonely and frightened young fighters and stirred their blood before action The 17th century Erot kritos written by Vinz tzos Korn ros is the most popular of these R thymnon holds a number of festivals throughout the summer with the municipal gardens and fortress the usual venues The July Music Festival is followed by the Renaissance Festival in August This includes numerous classical performances The larger hotels will usually hold a Greek evening on one night each week The music and dance is usually of a high standard though the surroundings can be less than authentic The settlement of Ano Hers nissos just inland from the resort holds a weekly Greek evening in the village square It s full of atmosphere and there is a selection of tavernas where you can enjoy a meal while watching the show Dionysos Restaurant at Limnes near gios Nik laos also holds music and dance evenings Shopping Shopping is one of the delights of a trip to Crete and souvenirs abound in all ranges of price and quality Many souvenir shops in the major resorts tend to cater to the popular however you don t need to look far to find locally produced goods that make wonderful remembrances of your trip and the narrow streets of the old towns are the perfect places to browse for hours Prices can be flexible particularly in tourist shops and at the beginning and end of the season so don t seem too eager to pay the ticket price Textiles Wool and goat hair have always been used to produce material clothing and interesting rugs carpets and throws You can still buy handmade pieces hyfanda with traditional designs or machine produced items Brighter colors often indicate synthetic dyes whereas traditionally made items are still made with the muted earthy colors of natural dyes The price differential will also indicate the difference between the two Dolphins and fish are popular themes as are stylized images of Greek gods You ll find particularly interesting ranges in Krits and An gia along with the approach to the Dictaean Cave in Las thi and in shops in Chani If rugged textiles don t appeal then you ll also find beautiful embroidered items such as cotton and linen tablecloths and napkins Again the hand embroidered pieces are the best and the most expensive but this skill is a dying art so good examples will become harder to find You will however have plenty of everyday tablecloths to choose from in markets and the main tourist centers Leather Goods Leather goods have been extremely good value in Greece for many years Bags purses luggage and belts can be found in abundance try Od s Skridl f Leather Street in Chani to begin comparing quality and prices The traditional leather sandals flat soles with leather straps are still sold in the streets of R thymnon and Chani There is also a workshop at Krits but these days modern mass produced fashion shoes seem to be invading the scene Hopefully this won t signal the demise of this comfortable and casual footwear You can also purchase a pair of Cretan farmer s boots almost knee high black leather with thick leather soles They are guaranteed to last a lifetime and judging by the number of well worn pairs on feet in the hinterland it certainly seems to be the truth These are handmade and will take about one week to complete Edibles Crete is exporting elements of its healthy diet and the seasonal gluts that used to see farming families through the winter now end up on tables in lands far away Olives and olive oil are obvious choices to take home The quality of both is excellent and considered the best in Greece Particularly good are the extra virgin cold pressed oils from Sit a Toplo and Ag a Tri da Honey is also one of the prime staples of the Cretan diet Wild herbs and flowers on the hills impart a wonderful flavor and you can buy it plain or with nuts added Herbs are collected and dried for you to take home and use in your cooking Basil thyme and oregano are the most common though you can also buy mixed sachets

colors Stores in Ir klion stock all the major European designer street names along with many US labels There s not much differential from other EU prices Art and Icons Artists flocked to Chani in the 1960s and 70s and this has left a legacy in the quality of work on sale here and to a lesser extent throughout Crete You will find a number of galleries displaying work by local and international artists in the narrow alleyways of the vr ika Quarter A more Greek form of art is that of the icon An icon is a religious portrait usually of a saint or apostle These were a development from the fayum paintings that covered the face of the dead in the sarcophagi of Egyptian mummies Icons lie at the heart of Byzantine or Orthodox worship and they form a focus for prayer The characteristic gold leaf used in their production symbolized the glory of God For centuries they were popular souvenirs of the grand European Tour or religious pilgrimage However modern production methods including thin artificial canvas and gaudy synthetic colors saw them lose favor In recent years there has been a rebirth in icon painting using traditional methods both for church renovations and for commercial sale This time consuming work is exquisite and correspondingly expensive Most monasteries on Crete create certified copies of their most celebrated icons and you can also find them in jewelry shops and specialty stores in the towns Jewelry Both gold and silver are sold by weight with relatively little extra cost for workmanship so they represent good value Ancient Minoan patterns are common with necklaces bracelets and rings in matching sets You can also find precious and semi precious set stone items However you don t need a large budget to buy trinkets as there is a plethora of popular street jewelry for sale with leather semi precious stones and crystals Pottery and Ceramics It s not surprising given the importance of ceramics and pottery throughout Crete s history that it is still a significant industry Pieces come as small as a ring holder or olive bowl to huge garden pieces that would have to be shipped back home Both unglazed and ceramic styles are available most notable of these is the bright blue glaze of Chani ceramics Traditional designs abound including marine themes Minoan designs and Classical Greek imagery Modern free form pieces can also be found particularly in Chani where there are galleries stocked by avant garde potters At Marger tes you can watch the potters at work and buy from their workshops Children s Crete A visit to Crete isn t all about museums

is adequately protected even when children are playing in the water Waterparks at Hers nissos and M lia will keep them busy and wet for hours A horse and carriage ride through the streets of Chani is a great treat and gives young children a good vantage point They can even sit next to the driver At Greek evenings hotels usually allow kids to get up on the dance floor and try the steps themselves Trips along the coast in colorful ca ques offer the chance to enjoy a cooling breeze and an alternative view of the island Castles such as Koules in Ir klion and Frangok stello allow imaginations to
