 New York Manners David I quite agree that filmmakers are enthusiastic about the considerable freedom given them by digital production But then you write Most filmmakers don t care if digital projection looks better than celluloid they d be thrilled if it looked as good And I wonder I think most filmmakers do care about the picture quality of their films as evidenced by the fact that those who broke through with video like Rodriguez turned to real film the moment they had the money And besides sod the filmmakers I care While I am perfectly able to enjoy films shot on video such as Blair Witch El Mariachi or American Movie I also enjoy the voluptuous pleasures of great celluloid cinematography in a film like Fargo or The Double Life of Veronique You write of Magnolia At a screening the other day I had the pleasure of listening to Joel Siegel make fun of the movie behind me and John Simon in a separate conversation make fun of the movie in front of me That clinches it it s one of the year s best movies It s also on my best movie list No 2 I also heard there was a lot of derision at the Boston screening If you can keep your head when all about you etc That s one difference between New York screenings and Chicago screenings In Chicago unless a movie is really bad and everyone senses that everyone else thinks so the critics do the director the courtesy of not distracting from his work by vocalizing their own opinions I have been to a lot of New York screenings over the years and have been surprised a at how some critics feel the right to laugh scornfully or even talk back to the screen and b how so many of them loudly share their opinions of a film as soon as it s over In Chicago we have a rule that we do not talk about films with each other after the screening I have zero need to know what my colleagues think and they have the same interest in my opinion As for Magnolia it is so exciting to see a director and yes you are right actors swinging for the fences not holding back not playing it cool going for it What a movie I agree too about Chlo Sevigny s work in Boys Don t Cry She provides our entrance into the story and her reactions to Brandon let us know who Brandon is and how he she is perceived It is a superb performance I fully expect that many critics snorted and hooted all the way through Titus too but Harry J Lennix was superb in the film s key role as the villain Aaron And Anthony Hopkins was splendid too in a role that provides the definition of thankless In a season when directors have been breaking free of timid generic expectations why not an audacious film of Shakespeare s least accomplished and most wretchedly excessive tragedy Roger
