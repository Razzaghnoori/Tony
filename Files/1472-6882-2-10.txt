 Background Fetal alcohol syndrome FAS children do not display the normal hemispheric dominance patterns observed in non FAS children 1 Dominance has been disrupted or is in some cases completely absent depending on the amount of tissue loss in the corpus callosum Morphological abnormalities one of which is corpus callosum hypoplasia has been observed in children with FAS 2 Archibald et al 3 using structural magnetic imaging sMRI also noted that there were corpus callosum abnormalities in children who had experienced prenatal exposure to ethanol In a magnetic resonance imaging MRI study of adult FAS males callosal morphological data when compared with landmark data differed significantly from that of control males 4 Agenesis of the corpus callosum occurs as a consequence of early embryonic insult The exact time of the insult usually determines the extent of commissural agenesis Jeeves et al 5 reported a timetable in which if the insult occurs before the tenth embryonic week in humans all forebrain commissures will be absent Miller 6 observed that in utero exposure to ethanol EtOH disrupted the distribution of callosal projection neurons in the rat somatosensory cortex The complete absence of a corpus callosum in rats exposed in utero to EtOH has been documented by several studies 7 8 9 Because in utero exposure to EtOH affects both corpus callosum development and laterality researchers have turned to the rat model to assess the impact of EtOH on both measures In Zimmerberg et al 10 rats prenatally exposed to a 35 ethanol derived calories EDC liquid diet did not display a preferred side for the 2 hole nose poke apparatus unlike rats whose mothers were maintained on a chow or liquid diet Later Zimmerberg et al 1 assessed laterality using a left right lever choice on a continuous reinforcement schedule Again the rats exposed in utero to EtOH displayed less side preference than the chow fed and liquid diet pairfed rats When London 11 tested paw preference in rats he found that rats exposed to ethanol during gestation were more likely than control rats to preferentially use the left paw In 1989 Zimmerberg et al 12 tested preferred tail direction in neonates exposed in utero to EtOH When compared to the 0 EDC group and the chow group a left preferred tail direction was exhibited by rats from the 35 EDC group Thus it appears that in utero exposure to ethanol at least in rats results in a disruption of laterality patterns We have investigated the potential fetoprotective capacity of silymarin SY against the toxic effects of in utero exposure to ethanol Silymarin has long been noted for its hepatoprotective properties 13 The mechanisms through which SY is thought to manifest its therapeutic effects include the following 1 enhanced protein synthesis 14 2 scavenging free radicals 15 3 prevention of glutathione GSH depletion 16 and 4 preservation of cell membrane integrity 17 The theories formulated to explain the physiological events that culminate in fetal alcohol syndrome include decreased antioxidant levels decreased protein synthesis increased free radical activity and disrupted membrane function The observation that the protective effects of SY and the causal factors in FAS overlap led us to investigate the possibility that SY might have application as a fetoprotectant compound In a series of studies conducted in our lab we have demonstrated that the coadministration of SY with ethanol prevents ethanol induced decreases in neonate mortality rate decreases in pup birth weight and increases in liver and brain gamma glutamyl transpeptidase GGTP activity 18 19 SY also prevented the deficits in spatial memory and social memory observed in rats exposed in utero to EtOH 20 21 Given that SY has been successful in ameliorating some of the negative consequences of in utero exposure to EtOH in the rat model we examined the possibility that SY might prevent EtOH induced callosal agenesis and the disruption of laterality as measured by paw preference Methods Subjects Subjects were 50 female Fisher 344 rats weighing 235 245 g The females were housed with male rats until pregnancy was confirmed by vaginal smear Once pregnancy was confirmed the rats were placed in standard plastic laboratory maternal tubs and assigned to one of five gestational treatment groups Ten pregnant females were assigned to each treatment group Group 1 consisted of pregnant females that received the liquid diet regimen Bioserve Frenchtown NJ containing an isocaloric amount of dextrin maltose that matched the caloric amount in the EtOH diet Group 2 rats were provided with the liquid diet to which a 400 mg kg dose of silymarin SY was added The SY provided by Inverni della Beffa Milano Italy contained 29 8 silybin complexed with phosphatidylcholine The dose administered to the rats was based on the percent active ingredient in the compound and was derived from data acquired in our previous studies 18 19 Group 3 rats received the liquid diet which contained both the SY and 35 ethanol derived calories 6 7 EtOH solution In previous studies we established blood alcohol concentrations BACs for all experimental groups and ascertained that SY does not have any appreciable affect on BAC 21 The rats in Group 4 were maintained on the 35 EDC liquid diet and Group 5 rats were provided with unlimited access to Purina lab chow The amount of liquid diet provided to the rats in Groups 1 2 and 3 was determined by the amount of liquid diet consumed the preceding day by the rats in Group 4 The liquid diet treatments were discontinued five days before the dams gave birth at which time they were provided access to Purina lab chow When the EtOH administration is continued until birth pup survival rats are extremely low Once pups reached age 18 21 days they were weaned and placed in individual standard laboratory cages On the day of weaning we randomly selected one female pup from each litter and as subjects in the laterality testing procedure We used females in an effort to remedy the paucity of FAS related data collected on female rodents A total of 10 female rat pups were selected from each of the five original treatment groups Apparatus and procedures Testing apparatus for laterality All testing sessions took place in a reaching apparatus The apparatus was made up of three contiguous plastic cubicles each of which measured 24 13 cm 7 62 cm 16 41 cm The adjoining walls of the cubicle were 6 35 mm thick and were painted white so that rats in adjacent cubicles could not see each other An 11 mm tube was installed in the face of each cubicle All test sessions were videotaped Laterality testing procedure The rats began laterality testing at age 12 weeks They were food deprived for 14 21 hr prior to the testing sessions and each rat participated in three testing sessions They were placed three at a time into the reaching apparatus one in each cubicle Rats remained in the reaching apparatus until they had either reached 50 times for food Fruit Loops or one hour had passed A single Fruit Loop was placed in the reaching tube for each trial A successful reach was defined as the rat obtaining the piece of Fruit Loop Each time the Fruit Loop was retrieved another piece was immediately placed into the tube Upon completion of a testing session rats were taken out of the reaching apparatus and placed back into their cage Perfusion After all of the rats had completed the reaching protocol they were anesthetized and intracardially injected first with Ringers solution and then with a fixing solution After sacrifice the brains were removed preserved in formalin and stored in a refrigerator for later corpus callosum extraction Corpus callosum extraction Because hemisphere weights were also dependent variables a cut was made through the longitudinal fissure that separated the two hemispheres which then exposed the two halves of the corpus callosum The hemispheres were weighed separately prior to corpus callosum extraction Using a surgical knife the corpus callosum was outlined and lifted away from the rest of the brain The two halves of the corpus callosum were weighed separately on an analytical balance The total length of the corpus callosum was measured before and after extraction The genu body and splenium were identified to confirm complete development of the corpus callosum Statistics The criterion for assessing individual laterality was generated from binomial z scores To identify a group of rats as demonstrating paw preference 7 of 10 rats had to be observed reaching in the same direction Three raters who were unaware of treatment groupings observed and counted the reaches The Statistical Package for Social Sciences SPSS Reliability Analysis was used for inter rater reliability A priori contrasts were conducted to determine if differences existed between groups on all dependent measures laterality corpus callosum development and weight splenium development total brain weight and pup weight gain Results Pup weights were recorded at birth and again when the rats were weaned An ANOVA and subsequent post hoc Tukey comparisons revealed that there were no significant birth weight differences for any experimental group as compared with the LD group although the overall ANOVA was significant F 4 45 4 98 p 05 However when the wean weights were analyzed the ANOVA results were significant F 4 45 6 77 p 01 and the posthoc tests specified that the EtOH group M 43 12 g differed significantly from the LD group M 50 08 g t 45 4 476 p 001 This indicates that the EtOH pups gained comparatively less weight during the period between postnatal day PND 1 and PND 20 which is when the pups were weaned A percent weight gain was calculated for each group see Table 1 Eta square was calculated and indicated that 61 of the variance in pup weight gain values was attributable to the treatment received during gestation Total brain weight and corpus callosum weight were determined for each of the pups and a total weight to corpus callosum ratio calculated see Table 2 Eta square was again calculated for the variance in corpus callosum weight resulting in 56 of the variance attributable to the treatment condition After perfusion the brains were visually inspected to determine whether or not the splenium was fully developed Of the 50 rats tested 8 did not have a fully developed splenium All 8 rats were from the EtOH group see Table 3 A priori contrasts were conducted to assess group differences All of the group comparisons were made with the Liquid Diet LD group Significant differences are reported in Tables 1 2 3 Discussion EtOH had an adverse impact on birth weight as indicated in Table 1 Further the in utero exposure to EtOH also prevented normal weight gain during the 20 day suckling period SY given in combination with EtOH appeared to prevent the EtOH associated low birth weight and attenuated weight gain Although the birth weight of the SY only pups was normal weight gain during the suckling period was significantly less than that of the LD group Weight gain for the SY pups however was still more than that observed for the EtOH pups In a previous study 20 SY pup weight gain did not differ significantly from weight gained by LD pups Brain weights did not differ significantly although the lowest weights were observed in the EtOH Corpus callosum CC weights did vary significantly for which the EtOH pups had the lowest weights Inexplicably the Chow pup callosal data weight data did not differ from that of the EtOH pups However when the ratio of brain weight to CC weight was calculated there were no significant group differences The EtOH group brain to CC weight ratio indicated that the CC weight as compared to total brain weight was the lowest observed among all of the treatment groups This lower CC weight might be associated with the unusual left paw preference displayed by the EtOH pups As an indication of EtOH and SY fetal effects the CC weight measure does not seem to provide much relevant information whereas the measure of splenium development clearly indicates EtOH induced disruption The in utero effect of EtOH on splenium development has also been observed in humans with FAS Sowell et al 22 using MRI analytic methods determined that EtOH related callosal area reductions were most severe in the splenium Consistent with the London 11 investigation the EtOH exposed rats displayed a left paw preference Further evidence of laterality disruption was manifested by incomplete splenium development in 8 of the 10 EtOH exposed rats The paw preference scores in the LD and Chow groups indicated an even distribution between left and right paw preference An unexpected finding was that of the strong right paw preference displayed by the rats from the SY and SY EtOH groups Given the 50 50 left right paw preference of the Chow and LD groups the expected outcome of SY influence would be the preservation of the 50 50 ratio The SY paw preference results are however consistent with a very recent study by Pence 23 Male and female rats were tested for paw preference using a food reaching task There was no significant sex difference He did observe that 70 2 of the rats were right pawed 19 3 were left pawed and 11 9 were ambidextrous Our observations can be summarized as follows 1 Fisher 344 rats when not subject to any form of prenatal insult and subsequently raised with adequate nutrition and housing do not as a group display any particular paw preference 2 Rats when exposed in utero to EtOH experience tissue loss in the splenium and as a group display a left paw preference 3 Rats that have been exposed in utero to EtOH co administered with SY have a fully intact corpus callosum yet display a right paw preference Why SY would have any impact on laterality that is distinct from EtOH exposure is puzzling There is a possible explanation in light of the gender specific differences observed in callosal size 24 coupled with the fact that prenatal exposure to EtOH causes feminization of male rats and defeminization of female rats 12 25 26 There is a hormonal influence on the developing commissural pathway that could be disrupted by a number of EtOH induced aberrations in hormone activity such as the diminished perinatal surge of testosterone observed in EtOH exposed male fetal rats 27 The EtOH induced attenuation of the testosterone surge eliminated the normal sex difference in rat callosal size In a previous study we observed that the coadministration of SY with EtOH to pregnant dams prevented the EtOH induced deficits in social recognition observed in the EtOH exposed offspring 20 Social memory in rats is a sexually dimorphic behavior that requires adequate levels of perinatal and neonatal androgen activity In utero exposure to EtOH reduces testosterone levels as well as maternal levels of estrogen consequently there is a reduction in P450 aromatase activity 28 29 This then results in a reduction in estrogen and estrogen receptor activation Estrogen receptor activity is necessary for the expression of androgen driven behavior in rodents 30 27 In addition to behavior estrogen also affects neurogenesis synaptogenesis and synaptic modifications 31 Our subjects were the female offspring of the various treatment groups As previously confirmed 32 the rat s corpus callosum CC is a sexually dimorphic structure with the larger CC observed in male rats Fitch and colleagues 32 also determined that the feminization reduction in size as compared to the CC of male rats of the female CC only occurs if the ovaries are intact and the CC is exposed to estrogen Recently Bimonte et al 33 established that neonatal exposure to estrogen is essential to feminine specific brain organization to the extent that the brain can respond appropriately to the organizing effects of subsequent estrogen exposure Experimental rats were administered an estrogen receptor blocker and later at postnatal day 70 these rats responded to estrogen administration with an increase in CC size an effect opposite of what would be expected Dehmlow et al 17 have established that silymarin can compete with estradiol at estradiol receptor binding sites 17 Therefore it is possible that the ameliorative effects of SY observed in the present study can be attributed to estrogen receptor activation at developmentally appropriate times Conclusions Because callosal development was complete in rats exposed to the co administration of SY with EtOH it appears that SY conferred some ameliorative effects upon the corpus callosum developmental process Without the SY EtOH exposed pups clearly displayed EtOH induced disruption to normal callosal development Even though the mechanism for the protective action of SY is not clearly understood our consistent findings of fetoprotectivity in the presence of in utero EtOH exposure merit further
