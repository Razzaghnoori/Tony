 Bust That Bank Take A Stand produced by Trippi McMahon and Squier for the Credit Union Campaign for Consumer Choice Increasingly political consultants are moving from pushing candidates to pushing issues a change that is unlikely to meet with universal approbation Take A Stand is the creation of political consultant Steve McMahon on behalf of credit unions At issue is legislation that would undermine the unions federally endorsed guaranteed protected competitive advantage over conventional banks The spot uses a tactic common among candidates who don t want to take the in your face negative route Its strategy is comparative Affirmation moves seamlessly into attack the positive sets up the negative The message is explicit from the get go Big banks are bad banks the high cost alternative you don t need to settle for The option already availed of by 70 million Americans just like you is the credit union The initial visuals are fuzzy and sweet and ring newish variations on familiar themes of family and friends companionship and security Though the family gathered around the table in this Ozzie and Harriet update is stolidly suburban it comprises Asians though the spot proffers a squishily trite bedtime story shot it does so with an explicit nod to the minority family an implicit nod to the minority parent With their low rate loans credit unions let the American family bite off their bit of the dream be it new wheels new digs or a college degree The spot serves up a sanitized sitcom version of the grand melting pot the images of diversity are carefully calibrated almost disingenuously casual We ve seen the Asian family clustered around cake and we ve seen the black mother reading to her child We also get the picnicking towheads the strolling seniors the black graduate Now the nub the entirely credible complaint that big banks levy higher ATM fees Focus groups have identified this as a pet consumer peeve and Take A Stand urges viewers to do just that The visual limns an urban skyline superimposing a sinister message Now the big banks want to take away your right to join a credit union over an unsourced headline Tell banks to back off Chyron and narrative alike tap the eons old morally loaded distinction between concrete jungle home to the malefactors of great wealth as Theodore Roosevelt dubbed monster corporations and Walden wood or its 90s version the manicured burbs And you re given an 800 number which is left on screen through the succeeding scenes The sponsors of the spot really want you to make that call after which you ll be patched through to the office of your senator or representative your name added to a petition and so on After all there are several issue advocacy techniques designed to show members of Congress your grassroots support The end is even sweeter and pairs clasped hands the grown up hand and the kiddie hand the black hand and the white hand and so on So what if the narrative is a tad cluttered by all the calls to action It s to Steve McMahon s credit that Take A Stand s populism is entirely palatable The proof of its success however may well lie in the length of that petition Robert Shrum
