 Sense and Inessentiality Dear Dad That was a lovely letter A long time ago you talked to me about British obituaries and since then when I ve had time I ve tried to read the obituary page of the Daily Telegraph After getting your message I went back to it on the Web and saw again what you mean about the differences from American obits Here s something from last Friday from a short notice written by the poet P J Kavanagh about his late brother in law Lord Milford He could not help having a creative laugh unfeigned joyous it made you feel much funnier than you thought you were which is among the kindest of social gifts I can t imagine an American newspaper printing an obituary with a sentence like this which might certainly help get readers through a cold day There s a certain delight in the inessential things in life which is one of the most pleasant things about British and also Irish culture I suppose it s one reason why poetry remains so much more of a vital force in Britain and Ireland than in America for what is poetry if not inessential Tony Blair of course doesn t seem to have much time for the inessential His Britain has to be dynamic forward thrusting fully charged In this he resembles no one so much as Margaret Thatcher whose attitude toward the inessential was one of brusque snarling contempt Speaking as an American this trend in British politics is something I deplore and my opinion has only been strengthened by reading British authors like John Mortimer of Rumpole of the Bailey fame and magazines like the Spectator which have made a fetish out of the British attitude toward inessential things Long live fox hunting the House of Lords High Table and High Church and High Tea Horse Guards and public schools and the royal family But as a historian I can t resist remarking that the cultivation of the inessential is a trademark of aristocratic societies aristocrats deliberately spend their time on trifles to show that they can and others can t and that as charming as it appears to outsiders most native members of the society are unlikely to be so well disposed since the burden of the aristocracy falls on their shoulders And having seen one of the famous public schools at rather too close quarters back when I was 14 during your sabbatical year in London I think that if I were British I d be more likely to approach those charming and inessential aspects of British society with a box of explosives than with the Spectator s pious reverence and on the Speccie in particular you ll remember Ian Buruma s devastating account of the place in his book Anglomania But back to the news The most amusing thing I saw in the paper yesterday was that a man legally named DotComGuy formerly Mitch Maddox is going to move into an empty house carrying only a credit card on January 1 and not leave again for the entire year relying exclusively on the Internet for furniture food services and entertainment His Web site claims that he will spend the year living inside the Internet as if this were some great foray into new and unexplored regions of cyberspace Talk about being behind the curve I think the real challenge for a currently employed middle class professional today would be to spend a year living entirely outside the Internet no e mail no eToys or E Trade or Amazon no MP3s or game demos no online banking or selection of benefits through the company intranet not to mention of course no Slate I don t think I d survive for more than a few days which is why your daughter in law alas once referred to herself as a wwww for world wide web widow You may have a different opinion not being anywhere near as much a regular user of the Web as I am But then again here you are in Slate the public intellectual as content provider for Microsoft
