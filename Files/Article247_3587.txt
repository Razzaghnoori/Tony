 What Is Money Laundering Federal investigators suspect that Russian mobsters may have used the Bank of New York to launder as much as 10 billion over the last two years What exactly is money laundering and how does it work In short money laundering is the conversion of illegally obtained profits into funds that appear legitimate that is making dirty money clean It is used by drugs traffickers arms smugglers and anyone else who needs to spend ill gotten gains without arousing suspicion White collar criminals and corrupt political leaders also frequently launder funds to avoid taxes or conceal embezzlement The simplest form of money laundering is combining criminal profits with earnings from a legitimate cash intensive business For example say a drug dealer wants to disguise 10 000 in monthly profits from cocaine sales So he buys a bar that takes in 50 000 a month mostly in cash At the end of each month he slips an extra 10 000 into his till and reports 60 000 in bar revenue Although his drug income is now taxable it is worth that price to make the profits appear legal Larger amounts like 10 billion can t just be slipped into the till Laundering big sums generally involves three steps Placement The cash proceeds often thousands of small denomination bills enter the legitimate banking system Many countries require that large cash transactions in the United States anything above 10 000 be reported to authorities So launderers often deposit proceeds piece by piece or export the money to countries with relaxed banking regulations Layering The money is separated from its criminal origins through complex financial transactions Often funds will be transferred dozens of times through multiple accounts companies and countries making the paper trail virtually impossible to follow Integration The money returns to its original source apparently as legitimate income There are countless variations on this pattern One of the most common is the loan back scheme in which the launderer essentially borrows money from himself First he sets up a lending company in a country with few financial regulations Then he fills its coffers with illegal profits layered through multiple accounts When the launderer wants to make a purchase in his home country he simply borrows the money from the overseas lender This money once illegal now appears to be a legitimate loan Next question
