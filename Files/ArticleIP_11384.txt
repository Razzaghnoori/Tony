 Wag the Doubt Did President Clinton wag the dog by bombing Iraq on the eve of the House impeachment debate Politicians and pundits launched the rhetorical war over that question even before the first missiles fell in Baghdad While the damage mounts in Iraq the debate at home is dragging politics to new depths Here s a glossary of the debaters latest tactics in morally descending order 1 Overt Cynicism The politician accuses Clinton of wagging the dog Example It is obvious that he is doing this for political reasons Rep Gerald Solomon R N Y 2 Cynicism by innuendo The accuser phrases the dog wagging charge obliquely so that he can deny having made it Example We have had either hostilities or threatened hostilities at interesting times throughout the last year incoming House Speaker Bob Livingston 3 Backhanded cynicism The accuser implies dog wagging by saying either a he can t bring himself to believe Clinton would wag the dog or b the White House has assured him it s not so Example While I have been assured by administration officials that there is no connection with the impeachment process b oth the timing and the policy are subject to question Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott 4 Cynicism about principle The accuser argues that because Clinton is inherently unprincipled any seemingly principled behavior on his part is fishy Example Clinton must have bombed Iraq to avoid impeachment because how else to explain the sudden appearance of a backbone that has been invisible up to now Solomon 5 Cynicism by association The accuser doesn t allege a causal relationship between the impeachment process and the bombing but he blames Clinton for the correlation anyway Example President Clinton has indelibly associated a justified military response with his own wrongdoing Clinton has now injected the impeachment process against him into foreign policy and vice versa Jim Hoagland Washington Post 6 Vicarious cynicism Rather than stand behind his cynicism the accuser attributes it to others Example It is dangerous for an American president to launch a military strike however justified at a time when many will conclude he acted only out of narrow self interest to forestall or postpone his own impeachment Wall Street Journal editorial 7 Fake idealism about cynicism The accuser says other people s cynicism makes it impossible for Clinton to govern well Example The point is not whether this president would wag the dog b ut for some significant portion of the population there must be that doubt And that doubt is the crucial nexus A president must have credibility when he makes decisions about peace or war former Reagan lawyer Peter Wallison New York Times op ed 8 Fake patriotism about cynicism Democrats say Republicans who accuse Clinton of wagging the dog are inadvertently aiding and comforting the enemy Example Shame on you Republicans for playing into the hands of Saddam Rep Martin Meehan D Mass 9 McCarthyism about cynicism Democrats say Republicans who accuse Clinton of wagging the dog are deliberately aiding and comforting the enemy Example The GOP s remarks were as close to a betrayal of the interests of the United States as I ve ever witnessed in the United States Congress Sen Robert Torricelli D N J 10 Recidivist cynicism Having accused Republicans of cynicism for suggesting that Clinton cynically used the Iraq conflict to delay the impeachment vote Democrats use the conflict to delay the vote Example The House should not take up impeachment until the hostilities have ended It shouldn t come up as long as our troops are in harm s way House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt 1 1 Cynicism about cynicism While publicly accusing Republicans of tactics aimed at gaining political advantage Democrats privately gloat that the tactics will give Democrats a political advantage Example The rules we ve always had is that politics stop at the shore one senior White House official said speaking on the condition of anonymity Somebody changed the rules and it wasn t us But Clinton advisers said that they expected Mr Lott s comments to backfire New York Times 12 Reverse cynicism While accusing Clinton of invoking the Iraq conflict to delay the impeachment vote Republicans invoke the Iraq conflict to expedite the impeachment vote Example I don t see any reason to postpone the vote That plays right into Saddam Hussein s hands That s what terrorists want disruption Rep Bill McCollum R Fla 1 3 Cynical anti cynicism While accusing Democrats of cynicism for suggesting that impeachment would undermine the war effort Republicans argue that impeachment is the best way to honor the war effort Example As those troops are engaged now even now defending the Constitution of this nation they have a right to know that the work of the nation goes forward And in consideration of this it is our intention Mr Speaker to begin consideration of impeachment House Majority Leader Dick Armey 14 Circular vicarious cynicism Unable to prove that Clinton wagged the dog Republicans argue that the mere suspicion of dog wagging is grounds for impeachment Examples The suspicion some people have about the president s motives in this attack is itself a powerful argument for impeachment Armey Perceptions that the American president is less interested in the global consequences than in taking any action that will enable him to hold onto power are a further demonstration that he has dangerously compromised himself in conducting the nation s affairs and should be impeached Wall Street Journal editorial Recent Frame Games William
