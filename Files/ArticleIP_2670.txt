 Cold Comfort Zinc has become the hot new therapy for the common cold Once just a weak selling natural cold remedy touted in health food stores it now sells to millions at pharmacies and grocery stores Does it work Probably not Does it sell Ask the big pharmaceutical companies whose immense resources are nurturing the all too credulous market for unproven alternative medicines Zinc a nutrient found in red meat is known to be essential to growth and immune system function It was not plugged as a cold remedy however until 1979 when a Texas city planner George Eby became convinced that megadoses of zinc improved his 3 year old leukemic daughter s response to chemotherapy and protected her from colds during treatment While such anecdotes commonly spur alternative medicine fads Eby took the admirable step of instigating a 1984 clinical trial of zinc lozenges that found the treatment cut the duration of colds in half Zinc did not really sell however until the summer of 1996 when the Annals of Internal Medicine published a Cleveland Clinic study with similar results Patients showing cold symptoms for 24 hours or less were given either zinc or placebo lozenges They were instructed to dissolve one lozenge in their mouths every two hours while awake until the symptoms were gone Symptoms in zinc takers disappeared after 4 4 days compared with 7 6 days for those in the placebo group The only problem was zinc s bitter taste Eighty percent of patients who got zinc complained of a bad aftertaste and 20 percent felt nauseated Still the evidence for zinc is equivocal Eby s initial trial stimulated seven other studies and while three found zinc worked four found it did not Army researchers in Tacoma Wash recently pooled the zinc data for a comprehensive meta analysis published last month in the Archives of Internal Medicine They found no benefit concluding The evidence for effectiveness of zinc salts lozenges in reducing the duration of common colds is still lacking It is also unknown whether large doses of zinc have toxic effects in the long run Some scientists question whether it is even biologically plausible that zinc could cure colds Zinc backers propose that the element s positive charge could a bind it to viruses blocking their entry into the cells along your nasal tract or b allow it to clamp nerves that stimulate congestion However University of Virginia researcher Jack Gwaltney pointed out that zinc in the saliva does not reach the nasal tract and therefore cannot exert any of these effects Furthermore the zinc levels needed to kill cold viruses in the test tube are far higher than anything the lozenges achieve Gwaltney and others believe a placebo effect may account for the sporadic positive results from zinc It is known that inert substances can alleviate symptoms in colds asthma sciatica and even congestive heart failure through the power of suggestion alone This is not to say the symptoms are just in the mind but rather that the mind can generate beneficial biological effects You might think that the fact that zinc beat the placebo in the Cleveland Clinic trial would rule out a placebo effect But a dummy pill only works as much as you believe in it Belief can be affected by many factors including the drug s appearance certain pill colors are more effective than others form injections often have a greater effect than pills or taste bitter may seem like better The zinc trials did not for example mask zinc s bitter medicine like flavor Zinc may work primarily because its distinctive taste helps convince you that it will This phenomenon has long confounded research on vitamin C which after almost two dozen studies has not been demonstrated to provide benefit in colds beyond its placebo effect Nonetheless publicity from the Cleveland Clinic trial made the Quigley Corp s Cold Eeze zinc gluconate lozenges a runaway success Quigley was a struggling dietary supplement company prior to the study It s stock sold for less than a dollar a share and revenues for the first half of 1996 were just under 175 000 The study s release boosted the stock to 37 a share overnight and has generated 41 million in revenues in the year since Subsequent revelations that the trial s lead researcher owned stock in Quigley raised questions of biased results On the day that his article was published Dr Michael Macknin sold 9 000 Quigley shares for 145 000 in profit During the course of the study Quigley gave Macknin options for an additional 10 000 shares According to the Cleveland Plain Dealer however Macknin denied that this was a payment and said he received the options after his results had already been compiled Others soon joined the zinc rush Nu Wave Health Product introduced Cold Rid sugar free zinc lozenges Weider Nutrition International offers Cold Free zinc acetate lozenges which it claims have higher zinc concentrations There is zinc gum zinc spray even zinc lollipops And now pharmaceutical giant Warner Lambert has jumped in with Hall s Zinc Defense a lozenge backed by a national TV ad campaign If the zinc story were an isolated anecdote it would be merely amusing Thanks to misinformation unrivaled since the pre FDA patent medicine era however alternative therapies have become a 14 billion market which is growing by as much as 30 percent annually And now the big boys want to cash in In addition to its zinc pill this fall Warner Lambert introduced Celestial Seasonings lozenges with echinacea a purple flower that herbalists promote without clinical evidence as a cold remedy and immune system enhancer American Home Products plans to market ginkgo saw palmetto and other herbal products under its Centrum label SmithKline recently announced plans for a herbal line that includes ginkgo saw palmetto ginseng and St Johnswort As with zinc many of these remedies become popular solely on the basis of anecdotes testimonials and equivocal studies Health food promoters often cite traditional use by Native Americans or Chinese herbalists as evidence These are terrific grounds for deciding to further test substances culled from nature some of which will surely prove valuable But they are not good reasons to tout them as cures or even as safe What s most worrisome about the entry of the big pharmaceutical firms is that their large marketing budgets will expand the respectability of these kinds of low standard claims Sure the big companies are more coy in their pitches the Hall s Zinc Defense box says zinc may relieve cold symptoms and in small print denies making any claim to treating a health condition but that only makes the sham more effective So what does work for colds Drinking plenty of liquids keeps mucus flowing out of the body and carrying viruses with it Trials show that over the counter combination decongestant antihistamines do help relieve nasal congestion and post nasal drip And when suffering from a bout of miracle cure claims try a healthy dose of skepticism
