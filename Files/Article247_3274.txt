 You Can Lead a Kid to Bacon Dear Steve You re right we began somber and became silly which is a fair representation of my breakfast table I m thinking of the morning trajectory from stumbling glumly downstairs to fighting over the comics except that around my table the only audible dialogue is generally You done with those yet punctuated by the clank of spoon against cereal bowl There was a phase a while back when I filled with resolve for reasons then unclear to myself but transparent to any female who has ever cracked the pages of a McCall s or Family Circle to cook hot meals at breakfast I had in mind the sort that appeared in magazines with the little wisps of steam visible as the plates were lowered to the table I made muffins or scrambled eggs with green chiles and cheddar cheese or crepes rolled around blackberry jam or whole wheat pancakes with peanut butter chips I know this sort of fits into the category of manteca en su bolsillo but they re actually pretty good There was a lot of bacon too Something elemental about bacon the smell I think Also good sound effects My kids looked startled at first large plates of steaming food at 7 a m What is going on around here Is Mom OK Maybe better not ask Then there was a Mom s Cafe phase Oh look it s breakfast at the Mom s Cafe Then my daughter got up the nerve to say Um this is nice but you know I really like Crispix My son who had rattled both of his deeply secular parents a few years earlier by requesting a bar mitzvah for which to our astonishment he studied intently for two years delivering himself of a whomping cantor led performance and bar mitzvah speech in which he discussed in serious 13 year old voice his intense feeling about carrying on a tradition his father s family had let lapse told me kindly one day that he had stopped eating pork so maybe I could cut back on the bacon My husband in the interests of middle aged guy health dropped eggs and muffins from his diet So that was that for the wisps of steam at our breakfast table The Crispix came back in force in fact the last time I was at the supermarket the checker gazed at my overflowing cart and said Lot of cereal eaters in your house are there I do have one more somber thought though because I really am troubled about this even though I can see no way to let off even a tiny rant without personally contributing to the very problem of which I speak I do believe the press and in particular the broadcast press took leave of its collective senses last weekend when that little plane disappeared surely not the first time such a thing has happened but I am afraid that the net result following day after day of relentless nonstop overblown breathless self referential nearly entirely content free coverage has been the transformation of a single publicly shared tragedy into something venomous I think people are just furious at the coverage I think fury at the coverage has in some measure replaced what might have been a brief period of honorable modestly proportioned mourning for some famous people who died I think we ll be hearing about this for quite a while and that the demonstrably low public regard for reporters and commentators will dip still lower in the wake of this past week I know we do this all the time we did it when Diana died and we will surely do it again but it seems mysterious to me that in the first year post Monica when so many reporters looked back in embarrassment and agreed that events and group think had sucked us into dreadful vacuous coverage from which we felt unable to extricate ourselves the same blind terror of losing audience share could have overtaken assignment editors again So that is my closing rant I m afraid the only journal in our house that for interest factor can be rated anywhere near your Journal of Inconspicuous Consumption is our full color glossy monthly called Lowrider which was given to my son no not himself a lowrider his only available vehicle is the denuded Toyota van as a Christmas present last year I have actually become quite fascinated by this magazine and was going to dig out the latest issue to report on exactly which babes in bikini tops and pachuco pants were jutting their hips out beside which gleaming curvaceous cherried out 20 ton American car But it seems I was overcome by feminist bile one morning and tossed it Pity I bet Lowrider is a hit in Austin And is now the time to say I can hardly wait for your impending new novel about the Alamo It s been swell Steve but do something about that lard in your pocket OK Yr faithful correspondent CG
