 Rental rules scarce in rural Iowa By JASON CLAYWORTHRegister Staff Writer 05 14 2002 Thousands of Iowans who live in mobile homes face increasingly unsafe conditions because no laws exist to govern how landlords care for property outside city limits advocates say None of Iowa s 99 counties regulates upkeep on rental property in unincorporated areas according to county auditors That leaves rural renters in mobile home parks apartments and houses with few places to turn when they encounter problems said Robert Simmons of the Iowa Coalition for Housing and the Homeless Simmons said he fears a disaster because of bad wiring or other problems If it s not installed properly and if it s not maintained it could be life threatening he said Simmons works most directly with residents of the approximately 55 700 mobile homes in Iowa Most either rent the mobile homes or the lots where the homes are parked There s nobody telling that landlord to fix the property Simmons said More and more we are seeing this as a problem State law mandates that cities of more than 15 000 residents regulate rental units But zoning ordinances have pushed many mobile home parks out of city limits where regulations are lacking It s pretty amazing how many elected officials aren t even aware of this issue said Terry Nelson vice president of the Manufactured Home Owners Association of America A lot of people rely on their local government for protection Karen Fraise president of the tenant association at Westside Trailer Park for Mobile Homes near Fort Madison said the lack of oversight has caused problems for more than 80 families there Just because we live in a trailer doesn t mean we re trailer trash Fraise said We re human beings Residents complain that the smell of a nearby septic lagoon makes them sick Deep holes in the road and balky water pressure have gone unresolved for several years she said Mark Anderson an owner of the park said Fraise exaggerates the problems some of which he added have not been brought to his attention Lee County has sewage disposal health rules which he has not violated he said Anderson said he complains that some tenants don t take care of the property even after repairs are made When you have rental properties how the tenants take care of the place is what it looks like Anderson said Some counties rely on their health departments to solve rural renter complaints about sewage roads and vacant vermin infested homes said William Peterson of the Iowa Association of Counties Many types of problems such as broken doors or weak water pressure aren t considered health issues he said I don t know what people do if they feel they are being unfairly treated he said I don t know where they would go to file a complaint John Bohlen a resident of the Oakwood Heights Mobile Home Community near Ankeny said not having somewhere to turn when there are problems leaves many mobile home dwellers feeling helpless For example Oakwood Heights does not have a storm shelter he said The tenants feel very frustrated said Bohlen 40 who owns his mobile home and pays 280 a month to rent the lot Judy Johnson an owner of Oakwood Heights said the park is well run If residents are unhappy they can put wheels on their homes and go someplace else she said There s no shelter and we re not going to build a shelter Johnson said We don t have to We re not breaking any rules Tenants of mobile home parks often feel forced to move when conditions become intolerable Iowa has landlord tenant laws but no state or county governing body regulates them said Robb Goedicke an attorney with Legal Aid Society of Polk County Tenants often must take their problems to court before landlords are forced to make changes he said The problem is the county doesn t have any enforcement agency Goedicke said Who does the tenant turn to
