 Background In the course of studies involving intravenous adenoviral gene transfer we observed a 10 fold difference in plasma levels of the encoded proteins between two of the rat strains employed the Wag Rij and the Brown Norway These differences were observed for several vector encoded proteins as soon as 2 days after gene delivery and were maintained for one month after which the levels declined slowly to background Other investigators described differences of the same order of magnitude between mouse strains in expression of transgenes encoding 1 antitrypsin 1 interleukin 12 2 and human endostatin 3 These differences in transgene expression between inbred species may have clinical implications as differences between inbred strains are considered to reflect differences between individuals of an outbred species Consequently the therapeutic efficiency of a transgene could drastically vary from one patient to another So far a satisfactory explanation for such strain differences has not been provided Most authors have attributed the difference of plasma levels of vector encoded protein to immune reactions against the protein or against the vector 4 5 However the kinetics of the vector encoded proteins in the plasma do not support regulation by an adaptive immune reaction as the strain difference is manifest as early as 2 days after administration of the vector Innate humoral immunity e g the presence of neutralising antibodies against the vector can also be excluded as the cause of the difference because such antibodies are not present in na ve rats An innate cellular immune reaction directed against the infected liver cells is also an unlikely explanation because plasma transaminase levels 6 a marker of hepatolysis though somewhat elevated are not different in the two strains The main organ infected by an adenovirus following iv injection is the liver 7 8 Others and we find that the liver is producing 95 99 of the vector encoded protein after intravenous delivery of recombinant adenoviral vectors The global process from liver cell infection to protein production is commonly described as adenoviral permissiveness of the liver In this study we investigated which one of these three processes transfection transcription translation is pivotal for the strain difference in transgene expression Secreted vector encoded proteins are not suitable to interpret the early manifestation of transgene expression as plasma levels are highly dependent on the pharmacokinetic properties of the encoded proteins Therefore we employed adenoviral encoded marker genes the intracellular Luciferase Luc and the nuclear Galactosidase LacZ The luciferase activity of the whole liver is a measure of vector encoded protein expression in that organ while the LacZ staining of hepatocytes provides information on the proportion of liver cells infected Furthermore we determined the amount of Ad5 DNA and of transgene mRNA in the liver as measures of the adenoviral infection of hepatic cells and of transgene transcription respectively Results Intravenous injection of Ad5 vectors in different rat strains results in different levels of early transgene expression Intravenous administration of a fixed dose of Ad5 vector either expressing the human endostatin gene or the gene for mhATF BPTI resulted in clear 10 fold difference in the plasma levels of both proteins between Brown Norway and Wag Rij rats Fig 1and 2 This difference was detected as soon as 3 days after the vector administration and persisted during the first 6 weeks subsequently the plasma levels of both proteins slowly decreased to undetectable levels in 2 to 3 months To investigate whether the livers of the 2 rat strains differ in their permissiveness for Ad5 or if this phenomenon could be explained by differences in the hepatocyte secretion capacity we administrated Ad5 vector carrying the gene for Luciferase Ad5 Adapt Luc a protein that is not secreted Measurements of Luciferase transgene activity in various organs following iv administration of the vector confirmed the observations from other research groups 7 8 that in rodents 95 99 of virus infection and subsequent transgene expression occurs in the liver Table 1 Next we determined luciferase activity in the liver of Brown Norway and Wag Rij rats 2 days after intravenous injection of 10 9iu 3 10 9iu or 10 10infectious units iu of Ad5 Adapt Luc The results depicted in the Fig 3seem to reflect those observed with ATF BPTI and endostatin naming a 10 fold difference between Wag Rij and Brown Norway rats These experiments with the non secreted luciferase vector encoded protein confirmed that the two rat strains have a very different liver response to the recombinant adenovirus Since the levels of mhATF BPTI and endostatin reached a plateau about 7 days after vector delivery both in the Brown Norway and in the Wag Rij rats we also determined the luciferase activity in the liver 7 days post intravenous administration of the Ad5 Adapt Luc As shown in figure 4 roughly the same values were obtained at the 2 time points which reflect the kinetics of the plasma concentrations of the secreted proteins ATF BPTI and endostatine Galactosidase expression in hepatocytes from Brown Norway and Wag Rij rats To explore whether differences in the number of transduced hepatocytes could account for the observed differences in transgene expression levels we injected different doses 10 9iu 3 10 9iu and 10 10iu of Ad5 Adapt LacZ into the tail vein of the rats Histological inspection of the stained sections allowed an estimation of the proportion of transduced liver cells Animals were sacrificed after 2 days liver sections were prepared and stained with X gal The liver sections revealed an inhomogeneous distribution of transduced cells In both rat strains hepatocytes were the sole cell type expressing the Galactosidase Both the number of stained cells and the staining intensity was highest near the interlobular portal vein and declined gradually towards the centro lobular area Fig 5 The percentage of blue nuclei was roughly proportional to the amount of infectious units administered and did not differ significantly between the two strains Table 2 However overall the intensity of the nuclear LacZ stain was 8 to 9 times higher in the Brown Norway than in Wag Rij liver sections as determined by computer assisted analysis of the histological section Fig 6 These findings suggest that although the protein production is significantly higher in the Brown Norway rats the number of infected cells is roughly similar for both rat strains Still the number of infectious particles per hepatocytes might be higher in the Brown Norway rats However the number of iu can never be 10 time higher because that would require at least 10 the number of hepatocytes 1 8 10 9 1 8 10 10 and the dose administered was 10 10iu The number of recombinant adenovirus copies in the liver Real time PCR was employed to quantify the copy number of the adenoviral genome in the hepatocytes of rats from the previously described experiments that received graded doses of Ad5 Adapt Luc or of Ad5 Adapt LacZ As listed in Table 3 the number of adenoviral copies per liver was similar in the Brown Norway and Wag Rij rats for both vectors Roughly there is a linear relation between the Ad5 DNA detected and the dose of adenoviral vector administered In the case of LacZ the deviation from the linearity is not statistically significant These results shows that recombinant Ad5 infect hepatocytes of both rat strains with similar efficiencies Thus the observed differences in levels of vector encoded protein must be due to differences in transcription CMV promoter activity RNA stability RNA translation or post translational processes Liver damage Considering that the local inflammation of the liver may significantly increase the synthesis of certain proteins it could be that the difference in transgene expression observed is a consequence of different inflammatory reactions in the two strains To eliminate the possibility that the difference found in the Brown Norway rats in encoded protein is due to a global increase in protein synthesis the total amount of liver protein was determined after different vector doses and time points It was found to be similar in both strains and not significantly elevated from the basal line Table 5 Adenovirus particles in apoptotic hepatocytes or phagocytosed by immune cells would not contribute to the luciferase production However to exclude that a massive hepatitis or a severe inflammatory infiltrate in the liver is causing the difference of luciferase expression the inflammatory infiltration and pathological changes were determined in the liver of the two rat strains Table 5 The damage scoring shows that there is no difference of toxicity or infiltration 2 days after vector delivery and that the difference in transgene expression persisted even when a low dose of adenovirus that caused hardly any inflammation was injected At 7 days after the injection the Brown Norway rats showed a significant higher liver damage and infiltration than the Wag Rij rats However this deviation of the toxicity between the two strains was not accompanied by an increase in the difference of transgene expression Seemingly the difference in transgene expression seen 2 days as well as 7 days after vector administration is due to processes that occur after the penetration of the virus into the cells Northern Blotting of the Luciferase transcript To investigate whether an intrinsic difference exists in transcription efficiency or in translation efficiency the amount of the luciferase mRNA present in the liver of rats was determined after administration of 10 10iu Ad5 Adapt Luc intravenously As depicted in Fig 7 the northern blot of the liver RNA shows about 10 times more luciferase mRNA in the liver of the Brown Norway rats than in the Wag Rij rats These findings leave open only two options to explain the difference in protein levels observed namely an intrinsic difference in transcription efficiency under the CMV promoter or a difference in RNA stability Discussion It has been suggested that after iv administration low dose intravenous adenoviral vectors are taken up by Kupffer cells and degraded quickly within a few hours 1 9 whereas higher doses saturate these cells and the surplus productively transduce hepatocytes Therefore we used doses 10 9iu 10 10iu that are in the linear part of the dose response curve and well above the threshold effect In both rat strains 2 days after intravenous delivery of the vector the Galactosidase was observed only in the hepatocytes Consequently it may be concluded that the bulk of the adenoviral genomes in the liver is localized in the hepatocytes After correction for the extraction efficiency of DNA an average of 2 6 10 9copies of vector genome were detected in the livers following administration of 10 10iu Ad5 Adapt LacZ At this dose 75 of the hepatocytes stained positive for Galactosidase It is estimated that the liver of a 350 g rat contains about 1 8 10 9hepatocytes 10 Thus the average number of infectious units per hepatocyte is about 1 5 It is assumed that the infection of hepatocytes by the adenoviruses is a random event following the Poisson distribution Then this event will occur at least one time in 75 of the cases when the expected number of occurrences is 1 5 As about 75 of the hepatocytes stained blue following injection of 10 10iu an hepatocyte will stain blue if it has incorporated one copy of the vector Poisson probability calculations show also that under these conditions the infection occurs twice in 40 and three times in 20 of the hepatocytes This variation in the number of adenoviral copies per cell can explain the variation of the staining intensity per cell within one liver from light to dark blue In each of the vectors used in this study the transgene was under the control of the CMV immediate early promoter It was determined by Norther Blots that the amount of transgenic mRNA was also different in both rat strains Thus the difference in vector encoded protein production found is due to difference in transgene transcription or difference in RNA stability As expected a difference in protein levels was observed following 3 different doses of the vector 10 9 3 10 9and 10 10iu However the lower the dose the smaller is the difference of protein expression between the two rat strains This might be explained by a saturation of the transgene expression machinery in the Wag Rij hepatocytes at the higher doses The different protein expression in Wag Rij and Brown Norway rats was observed with 4 different transgenes Luciferase Galactosidase endostatin and mhATF BPTI and at several different doses Our experiments localised the mechanism of this difference at the transcriptional level and disqualified the hypothesis based on immunological induced death of the infected cells Nevertheless the differences of transcription efficiency observed between the two rat strains might be due to different cytokine production following the adenoviral infection It was shown that the adenoviral infection of the liver activates the innate immunity with increase NK cells and cytokines production INF TNF IL 12 IL 6 11 12 13 14 Further differences of this activation between mouse strains were associated with variation in adenovirus transgene expression 11 13 However it was demonstrated that no activation of the innate immunity and that no difference of transgene expression could be observed before the seventh day after the adenoviral administration 13 Furthermore the decrease of transgene expression after activation of the innate immunity following i v administration of adenovirus was due to decrease of the number of infected cells and a corresponding diminution of the viral DNA in the liver 15 Our results do not show such results However in such perspective we measured the serum level of INF in both rat strains 2 days after the vector administration and no difference could be observed 60 14 pg ml in the Wag Rij rats versus 65 18 pg ml in the Brown Norway rats Nevertheless difference of intracellular cytokine response to the adenoviral infection might explain the difference in transcription efficiency In general differences between inbred strains are considered to reflect differences between individual members of outbred species If the variation observed in the rat strains described here would hold for individual humans the therapeutic efficiency of gene transfer could drastically vary from one patient to another after systemic administration of adenoviral vectors Methods Animals Pathogen free inbred male Wag Rij and Brown Norway rats weighing 300 to 350 gr were purchased from Harlan The Netherlands All animals were fed ad libitum with laboratory chow and water and were kept under standard laboratory conditions For assay of plasma transaminase ALT hEndostatin and mhATF BPTI rats were anaesthetised with isoflurane and bled by tail vein puncture and the blood was collected in EDTA tubes All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the official guidelines after obtaining permission of the animal welfare committee Measurements of ALT were performed according to standard clinical procedures Adenoviral vectors Recombinant adenovirus vectors were generated in PER C6 cells by homologous recombination between an adapter plasmid pAdapt and the E1 deleted Ad 5 DNA plasmid as described elsewhere 16 The expression cassette contains a CMV promoter and SV40 poly A signal As a result of the absence of sequence overlap between the Adapt plasmid and the Ad5 E1 sequences integrated into the genome of PER C6 the vector stocks used in this study did not contain replicative competent adenovirus RCA 17 The Ad5 Adapt mhAB encodes for a murinised form of the human ATF BPTI mhAB 18 In this construct the mhATF BPTI is preceded by the native secretion signal peptide of the human urokinase The human endostatin coding sequence InvivoGen CA USA was cloned in the Ad5 Adapt shuttle vector The encoded endostatin corresponds to the 183 residue of the human endostatin described by O Reilly et al 1997 with an intact N terminus HSHRDFQ preceded by the secretion signal peptide of the human IL 2 The Ad Adapt Luc and the Ad Adapt LacZ are recombinant adenoviral vectors in which the E3 region of Ad5 is retained and the gene of interest luciferase or LacZ replaces the E1 region The Ad5 Adapt empty is identical to Ad5 Adapt mhAB except that it does not encode any transgene All vectors were produced on PER C6 using standard procedures 17 Infectious units iu ml were determined by end point cytopathogenic effect CPE assay on 911 cells 19 Viral particles were determined by HPLC 20 The particle to infectious unit ratio was always lower than 10 A single batch per vector was used in all experiments Liver lysate and Luciferase activity assay Rats were sacrificed by an overdose of isoflurane and whole organs were dissected out frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 C Organs were homogenised in phosphate buffered saline pH 7 8 using a blender To lyse the cells DTT SIGMA The Netherlands 1 mM and Triton x 100 0 1 Merck The Netherlands were added After centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 10 min 20 l of the supernatant was added to 100 l of luciferase assay substrate Promega The Netherlands Relative light units RLU were determined for 30 s using a luminometer Lumat 951 Wallac Belgium The amount of protein in the extracts was determined using a commercial kit Bio Rad laboratories The Netherlands based on the Coomasie brilliant blue G250 binding assay developed by Bradford 21 The level of luciferase activity in the tissue homogenates was expressed in RLU mg protein The background level of this assay is 1000 RLU mg protein and was defined by measuring luciferase activity in organs of non treated rats LacZ expression assay Forty eight hours after Ad5 Adapt LacZ administration rats were sacrificed and organs were removed and cut in 2 mm sections Sections were fixed in 10 phosphate buffered formalin pH 7 0 for 60 min at room temperature and incubated overnight in 0 5 M sucrose The samples were subsequently frozen in liquid nitrogen Ten m thick frozen sections were prepared and stained with 5 bromo 4 chloro 3 indolyl galactopyranoside X gal solution Molecular Probes The Netherlands overnight at 37 C Finally sections were counterstained with Hematoxylin Phloxin Safran The number of blue nuclei in each section was determined on digitalised photographs of four 20 magnification fields with the interlobular vein in the centre designated portal area and of four fields centred on the central vein called centro lobular area These two areas were slightly overlapping The resolution of the photographs which were processed in Adobe Photoshop 5 0 was 600 dots per inch dpi Cells were considered positive when a blue staining was seen in the nucleus The total number of hepatocytes per field was determined by dividing the surface of the tissue section by the average surface of a hepatocyte The surface of the lumen of large vessels was subtracted from the total surface of the tissue section The average surface of the hepatocytes was determined by ten measurements of mononuclear hepatocytes per field The surface measurements were performed with the NIH Image 1 62 software It was shown in rats that binuclear hepatocytes have double the volume of mononuclear hepatocytes and that the extrahepatocytic space volume was 15 of the total liver volume 10 To compare Galactosidase expression levels in the livers of Wag Rij and Brown Norway rats frozen livers were cut into sections with a thickness of 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 and 50 m Whole sections were scanned at 600 dpi under TIFF format and analysed in Adobe Photoshop 6 0 We quantified the blue staining intensity by performing the histogram of the luminosity and of the four colours on the whole liver section Matching the histograms of a Brown Norway section to a Wag Rij section with different thickness determine the relative liver Galactosidase intensity of the two strains Elisa assays An mhATF BPTI enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assay ELISA was developed by Dr P Quax Toegepast Natuurwetenschappelijk Onderzoek institute using a monoclonal antibody specific for the ATF as the capture antibody and a polyclonal antibody directed against BPTI as the detector antibody 18 As a standard we used medium of Ad5 Adapt mhAB infected CHO cell culture in which the mhATF BPTI concentration was determined by an urokinase ELISA Secretion of human endostatin in plasma was routinely determined using a commercial ELISA kit InvivoGen CA USA according to the manufacturer procedure INF levels in rat sera were measured by an ELISA kit BioSource Netherlands B V The Netherlands Real Time PCR analysis The amount of adenoviral genomes per cell was determined by a multiplex real time polymerase chain reaction 22 Real time PCR is based on the 5 3 nuclease activity of AmpliTaq Gold polymerase which allows it to cleave fluorogenic probes resulting in fluorescence The amount of fluorescence obtained during the PCR reaction is representative to the amount of amplified DNA Total DNA of transduced rat organs was extracted by using a DNeasy Tissue Kit Qiagen The kit efficiency was verified by measuring the recovery of plasmid DNA mixed from a liver lysate We confirmed that 80 of the total DNA can be extracted from liver samples as described by the manufacturer To amplify the adenoviral DNA specific primers Ad5Clip F 5 CGACGGATGTGGCAAAAGT3 and Ad5Clip R 5 CCTAAAACCGCGCGAAAA3 were designed by using the Primer Express Software Perkin Elmer Foster City CA USA A fluorogenic probe Ad5Clip Pr 5 VIC CACCGGCGCACACCAAAAACG TAMRA 3 was also designed by the Primer Express Software To determine the amount of cellular DNA present in the sample a second pair of primers and a FAM probe specific for 18S rDNA 22 were used The PCR reaction mixture consisted of 1 buffer A Perkin Elmer 3 mM MgCl 2 200 M dNTPs 90 nM of each adenovirus primer 100 nM of each 18S rDNA primer 200 nM of each probe 0 6 U AmpliTaq Gold polymerase Perkin Elmer and 5 l of total DNA sample As a standard to determine the amount of adenoviral genomes and cellular DNA a plasmid containing approximately 5000 bp of the left part of the Ad5 genome pAdapt was mixed with cellular DNA extracted from A549 cells The PCR reaction was initiated with a hot start at 95 C for 10 min and involved 45 cycles of 15 s at 95 C and 1 min at 60 C Northern Blotting The animals were sacrificed 2 days after vector administration and the liver was immediately collected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen The liver samples were cut and homogenised in Trizol reagent Gibco Life Technologies using a blender Total RNA was isolated from the liver tissue homogenate by using the method developed by Chomoczynski and Sacchi 23 Briefly chloroform was added and the aqueous phase containing the RNA was recovered RNA was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol and the pellet was resuspended in RNase free water The RNA and DNA content were measured by spectrophotometric analysis The quantity of RNA loaded was 20 g as determined by spectrophotometry The RNA loaded represents a similar proportion of luciferase mRNA in both strains as the total concentrations of RNA are similar in the Wag Rij 6 40 1 43 g gr and in the Brown Norway rats 6 55 1 91 g gr The RNA was run on a 1 agarose gel and transferred onto Hybond N membrane by overnight transfer The RNA was then fixed by UV irradiation The hybridisation was performed overnight with one stranded 32P dATF Luciferase probe 1800 bp The membrane was exposed to a X ray film Kodak for 24 h and afterwards the membrane was scanned in a phosphorimager for quantification Then the membrane was stripped 15 min at 65 C and prehybridised with salmon sperm DNA Then a second hybridisation procedure was performed with the 32P dATF actine probe Pathology The scoring of the liver damage was performed in Wag Rij and Brown Norway rats 2 and 7 days after the intravenous injection of adenoviral vectors The liver pieces were fixed in formalin 10 embedded in paraffin and sections of 10 m were stained with haematoxylin and eosin The total damage score is a compilation of scores of
