                i dont think anybody pays too little   no i would tend to agree very highly i think that were all paying a little bit too much taxes and not seeing too much good come out of it   do you get hit up for local taxes there   yeah we sure do here in Indiana we pay uh we pay county income tax state income tax we pay five percent sales tax uh you name it they tax it   oh so you you you get the whole smorgasbord   thats right we   well i i actually live in New Hampshire   uhhuh   tax free or die uhhuh   right which is probably pretty nice but ill bet that means your state sales tax is pretty high   no actually theres no sales tax in New Hampshire either   theres no sales tax either   no what there is is very high property taxes because thats how they fund schools and everything   uhhuh   the only problem is i work in Massachusetts so they they hit me up for the five percent there   right Taxachusetts   yep but it well you know we its its only a state taxes no local weve got a five percent sales tax   uhhuh right   but um the problem is that so im paying state tax even though i dont live here but at least on things like stock options and things like that they dont tax me   right uhhuh   so thats not too bad   no i uh i really think that here in Indiana at least we pay a a whole uh just too much tax i worked in a factory uh last summer and on the average i was losing twenty percent of every paycheck to taxes and i dont feel that i really get a whole lot of return from that i mean i dont utilize all you know it really any government welfare services of course i drive on the roads and i you know went to the schools and stuff but i really feel that that im just getting overtaxed   yeah oh i i i mean i id consider twenty percent lucky because just on i mean you know when you figure out just on feds you know i actually hit the thirty one bracket this year which was no fun   uhhuh no thats thats not any fun   right and also you know then you figure out seven or eight percent for FICA   uhhuh   which is taxes where you  most people forget about them because youve got you know you cant always get your FICA back at the end of the year but so you know and then you know like a five percent FICA im paying forty percent tax   right right yeah which is just outrageous and a lot of it and if you look at the way the government is run these days it just seems like a lot of its going to waste   yeah well i i mean i think theres some people there you there clearly are some things where you need infrastructure and you need   right   you know you know there are things government does better you know i think government does a better space program   right   than youre gonna get out of private individuals but you know i think you know you look at things like you know tax subsidies to tobacco farmers because Jesse Helms wants it that way or   right thats right got to keep those farmers happy   you know and and just tremendous amounts of you know so much of it is now just going to service debt or you know is going in   uhhuh   into into programs that you know yeah they are they are fat you know i think the military is really fat i think that a lot of the the HEW services although theyre providing necessary services have too much fat in them   right there is there is just way too much bureaucracy and so much of that tax money is going just to keep that bureaucracy running keep the paper shuffling around instead of real you know good programs   you know like we we um yeah i mean we we spend a fortune for things like VA hospitals and you know then you look at how well theyre managed you know i dont think were getting our moneys work out worth out of there i think its all going into into bureaucrats   right and a lot of its feeding uh just i just i really especially in the election year i mean im really thinking a lot about this the economy and questions like that and and just the whole       it seems like everything is really screwy right now as far as the economy of the government goes and our our whole economy in general and our taxes just are gonna keep rising no matter what happens and especially when youve got the Bush administration who has increased government and expenditures uh beyond beyond what any other President since World War Two has done and yet he supposedly   well between between between him and Reagan yeah   right right yeah i mean i just read something that two thirds or three quarters im not exactly sure of our national debt   the great communicator   are was created during the Reagan Bush era who are supposedly supposedly fiscally conservative   oh oh yeah they think oh yeah and then they go and say that Congress Congress theyre the fault for it   right   but you know the other thing is its tricky though because like in New Hampshire they say oh all right lets cut the military budget well yeah then you lose half your jobs in New Hampshire you lose Grotten Connecticut goes so you know its like   right umhum   you know its very tricky to balance that stuff off because then you hurt you know if the if the if people lose their jobs then they become a load and theyre not contributing taxes   thats right   so you know its its very hard to say you know this is what we should cut   yeah its really that is the especially that defense  cuts in the defense is really a catch   yes   double whammy because like you say if you cut defense well thats great thats gonna lower our national expenditures but then youre gonna have people on welfare and theyre not putting taxes in   who who arent contributing right yeah   so thats thats really   and uh in our   its im glad im not the one who has to come up with these policies   right   but whats very funny is in our town meeting they were voting this this this guy had both for our school district meeting and our town meeting had this proposal which unfortunately violates New Hampshire constitution  for our local town to do it to uh have you have people line item their taxes   uhhuh right   they say i want to pay for this and this and this and this and this course the only problem with that is then nobody pays for the necessary services that they dont use   thats right   yeah
