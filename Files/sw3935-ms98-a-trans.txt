        well have you had to return any uh merchandise recently     yeah i did i just had to return a pair of shorts i bought for Christmas a winter pair of shorts and the seam was out on the the zipper went out on it right away pulled out   yeah   and the buttons were loose on it and it was from you know a nice department store   yeah  its interesting its interesting i really hadnt even given any thought at all to things like buttons and seams but   and um   i guess ive just begun to take that for advantage that buttons are not gonna be sewn on i mean took that for uh granted that buttons are not gonna be sewn on very well   i guess thats true but it you know you think back and you didnt have to do replace buttons or anything   yeah well youre right youre right   very long ago it wasnt   yeah yeah no i i agree with you   but anymore its pretty common that you do but when the zipper went on this one i said thats it   yeah uhhuh   that you know that really did it   yeah one of my pet peeves is uh neckties uh neckties you know theyre just uh uh a nice silk necktie is astronomical   yeah umhum right   and it has this little um you know sewn on bar on the back of the tie that you tuck it in you know after youve tied it and those little those little some of them bars will inevitably come loose loose loose   umhum umhum i know they hang they hang   and it drags it just drives me crazy i mean its an integral part of the tie and it wouldnt take you know what a half a penny of good thread to put it on there securely so um  anyway yeah thats uh thats   yeah i know it right yeah yeah there are a lot and and how about uh any appliances ive had that happen with Sunbeam no im disgusted i have a Sunbeam beater that weve taken back three times and Sunbeam always had a good name   yeah   now that just really shocks me but ill tell you that thing hasnt i burnt the motor out twice and i cooked once at Christmas so thats about it anymore   well yeah   but i bake and im very disgusted with them   yeah i i will i will tell you my experience with appliances Joan has been that uh  well what happened to me i had a a stereo   umhum   that i uh um receiver receiver amplifier that i really liked and it started messing up so i took it to the shop and the minimum charge to even look at it was fifty bucks   um   but i you know rationalized and i thought well even if i spend you know seventy five dollars thats cheaper than buying a new one so i wound up spending the nearly a hundred dollars on it   yeah sure umhum   took it home it worked maybe two weeks and exactly the same thing happened to it so i took it back to the shop   um um uhhuh   and you know bottom line is i went through all this gyration and and aggravation and unhooking it and hooking it back up and hauling it back and forth to the repair shop   umhum   eventually it never worked right again and i i wound up buying a new one i had similar i had a similar thing happen with a television and im about i i just came to the conclusion with electronics anyway   huh huh huh right   you know if they break throw them away go get a new it   and go ahead and get a new one anyway you got a lemon     yeah you know and and i think youre better off in the long run just to chunk it and get a new one but i i will have to say you know if you think about things like uh   yeah yeah yeah but yeah   as much as stereos for example i can remember the first one i bought whenever i was in college i mean i paid a fortune for it   umhum and you had it forever though   well thats true as a matter of fact my i gave the amp to my little brother and hes still using it yeah that is true ill have ill have to admit  but they have come down in price but there again theyre theyre made a lot cheaper     right right yeah yeah yeah theyve come a long way with the difference in the i heard an interesting thing on this morning on the radio to going to work about the Japanese you know they have that big thing about the consumers   uhhuh   and how many more hours they work on it and um they were saying that they did a study on it and the Japanese actually uh i mean the United States actually produces six point five percent more product in the time um more products than Japanese do and the Japanese take twice as much time and work but they dont get the productivity productivity out of it   uhhuh   and that they do because of the hours they put in that thats what they loose they loose and i thought it was very interesting and they said in the and the unique part of it is that the Japanese are the ones that um did the study it wasnt as though we were doing it to show them they did the study so i got i got got a big kick out of that one   so yeah so yeah and i i agree with you if we had done it i would have felt maybe it was biased which thats a terrible thing to say but  well i dont know its um it were living in an interesting time i mean certainly the Japanese have shown that   yeah yeah yeah yeah   you know they can really produce some quality merchandise and at the same time um   umhum   i think what its forced uh American manufacturing to realize is that theyre gonna
