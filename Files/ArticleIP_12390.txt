 His Excuse for Loving To hear Robert Pinsky read His Excuse for Loving click Is it possible to write in rhyme and meter more gracefully and plainly than Ben Jonson 1573 1637 does in His Excuse for Loving In couplets and the beheaded first syllable omitted four foot iambic line familiar from Twinkle Twinkle Little Star he speaks his mind directly and eloquently about feeling love ardently when no longer a youth The closing lines of the poem with the sentence dancing eagerly over and across the ends of the lines suggest that William Butler Yeats read Jonson closely and indeed Yeats and Ezra Pound did study Jonson during the months when they shared a cottage in the country Robert Pinsky Let it not your wonder move Less your laughter that I love Though I now write fifty years I have had and have my Peeres Poets though divine are men Some have loved as old again And it is not always face Clothes or Fortune gives the grace Or the feature or the youth But the Language and the Truth With the Ardor and the Passion Gives the Lover weight and fashion If you then will read the Storie First prepare you to be sorry That you never knew till now Either whom to love or how But be glad as soon with me When you know that this is she Of whose Beautie it was sung She shall make the old man young Keepe the middle age at stay And let nothing high decay Till she be the reason why All the world for love may die
