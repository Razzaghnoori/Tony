 The Back Slapping Media Elite ELLEN We are on opposite schedules While you were writing yesterday s last dispatch I was eating noodles and steamed vegetables from a palatable take out joint in Tribeca watching Hardball and preparing to tuck my almost 5 year old son into bed His birthday is next week ironically on the same date as my mother who passed away 16 years ago and that s all he can talk about You didn t respond to my take on Columbine On hate crimes I see your point but I think the media and attention starved politicians have trivialized the issue The most publicized hate crime in recent memory was the sad death of Matthew Shepard the gay man in Wyoming I don t believe that was a hate crime designed to send a message to a whole class of people It was the case of a couple of losers who were drunk homophobic and out of control It doesn t compare to abortion clinic bombings In any case my point remains What s the point of hate crime legislation other than to assuage liberals For example I hope Shepard s killers are fried but they can t be killed twice right In today s Times Maureen Dowd comes close perhaps subconsciously to endorsing George W Bush She writes about the cocaine question as every pundit is these days and chastises Bush for not answering that query when he s stated that he s been faithful to his wife Yet she closes the piece He seems to have good instincts and he knows how to get good advice But does that qualify him to lead the country That s the substance abuse we should worry about Dowd is an odd duck Most often she writes about Hollywood fashion everything trivial while wrapping it up in some political context Last Sunday s column about Warren Beatty s running for president which would be a lot of fun no was typical She said he won t because as Carly Simon sang so long ago He s So Vain She certainly didn t deserve the Pulitzer even though it s a bogus award an example of the media elite slapping each other on the back especially when Nat Hentoff now one of the few reasons to read the Voice was her competitor But I m behind in my work The classified director from the Voice has just moved over to NYPress and she starts today She ll need a quick primer in NYPress in house culture which I guarantee you is far different from our rival s Best RUSS
