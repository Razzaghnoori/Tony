                 do you um have a family budget or how do you work your budgeting   well  for many many years uh my wife and i did have a budget uh we were both working at the time and so forth and um that we had to do that until we finally got the house paid for and and other big bills taken care of uh we have a a budget but not as strict now as we used to because we dont have quite such a tight financial situation   umhum yeah   so it its uh its been helpful i mean yes having a budget is very very important and that did get us so that you know the house is paid for and uh other major things were taken care of and now we can relax a little bit more because basically we dont really require as much on a daily or a monthly basis as we did before so were we dont have to have quite as strict uh a budget as we did   oh well we dont have a real strict budget um we have a a low budget to work on but we um you know for like groceries we saved up this much per week and then we we just spend about so much we dont   sure uhhuh   i i dont know of a a written figure of expenses that we you know keep to or anything but i know that when i go to the grocery store  that we always stick within you know five dollars between here and there   umhum   a certain amount   i think ive i do that automatically myself i mean i unconsciously uh   yeah   you know stay in a within a with a certain amount because i i have enough food already stored here that i dont have to make any large purchase at any one time all i normally do now is pick up little things here and there   oh   as the salt goes out or we need sugar or something like that   wow thats great   yeah we have two freezers and course we had a large garden here that we grow a lot of our own stuff and we freeze a lot of that so a lot of the vegetables are taken care of in our own personal personal storage   oh oh you guys sound pretty self sufficient   well we we keep a little note pad on a on our wall when if anything is absolutely out make a note of it and then uh the next time i go to the store why i pick it up and fill it up so its its worked very well that way at least that way we  you know if each of us finds something is missing   hm   uh we put it up uh the other person might not know about it   yeah well thats a good idea   that way we can keep up to date   lets see the the other thing there the topic was talking about was if you if i dont all i can think of is if you dont keep a real real tight budget how do you control expenses but um one another thing that we do is we always fly back to California and Washington each Christmas well not fly back but somehow we get back there   uhhuh   and um this year we did it by train because it was the least expensive and   well actually its more interesting too if youve got the time   huh oh yeah and um you know we could go to both places without having to spend so much for plane fare   yeah   and so um we find that if were careful with our you know just everyday things like grocery shopping and and gas and entertainment things like that then um somewhere in out in the wash itll come out that we have enough to get back there you know   sure well i think we unconsciously  do the same thing excuse me my throats not as clear today as it should be   uhhuh thats right   uh we are uh going to be traveling to Europe with a choral we sing with this so called Pennsylvania Choral and we make a two weeks   uhhuh   tour of of uh foreign countries and of course that costs money so we uh each of us watches the funds that we spend and make sure that that we gather together over a period a time enough money to to make this trip so that that is another way of uh budgeting   uhhuh thats right   and i think we just sort of unconsciously do it we uh just live a normal life but we dont throw any money away particularly we save it for this trip which is uh always very very nice   yeah well whenever  i dont know if this is part of the topic but whenever i find you know a dime or something on the ground i will ill probably pick it up      i do the same thing i have a whole pile of those things that i have found by parking meter      uhhuh yeah i have a special little jar that i keep all the money i found in  count it up at the end of the year something   yeah yeah   but yeah   well lets face it then when we talking budget it is important to to have a budget  and uh i i keep track of mine on a more rough basis now by just watching the level of my checking checking account and i have a money market account also   uhhuh   and uh i keep those levels up above a certain minimum and im always trying to
