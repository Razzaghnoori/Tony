                            Grant  describes as incorrect the statement that at least half of the explanation for        individual differences in risk for Alzheimer disease is genetic He suggests instead that        dietary and lifestyle factors explain the majority of individual susceptibility to        Alzheimer disease        The basis for asserting a  or greater role for genetics in Alzheimer disease risk        comes from family studies and from twin studies In family studies firstdegree relatives        of individuals with Alzheimer disease are at more than double the risk of Alzheimer disease        compared to those with no affected relatives  In twin studies across different        Scandinavian twin registries estimates of heritability of Alzheimer disease range from         to over          Genetic risk undoubtedly represents the cumulative influence of many genes including        apolipoprotein E APOE and other genes not yet identified In particular it appears that        the magnitude of the genetic component of Alzheimer disease risk is similar across ethnic        communities but that different genetic factors may contribute differently to that risk in        white Latino and African American families         Further there are interactions between genetic and environmental risks for example        between the APOE e allele and high cholesterol  or head injury         Clearly Alzheimer disease is the outcome of multiple genetic and multiple environmental        influences operating additively and interactively If genetic effects account for half of        individual differences in liability then environmental influences also account for half of        the variation in susceptibility From a public health viewpoint it is vital to identify        those influences that are modifiable Controlling blood pressure and avoiding head trauma        are examples However it is also important to appreciate that individuals bring        differences in genetic risk to the table
