 State your full name Brian DeLucia What is your native language Uh my native language is English What is your occupation My occupation I work for Bank Of America and I work on a uh website OK Um when do you remember hearing stories as a child Uh I remember hearing stories as a child when basically my mother reading stories to me not so much my father but more my mother when I was I can t even tell you how old I was But I just I know for a fact as a child my mother would read to me before I went to bed Do you remember any stories Um there was one book that I always remember I don t know if my mother ever finished it But one sticks out and it s still um at our home in New York and whenever I go back up there I always see the book lying around um in my room actually or on the bookshelf And it s actually called the Trumpet of the Swan So that s that s the that s the main story that I remember that that sticks in my head as far as my mother reading it to myself and my sister when we were younger Can you tell a little bit about it or do you remember anything Um I think the one thing I remember mostly about it actually is just the the front cover of it And it was just a uh uh a small boy it looked like on the edge of a lake and he was doing something either like feeding you know the swan or holding out his hand to it or something to that effect But the actual um the actual plot of the story I probably don t really remember Do you remember hearing stories that your parents would tell you as a child maybe about their past or Oh yeah I can remember my uh my father telling me um the story of my grandparents coming from uh Italy when uh they came over Um so that kind of stands clearly in my mind I also remember uh my mother telling me a lot of stories about uh how hard it was for her when she was growing up because uh there was about I think she was one of um four siblings and um my grandmother never really worked or anything like that She was always taking care of the kids And my grandfather was always working like about three different jobs So I remember my mother telling me all kinds of interesting stories about my grandfather as far as uh he was a New York City cop um you know and worked in a he was a bailiff in in court you know for the New York courts for awhile like at the same time actually and he was also doing like a a security job as well So those kind of stories Hmm Do you read stories now Uh I read books and and magazines if that that counts as as stories What kind What do you tend towards I tend to read uh mostly uh fiction books I m not really uh into uh a lot of the non fictions though occasionally I ll read a biography or uh something like that if if you know I see something in a bookstore But uh yeah I read a lot of non fiction Um I like fantasy type stories cause I always liked that when I was younger The The Dungeons and Dragons type stuff and even up until um you know I still enjoy reading that kind of stuff about you know swords and magic that kind of stuff And I ve actually always uh enjoyed stuff reading books about like vampires Like you know fiction books about uh vampires and and that kind of stuff And I also tend to um hear about authors from you know friends or or hear of a famous book from a friend and I ll read one and if there happens to be a series on it then you know I ll start reading those I actually just started reading uh the first three books of the Harry Potter series and I think those are intended for a much younger audience but I ve actually read all the first three that have come out and I ve enjoyed them cause that s basically it s about a kid who s a magician basically finds out that he s a magician So that kind of you know peaked my interest when I started reading it So when you first started to read you tended towards the fantasy books Um yeah when I started to be able to decide what I wanted to read as opposed to having somebody read it to me I tended to lean more towards yeah fantasy type books Is there a story that changed in significance as you ve gotten older Like maybe you ve read you remember hearing a book and then you heard it again or read it again that changed in meaning or meant something different to you Uh yeah actually I remember my parents actually read to me um Watership Down which is a story about a bunch of rabbits who um get driven out of wherever they re living I forget the technical term for for what their home under under the ground is called but they get driven out of that and they have to go and basically find a new place to live And I remember my parents read that to me It s a really big long book The paperback book is like about like six hundred pages long So I remember my parents read that to me and I thought it was just really like cute about the rabbits kind of thing And I think they might have skipped a lot of pages too because I actually read it in high school and it turns out it was like you know somewhat of a violent book Like some of the rabbits get killed and it s it s much more deeper and it s actually it has like political undertones to it cause it s you know different factions of rabbits you know kind of like fighting against each other and you know it was really interesting So that that kind of that story like I remember being younger and hearing it and thinking like oh it was cute because it was rabbits and then reading it and actually you know en enjoying it a lot more when I was in high school cause it was actually a really really good book Um do you or would you like to read to children Uh yes I I d read to children but probably not I d probably tend to read to my own children Um I don t know how much I d be into reading to just you know like a a program of just reading to children kind of thing But when I do have children I m going make sure that either um you know my wife reads to them or that you know or make it a point that I read to them cause I think it s it s really important And actually uh my sister has two young children and um she s constantly reading to to her child and who s two years old now And she just seems like a pretty bright intelligent kid compared to some other two year olds that I ve that I ve encountered Are there any personal stories about your past and history and growing up that you re going to tell your children Um yeah I m sure that there s going be stories that I ll I ll tell them about Um to tell you the truth I ll definitely tell my kids you know things about you know stories about when I was growing up and maybe some things that you know you should or shouldn t do Um in particular I could I could think of a few things Um I know when I was really younger I ll tell them this story about never going near uh a frozen pond because when I was really young um the lake by my house had frozen over actually it was just a pond but it was a pretty big one um and we always use to play ice hockey and what not on it And it started to um get warmer outside but there was still a layer of ice on top of it and a bunch of my friends had gone out on to the the dock That is you know you could easily get to it It was attached to kind of like the shore but at the deep end of the pond And we were out there and one of my friends was kidding around and I think we were in like about seven or eight years old Um and one of my friends was joking around on it and actually fell through the ice And uh a bystander had to come over and basically fish him out and the kid could ve died So I ll tell my kids to to stay away from thin ice Do you think your parents told you stories more out of humor or more out of as a warning Like about stories about growing up with them or their past Do you think they used their stories as teachable moments Yeah I think they had a mixture because I think um it s kind of like two different you know things that they would tell me as far as stories You had the things that they would read out of books which were purely for entertainment it always seemed like Um and then if it was anything that was you know that I kind of correlated with if it wasn t coming from a book they were probably trying to get something into my head You know trying to like you know teach me something in some way So it was kind of like if it was coming out of book I knew it was for pure entertainment whereas if it was something they were telling to me I might be a little more receptive to you know maybe trying to find a little a little meaning behind it and say Hey why are you why are you telling me this Now your grandparents or great grandparents came from Italy Uh my grandparents So your grandparents had they told you stories about Italy Oh yeah Can you think of anything Um yeah I mean they just they mostly they didn t really talk about what it was like being over there I mean they more talked about um coming over here Like from the time when they came over here that was hard for them at first to adjust And how they came over with with basically you know nothing or you know not not that many possessions looking for a looking for a better life and you know just how they had to work hard to get you know where they were And that they their entire lives they were just trying to make a better life for my dad and his sister So I didn t really hear too many stories about um you know where they came from But more of like the actual journey over and and what it was like to first come here OK I think I ve got everything Thank you You re welcome
