 Europa Translated by David Ferry posted Tuesday July 16 to be composted Tuesday July 23 May bad people see bad omens everywhere The screech of an owl the sight of a pregnant dog Or a grey she wolf running across a field Or maybe a fox that s lately dropped her litter Or may they see a serpent like an arrow Slither obliquely across scaring the horses My prayers will make good omens for good people I ll look to the east and call upon the raven To sing good fortune to come to those I fear for Before he has a chance to fly to the west To the standing pools to prophesy bad weather Wherever it is your heart desires to go Go safely there and be happy Galatea Remembering with pleasure how we were Let no sinister magpie say you nay Nor any wandering crow forbid your journey But you can see the tumult in the sky When angry Orion sets You know how black The Adriatic can be and what can go wrong Even when lapyx the favoring West Wind blows O rather may our enemies wives and children Experience the unexpected gales The South Wind brings upon them the roaring of The blackening waters the sound of the pounding surf Shaking the beaches Thus it was for Europa Entrusting the safety of her snow white body To the not to be trusted bull when in the very Moment of her departure she was aghast At the midnight sea swarming with terrible monsters She who had only a moment before that been A pupil of the flowers of the fields And a weaver of the garlands of the nymphs Now all she saw in the blackness of the night Were the waves of the sea and the faint light of stars At last she found herself upon the shore Of the mighty hundred citied island of Crete And cried out to her father Father I Who left behind my name and daughterly duty What madness was it that came over me Where am I now Where is it I have come from One death alone is too little for such as I Am I in my senses deploring the deed I did Or didn t I do it Was it some empty phantom That flew up through the ivory gate of lies Which was it better to do To do as I did To fly here through the darkness over the waves Or stay back there in the field gathering flowers If that young bull were here before me now I d strike into its hide with avenging steel And break the horns I lately hung with flowers Shameless I left the gods of my father s house Shameless I wait for Orcus to take me away If there are any gods who listen to me While still my beauty remains send me naked Out among lions let me be eaten by tigers Before these fresh cheeks wither Vilest Europa The voice of her father says from far away Why do you put off dying There is a tree An ash tree near to hand yourself upon With the silken sash you luckily brought with you Unless that is the jagged rocks that lie At the bottom of yonder cliff would please you better If that is so just give yourself to the wind A royal princess otherwise fated to be A slave handmaiden to some savage queen Europa wept Quite suddenly there stood Venus Heartlessly laughing and laughing and with her her son With his bow unstrung and when Venus had laughed enough She aid Dry up your tears and quell your rage When the bull presents its horns for you to break Europa you are the bride of Jupiter Learn how to bear your great good fortune for A region of the world is named for you
