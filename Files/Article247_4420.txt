 Something To Talk About I m sort of ashamed to admit I don t often read newspaper humor columnists or newspaper columnists in general My memory from the time when I did read columnists regularly is that even the very best of them tend to bat around 300 This is not I suspect their fault The economics of newspapers and the tastes of readers more or less dictate that a columnist has to appear at least twice and preferably three times each week That s 2 400 words Very few people can turn out 2 400 words of penetrating insight every week As a result columnists often tend to turn to filler mock outrage over the scandal of the day rants on solidly uncontroversial topics the New York Post s Maggie Gallagher I noticed devoted an entire column yesterday to advancing the rather daring notion that adults should not have sex with children and in certain cases paeans to the comforts of their family I m pretty sure that there are few fates worse than being the child of a columnist struggling with writer s block and a deadline In the early 1990s I could easily imagine Anna Quindlen turning to one of her kids and saying Please for the love of God say something innocent yet wise And if it could have some bearing on a contemporary issue all the better Again I m not really blaming the columnists here They have a deadline to meet they have space to fill They do what they have to do But I do think they re symptomatic of a larger problem Journalistic overcapacity Which is to say we now have so many news outlets with so many writers that we are now saying far more than needs to be said covering far more than needs to be covered I might suggest that many of the mini scandals that pop up and dominate the news for a few cycles do so not because anyone s legitimately upset or outraged over them but because people like you and especially me need something to talk about Thus all the silly debates over say a flag burning amendment or the Sensation show Sure the discussions tend to be reductive and overheated But at least they re something to fill an hour of Hardball This in turn ties into a favorite fantasy of mine I am invited to appear on Hardball With Chris Matthews to debate say flag burning I am introduced as being for it I give my little speech They give such warmth and oh the rosy glow And my opponent let s imagine Charlton Heston lights into me An outrage should be ashamed to be an American an enduring symbol of our national freedom freedoms which you so clearly don t deserve And so on To which I reply You know Charlton may I call you Charlton No OK I never thought about it that way Never thought about it that way at all And now that you mention it you re quite right It is a travesty I agree with you completely We are now about five minutes into the broadcast What we do with the remaining 55 minutes is a mystery to me
