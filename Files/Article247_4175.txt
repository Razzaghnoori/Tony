 The Resumption of History Dear David In re the millennium A camera crew from ABC News was here yesterday morning to interview me for the Peter Jennings news hour Every Friday evening Jennings has a seven minute segment called The American Century The segment focuses on a single topic The one I saw last Friday was called Feminism The theme was carried principally by Jennings narration and documentary footage and this was interspersed briefly with some comments by the Chilean novelist Isabel Allende and the cultural historian Ann Douglas It is hard to recall what each of them said for they were literally sound bites or is it bytes The Jennings producers have scheduled a segment called Prediction and I was called because in 1965 I had initiated the Commission on the Year 2000 of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and our major report Toward the Year 2000 had been reprinted last year by the M I T Press as was this year my book The Coming of Post Industrial Society by Basic Books with a new 30 000 word foreword I spoke with one of the producers for about 40 minutes on camera What they will make of it I do not know for I began by saying that one could not predict the future if by the future one meant point events such as Who will become president of the United States in the year 2000 Who will succeed Boris Yeltsin as president of Russia if Yeltsin does not create a ruse to succeed himself What will happen in Iraq after Saddam Hussein Or in Cuba after Fidel Castro No one knows There are too many imponderables I think of an episode of my friend Zbigniew Brzezinski who had been a member of the Commission of the Year 2000 He was being baited on television by a hostile commentator who began Professor Brzezinski you are a Kremlinologist Yes said Zbig if you like that clumsy word You tell the State Department what goes on in the Soviet Union the man continued When they listen said Zbig The man then sprang his trap How come you failed to predict the ouster of Khrushchev And Zbig who is quick on his feet replied Tell me if Khrushchev couldn t predict his own ouster how do you expect me to do so The simple point is that one can predict only if you have an algorithm a decision rule that tells you how to sort things out Or where there is a firm set of rules for institutional succession When I initiated the Commission on the Year 2000 I went to John Gardner then the head of the Carnegie Corporation for funding John said You have written an interesting memorandum but give me a prediction It is very difficult to predict I said Well if you don t give me a prediction you don t get the money To paraphrase Dr Johnson there is nothing like the loss of money to concentrate the mind So without much forethought I said This is 1964 In November there will be an election for president equally in 1968 1972 1976 1980 2000 You call that a prediction Gardner asked incredulously Well I replied there are today about 120 nations in the world about how many can you make such a prediction This was shortly after the French Army in Algeria had been preparing to send in the paras to overthrow the government of Guy Mollet until de Gaulle stepped in to assert authority Oh Gardner replied We got the money This is running on but to anticipate you or any reader Can I return to John Gardner s question and give one prediction about the next century No not a prediction for that is not the way to think about it but a relevant social framework to identify issues and problems What we are witnessing is a change in the axis of world socio political organization namely one of widening economic integration crossing national boundaries and increasing political fragmentation within national boundaries The economic dimension is a change of scale as all national economies are absorbed into a global framework The fragmentation is occurring because as I remarked a decade ago the national state is becoming too small for the big problems of life and too big for the small problems The national state was a 19 th century innovation in response to the breakdown of local economic exchange Now the national state becomes defensive against the international onrush of capital currency commodity and even demographic flows And in imposing social programs from a national center it becomes unresponsive to the varieties and needs of different localities More than that we are witnessing not the end of history but the resumption of history Communism was a large smothering blanket thrown across societies and suppressing primordial identities With the end of the Soviet and Tito regimes those societies have broken open But it is not only those ideological empires the re assertion of defensive primordial identities is taking place in Africa and Belgium and even the United Kingdom Today there is an independent Scottish parliament a Welsh assembly and a self governing Northern Ireland All this is called devolution to rhyme with evolution and not to rhyme with revolution Some people think you have it easier You are a historian specializing in 18 th century France They think that the past is now over You know better It is not The past is itself ever subject to revision and new interpretation As we said when we adopted an epigraph for the Commission on the Year 2000 The past is never finished for the future is yet to come Love Dad
