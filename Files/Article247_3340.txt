 Can a New Magazine Survive The predicted demise of John Kennedy s George and the launch of Tina Brown s Talk raise the question What are a new magazine s chances for survival If the magazine is intended to reach a broad general interest audience the answer is not good The total number of magazines published in the United States has actually soared from 2 500 in 1985 to 5 500 in 1998 But this is entirely due to special interest magazines with names like The Asthmatic Day Trader imaginary or Martha Stewart Living real Even here the odds are against a newcomer More than 1 000 new magazines were launched in 1998 and half have already folded most after one issue In general only three out of every 10 new magazines make it to their fourth anniversaries Among general interest magazines the only newcomer to survive and thrive is Cond Nast s Vanity Fair InStyle and Entertainment Weekly both published by Time Warner might also qualify depending on your definition of general interest Cond Nast is privately owned so actual financial data are not available But it is widely assumed that Vanity Fair though making money now is far from recouping its early losses Even ultimately successful magazines spend many years and many millions before reaching profitability Unsuccessful magazines spend the money and never become profitable How much money George s start up costs were said to be 20 million Rumors about the cost of launching Talk range up to 50 million Why Partly for the same sorts of reasons that any new business must spend money before it starts coming in hiring employees stocking up on yellow notepads throwing a launch party etc but mainly because of the cost of acquiring subscribers You mail out masses of subscription offers i e junk mail and are happy with a 1 percent to 2 percent response It can easily cost 50 or more for a glossy monthly to acquire a subscriber who pays 12 or 15 a year Then you are thrilled if half of those renew at the end of a year Even an unsuccessful magazine can have a large circulation if it is willing to pay enough for subscribers Success comes when you have a high renewal rate and new customers are easy to entice to replace dropouts Then your subscriber acquisition costs plummet Even so the average subscriber may cost more to acquire than he or she ever pays But meanwhile your large and loyal audience entices lots of advertisers At best this takes years Of course even a money losing magazine can always survive indefinitely if its owner is willing to cover the losses The Weekly Standard owned by Rupert Murdoch has joined the New Republic the National Review and other older magazines in the tradition of magazines subsidized for political reasons But there is another more amorphous and less acknowledged tradition of money losing magazines kept alive for reasons of general glamour and corporate synergy Talk co owned by Miramax a division of Disney and the Hearst Corporation may survive and even thrive in that tradition And then there s the Internet where there are no postage printing or paper costs And there are no subscriber acquisition costs either since Internet magazines are given away free though Internet magazines do spend some money on marketing The theory is that advertisers who don t seem to mind the lack of paying subscribers eventually will cover the entire cost with a bit left over for profit So far this remains a theory Next question
