 Beyond Fact Checking Hi Russ While you ve been in Bermuda getting sunburned I ve been up in the mountains Catskills all summer which has been great for getting away but also leaves me somewhat media challenged I get the New York dailies but don t have cable or any TV and even the radio reception is terrible For any magazine less popular than Time the nearest venue is that great metropolitan center Woodstock which is 25 miles away Courtesy of a traveling family member I did get hold of the first Talk issue speaking of Hillary The profile was terrible it must be really difficult to write with your nose so far up someone s ass Hillary needs a great popular novel to do her justice She s in some ways poignant in some ways horrifying and an ur representation of all our cultural contradictions about women and power I m no fan of her politics on the evidence her left wing reputation is entirely undeserved she s a pro corporate New Democrat that health plan should have been called the Insurance Company Protection Act a pious communitarian against divorce no friend of civil liberties feminism half a millimeter deep I would vote for her for Senate because I can t stand Giuliani and don t want to see the Republicans get 60 votes but not with any enthusiasm She s a vulnerable candidate not because of the New York thing but because she s arrogant hates the press and people are tired of the Clintons Though if Ken Starr is stupid enough to release his report right before the election she s in But Giuliani is no shoo in A lot of New Yorkers and even suburbanites are turned off by his authoritarianism Pataki and D Amato will continue to undermine him endorsement or no and the Conservative Party probably won t endorse him unless he makes some gestures to the right which will not help him with his New York suburban base I do think Hillary will run short of some major negative groundswell which I don t detect so far I hope she does since it would at least be an exciting and unpredictable race unlike so far the presidential yawn RFK Jr or Andrew Cuomo Excuse me while I take a nap Rangel Maybe Nita Lowey would have been the best candidate actually but at this point she could never escape the comparisons and the celebrity gap Re the dailies casual attitude toward facts If news stories get the dates wrong the facts purveyed by what passes for news analysis and commentary make me feel like I m living in an alternate universe From what I read we re in the middle of an endless euphoric economic boom and lots of jobs at rising wages while what I see is a shaky stock market technology companies unable to unload their overstock of computers continuing layoffs people losing good jobs and getting part time lower paid benefitless jobs instead etc etc And then I keep reading that the culture war is over so what do you call it when the Kansas school board has decided evolution doesn t have to be taught
