 Tame at Heart Why do big studio movies that celebrate wildness and primal man and equate civilization with corruption tend to play as if their plots have been hammered out by Hollywood executives on car phones And why do those pictures always feel as if they ve been honed with the help of focus groups in suburban shopping malls to ensure that no aspect will be jarring to the middlest of middle class viewers Instinct is the newest specimen of commercially overprocessed primitivism The film which purports to explore the circumstances under which a celebrated anthropologist Ethan Powell Anthony Hopkins disappeared among Rwandan gorillas and emerged two years later as a mute and wild eyed killer of park rangers is loaded with radical credos ideas evocative of Kafka deep ecology and Dian Fossey at her most gorillaphilic But every one of those conceits is rendered toothless by a form of storytelling that s the opposite of instinctual The more subversive Instinct gets in proclaiming free will an illusion fostered by a rigidly repressive society the more captive it seems to a rigidly repressive studio marketing department Instinct is inspired by Daniel Quinn s 1991 cult novel Ishmael which is largely a Socratic telepathic dialogue between a man and a gorilla the latter of whom hectors the former about the destructive path of modern society and restates the history of the world as a struggle between leavers animals wise nomadic tribes and takers mostly white males Someone must have spent a fortune to option Quinn s book before concluding that an interspecies Socratic telepathic dialogue with huge chunks of the Earth First manifesto wouldn t burn up the box office so screenwriter Gerald DiPego was brought in to fashion a story around Quinn s core principles The movie would have been more fun though if DiPego had left in a token telepathic ape Maybe just for a prologue Gimme that banana and I ll tell you the story of my old friend Ethan Powell What a character Anyway Instinct is built around that theater standby the series of charged encounters between a psychiatrist and a shackled patient during which it dawns on the doctor Cuba Gooding Jr that he and his society are the ones who are actually in need of curing Come to think of it the first Broadway play I ever saw Equus featured Hopkins in the role of the shrink who concludes that a boy who blinded eight horses with a metal spike has a passion sadly lacking in his sterile countrymen The ambitious Gooding s first challenge is to get Hopkins sedated and under heavy guard at Florida s Harmony Bay Correctional Facility to speak It seems to me that his next challenge is to get Hopkins to shut up since with relatively little prodding the ex mute wild man launches into a stream of resonant orations about life among the silverbacks Did they think of me I thought of them It was terrifying and wonderful I was coming back to something I had lost a long time ago and was only now remembering Danny Elfman puts a swelling choir on the soundtrack to help us remember those same things i e awestruck countercultural jungle movies such as The Emerald Forest 1985 and Greystoke The Legend of Tarzan Lord of the Apes 1984 Instinct recycles a lot of countercultural touchstones the lovable psychotics out of One Flew Over the Cuckoo s Nest 1975 the fascist guards out of Cool Hand Luke 1967 He lives with the animals takes on their behavior becomes one of them says Gooding seemingly on the verge of a chorus from Doctor Dolittle 1967 He can give me a look at man at his primitive state ungoverned man It s a giggle but the idea of a young African American learning the secrets of the Dark Continent from a 60 plus year old Welsh ham has its daft charm He s leading me into the jungle concludes Gooding Maura Tierney playing Hopkins estranged daughter listens to Gooding talk and struggles to keep her emotions in check smoking intensely while her eyes water and her chin quivers Will she and Gooding do the Wild Thing No perhaps the mall focus groups turned thumbs down on interracial romance Back in the prison Hopkins puts Gooding in a headlock and gives him an intellectual noogie What has he lost now that he has been immobilized by a senior citizen Control No No one has control Freedom No No one is free The answer is supposed to be his illusions but more likely it s whatever remains of Gooding s credibility as an actor If nothing else the director John Turteltaub Phenomenon 1996 keeps the performers from drifting into camp A raw skinned actor named John Aylward does a good job of making the warden a malignly neglectful bureaucrat recognizably human and John Ashton plays the chief villain a guard called Dacks as a man whose cruelty arises out of an obsession with control What makes him scary is his watchfulness But Turteltaub s technique is otherwise too slick for his supposedly primal subject The larger problem is that Instinct doesn t have the courage to leave its natural subjects untamed The gorillas are pussycats and Powell isn t a true murderer after all He killed a couple of Rwandan park rangers in defense of his adorable ape family which makes the movie a de facto vigilante picture and thus as mainstream a product as any that Hollywood churns out You taught me to live outside the game says Gooding his eyes misting up But Instinct is the work of players For true instinct you must turn to Mike Figgis an English director Leaving Las Vegas 1995 One Night Stand 1997 who s defiantly not a player and whose pixilated semi autobiographical semi allegorical The Loss of Sexual Innocence would not have got past the mall focus groups that evidently embraced Instinct It nearly didn t get past the screening that I caught at Manhattan s indie friendly Angelika Film Center which was marked by uneasy throat clearing and lots of walkouts What the hell is this thing In the movie Adam and Eve show up at intervals looking like Calvin Klein models He Femi Ogumbanjo is black and muscular she Hanne Klintoe is waiflike and flaxen haired with an expensive looking coif They emerge naked from golden waters into a yellowish African landscape explore each other s orifices and recline beside a white stallion and in range of a disappointingly ordinary snake At the end they eat squishy fruit vomit and are set upon by paparazzi Before that seminal episodes of disillusionment jealousy and betrayal are recalled by the movie s protagonist Nic Julian Sands As a lad in Kenya he peers through a window at an African girl practicing her English in lingerie for a drowsing old white pervert Cut to an English landscape from which all color has been drained and where Nic is a skinny teen ager Jonathan Rhys Meyers whose pubescent girlfriend drunkenly cheats on him during her father s wake Sex and death are forever entwined Nic sees photos of a naked woman stabbed by a lover a corpse bloated after three weeks in a river As a grown up he drives through the northern English countryside beside a frostily pissed off blond wife whom he subsequently takes from behind in the kitchen of their country cottage while his young son clutching a stuffed animal wanders their way Figgis shoots all this through windows to make the couple s alienation palpable Nic s wife dreams of coming upon Nic in a jazz combo then dancing half naked for old people Nic dreams of being dogged at a train station by a gangly cretin who then stabs him As the pavement rises up to meet his falling body he sees himself and his wife walk into their country cottage and close the door Cut to a shot of newborn twins who are then separated and grow up to be the lush Saffron Burrows one English one Italian The twins nearly meet each other in an airport but fate keeps them from connecting The Italian twin drives Nic who turns out to be a documentary film director to the desert of Tunisia where there is further betrayal loss of sexual innocence exploitation of Third World peoples and a tragic retaliation The soundtrack is melancholy classical piano That The Loss of Sexual Innocence doesn t gel is a point too obvious to belabor Much of it is risible yet I loved watching it not because I thought that the emperor was wearing new clothes but because I thought he looked fine beautiful actually naked Figgis camera is probing and alive so that even when his meanings are laughable his images remain allusive and mysterious What can I say The man gives good movie
