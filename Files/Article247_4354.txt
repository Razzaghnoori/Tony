 Disorganized Crime Dear Jeff OK you fuckin mook I deserved exactly half of that butt kicking But only half So watch it The first rule of mob movies is never give someone a bigger beating than they deserve in the first act if you don t want to get your ass thrashed in the third You re right about the writing being better than the acting but only because the writing is so good You re right about Goodfellas laugh fest was too strong Scorsese is not a belly laugh kinda guy You re right about expectations having been blown out of proportion And you are so right that David Chase should have killed off Livia Soprano whose acid tongue is starting to remind me of the monster drool in the Alien movies it eats away at the infrastructure I ll get back to Livia in a minute but first I have to get up on my Culturebox and pontificate on where you re wrong You are wrong sir to say that television criticism is about profound meaning Most of it is critics trying to explain how they think things work and why they like them The audience has a right to figure stuff out and to read people who might help them do that The boob tube is powerful Millions of people watch this show and talk about it every week Mobsters in fact do take their cues from it at least according to Time and Newsweek this week The Sopranos will probably do more than any of Tipper Gore s mental health initiatives to get insurance companies to change their policy on psychotherapy reimbursements So don t shut down the entire discussion just because you ve started hanging out with the producer and presumably swallowed his artsy fartsy faux modest we re just making TV here crap Now back to the second season Cards on the table I think next Sunday s episode is a letdown although that was probably inevitable It s an advertisement for psychotherapy only this time in reverse Without Melfi the psychiatrist around to draw out Tony s human side he and his buddies just seem angry and sour Thugs are thugs and their wives are idiots to stick around and mob business is greasy and seedy instead of greasy and seedy and fun There was a sweetness to Tony when he was discovering his inner mensch that made his and everyone else s brutality come off as ironic and incongruous rather than just brutal Now stroke victim Livia is a stringy haired vision of evil instead of an amusingly tart tongued old bitch Her daughter and Tony s sister a sleazy ex hippie named Pavarti nee Janice has shown up from Seattle ostensibly to take care of her mother but more likely to scam off her brother Christopher Tony s prot g has a new gig as an SEC compliance officer involving some complicated scheme to dump crummy stock on unsuspecting widows and shut ins but basically he s the same asshole junkie he always was and has taken to fighting in bars with Ariana his girlfriend Carmela is more long suffering than ever She is reduced in this episode to smiling sadly a lot and cooking ziti Melfi sees patients in a roadside motel and when Tony finally tracks her down in a diner she spits in his face Fuck you And Tony my god He has turned into a huge drag stomping around crashing his SUV and throwing hissy fits at the world The only really great moment in the entire hour is the look on his face when the male shrink he goes to in desperation says he can t take on a patient in Tony s line of work After all quoth the shrink I saw Analyze This Analyze This says Tony with that inimitable Gandolfini I can t believe I m hearing this shit double take It s a fuckin comedy Oh yeah Analyze This Do we have to What s there to say Are mob movies played out Who knows As Melfi s son said last season they re our national epic or something like that But one thing s for sure They re all going to have to refer to The Sopranos now the way The Sopranos has to refer to The Godfather I want to know what happens next with the mob in real life if as you say the smarter ones realize that the Bada Bing lifestyle is dead And um Jeffrey Little Herring What the hell kind of moniker is that Yours most critically Judith De Man Shulevitz
