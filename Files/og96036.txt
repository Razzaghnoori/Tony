ANALYSIS UNDER 5 U S C 801 a 1 B i iv OF A MAJOR RULE ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION ENTITLED ACCESS TO TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES BY PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES FCC 96 285 BACKGROUND OF REPORT AND ORDER In 1992 the Federal Communications Commission FCC adopted rules to implement the requirements of the Hearing Aid Compatibility Act of 1988 47 U S C 610 In 1993 reacting to petitions filed by establishments affected by the rules the Commission suspended portions of the rules stating that these establishments were experiencing serious difficulties in their attempts to comply with the rules 8 FCC Rcd 4958 1993 58 Fed Reg 26692 The Commission later announced the formation of the Hearing Aid Compatibility Negotiated Rulemaking Committee an advisory committee that would consider whether the rule suspension should be lifted and whether new rules should be proposed 59 Fed Reg 60343 58 Fed Reg 1539 and 60 Fed Reg 27945 The Committee s members included telephone equipment manufacturers employers hospitals and nursing homes hotels and motels persons with disabilities and an FCC representative The Committee s Final Report adopted by unanimous consent was filed with the FCC in August 1995 i Cost benefit analysis Section 610 e of the Hearing Aid Compatibility Act of 1988 47 U S C 610 requires the Commission to consider the costs and benefits of proposed rules to all telephone users including persons with and without hearing disabilities In the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking the Commission solicited comments on the costs to establishments of providing volume control and hearing aid compatibility After reviewing the comments the Commission concluded that the 50 to 1 00 per unit increase in manufacturing costs does not impose a significant additional cost to users especially considering the lengthy phase in period for the requirements It also concluded that any costs are significantly outweighed by the benefits to be achieved GAO OGC 96 36 ii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 U S C 603 605 607 and 609 Section 603 Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The Commission initiated this proceeding with a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 11 FCC Rcd 4338 that reflected the recommendations of the Hearing Aid Compatibility Negotiated Rulemaking Committee That notice was summarized in the Federal Register 60 Fed Reg 63667 In the Notice the Commission published an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis and invited written public comments on the proposed rulemaking including comments on the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The analysis included in the proposed rulemaking provides the information required by sections 603 b 1 and 2 describing the reasons for the proposed action and its objectives and legal basis The information required by sections 603 b 3 and 4 concerning the estimate of the classes of small entities subject to the Report and Order and the projected reporting recordkeeping and other compliance requirements of the proposed rulemaking is also included In the analysis the Commission stated its belief that the proposed Report and Order does not duplicate overlap or conflict with any other relevant federal rules in accordance with the provisions of section 603 b 5 The Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis did not discuss any significant alternatives minimizing the impact on small entities Section 604 Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The Supplementary Information published in the Federal Register includes the full text of the Commission s Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 61 Fed Reg 42181 That analysis includes information required by section 604 including a description of the need for and purpose of this Report and Order Although no comments were submitted in direct response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis the Commission noted that a number of the general comments on the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking raised issues that could affect small entities In response to comments the Commission extended the compliance deadline for volume control from 1 year to 2 years and for HAC labelling of telephones by 6 months The analysis describes and estimates the number of small entities affected by the Report and Order addressing separately workplaces confined settings such as hospitals and nursing homes hotels and motels and importers and manufacturers Page 2 GAO OGC 96 36 of telephones for use in the United States The analysis also discusses the projected reporting recordkeeping and other compliance requirements of the Report and Order Finally the Commission considered two significant alternatives that could minimize the impact on small businesses 1 not including within the purview of telephones provided for emergency use those telephones in workplace noncommon areas in confined settings and in hotels and motels and 2 not requiring volume controls on the covered telephones The Commission stated that it rejected both alternatives because both seriously decreased the ability of hearing impaired individuals to gain access to phones in emergency situations Commission officials confirmed that copies of both the Initial and the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analyses were submitted to the Chief Counsel Small Business Administration Section 609 Participation by small entities The Report and Order in large part adopts the unanimous recommendations of the Hearing Aid Compatibility Negotiated Rulemaking Committee an advisory committee established by the Federal Communications Commission in 1995 According to the Commission the Committee s membership included small businesses and associations representing both large and small businesses as well as a telecommunication association representing end users some of whom are small entities iii Agency actions relevant to sections 202 205 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 2 U S C 1532 1535 As an independent regulatory agency the Commission is not subject to Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 iv Other relevant information or requirements under Acts and Executive orders Administrative Procedure Act 5 U S C 551 et seq The Commission promulgated this rule under the notice and comment procedures of 5 U S C 553 A Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was released on November 28 1995 11 FCC Rcd 4338 A summary of the notice was published in the Federal Register 60 Fed Reg 63667 In response to the Notice 31 parties filed comments 45 parties filed informal comment letters and 6 parties filed reply comments Appendix A to the Report and Order lists the parties filing comments and reply comments The Report and Order provides a discussion of these comments and Commission reaction to them Page 3 GAO OGC 96 36 Paperwork Reduction Act 44 U S C 3501 3520 The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking solicited public comment on specific aspects of the collections and was submitted to OMB for review pursuant to 44 U S C 3507 d 1 OMB assigned control number 3060 0687 to the collection and approved several of the proposals while filing comment on one of the proposed requirements The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking discussed three requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 First the item proposed that importers and manufacturers of new telephones for use in the United States be required to stamp the date of manufacture on new telephones Under current rules the date of manufacture is optional The Commission stated that a date stamp on a telephone would indicate to users that a telephone is hearing aid compatible if it were imported or manufactured after August 16 1989 when all new telephones were required to be hearing aid compatible Second until the rules for all workplace telephones go into effect the Commission proposed that employers designate certain hearing aid compatible telephones for emergency use Third the Commission proposed to amend a Commission rule regarding packaging to clarify that the type of hearing aid compatibility referred to is electro magnetic coil compatibility As a result of comments from groups representing persons with hearing disabilities and the Office of Management and Budget the Commission modified its date stamp proposal in the Report and Order Instead of requiring a date stamp the Report and Order required that new telephones be stamped with the letters HAC Commenters stated that a date stamp would be meaningless to many installers and users but that a letter stamp would be much more informative The Commission also changed the effective date of the letter stamping requirement from the effective date of the Report and Order to April 1 1997 to give importers and manufacturers time to make equipment changes The Commission also confirmed in its Report and Order its proposal to require employers to designate emergency use telephones until the new hearing aid compatibility rules are implemented The Commission rejected suggestions to issue specific signage requirements saying that the requirement that employers designate the telephones was sufficient The Commission also amended its rule regarding packaging to clarify the type of hearing aid compatibility to which the rule refers The final requirements were submitted to OMB on July 23 1996 pursuant to 44 U S C 3507 d 2 for approval The Report and Order is effective October 23 1996 70 days after the August 14 1996 publication of the Report and Order in the Federal Register Page 4 GAO OGC 96 36 Statutory authorization for the rule The Commission has promulgated this rule pursuant to provisions of the Hearing Aid Compatibility Act of 1988 47 U S C 610 The Commission did not identify any other statutes or executive orders imposing requirements relevant to this Report and Order Page 5 GAO OGC 96 36
