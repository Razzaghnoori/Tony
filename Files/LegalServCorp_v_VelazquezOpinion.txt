 SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Nos 99 603 and 99 960 LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION PETITIONER 99 603 v CARMEN VELAZQUEZ ET AL UNITED STATES PETITIONER 99 960 v CARMEN VELAZQUEZ ET AL ON WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT February 28 2001 JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court In 1974 Congress enacted the Legal Services Corporation Act 88 Stat 378 42 U S C 2996 et seq The Act establishes the Legal Services Corporation LSC as a District of Columbia nonprofit corporation LSC s mission is to distribute funds appropriated by Congress to eligible local grantee organizations for the purpose of providing financial support for legal assistance in noncriminal proceedings or matters to persons financially unable to afford legal assistance 2996b a LSC grantees consist of hundreds of local organizations governed in the typical case by local boards of directors In many instances the grantees are funded by a combination of LSC funds and other public or private sources The grantee organizations hire and supervise lawyers to provide free legal assistance to indigent clients Each year 2 LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION v VELAZQUEZ LSC appropriates funds to grantees or recipients that hire and supervise lawyers for various professional activities including representation of indigent clients seeking welfare benefits This suit requires us to decide whether one of the conditions imposed by Congress on the use of LSC funds violates the First Amendment rights of LSC grantees and their clients For purposes of our decision the restriction to be quoted in further detail prohibits legal representation funded by recipients of LSC moneys if the representation involves an effort to amend or otherwise challenge existing welfare law As interpreted by the LSC and by the Government the restriction prevents an attorney from arguing to a court that a state statute conflicts with a federal statute or that either a state or federal statute by its terms or in its application is violative of the United States Constitution Lawyers employed by New York City LSC grantees together with private LSC contributors LSC indigent clients and various state and local public officials whose governments contribute to LSC grantees brought suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to declare the restriction among other provisions of the Act invalid The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit approved an injunction against enforcement of the provision as an impermissible viewpoint based discrimination in violation of the First Amendment 164 F 3d 757 1999 We granted certiorari and the parties who commenced the suit in the District Court are here as respondents The LSC as petitioner is joined by the Government of the United States which had intervened in the District Court We agree that the restriction violates the First Amendment and we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals I From the inception of the LSC Congress has placed restrictions on its use of funds For instance the LSC Act prohibits recipients from making available LSC funds program personnel or equipment to any political party to any political campaign or for use in advocating or opposing any ballot measures 42 U S C 2996e d 4 See 2996e d 3 The Act further proscribes use of funds in most criminal proceedings and in litigation involving nontherapeutic abortions secondary school desegregation military desertion or violations of the Selective Service statute 2996f b 8 10 1994 ed and Supp III Fund recipients are barred from bringing class action suits unless express approval is obtained from LSC 2996e d 5 The restrictions at issue were part of a compromise set of restrictions enacted in the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 1996 Act 504 110 Stat 1321 53 and continued in each subsequent annual appropriations Act The relevant portion of 504 a 16 prohibits funding of any organization that initiates legal representation or participates in any other way in litigation lobbying or rulemaking involving an effort to reform a Federal or State welfare system except that this paragraph shall not be construed to preclude a recipient from representing an individual eligible client who is seeking specific relief from a welfare agency if such relief does not involve an effort to amend or otherwise challenge existing law in effect on the date of the initiation of the representation The prohibitions apply to all of the activities of an LSC grantee including those paid for by non LSC funds 504 d 1 and 2 We are concerned with the statutory provision which excludes LSC representation in cases LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION v VELAZQUEZ Opinion of the Court which involve an effort to amend or otherwise challenge existing law in effect on the date of the initiation of the representation In 1997 LSC adopted final regulations clarifying 504 a 16 45 CFR pt 1639 1999 LSC interpreted the statutory provision to allow indigent clients to challenge welfare agency determinations of benefit ineligibility under interpretations of existing law For example an LSC grantee could represent a welfare claimant who argued that an agency made an erroneous factual determination or that an agency misread or misapplied a term contained in an existing welfare statute According to LSC a grantee in that position could argue as well that an agency policy violated existing law 1639 4 Under LSC s interpretation however grantees could not accept representations designed to change welfare laws much less argue against the constitutionality or statutory validity of those laws Brief for Petitioner in No 99 603 p 7 Even in cases where constitutional or statutory challenges became apparent after representation was well under way LSC advised that its attorneys must withdraw Ibid After the instant suit was filed in the District Court alleging the restrictions on the use of LSC funds violated the First Amendment see 985 F Supp 323 1997 the court denied a preliminary injunction finding no probability of success on the merits Id at 344 On appeal the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part 164 F 3d 757 1999 As relevant for our purposes the court addressed respondents challenges to the restrictions in 504 a 16 It concluded the section specified four categories of prohibited activities of which three appear ed to prohibit the type of activity named regardless of viewpoint while one might be read to prohibit the activity only when it seeks reform Id at 768 The court upheld the restrictions on litigation lobbying and rulemaking involving an effort to reform a Federal or State welfare system since all three prohibited grantees involvement in these activities regardless of the side of the issue Id at 768 769 The court next considered the exception to 504 a 16 that allows representation of an individual eligible client who is seeking specific relief from a welfare agency The court invalidated as impermissible viewpoint discrimination the qualification that representation could not involve an effort to amend or otherwise challenge existing law because it clearly seeks to discourage challenges to the status quo Id at 769 770 Left to decide what part of the 1996 Act to strike as invalid the court concluded that congressional intent regarding severability was unclear It decided to invalidate the smallest possible portion of the statute excising only the viewpoint based proviso rather than the entire exception of which it is a part Id at 773 Dissenting in part Judge Jacobs agreed with the majority except for its holding that the proviso banning challenges to existing welfare laws effected impermissible viewpoint based discrimination The provision in his view was permissible because it merely defined the scope of services to be funded Id at 773 778 opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part LSC filed a petition for certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals conclusion that the 504 a 16 suits for benefits proviso was unconstitutional We granted certiorari 529 U S 1052 2000 II The United States and LSC rely on Rust v Sullivan 500 U S 173 1991 as support for the LSC program restrictions In Rust Congress established program clinics to provide subsidies for doctors to advise patients on a variety of family planning topics Congress did not consider abortion to be within its family planning objectives how 6 LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION v VELAZQUEZ ever and it forbade doctors employed by the program from discussing abortion with their patients Id at 179 180 Recipients of funds under Title X of the Public Health Service Act 1002 1008 as added 84 Stat 1506 42 U S C 1508 300a 300a 6 challenged the Act s restriction that provided that none of the Title X funds appropriated for family planning services could be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning 300a 6 The recipients argued that the regulations constituted impermissible viewpoint discrimination favoring an antiabortion position over a proabortion approach in the sphere of family planning 500 U S at 192 They asserted as well that Congress had imposed an unconstitutional condition on recipients of federal funds by requiring them to relinquish their right to engage in abortion advocacy and counseling in exchange for the subsidy Id at 196 We upheld the law reasoning that Congress had not discriminated against viewpoints on abortion but had merely chosen to fund one activity to the exclusion of the other Id at 193 The restrictions were considered necessary to ensure that the limits of the federal program were observed Ibid Title X did not single out a particular idea for suppression because it was dangerous or disfavored rather Congress prohibited Title X doctors from counseling that was outside the scope of the project Id at 194 195 The Court in Rust did not place explicit reliance on the rationale that the counseling activities of the doctors under Title X amounted to governmental speech when interpreting the holding in later cases however we have explained Rust on this understanding We have said that viewpoint based funding decisions can be sustained in instances in which the government is itself the speaker see Board of Regents of Univ of Wis System v Southworth 529 U S 217 229 235 2000 or instances like Rust in Opinion of the Court which the government used private speakers to transmit information pertaining to its own program Rosenberger v Rector Visitors of Univ of Va 515 U S 819 833 1995 As we said in Rosenberger w hen the government disburses public funds to private entities to convey a governmental message it may take legitimate and appropriate steps to ensure that its message is neither garbled nor distorted by the grantee Ibid The latitude which may exist for restrictions on speech where the govern ment s own message is being delivered flows in part from our observation that w hen the government speaks for instance to promote its own policies or to advance a particular idea it is in the end accountable to the electorate and the political process for its advocacy If the citizenry objects newly elected officials later could espouse some different or contrary position Board of Regents of Univ of Wis System v Southworth supra at 235 Neither the latitude for government speech nor its rationale applies to subsidies for private speech in every instance however As we have pointed out i t does not follow that viewpoint based restrictions are proper when the government does not itself speak or subsidize transmittal of a message it favors but instead expends funds to encourage a diversity of views from private speakers Rosenberger supra at 834 Although the LSC program differs from the program at issue in Rosenberger in that its purpose is not to encourage a diversity of views the salient point is that like the program in Rosenberger the LSC program was designed to facilitate private speech not to promote a governmental message Congress funded LSC grantees to provide attorneys to represent the interests of indigent clients In the specific context of 504 a 16 suits for benefits an LSCfunded attorney speaks on the behalf of the client in a claim against the government for welfare benefits The lawyer is not the government s speaker The attorney 8 LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION v VELAZQUEZ defending the decision to deny benefits will deliver the government s message in the litigation The LSC lawyer however speaks on the behalf of his or her private indigent client Cf Polk County v Dodson 454 U S 312 321 322 1981 holding that a public defender does not act under color of state law because he works under canons of professional responsibility that mandate his exercise of independent judgment on behalf of the client and because there is an assumption that counsel will be free of state control The Government has designed this program to use the legal profession and the established Judiciary of the States and the Federal Government to accomplish its end of assisting welfare claimants in determination or receipt of their benefits The advice from the attorney to the client and the advocacy by the attorney to the courts cannot be classified as governmental speech even under a generous understanding of the concept In this vital respect this suit is distinguishable from Rust The private nature of the speech involved here and the extent of LSC s regulation of private expression are indicated further by the circumstance that the Government seeks to use an existing medium of expression and to control it in a class of cases in ways which distort its usual functioning Where the government uses or attempts to regulate a particular medium we have been informed by its accepted usage in determining whether a particular restriction on speech is necessary for the pro gram s purposes and limitations In FCC v League of Women Voters of Cal 468 U S 364 1984 the Court was instructed by its understanding of the dynamics of the broadcast industry in holding that prohibitions against editorializing by public radio networks were an impermissible restriction even though the Government enacted the restriction to control the use of public funds The First Amendment forbade the Government from using the Opinion of the Court forum in an unconventional way to suppress speech inherent in the nature of the medium See id at 396 397 In Arkansas Ed Television Comm n v Forbes 523 U S 666 676 1998 the dynamics of the broadcasting system gave station programmers the right to use editorial judgment to exclude certain speech so that the broadcast message could be more effective And in Rosenberger the fact that student newspapers expressed many different points of view was an important foundation for the Court s decision to invalidate viewpoint based restrictions 515 U S at 836 When the government creates a limited forum for speech certain restrictions may be necessary to define the limits and purposes of the program Perry Ed Assn v Perry Local Educator s Assn 460 U S 37 1983 see also Lamb s Chapel v Center Moriches Union Free School Dist 508 U S 384 1993 The same is true when the government establishes a subsidy for specified ends Rust v Sullivan 500 U S 173 1991 As this suit involves a subsidy limited forum cases such as Perry Lamb s Chapel and Rosenberger may not be controlling in a strict sense yet they do provide some instruction Here the program presumes that private nongovernmental speech is necessary and a substantial restriction is placed upon that speech At oral argument and in its briefs the LSC advised us that lawyers funded in the Government program may not undertake representation in suits for benefits if they must advise clients respecting the questionable validity of a statute which defines benefit eligibility and the payment structure The limitation forecloses advice or legal assistance to question the validity of statutes under the Constitution of the United States It extends further it must be noted so that state statutes inconsistent with federal law under the Supremacy Clause may be neither challenged nor questioned By providing subsidies to LSC the Government seeks to 10 LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION v VELAZQUEZ facilitate suits for benefits by using the State and Federal courts and the independent bar on which those courts depend for the proper performance of their duties and responsibilities Restricting LSC attorneys in advising their clients and in presenting arguments and analyses to the courts distorts the legal system by altering the traditional role of the attorneys in much the same way broadcast systems or student publication networks were changed in the limited forum cases we have cited Just as government in those cases could not elect to use a broadcasting network or a college publication structure in a regime which prohibits speech necessary to the proper functioning of those systems see Arkansas Ed Television Comm n supra and Rosenberger supra it may not design a subsidy to effect this serious and fundamental restriction on advocacy of attorneys and the functioning of the judiciary LSC has advised us furthermore that upon determining a question of statutory validity is present in any anticipated or pending case or controversy the LSC funded attorney must cease the representation at once This is true whether the validity issue becomes apparent during initial attorney client consultations or in the midst of litigation proceedings A disturbing example of the restriction was discussed during oral argument before the Court It is well understood that when there are two reasonable constructions for a statute yet one raises a constitutional question the Court should prefer the interpretation which avoids the constitutional issue Gomez v United States 490 U S 858 864 1989 Ashwander v TVA 297 U S 288 346 348 1936 Brandeis J concurring Yet as the LSC advised the Court if during litigation a judge were to ask an LSC attorney whether there was a constitutional concern the LSC attorney simply could not answer Tr of Oral Arg 8 9 Interpretation of the law and the Constitution is the primary mission of the judiciary when it acts within the sphere of its authority to resolve a case or controversy Marbury v Madison 1 Cranch 137 177 1803 It is emphatically the province and the duty of the judicial department to say what the law is An informed independent judiciary presumes an informed independent bar Under 504 a 16 however cases would be presented by LSC attorneys who could not advise the courts of serious questions of statutory validity The disability is inconsistent with the proposition that attorneys should present all the reasonable and well grounded arguments necessary for proper resolution of the case By seeking to prohibit the analysis of certain legal issues and to truncate presentation to the courts the enactment under review prohibits speech and expression upon which courts must depend for the proper exercise of the judicial power Congress cannot wrest the law from the Constitution which is its source Those then who controvert the principle that the constitution is to be considered in court as a paramount law are reduced to the necessity of maintaining that courts must close their eyes on the constitution and see only the law Id at 178 The restriction imposed by the statute here threatens severe impairment of the judicial function Section 504 a 16 sifts out cases presenting constitutional challenges in order to insulate the Government s laws from judicial inquiry If the restriction on speech and legal advice were to stand the result would be two tiers of cases In cases where LSC counsel were attorneys of record there would be lingering doubt whether the truncated representation had resulted in complete analysis of the case full advice to the client and proper presentation to the court The courts and the public would come to question the adequacy and fairness of professional representations when the attorney either consciously to comply with this statute or unconsciously to continue the repre LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION v VELAZQUEZ Opinion of the Court sentation despite the statute avoided all reference to questions of statutory validity and constitutional authority A scheme so inconsistent with accepted separation of powers principles is an insufficient basis to sustain or uphold the restriction on speech It is no answer to say the restriction on speech is harmless because under LSC s interpretation of the Act its attorneys can withdraw This misses the point The statute is an attempt to draw lines around the LSC program to exclude from litigation those arguments and theories Congress finds unacceptable but which by their nature are within the province of the courts to consider The restriction on speech is even more problematic because in cases where the attorney withdraws from a representation the client is unlikely to find other counsel The explicit premise for providing LSC attorneys is the necessity to make available representation to persons financially unable to afford legal assistance 42 U S C 2996 a 3 There often will be no alternative source for the client to receive vital information respecting constitutional and statutory rights bearing upon claimed benefits Thus with respect to the litigation services Congress has funded there is no alternative channel for expression of the advocacy Congress seeks to restrict This is in stark contrast to Rust There a patient could receive the approved Title X family planning counseling funded by the Government and later could consult an affiliate or independent organization to receive abortion counseling Unlike indigent clients who seek LSC representation the patient in Rust was not required to forfeit the Govern ment funded advice when she also received abortion counseling through alternative channels Because LSC attorneys must withdraw whenever a question of a welfare statute s validity arises an individual could not obtain joint representation so that the constitutional challenge would be presented by a non LSC attorney and other 504 a 16 is necessary to define the scope and contours of the federal program a condition that ensures funds can be spent for those cases most immediate to congressional concern In support of this contention they suggest the challenged limitation takes into account the nature of the grantees activities and provides limited congressional funds for the provision of simple suits for benefits In petitioners view the restriction operates neither to maintain the current welfare system nor insulate it from attack rather it helps the current welfare system function in a more efficient and fair manner by removing from the program complex challenges to existing welfare laws The effect of the restriction however is to prohibit advice or argumentation that existing welfare laws are unconstitutional or unlawful Congress cannot recast a condition on funding as a mere definition of its program in every case lest the First Amendment be reduced to a simple semantic exercise Here notwithstanding Congress purpose to confine and limit its program the restriction operates to insulate current welfare laws from constitutional scrutiny and certain other legal challenges a condition implicating central First Amendment concerns In no lawsuit funded by the Government can the LSC attorney speaking on behalf of a private client challenge existing welfare laws As a result arguments by indigent clients that a welfare statute is unlawful or unconstitutional cannot be expressed in this Government funded program for petitioning the courts even though the program was created for litigation involving welfare benefits and even though the ordinary course of litigation involves the expression of theories and postulates on both or multiple sides of an issue It is fundamental that the First Amendment was fashioned to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the 14 LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION v VELAZQUEZ bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people New York Times Co v Sullivan 376 U S 254 269 1964 quoting Roth v United States 354 U S 476 484 1957 There can be little doubt that the LSC Act funds constitutionally protected expression and in the context of this statute there is no programmatic message of the kind recognized in Rust and which sufficed there to allow the Government to specify the advice deemed necessary for its legitimate objectives This serves to distinguish 504 a 16 from any of the Title X program restrictions upheld in Rust and to place it beyond any congressional funding condition approved in the past by this Court Congress was not required to fund an LSC attorney to represent indigent clients and when it did so it was not required to fund the whole range of legal representations or relationships The LSC and the United States however in effect ask us to permit Congress to define the scope of the litigation it funds to exclude certain vital theories and ideas The attempted restriction is designed to insulate the Government s interpretation of the Constitution from judicial challenge The Constitution does not permit the Government to confine litigants and their attorneys in this manner We must be vigilant when Congress imposes rules and conditions which in effect insulate its own laws from legitimate judicial challenge Where private speech is involved even Congress antecedent funding decision cannot be aimed at the suppression of ideas thought inimical to the Government s own interest Regan v Taxation With Representation of Wash 461 U S 540 548 1983 Speiser v Randall 357 U S 513 519 1958 For the reasons we have set forth the funding condition is invalid The Court of Appeals considered whether the language restricting LSC attorneys could be severed from the statute so that the remaining portions would remain operative It reached the reasoned conclusion to invali Opinion of the Court date the fragment of 504 a 16 found contrary to the First Amendment leaving the balance of the statute operative and in place That determination was not discussed in the briefs of either party or otherwise contested here and in the exercise of our discretion and prudential judgment we decline to address it The judgment of the Court of Appeals is Affirmed
