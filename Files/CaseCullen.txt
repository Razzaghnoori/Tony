                     OK         Umm go ahead and tell me about a story                     Well I can remember as a small child probably between the ages of three and seven going to Asheville and visiting my grandmother umm and my grandfather but he died when I was fairly young so I mostly remember visiting my grandmother         She lived in a small house in Asheville         Uh it was pretty much a kitchen a front room and twobedroom house one bathroom         The uh neighborhood she lived in was very uh quiet mostly older people and uh we used to go around the neighborhood and visit a lot of her old friends         Um one couple in particular the Blankenships had a apple tree in their back yard and we would go and we would pick apples and take them back to her place and make apple pies         The Blankenships were kind of an odd couple in that uh both of them chewed tobacco and spit into little spittoons         Uh its kind of weird talking to an elderly couple spitting tobacco especially because one of them was female and you always had that impression that chewing tobacco was a guy thing         Uh         strange little memories like that about my grandmothers house         She had a washing machine but not not a dryer so all the laundry get got put hung out on the clothesline         Uh she had a big garage that was separate from the house and almost bigger than the house it was almost like it was a barn         And a bunch of my grandfathers old tools were in there odd things like like scythes and things that you would find only on a farm even though the house itself was not on farmland         Uh my grandmother had a  Nova which a most people would consider to be a muscle car but uh she only drove it maybe two to three miles at the most and it usually took the whole day to plan what would happen if she were to need to drive somewhere so this car had very little mileage on it even though it was at that point about  years old         Uh we used to sit on her back porch and uh snap uh beans or what they called doing snap beans uh which was really just taking green beans and snapping them into smaller pieces         Uh I suppose it had some kind of great significance         My sisters seemed to get a good kick out of it         Uh we used to walk up to the local grocery store uh which was about three or four blocks away         There was also a candy store about three or four blocks in the other direction called Puds that we used to walk up to and across the street from Puds was the local fire department and the uh the firemen used to let us play on the fire engines which is completely unheard of nowadays but they let us you know climb all over them get inside and honk the horns you know put on fire jacket and boots or whatever we wanted to do and uh I guess there just werent a lot of fires in Asheville in that part of town because they never seemed to be concerned that we would be interfering with their preparedness         Um         I dont know those are the the sort of stick out in my mind about visiting Asheville         Um we always tended to stop somewhere scenic either going to or coming from         We went to Chimney Rock on a number of occasions         We went to Linville Caverns once and we went to Sliding Rock and Biltmore House and some of the other attractions that are up that way in the western part of the state         Uh I think we even went to Tweetsie Railroad a couple of times so uh you know the sort of just wholesome down home kind of memories         about visiting my grandmother before she got uh unable to take care of herself and she ended up moving in with us         You know but theyre rather pleasant memories of childhood and I certainly wouldnt trade them for anything                     Is there anything specific that uh you remember about your grandma                     Mm                     A specific story that she used to tell or                     Not any stories that she used to tell         Um she was always a very active person         Um she used to she used to walk every day         Um she had grown up on the farm         She had uh I believe she had  kids in her family         And uh they were all very active very strong people and even though my grandmother was a tiny little woman she was about  uh she was pretty strong for her size and rugged and sturdy and that uh even carried over into her later years when mentally she wasnt all there but physically she was still extremely healthy and it was uh kind of a strange kind of position to be in         Um I guess the thing I remember most about my grandmothers personality is that she was extremely frugal         She would save everything         One thing in particular she used to save would be soup labels         I guess there was one particular program where you would returned so many soup labels and they gave you a rebate or something on collecting aluminum cans         And uh she had just cartons and cartons of soup labels that she had saved over the years and redeem them you know I dont know         five cents a bushel so she was very practical in that regard         Um she always kept all her bills and expenses at an absolute minimum ran everything very efficiently kept an extremely tidy house uh                     Is there anything your parents ever told you about her stories that they ever did like when they were kids         Um I guess when your father was a kid                     Um not too many stories about my dads childhood         He spent most of his time with my grandfather learning things like how to work on cars and how to build things paint things and that translates over cause my dad does just about everything he can fix about anything and build just about anything and repair just about anything         Um I guess the only story that they ever say a lot about my grandmother was the fact that she did not like my mom when uh my father and she first got together         And uh mostly because my dad my dads side of the family were Southern Baptists from the mountains of North Carolina my mom was a Catholic from California which oh just scared everybody right there         So before she even had the opportunity to meet my mom she had already decided that she was this this evil heathen creature that was going to corrupt her beautiful boy um and even wrote her a nasty letter to that effect         Um she pretty much showed a lot of disinterest at best and and outright hostility at worst towards my mom until we the kids came along         Um once uh she had grandchildren my grandmother was all smiles to everybody which I think was kind of amusing         Um I guess at that point she figured it was too late so she might as well make the best of the situation                     Anything else                     Um not that I can really think of off the top of my head                     What about when your grandma moved into the house with you were there any stories about her once she moved into the house         Anything you remember                     Um not really anything unusual         Um she uh at that point things were she wasnt in the best of health so there werent really any any unusual anecdotes that werent immediately or at least tangentially related to her health and the decline of her health so no no interesting anecdotes about her personality or really or really anything that I could talk about at that point                     OK         Well thank you very much                     Youre welcome
