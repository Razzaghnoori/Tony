 Bill Bombs Bill Clinton s public vivisection continues as the commentariat tears into his Iraq policy with both hands Paul Gigot PBS s NewsHour With Jim Lehrer notes that congressional support waned after the president made his case as Capitol Hill realized that the administration s ends and means don t coincide Congress smells a president who doesn t believe in his own policy adds Gigot Contain Saddam is not a ringing bumper sticker scoffs Steve Roberts CNN s Late Edition Just as there was no consensus on how to pronounce Kofi Annan s name there was no consensus on how to regard the U N secretary general s 11 th hour diplomatic mission The commentariat did their gabbing before Annan delivered his deal A sunny George Stephanopoulos ABC s This Week With Sam and Cokie announces I guess

that if the White House wants to hand the reins of U S foreign policy to Annan then we ought to anoint him secretary of state Kate O Beirne CNN s Capital Gang and Pat Buchanan The McLaughlin Group
