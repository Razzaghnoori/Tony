 A civil jury found O J Simpson liable in the wrongful death and battery related charges brought against him by the Goldman and Brown families The unanimous verdict was less surprising than the whopping 8 5 million in compensatory damages the jury ordered Simpson to pay Goldman s parents Whereas the cynical view of the criminal trial was that a black jury ignored its instructions by acquitting Simpson in order to sock it to the Los Angeles police the cynical view of the civil trial is that a white jury ignored its instructions by inflating the compensatory damage figure in order to sock it to Simpson Reporters however scrupulously pointed out that a civil trial only requires proof by a preponderance of evidence rather than proof beyond a reasonable doubt But people who have always believed Simpson guilty took the civil verdict as vindication of that belief The spin on the trial is that O J did himself in by contradicting photographic evidence and other witnesses

enough 2 5 President Clinton delivered his State of the Union address Pundits found it long on grand exhortations but short on government action confirming Clinton s rightward drift The New York Times

the two Simpson verdicts would overwhelm Clinton s noble words to the contrary 2 5 Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter announced that they will merge The combined entity with more than 20 billion in equity

Association winter meeting Several Republican governors supported restoration of aid to legal immigrants which was cut in the new welfare law Republican congressional leaders reportedly hit the roof over the governors defection and under that pressure they fudged their stand somewhat But a similar fuss is expected over a cap on Medicaid which Clinton and Congress are considering As with welfare

Jedi Critics are bubbling with nostalgia for the film s nostalgia The fairy tale version of the Star Wars legacy promulgated in most of this week s retrospectives reviews is that it reacquainted
