 My Panel Discussion With Andre Who is Wallace Shawn exactly He s been around for years yet it s still hard to know In arty circles he s famous as the highbrow exhibitionist who wrote and starred in My Dinner With Andre but there s more to Shawn than grandiose nerd angst Millions of small children around the country could pick him out in a lineup They d know him as the dotty character actor from mass appeal films like The Princess Bride and Clueless a guy who unlike the earnest playwright Shawn appears to have stopped taking anything in life seriously least of all himself On the contrary he hams up his resemblance to a clown and wheezes for laughs and presumably a paycheck Shawn doesn t appear in this film based on his latest play but his schizoid spirit haunts it all the same The Designated Mourner is one of those sobering allegories set in the not so distant future in a country not unlike our own The actors deliver lots of brooding speeches and the plot is a downer On the other hand the star is Mike Nichols in his first ever film appearance and with a sneering comic timing that has somehow improved in the 30 odd years since he stopped performing with Elaine May Nichols plays Jack a shrewd middle aged pragmatist Years ago in college Jack impulsively married smart but prissy Judy Miranda Richardson unaware that by doing so he was entering a stifling ivory tower At the time Judy s father Howard David de Keyser was one of the country s leading intellectuals He was a great man but also a jerk he surrounded himself with suck ups and expected his daughter to wait on him hand and foot For a while Jack admired Howard s strong convictions and his ability apparently rare in this bleak hypothetical future to understand the poetry of John Donne But one day Jack admitted to himself that he didn t give a damn about art or poetry that Howard got on his nerves and that anyway he d fallen out of love with Judy Relieved he left her and her clique behind Director David Hare has preserved the no frills setup of the stage production he oversaw in London It makes sense that the London production was more successful than the American one and that the director and two of these three actors in the film are English Since when in America have we really obsessed over the fate of intellectuals The play unfolds in monologues with Jack making a witty case for his desertion of Judy then Judy speaking then Howard then back to Jack and so on the three of them sit at a long table and talk into the camera occasionally pouring themselves glasses of water as panelists at a conference do The drama comes from the way Shawn craftily shifts your sympathy back and forth among characters Just when Jack has you convinced that Judy is a pretentious albatross Richardson s very British clucking tongue routine helps here Judy s stock rises as she stoically describes how the intolerant new government had begun to crack down on her and her father Then slowly it becomes clear that the government is going to do worse than harass the intellectuals And you realize or you re supposed to realize that however arrogant and annoying you find Judy and Howard some bottom line human decency will be violated if they are harmed The writing is ostentatiously literary and I expect that although a hard core band of fans will praise The Designated Mourner for condemning the vulgarian times we live in a larger group will think it s just more intolerable hooey from that highbrow exhibitionist It s actually better than hooey but it s also a hopelessly conflicted piece of work The whole conception of the intellectual life feels dated The film is set in the future but its grasp of male female relations harks back to the 1950s or earlier Judy starts off as a virgin then becomes a servant to be traded back and forth by the men Later when Jack casts off the brainy lifestyle he becomes a porn addict In the Shawnian scheme of things being or not being an intellectual would appear to be an issue only for men as if the only thing that kept them from humping everything like craven dogs was a fondness for sonnets Then there s the problem of what s killing the intellectuals off They are themselves partly to blame because they re such insular snobs But the big villain is a power mad government whose only agenda seems to be hunting down and killing smart people Shawn has been vocal about his belief that theater should be more political but this government of philistine meanies seems more like a cheap device designed to give his play some tension All he s really telling us is Beware of people with bad taste Besides being anachronisms the intellectuals are underwritten and deliberately unattractive It s Jack who hogs all the energy as if Shawn the highbrow sketched out a play and Shawn the clown took over the writing And Nichols who specializes in 100 proof irony is the clown s ideal front man With his flushed and blotchy skin his narrow feminine nose his gap toothed grin and his eyebrows that rise to meet each other like sides of a triangle Nichols looks like a scary blend of Hugh Hefner and Alfred E Neumann He s charismatic and monstrous In what must be one of the greatest nasal performances of all time he rasps and chuckles and seduces us into thinking that he s a detached but basically trustworthy guy our friendly narrator Then out of the blue he calls Judy a stupid bitch and we realize he s missing a soul And yet before he turns completely sour Jack makes a pretty unbeatable case for leaving the cloister Once he gets away from Howard and Judy and their over serious isolated friends he discovers a kind of peace He realizes how noisy and restless his mind has always been an endless tinkling of reportage and commentary He sees how he s always trying to squeeze everything into concepts this is Beautiful that isn t instead of taking in life as it is He experiences silence for the first time and finds out that it s all right Sounds a little like Buddhism But still the segment of the movie in which Jack begins testing what it would be like to live in the present is funny and original Up to this point the audience has been watching with the spaced out slightly bored respect one feels when confronted by a medieval Flemish altar piece But when Jack starts making fun of all the irrelevant thoughts that clog his brain I like poetry I like Rembrandt murmur murmur murmur murmur we wake up recognizing the sound of our own inner babble For a moment Shawn climbs off his high horse and the movie breathes Then the moment passes and it becomes clear that all he wants to do is wag his finger at the know nothings The last intellectuals die off and Jack heads directly for the gutter Toward the end Shawn has him place a volume of John Donne in the bathtub and pee and shit on it We re supposed to mourn for Howard for Judy for Jack s soul and even for poor harmless John Donne But it s tempting to say good riddance Jack Mike Nichols
