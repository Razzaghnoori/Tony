 During development cells need to communicate with each other to establish properly organised and functional tissues Cells communicate with each other in various ways such as by secreting and receiving diffusible molecules morphogens hormones and neurotransmitters or by establishing intercellular connections gap junctions and cell protrusions to allow a direct exchange of instructive factors A recent paper has shown that communication via tiny cell protrusions might be a more common mechanism than previously expected Rustom et al 2004 Many different types of cell extensions have been described in a variety of developmental processes and organisms Miller et al 1995 Bryant 1999 Chou and Chien 2002 Rorth 2003 and for most of them a role in cell to cell communication has been hypothesized For example in the mouse Salas Vidal and Lomeli 2004 have described long processes filopodia that connect tissues in early embryos Because these protrusions contain receptors for some well known signalling molecules it is thought that they might be responsible for receiving signals from neighbouring cells Similarly it has been proposed in the development of the Drosophila wing and eye imaginal discs precursors of adult structures that signals modulating the growth and patterning of one epithelial layer of cells are received through microtubule based cell extensions arising from the apposing epithelium Cho et al 2000 Gibson and Schubiger 2000 Furthermore in the wing imaginal disc planar extensions called cytonemes arise from the periphery of the epithelium and grow towards a central area in the wing disc that produces the signalling molecule Decapentaplegic This directionality of growth and the observation of vesicles inside cytonemes led Ramirez Weber and Kornberg 1999 to propose that cells meant to receive a signal were searching actively for it extending long cell protrusions towards the region from which signals were emanating Although cell protrusions have been described in different developmental processes tissues and organisms their potential role in cell signalling has been difficult to pin down Most cell processes are very fragile and their study is mainly limited to live tissues in these conditions it is technically challenging to define how the signalling is mediated via protrusions Possibly it could occur through the release of free molecules in a similar manner to synaptic neurotransmission or shedding of vesicles as exosomes followed by endocytosis by the recipient cell Alternatively membranetethered ligands such as Delta on the protrusion could bind and activate receptors displayed on the surface of the receiving cell De Joussineau et al 2003 The paper by Rustom and colleagues has provided a new outlook on the role of cell protrusions by reporting a novel mechanism employed to transmit signals between cells connected by a protrusion Surprisingly they did not observe any of the mechanisms described above Rather transfer of molecules and organelles occurred directly from the cytoplasm of one cell to the other passing through a protrusion that established membrane continuity between the connected cells Using rat PC12 cells Rustom and colleagues observed ultrafine protrusions with a diameter of only 50 200 nm and a length spanning several cell diameters connecting sparse cells in culture Figure 1 Similar to other cell protrusions these structures termed tunnelling nanotubes TNTs displayed a pronounced sensitivity to both mechanical stress and chemical fixation and even to prolonged light excitation resulting in the rupture of many of them TNTs are actin based and devoid of microtubules interestingly most other types of cell protrusions also contain actin Condeelis 1993 Rorth 2003 The researchers also confirmed the existence of TNTs in a human cell line human embryonic kidney cells and rat primary cells normal rat kidney cells suggesting that TNTs are not a peculiarity of PC12 cells Aiming to investigate how TNTs were linking cells the authors performed scanning and transmission electron microscopy of TNTs They observed a seamless transition between TNTs and the cells they were connected to suggesting that indeed there was continuity between the membranes of the two connected cells Rustom and colleagues then went on to test whether TNTs could be used to transmit signals between cells The experimental approach used was to mark two populations of cells in a distinct way either by introducing genes that encoded proteins tagged with green fluorescent proteins or by using dyes The two different cell populations were then mixed cocultured and analysed for transfer of marked proteins or dye stained organelles from one cell to another between cells that were differently marked and connected by a TNT Strikingly soluble cytoplasmic molecules could not pass freely along the TNTs with actin tagged with green fluorescent protein being the only exception whereas membrane bound proteins were transferred along TNTs and detected in the receiving cells further supporting the likelihood of membrane continuity between connected cells Rustom and colleagues also observed transport of vesicles which seemed to be unidirectional Finally in transfer experiments performed at close to 0 C where endo exo and phagocytosis would be blocked vesicle exchange still occurred suggesting that these events are not required for vesicle transfer and further supporting the idea that membrane continuity exists between connected cells By contrast interfering with actin polymerization using the drug latrunculin B led to protrusion removal and arrest in organelle transfer indicating that actin is required both for protrusion biogenesis and organelle transport Taken together the experiments performed by Rustom and colleagues strongly suggest a role for cell protrusions in cell to cell communication They also provide evidence in culture for a novel mechanism used by cell protrusions to transport molecules and organelles It will be interesting to test whether TNTs also exist in living tissues and if so what molecules they transport TNTs could be distinct from the protrusions known so far and could be responsible for establishing another type of connection between cells They could connect all cells in a tissue directly or indirectly establishing a global interaction network potentially important in exchanging basic survival information as well as positional cues Milan et al 2001 Another interesting question is how connections such as TNTs are established Rustom et al have shown that initially many filopodial extensions arise from one cell and are directed toward a neighbour As soon as one of them reaches the target it is stabilised while the others degenerate It is possible that membrane fusion occurs between the tip of the protrusion and the planar plasma membrane of the target cell However membrane fusion can be more easily achieved if the tips of two cell protrusions fuse with each other thus suggesting the participation in the process of membrane fusion of microvilli or other tiny protrusions belonging to the target cell Fusion between two protrusions is reported to rely on the cylindrical shape and narrow diameter of cell protrusions and also on the localised concentration of adhesion fusion molecules at the tips of the cell protrusions such as microvilli that display particular tip specific membrane microdomains Monck and Fernandez 1996 Wilson and Snell 1998 Roper et al 2000 The work performed by Rustom and colleagues suggests that cell protrusions are a general mechanism for cell to cell communication and that information exchange is occurring through the direct membrane continuity of connected cells independently of exo and endocytosis It is important to determine whether events similar to these seen in cell culture are occurring in tissues and what functions cell protrusions perform during tissue morphogenesis In my work as a graduate student I am trying to address this question We need to identify the types of cell protrusions that are present in tissues and the molecular complexes localizing on them as well as their functions To then prove that cell protrusions are important in cell to cell communication in tissues we would need to remove the protrusions and see how this affects tissue architecture and function However the necessary tools are still missing given the lack of knowledge of the specific molecules important for the biogenesis of these protrusions Thus far the function of cell protrusions has been hypothesized mainly on the basis of their location in tissues and on crude attempts to remove them for example by altering the actin cytoskeleton or even by removing the entire epithelium they belong to The paper by Rustom et al has shed some new light on these still mysterious cellular arms and has further boosted my interest in this emerging field of cell and developmental biology
