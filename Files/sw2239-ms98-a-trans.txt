 hi Chris this is Carol hi this is interesting uh question come up here uh proposal for people to young people to spend a year or two in the Peace Corps um or something like that doing public service i or doing or doing public service suppose the idea is to um i don t know but but the point be to that get well in order to go in order to join the Peace Corps you have to have a college degree and so that eliminates a lot of people from that and doing public service how are they supposed to support themselves it sure does yeah i i i suppose the idea the idea would be to get um people interested in public service and to um i don t know maybe people give give people give young people an appreciation for maybe what they have and what other people don t have well yeah i think that s a good idea although i don t i think if it s something that s forced on you um um i think that the attitude is not going to be quite the same well i tend to agree and um uh in that we do live in the United States and i think one of our uh one of the things that our country is based on is freedom of choice yeah um forcing someone to give up a couple years of their life uh doing something that may not be or the timing that they want to do it or uh perhaps even you know maybe they would have something something else just just the idea of forcing someone to do something i i m pretty much against that yeah from what i ve read most people in the United States do do some type of volunteer work at some time in their lives just on their own um hum but i right but i agree it has to be at their choice and it needs to be a time when they re ready to do it um i don t think you can just snatch somebody away from you know you don t know what their circumstances are or what s going on in their life you can t just snatch them away and make them go do something they don t want to do that s right sort of like the draft i think there would be an awful lot of resentment and um i i really don t think it would be feasible on our country then that raises a question of how you know are you going to pay them or are you going to provide them with you know place to live and food to eat and whether they have a family you know that s right yeah some young people do some young people start families young and or maybe are responsible for their parents yeah that s true that s true brothers and sisters things like that i suppose they may have exceptions but um i guess it all it would all boil down to i mainly i i guess my question would be what what s the purpose what s what s trying to be accomplished by by that proposal i m not sure i m not sure if it s a way to cut down government expenses or it s like you said that s something more you know to to make people aware um hum more esoteric yeah what s going on and what needs to be done but i really do think that the population that people are pretty well aware i think more so now than ever before you know i think that s true and i i tend to think that our children are also growing up with a bit more awareness of that at least i mean i i feel i try to as an individual my children are very young but yeah um i i think they re being taught a lot maybe to be more responsible um hum and um hopefully to understand that everyone is not as in as fortunate yeah as as perhaps they are yeah yeah and i think that that s the trend now i think that s the trend now and i think people are a lot more willing to give of their time pardon me and help out you know its also seems to me if someone does it on a volunteer basis then they will probably put a lot more into it than if they were forced um yeah and get and get more out of it that s right so i think we or sounds like we pretty much agree yeah it s an interesting idea but i think we do agree and at least i m i m i don t think i would vote for it if it came down to that no i don t think i would either maybe just do our best to to do our own fair share and do what you can when you can right then as long as you feel good about yourself and what you re doing to help i think that s more important than that s right well it s been nice talking to you about it i have to admit it s something i hadn t thought of before it it is interesting to think about it nice talking yeah really well it does kind of catch you by surprise yes okay well thanks okay we ll talk to you later bye bye bye bye
