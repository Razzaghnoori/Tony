 Background Antibody directed enzyme prodrug therapy ADEPT 1 2 3 4 5 is one of the promising new approaches that selectively target tumor cells thus reducing toxic side effects to patients In this approach an enzyme is conjugated to a tumor specific antibody The antibody selectively localizes the enzyme to the tumor cell surface Subsequent administration of a prodrug substrate of the enzyme leads to the enzyme catalyzed release of the free drug at the tumor site This strategy addresses the stoichiometry controlled drug release and poor antibody penetration problems associated with the use of monoclonal antibody drug conjugates 6 7 8 In addition because the process of drug release is enzymatic a single enzyme can generate a large amount of free drug Consequently a small amount of antibody can be used to reduce immunogenicity It is important that the free drug in the ADEPT approach be highly toxic Using highly toxic agents can reduce the amount of the monoclonal antibody required thereby reducing side effects CC 1065 Figure 1 is among the most potent antitumor agents discovered 9 10 11 12 13 It binds to double stranded B DNA within the minor groove with a sequence preference for 5 d A GNTTA 3 and 5 d AAAAA 3 and alkylates the N3 position of the 3 adenine with its left hand CPI segment 14 15 CC 1065 also inhibits gene transcription by interfering with binding of the TATA box binding protein to its target DNA 16 Despite its high potency and broad spectrum of antitumor activity CC 1065 cannot be used in humans because it causes delayed death in experimental animals 17 To pursue compounds possessing the potent antitumor activity but devoid of the toxic side effects of the parent compound many CC 1065 analogues have been synthesized 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 Beta lactamases have been widely investigated for their role in the metabolism of antibiotics including cephalosporins and penicillins Because of the high catalytic efficiency and broad substrate specificity lactamases have been extensively used in the ADEPT approach to activate prodrugs of vinca alkaloids 27 nitrogen mustard 28 29 30 31 32 doxorubicin 33 34 35 36 and others 37 To take advantage of the potent antitumor activity of the CC 1065 class of compounds and the ADEPT approach we have synthesized lactam prodrugs Herein we report synthesis and preliminary cytotoxic effects of a prodrug comprised of a cephalosporin and a CC 1065 analogue Figure 1 Prodrug 2 is expected to be less toxic than its corresponding free drug 1 However it is expected that the prodrug will be converted to the potent free drug by lactamases localized on the tumor cell surface by an antibody Figure 2 This selective activation of prodrug 2 at the tumor site will lead to enhanced antitumor therapeutic efficacy Results and discussion Prodrug 2 was synthesized as shown in Figure 3 The key intermediate 7 was made using methods developed by Jungheim et al 33 and Rodrigues et al 35 36 with modifications The spectra data including NMR and MS of compounds 4 7 were identical to those as reported Compound 1 was treated with 7 in DMF to afford the protected prodrug 8 Removal of the t butyl protection group from 8 generated the targeted prodrug 2 with good yield The cytotoxicity of prodrug 2 and its corresponding free drug 1 was tested against U937 leukemia cells and the results are presented in Table 1 When the drugs were incubated with U937 cells for a period of 48 h prodrug 2 IC 50 0 9 nM is 10 fold less toxic than its corresponding free drug 1 IC 50 0 09 nM As observed for other compounds of the CC 1065 class 25 37 38 both prodrug 2 and the free drug 1 caused DNA fragmentation and the cells died by apoptosis data not shown Conclusion This is the first report demonstrating synthesis of a prodrug comprised of a cephalosporin and a CC 1065 analogue The preliminary in vitro studies show the prodrug to be less toxic than the free drug Due to the slow non enzymatic degradation of the cephalosporins in solution 39 the ratio of toxicity of cephalosporin containing prodrugs to their corresponding free drugs is generally not very high However some of the prodrugs are very effective against tumors in mouse models For example a cephalosporin doxorubicin prodrug was 9 fold less toxic than free doxrubicin against tumor cells in vitro but caused tumor regression when tested in tumor xenograft models 40 A cephalosporin vinca alkaloid prodrug was 5 fold less toxic than the free drug against tumor cells in vitro but was highly effective in tumor xenograft models in vivo 41 When taxol was conjugated to a cephalosporin the resulting prodrug was approximately 10 fold less toxic than free taxol against tumor cells in vitro 36 Thus prodrug 2 has the potential to be useful in cancer treatment using the ADEPT approach We will report more biological data in due course Materials and methods Cephalothin sodium 3 2 5 g 5 98 mmol was suspended in
