 Introduction In treating patients with severe sepsis physicians are mainly concerned with biologic physiologic and clinical outcomes Of those patients who survive to hospital discharge little is known regarding their physical functioning ability to conduct activities of daily life such as walking around psychologic functioning mental well being and social functioning communication and relationships with others after sepsis Because quality of life QoL describes or characterizes what the patient has experienced as a result of sepsis care it is a useful and important supplement to traditional physiologic or biologic measures of health status that is assessments of effectiveness need to include wider measures of benefits to patients and particularly those that measure the impact from the patient s point of view A relevant therapeutic benefit may also be in restoring the patient s ability to function on a daily basis to socialize and to be alert In fact a long term focus on QoL in clinical trial evaluations was among the recommendations of a recent sepsis international advisory group 1 This report presents the results of an evaluation of QoL among sepsis survivors done as part of the phase III multicenter KyberSept trial To the best of our knowledge limited information on the effects of sepsis treatment on QoL has been reported 2 3 The report focuses on the effects of antithrombin AT III therapy related to physical mental and social functioning of patients who were randomly assigned to either high dose intravenous treatment with Kybernin P Aventis Behring Marburg Germany a plasma derived AT III concentrate 30 000 IU over 4 days or placebo during up to 90 days of follow up In the trial overall survival tended to favor AT III over placebo after 90 days of follow up although the differences were nominal However the AT III group that did not receive concomitant heparin exhibited a nominally statistically significant survival advantage over placebo at 90 days of follow up The purpose of this investigation was to establish whether these trends also held for the subjective effects of AT III in severe sepsis It concludes that AT III treatment is effective in improving long term patient QoL and that future outcome research studies of severe sepsis should follow up patients throughout their hospital stay and after discharge Method Quality of life instruments There are a number of important conceptual and methodologic issues in assessing QoL in people who are critically ill not least of which is the question of how it should be defined Recent attempts to define QoL have resulted in the development of a functional definition that is measurable evaluable over time and readily applied to patients over a wide range of illness severity Most attempts incorporate the domains of physical psychologic cognitive and social functioning Each of these domains can be measured in two dimensions objective assessments of functioning or health status and more subjective perceptions of general health The patient s subjective experience translates that objective assessment into the actual QoL experienced Thus where the term QoL is used in the present study it refers to a composite of objective functional impairment and subjective perceptions and expectations The instruments chosen for the study were designed to reflect this QoL gives information on what medical care has achieved for the patient but severe sepsis is a difficult area in which to obtain such information Normally QoL data should be obtained directly from the patient Unfortunately patients hospitalized with severe sepsis may be unable to complete a QoL measure or it may be too burdensome Rather than lose information on patients the physician investigator was used as a proxy respondent Two instruments were used to cover the objective and subjective dimensions The objective component in the study was measured using the Karnofsky performance scale The Karnofsky scale emphasizes physical performance and dependency it is a descriptive ordinal scale that ranges from 100 good health to 0 dead Trial investigators assigned percentages based on physical performance Table 1 The Karnofsky scale is designed to assess independent functioning and appears to have substantial validity as an indicator of overall physical status The validity and reliability of the scale have been shown in several populations 4 5 6 The subjective component of the trial was measured with multiple items using a visual analog scale 7 A visual analog scale is a line with defined end points on which investigators indicate a patient s health state Thus the investigator placed a mark along a 100 mm line that best described his or her assessment of the patient with the domain in question There were six domains Table 2 The scales ranged from 0 worst health status to 100 best health status The visual analog scale has been used in several studies of QoL 8 9 10 Reliability estimates for visual analog scaling items range from 0 40 to 0 95 11 and these estimates compare favorably with those for other scales 12 13 The six domains of the first visual analog scale and the Karnofsky score are hereafter referred to as attributes The clinical trial The KyberSept trial was a large international phase III clinical trial that enrolled 2314 patients who were evaluable for efficacy and safety in a randomized double blind placebo controlled design in order to determine the role of high dose AT III in patients with severe sepsis Patients randomly assigned to the AT III group received a total of 30 000 IU plasma derived ATIII Kybernin P administered as a loading dose of 6000 IU given over 30 min followed by a continuous infusion of 6000 IU day for 4 days The study protocol permitted investigators to prescribe unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin for venous thrombosis prophylaxis 10 000 IU day subcutaneous and heparin flushes for vascular catheter potency 2 IU kg body weight per hour intravenous In the trial the all cause mortality rate at 28 days was almost identical between the placebo group and the group that received AT III 38 7 versus 39 9 not significant At the 90 day time point the AT III group had a nominally lower mortality than did the placebo group 46 4 versus 48 5 Among the 680 patients in the trial who did not receive heparin concomitantly there was a statistically significant difference between the AT III and placebo groups In this subgroup mortality at 90 days in the AT III subgroup was 44 9 versus 52 5 in the placebo subgroup P nominal 0 03 A complete description of that study and results are reported elsewhere 14 Outcomes The Karnofsky scale and visual analog scales were both administered by physician investigators when patients enrolled in the trial referred to as baseline during the trial at 28 days 56 days and 90 days after enrollment and at discharge from the hospital if it occurred other than at one of those three intervals For example if a patient survived and was discharged at day60 there would be four assessments i e baseline and days 28 56 and 60 The primary outcome was change in attribute scores until 90 days after patients were assigned to either treatment or placebo For this analysis two patient populations were used The smaller population was the group remaining in the hospital 90 days from baseline the in hospital survivors The larger population comprised all survivors at 90 days or at the time point closest to 90 days This group is labeled the all survivors group It includes the in hospital group In cases in which there was no patient response at 90 days because they had been discharged the data from the last assessment but before 90 days were used This method is equivalent to using the last observation carried forward The last observation carried forward method uses the last observed value for that case and it therefore assumes that the outcome remains constant at the last observed value after discharge Otherwise stated it is assumed that QoL in sepsis patients is stable on average for the short time period between discharge and 90 days It is not possible to conclude firmly that the change in QoL between discharge and 90 days was small and unbiased However the fact that the hospital discharge curve between AT III and placebo was almost identical provides evidence that the comparison between treatment groups should be unbiased Moreover the physician investigator the patient and the family were blinded to the treatment assignment placebo versus AT III throughout the duration of the clinical trial The secondary outcome was change in the attribute scores at 28 56 and 90 days after assignment to treatment or placebo That outcome measure was used in order to compare relative changes between AT III and placebo groups at the 28 day 56 day and 90 day assessments Analysis Patient characteristics Mean standard deviation and range values for age and percentages for relevant patient characteristics at enrollment and administration of heparin are reported The overall trial population is presented as well as the all survivors and the in hospital survivors groups The other variables used were Simplified Acute Physiology Score SAPS II 15 a measure of severity of illness admitting diagnosis and concomitant use of heparin In the SAPS II system a score to risk transformation developed by Le Gall et al 16 for sepsis patients was used The risk intervals were identical to the SAPS II strata defined in the trial Changes in quality of life between baseline and 90 days For both the in hospital survivors and the all survivors groups mean changes and standard deviations between baseline and 90 days are shown Differences in QoL between AT III and placebo were estimated for each attribute Two sample Wilcoxon statistical tests were used to determine whether the changes were different between treatment groups Differences among patient subgroups Similarly Wilcoxon tests were used to identify whether changes in the QoL scores differed for subgroups between baseline and 90 days This analysis was done on the all survivors population Changes in quality of life between baseline and 28 56 and 90 days For the all survivors and in hospital survivors subgroups comparative differences in changes between baseline and 28 56 and 90 days were estimated For each attribute the difference in mean change between treatment groups is presented together with two sided 95 confidence intervals so that the differences between placebo and AT III over time are clearly shown Statistical considerations Nominal P values should be regarded as descriptive because no formal null hypothesis was prespecified and no type I error probability can be indicated No adjustment of P values for multiple testing or multiple confidence intervals was made P values less than or equal to 0 05 were considered statistically significant P values above 0 05 but less than or equal to 0 10 were considered indicative of a trend Confidence intervals for the difference between mean changes were constructed assuming a normal distribution of changes from baseline Results Patient characteristics Table 3shows baseline patient demographic data and heparin administration for the 2314 patients who entered the KyberSept trial The all survivors group using the last observation carried forward analysis totaled 897 patients whereas the in hospital group totaled 118 The patients included in this study population were from a broad mixture of countries The mean SD age of the overall population was 58 17 years in the placebo group and 57 17 years in the AT III group Mean age was lower 53 17 years in the all survivors population A clear majority of patients were men 61 5 men versus 38 5 women In the three populations overall all 90 day survivors and 90 day in hospital survivors the sex distribution for the AT III groups was similar There was a shift toward the lower risk strata of SAPS II score from the overall population to the all survivors population whereas the risks in the in hospital population were slightly higher than those in the overall population In the all survivors group respiratory disorders were the most common diagnostic admitting category whereas digestive causes of sepsis were the most common among the in hospital group Among all patients enrolled in the trial 70 received heparin concomitantly Among the all survivors placebo and AT III differed by 3 with respect to concomitant heparin administration In this population 71 of placebo patients were administered heparin concomitantly 68 of those administered AT III received heparin Among the in hospital survivors at 90 days 87 in the placebo group received heparin as compared with 70 of those receiving AT III Comparing AT III groups across populations the use of concomitant heparin was nearly the same Changes in 90 day quality of life Table 4shows data for the six attributes of the visual analog scale and the Karnofsky scale objective physical performance and dependency measured from baseline to 90 days Assessment of the changes among the all survivors based on two sided two sample Wilcoxon tests suggests advantages for the AT III group as compared with the placebo group in three of the attributes namely patient communication and speech level of alertness and energy level In the inhospital population the differences indicated that communication and speech level of alertness and the Karnofsky scale were all more improved for the AT III group than for placebo In neither population was the change in patient overall QoL judged to be statistically different In the in hospital group a trend toward greater patient energy levels in the AT III group was found P 0 10 Differences across patient subgroups As shown in Table 5 although there were generally greater increases in attribute scores in the SAPS II risk for AT III in the all survivors none of the differences were statistically significant There were also no significant differences between placebo and AT III according to the diagnostic subgroups on hospital admission although a few trends favoring AT III notably the energy level attribute of QoL were found In the heparin subgroups there was an advantage in some attributes for AT III Compared with placebo physical activity was improved significantly more in the AT III subgroup than in the placebo subgroup not receiving heparin There was also a trend toward greater improvement in three other attributes in the no concomitant heparin subgroup namely patient mobility communication and speech and patient energy level Excluding the Karnofsky scores that were unchanged mean nominal changes in the AT III QoL attributes of the no concomitant heparin group ranged from 4 to 9 whereas those receiving concomitant heparin experienced nominal increases in scores ranging from 2 to 5 Changes in quality of life between baseline and 28 56 and 90 days Figs 1and 2show the differences in mean changes in scores between baseline and later periods for the seven attributes measured in the AT III group as compared with placebo Fig 1shows results for the all survivors population whereas Fig 2shows findings in the in hospital population Considering point estimates of differences between mean changes at each time point for all attributes and in both populations AT III patients were more improved than placebo patients Confidence intervals fully occupying the AT III better side indicate statistically significant improvements in the AT III group In the all survivors population comparative improvements tended to increase over time in the AT III group as compared with the placebo group An exception was the Karnofsky index for which the difference between treatment groups remained approximately constant over time For the in hospital population the advantage in the AT III group increased over time for the communication speech and the level of alertness attributes whereas the difference between treatment groups remained approximately constant for the other attributes In the all survivors the greatest comparative advantages for the AT III group were found in communication speech alertness and energy level Discussion The present study represents the first attempt to evaluate patient QoL over a relatively long period in a large randomized placebo controlled sepsis trial The results of the study indicate that over a 90 day period survivors of severe sepsis receiving AT III experienced substantial and statistically significant improvements as compared with placebo in several attributes of QoL These results held for both all survivors and in hospital survivors populations The comparative advantage in QoL for AT III was also maintained from 28 to 56 and 90 days After 90 days the study also found an advantage with AT III for some attributes in patients who did not receive heparin concomitantly The improvements identified in the study should be interpreted in terms of statistical and clinical significance Clinical significance deals with the applied value of the change in everyday life Unfortunately as with most other QoL instruments there is not yet a clear standard for minimal clinically important differences However improvements by approximately 20 in the in hospital group of AT III sepsis patients after 90 days in communication speech and level of alertness probably represent meaningful improvements in many patients Another limitation of the present study is the fact that investigators were proxy respondents rather than patients responding themselves Like many studies of QoL in critical care settings physicians were assumed to be sufficiently close to patients to provide valid and reliable data Although this was not substantiated empirically there is usually moderate agreement between patients and proxies although lower levels of agreement have been found in psychosocial functioning 17 18 Conclusion Combined with previous findings in 90 day mortality for those without concomitant administration of heparin this multinational study demonstrates that AT III is associated with meaningful improvements in health for many sepsis patients over an extended 3 month follow up period In this subgroup the clinical improvements over a long time period in patients in the AT III group were complemented by improvements in QoL in many patients particularly in terms of social and psychologic functioning Although no significant reduction in 90 day mortality was found for the overall population a nominal advantage in mortality for the AT III group combined with a generally improved QoL profile in the survivors of this group suggests a possible long term benefit from AT III Future studies of critically ill patients with severe sepsis or other conditions should include long term follow up of patients throughout hospitalization and after hospital discharge In sepsis long term follow up appears to provide more meaningful outcome data for patients families and society than do standard 28 day all cause mortality statistics Key messages In the present study clinical improvements over an extended time period with AT III were complemented by improvements in QoL particularly in social andpsychologic functioning in a predefined subgroup of patients who did not receive heparin Combined with previous research on 90 day mortality the study suggests that AT III may confer long term benefit in sepsis patients Among the all survivors group of patients communication and speech level of alertness and energy level exhibited the greatest gains at 90 days In most cases significant differences in patient QoL scores at 90 days after hospital admission were also found at the 28 day and 56 day assessments Future studies in patients with severe sepsis should include long term follow up throughout hospitalization and after hospital discharge Competing interests Dale Rublee Heinz Otto Keinecke and Sigrid Knaub are employees of Aventis Behring the latter also owning Aventis stock options Steven Opal is supported by a
