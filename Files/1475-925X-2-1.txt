 EEG The electroencephalogram EEG recorded from electrodes placed on the scalp reflects the electrical activity of the brain First registered from human scalp in 1929 1 until today EEG remains an important tool in neuroscience and clinical neurophysiology For a long time it was the only objective parameter providing information on brain s function Recently emerging dynamic imaging techniques like fMRI and PET offer a complementary information on brains functioning Their drawbacks include significantly lower time resolution high cost and invasiveness Nevertheless in spite of those drawbacks they are often preferred for the straightforward interpretability On the contrary visual interpretation of EEG is a difficult tedious and complicated task requiring many years of experience And even then it contains a significant subjective factor Every experienced electroencephalographer has his or her personal approach to EEG interpretation there is an element of science and element of art in a good EEG interpretation it is the latter that defies standardization writes Prof Ernst Niedermayer in the recent edition of a fundamental reference 2 In spite of this discouraging opinion application of various signal processing methods in this field is still very popular First introduction of Fourier analysis to EEG is dated 1932 3 Since then spectral analysis has become a standard tool in this field But until today basically no other method gained a general acceptance the few widely accepted and applied methods of EEG analysis still amount to 4 1 visual analysis of raw EEG traces 2 Fourier estimation of spectral power in selected frequency bands 3 description of evoked potentials averaged in the time domain One of the reasons of this unsatisfactory situation is that among the variety of new methods proposed each year for the analysis of EEG very few have any direct relationship to the traditional visual analysis That means that their results usually cannot be directly related to the most valuable knowledge base of 70 years of experience collected by means of the visual analysis of EEG On the contrary each new method needs to be evaluated from the scratch in many laboratories and over many repeated studies before it can be considered as a clinically usable parameter And since there is a multitude of new methods being proposed with few a priori hints for their possible performance this process seems to be hardly convergent Wavelets the first step towards time frequency analysis Limitations of linear and quadratic time frequency representations Further attempts to apply wavelets to the analysis of on going EEG activity encountered a major drawback Representation of the signal obtained from orthogonal wavelet representation is not time shift invariant This property is illustrated in Figure 5 This limitation is not present in the continuous wavelet transform as well as several quadratic representations of signal s energy density in the time frequency plane c f 6 and Figure 8 However in such case we loose the compact description offered by orthogonal wavelets the representation is highly redundant Another problem relates to the occurence of cross terms Figure 6 Both these problems can be solved or at least significantly reduced by the solution proposed in the next section Adaptive approximations and matching pursuit Given a set of functions dictionary D g 1 g 2 g n such that g i 1 we can define an optimal M approximation as an expansion minimizing the error of an approximation of signal f t by M waveforms where i i 1 M represents the indices of the chosen functions g i Finding such an optimal approximation is an NP hard problem A suboptimal expansion can be found by means of an iterative procedure such as the matching pursuit algorithm MP proposed by Mallat and Zhang 7 In the first step of MP the waveform g 0 which best matches the signal f t is chosen In each of the consecutive steps the waveform g n is matched to the signal R n f which is the residual left after subtracting results of previous iterations Orthogonality of R n 1 f and g n in each step implies energy conservation For a complete dictionary the procedure converges to f From this equation we can derive a time frequency distribution of the signal s energy that is free of cross terms by adding Wigner distributions of selected functions This magnitude is presented in Figure 7 calculated from MP decomposition of a simulated signal with known and simple content We observe that most of the structures are represented compactly and with high resolution except for the structure of changing frequency linear chirp It is represented by a series of structures of constant frequency since in the applied Gabor dictionary section 5 we have only constant frequency modulations Section 7 presents an alternative approach to this issue Figure 8presents estimates of the time frequency density of the same signal s energy obtained from spectrograms with different window widths continuous wavelet transform and smoothed pseudo Wigner Ville distribution Only in the last case representation of the chirp looks better than on the plot obtained from MP decomposition but we must take into account that in this case the parameters of the kernel of the distribution were optimized for this particular signal Except for the lack of cross terms and high resolution adaptive time frequency parametrizations exhibit one more basic and important advantage over the continuous time frequency representations Unlike the maps from Figure 8 for all the structures presented in Figure 7we have a priori the exact values of their time and frequency centers widths amplitudes and phases This property will be thoroughly explored in the following studies First application in EEG analysis sleep spindles The presence of sleep spindle should not be defined unless it is of at least 0 5 sec duration i e one should be able to count 6 or 7 distinct waves within the half second period The term should be used only to describe activity between 12 and 14 cps says the definition from the basic reference 8 A manual of standardized terminology techniques and scoring system for sleep stages in human subjects It can be directly translated into the language of parameters of the structures fitted to the signal by the algorithm discussed in the previous section By choosing from the time frequency atoms fitted to EEG by the MP algorithm those conforming to the above criteria we obtain a detailed automatic and high resolution parametrization of the relevant structures which correspond to sleep spindles 9 10 Figures 10and 11present results of such a procedure carried out for several derivations of an overnight sleep EEG recording This parametrization has proven to be consistent with visual detection especially for the structures of higher amplitudes 11 For lower amplitudes the algorithm detects also spindles elusive to a human expert Results presented in these figures conform also the previously observed effect of predominance of lower frequencies of sleep spindles in frontal derivations and higher frequencies in parietal derivations We also notice that some frequencies on these plots are prefereed i e exhibit regular maxima in the histograms But are they preferred by the brain or by the analysis algorithm This question will be resolved in the next section Discrete Gabor dictionary Stochastic dictionaries In forming the dictionary used for MP decomposition using any fixed scheme of subsampling the parameter space introduces statistical bias in the resulting parametrization This bias becomes apparent only when statistics comes into play like in parameterization of large amounts of data Unbiased MP decompositions can be obtained by an analogue of Monte Carlo methods In 12 we proposed MP with stochastic dictionaries where the parameters of a dictionary s atoms are randomized before each decomposition A stochastic dictionary D is constructed for a given signal length N and chosen resolutions 1in time frequency and scale t and s The space of parameters t and s is thereby divided into bricks of size t by by s each where 0 In each of those bricks one time frequency atom is chosen by drawing its parameters from flat distributions within the given ranges of continuous parameters Figures 14and 15present results for the same data as Figures 10and 11 These results owing to the application of the above described stochastic dictionaries are free from the statistical bias 1The resolution of the matching pursuit is hard to define in general since the procedure is nonlinear and signal dependent It should be related to the distance between neighboring dictionary waveforms available for decomposition In the described procedure this distance does not exceed twice the value of the corresponding parameter t or s Pharmaco EEG This section presents an application of the proposed methodology to the standard clinical problem of testing influence of sleep inducing drugs on the sleep EEG The effects of zolpidem midazolam and placebo administered at bed time were studied in 7 paid volunteers From each of the 21 all night recordings 3 nights for each subject we extracted artifact free epochs from derivation C3 A2 of the 10 20 system For the analysis of slow wave activity SWA we used data from stages III and IV and for sleep spindles only data from sleep stage II Figures 16and 18present the classical approach to the analysis of these data that is averaging the spectral integrals in the above mentioned ranges for each of the analyzed recordings Figures 17and 19present each of the structures classified as sleep spindles Figure 17 or SWA Figure 19 as a dot in the frequency amplitude plane These structures were selected using not only the frequency information as in the classical approach but also information on time duration and amplitude from Table 1 Total power carried by these structures summed and normalized per time unit is indicated on the right of each plot together with the average number of occurrences per minute average amplitude and frequency We observe that selective MP based estimates of power are more sensitive to the effect of influence of both drugs than the spectral integrals This sensitivity becomes crucial in two of the analyzed cases 1 In the recording of patient ZCB09 which revealed a very low spindling activity last row in Figures 16and 17 fluctuations in the background masked the power of sleep spindles to such an extent that spectral integrals indicate a partially reverse trend i e decrease of power of sleep spindles under the influence of midazolam Selective estimates indicate the expected increase 2 For patient ZCB08 second row from the bottom spectral integrals indicate increase of power of SWA while MP estimates reveal a decrease coherent with all the other cases Finally as an example of an effect elusive to the classical methodology these results indicate also a statistically significant decrease of the frequency of the slow wave activity Further discussion and statistical evaluation of results can be found in 13 Figure 20partially explains the increased sensitivity of the proposed approach as compared to the classical paradigm of band limited spectral power integrals Representation of changing frequency Another interesting property of the stochastic time frequency dictionaries discussed in section 5 1 relates to the representation of structures of changing frequency Such structures are absent in the dictionaries usually applied for the decomposition and therefore are represented as a series od fixed frequency Gabor functions Figure 22 f and Figure 21 b However by averaging several decompositions of the same signal in different realizations of smaller stochastic dictionaries we obtain a more continuous representation like in Figures 22 g and Figure 21 c The representation is no more compact but retains the general property of absence of cross terms Event related desynchronization and synchronization Advantages of the MP algorithm with stochastic dictionaries can be also combined with the stochastic element present inherently in the data like e g in the case of analyzing repetitions of event related potentials This relates especially to the non phase locked activity i e such that would not be enhanced in the stimulus synchronized time averages Its detection requires a different analysis technique allowing for averaging signal s energy irrelevant of the phase 2 Classically it was achieved by squaring the values of signals band pass filtered in a priori chosen frequency bands before averaging 14 Figure 23 This methodology has several drawbacks including tha arbitrary choice of frequency bands and limited sensitivity c f Figure 20 Averaging the time frequency densities of energy obtained from the MP decomposition allows for an instantaneous evaluation of the complete picture of changes in the time frequency plane with high resolution Figure 25presents this picture for the same data as in Figure 23 Another study in Figure 26reveals clearly splitting of the alpha band in the upper and lower frequencies with different behaviour related to the finger movement This phenomenon would be very difficult to find using the classical methodology 2If we want to analyze phasic synchronization in higher frequencies like e g gamma band around 40 Hz the accuracy of the triger s determination would have to be much better than e g 1 ms which is rather beyond the accuracy of determining e g the moment of a finger movement But non phasic effects should be visible in the presented approach Epileptic seizures Discussed advantages of time frequency estimates of energy density obtained from MP decomposition allowed for identification of different dynamic states during evolution and propagation of epileptic seizures in 15 Figure 27presents an example of time frequency density of energy calculated from the MP expansion of an intracranial recording of epileptic seizure Sensitivity of the algorithm to the phase changes clearly distinguishes the initial less synchronized period of transitional rhytmic activity starting near 15th second from the organized rhytmic activity In this period starting about 30th second all the harmonics up to the Nyquist frequency clearly follow the pattern of decreasing frequency Such a clear representation of changing frequency was possible using the technique discussed in section 7 Problems As presented in figure 28 greedy MP algorithm in certain cases can fail to properly decompose signal containing even a simple combination of dictionary s functions This counterexample was simulated especially for discussion of practical issues and as such may look scary but on the other hand we never encountered such a failure in applications to real world signals The trap in this case lies in the fact that both these structures have exactly the same phase and it might be even dicussable if they should not be treated as one in the first approximation If they were produced by two different biological generators such a coincidence of phases would not be possible and they would be parametrized separately Other more theoretical examples of MP failures are given in 16 and 17 Some of these cases can be properly solved by the orthogonalized matching pursuit 18 at a cost of increased computational requirements and a possibility of introducing numerical instabilities 19 Another modification of the MP algorithm discussed in 20 relies on a modification of the similarity function used in each step to choosed the best fit Other works 21 indicate that global optimalization of the l 1norm of expansion s coefficients might be the best choice 17 but in spite of recent advances in linear programming computational complexity is still very high Other problems awaiting better solutions include efficient and at the same time bias free implementations robust estimation of resolution proper addressing of the tradeoff between resolution increasing dictionary size and computation cost and extension of the algorithm to the multichannel case Such research will improve effectivity and understanding of mathematical foundations of these higly nonlinear procedures However current implementations and knowledge of algorithm s properties are already sufficient for large scale applications in EEG research and clinical practice They may serve as a basis for a unification of parametrization and description of EEG Implementations of MP with stochastic dictionaries is available from http brain fuw edu pl mp Authors contributions Parts of presented research
