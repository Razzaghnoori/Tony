 The pathologist makes do with red wine until an effective drug is available the biochemist discards the bread from her sandwiches and the mathematician indulges in designer chocolate with a clear conscience The demographer sticks to vitamin supplements and while the evolutionary biologist calculates the compensations of celibacy the population biologist transplants gonads but so far only those of his laboratory mice Their common cause is to control and extend the healthy lifespan of humans They want to cure ageing and the diseases that come with it I would take resveratrol if it were feasible notes David Sinclair assistant professor of pathology at Harvard Medical School in Boston Massachusetts In the meantime he adds I do enjoy a glass of red wine about once a day It was Sinclair s laboratory in association with a commercial partner that revealed last August how the team had identified for the first time a group of simple organic molecules capable of extending lifespan The most proficient of the group is resveratrol the plant polyphenol found in red wine and its discovery as a potential elixir to combat ageing represents another extraordinary advance in a decade of discoveries that have revolutionised the field These molecules will be useful for treating diseases associated with ageing like diabetes and Alzheimer s Extending Life Although the life enhancing effects of Sinclair s polyphenols are so far confined to the baker s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the work suggests that researchers are only one small step from making a giant leap for humankind People imagined that it might have been possible but few people thought that it was going to be possible so quickly to find such things says Sinclair The field of ageing research is buzzing Resveratrol stimulated a known activator of increased longevity in yeast the enzyme Sir 2 and thereby extended the organism s lifespan by 70 Box 1 Sir 2 belongs to a family of proteins with members in higher organisms including SIR 2 1 an enzyme that regulates lifespan in worms and SIRT 1 the human enzyme that promotes cell survival Figure 1 Though researchers still do not know whether SIRT 1 or Sir 2 in humans as Sinclair puts it has anything to do with longevity there is a good chance that it does judging by its pedigree In any event resveratrol proved to be a potent activator of the human enzyme This might not be altogether surprising at least not now given that the polyphenol is already associated with health benefits in humans notably the mitigation of such age related defects as neurodegeneration carcinogenesis and atherosclerosis The study came out from a pretty big gamble recalls Sinclair who used the human enzyme to screen and identify molecules that he expected would also stimulate those related enzymes in lower organisms Unlike SIRT 1 these related enzymes are known to increase longevity when activated usually by restricting the organism s calorie intake Not only did they find a whole collection of related polyphenols that activate Sir 2 from humans but we put them onto yeast justbeing the simplest model and amazingly they did what we were hoping they would do recalls Sinclair But it was a real long shot Now there s great eagerness in the Sinclair laboratory to complete and publish related research notably by replicating the yeast work in higher organisms We have very promising results in Drosophila which is a huge jump from a yeast cell says Sinclair So we re very encouraged by that Publication of these results is imminent The team has also quickly broadened its horizons and is already testing the polyphenols on mouse disease models We think we may have tapped into a cell survival and defence programme and that these molecules will be useful for treating diseases associated with ageing like diabetes and Alzheimer s says Sinclair He hopes to publish the diabetes results by mid 2004 and those for Alzheimer s by the end of the year Harvard and BIOMOL Research Laboratories its commercial partner based in Pennsylvania have already filed a patent application for the use of synthetic related molecules to combat diseases of ageing an application Sinclair adds very much linked to the polyphenols paper There s been a radical shift in attitude towards ageing says Sinclair Before the 1990s people thought that we were a lot like cars that we would just rust and breakdown nothing we could do about it The new idea is that there are pathways that can boost our defences against ageing the ageing can be regulated discovery that genes can control ageing and that there are pathways that we can use to slow down the process he says If that s true and it really seems to be true for a lot of organisms if it s true for us it really means that there is hope that we will be able one day to find small molecules that can alter these pathways How Long Could We Live Sinclair expects to see such developments within his lifetime but he ridicules the notion that humans will experience anything like the 70 extension to lifespan of his cultured yeast It ll be great if we can just give people an extra five years and have less disease in their old age and make it less painful he says We won t be seeing any Methuselahs around he insists On his side are James Vaupel one of Europe s leading demographers and Marc Mangel a mathematical modeller at the University of California at Santa Cruz Since 1840 life expectancy has been going up at 2 5 years per decade and will continue at this rate maybe a little faster says Vaupel head of the Laboratory of Survival and Longevity at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock Germany Women in Japan currently have the highest average life expectancy of 85 he notes So the figure could be 100 in six decades but not 500 There s remarkably little people can do even if they want to live as long as possible he says Give up smoking lose weight don t drive when drunk install a smoke detector take regular exercise suggests Vaupel who insists he does them all as well as taking vitamin supplements You look at these worms and think Oh my God these worms should be dead But they re not They re moving around Mangel sees the problem of assessing the limitations of ageing research as fairly straightforward Mathematical models he says could solve it by linking demographic properties and physiological developments We ve had a separation of the biology of ageing and the demography of ageing and they need to come together again notes Mangel whose personal anti ageing regime involves taking a dose of anti oxidant chocolate with a good feeling But Cythnia Kenyon whose laboratory reported in October that it had generated a 6 fold increase in the lifespan of its nematodes is not so sure about the limitations You look at these worms and think Oh my God these worms should be dead But they re not They re moving around Once you get your brain wrapped around that then you start thinking oh my goodness so lifespan is something you can change it s plastic Then who knows what the limit is Cynthia Kenyon has recorded video clips of the superstars of her lab Caenorhabditis elegans to show how long lived mutant nematodes are as vigorous as normal young adults Videos 1 4 Warming to the theme Kenyon hypothesises If you d asked me many generations ago when we were actually common precursors of worms and flies Cynthia you have a two week lifespan do you think that you could live longer And if I d told you Well I think our descendants will live 1 000 times longer you d have said Oh come on But we do It happened she notes Who knows what you could do in people Kenyon muses I don t want to go on record saying that it s not possible in people because I don t see why it wouldn t be I m certainly not imagining that my company in the next few years is going to come up with a compound that can make people live to be 500 That seems just preposterous So the timescale is millions of years No not necessarily she insists because once we understand the mechanism then we can intervene and see what we can accomplish Signalling Life and Sweet 16 Kenyon professor of biochemistry and biophysics at the University of California at San Francisco is among the key contributors responsible for showing that a single gene and subsequently many genes can change an organism s lifespan It is inconceivable that a life extending therapy will ever be developed that is able to extend life independent of every other change In a seminal paper published a decade ago Kenyon s laboratory showed that mutations in the daf 2 gene doubled the lifespan of the nematode C elegans daf 2 encodes a receptor that is similar to those for insulin and insulin like growth factor 1 IGF 1 in humans this hormone receptor normally speeds up ageing in worms but the mutations inhibit its action and enable the organisms to live longer Before the results appeared there was a very negative attitude towards ageing research recalls Kenyon Since then and especially over the past few years in response to later findings graduate students have been scrambling for a chance to work in her laboratory You can t believe the difference there was such resistance to it she says daf 2 made a huge difference But then so did her subsequent research in the field Among her most significant findings is the identification of many more longevity genes the results published in July derive directly from her early work on daf 2 We discovered that in order for long lived worms to live so long they need another gene called daf 16 recalls Kenyon daf 16 is kind of the opposite of daf 2 in the sense that it promotes longevity and youthfulness so we call it sweet 16 daf 16 encodes a transcription factor that controls the expression of more than 100 genes They don t do just one thing they do many things says Kenyon They can act as anti oxidants to prevent damage from oxygen radicals as chaperones to prevent misfolded proteins from forming aggregates as antimicrobials to protect against bacteria and fungi and as metabolic agents So the picture that emerges is that the way the insulin IGF 1 hormone system produces these enormous effects on lifespan is by coordinating the expression of many genes that do different things to affect lifespan each of which on its own has only a small effect notes Kenyon It s as though daf 2 and daf 16 the regulators would be the conductors of an orchestra They bring together the flutes and the violins and the French horns each of which do different things and they make them all work together in concert Kenyon is unequivocal about the bottom line Now we have a whole set of genes whose biochemical functions we can be working on to understand more about the actual mechanisms of ageing Complementary results in flies and mammals persuade her to be more explicit The common ancestor of worms flies and mice must have had an insulin IGF 1 like hormone system that controlled ageing And that ability has been maintained So the question is has that ability been lost in humans I think it s quite likely that it will also function in humans but there isn t a direct demonstration yet that that s the case Nevertheless the discoveries about the role of the insulin IGF 1 pathway in ageing have had a profound impact on her own lifestyle which includes a tendency to discard the bread from sandwiches and eat only the toppings of pizzas Box 2 I m on a low carb diet I gave my worms glucose and it shortened their lifespan The diet makes sense because it keeps your insulin levels down she says Caloric restriction extends lifespan of mice and so does the insulin IGF 1 pathway she notes Indeed starting a low calorie diet at any point in adulthood appears to help fruit flies live longer according to research in Britain published last September What we don t know for sure in mice Kenyon continues is whether the two pathways are different or the same While much ageing research focuses on these two influences she says that there are another two areas of investigation Her laboratory reported in December 2002 that inhibiting the respiration of mitochondria in developing worms increased longevity but that it had no effect in adult worms for reasons still unexplained she says Further microarray analysis is underway to pinpoint whether the cause simply lies downstream of the insulin IGF 1 pathway or whether it is something different altogether The Price of Life Then there s research looking at the effects on lifespan of changes to an organism s reproductive system For Kenyon such work often involves a battle to convince sceptics that longevity is not a trade off with fertility Four years ago her laboratory reported that killing germ cells increases the lifespan of worms by 60 but only because she stresses it affects endocrine signalling and not because it prevents reproduction Further research published last year showed quite clearly she says that ageing and reproduction are controlled independently of one another And as for her recent work on infertile worms which lived six times as long as normal following the removal of their entire reproductive systems she says If we could intervene in the hormone signalling pathways directly we think the animals would still live six times as long as normal but would be fertile as well Jim Carey is one of those trade off sceptics He is a population biologist at the University of California at Davis and his research on the effect on life expectancy of replacing the ovaries of old mice with ovaries from younger mice is intended to complement Kenyon s work But he insists that an honest discussion of lifespan extension must include consideration of tradeoffs Many manipulations that extend lifespan in model systems whether genetic or dietary for example ignore or gloss over the side effects such as permanent sterility huge weight loss distorted organ to body ratios or major behavioural aberrations he notes It is inconceivable to me that a life extending therapy will ever be developed that is able to extend life independent of every other change he concludes All life systems are interlinked and hierarchically integrated at all levels so to talk about life extension using analogies with a car warranty concept is wrong headed Another trade off sceptic takes a different tack As Armand Leroi puts it During occasional periods of involuntary celibacy I have thought well I may not be getting laid but at least I shall live to a miserable and solitary old age Leroi an evolutionary biologist at Imperial College of Science Technology and Medicine in London offers an optimistic appraisal of the chances of finding a cure for ageing in his new book about the effects of genetic variety on the human body He sees ageing simply as a collection of curable diseases There is no obvious impediment to that advance nothing to make us think that human beings have a fixed lifespan
