 A Brief history The First Puerto Ricans The island s earliest known inhabitants Indians now called Arca cos the ancients were primitive fishermen More than 2 000 years ago they were conquered by another tribe called the Igneri who had mastered farming and potterymaking The final stage of Indian advancement began while Europe was in the Middle Ages the Ta no Indians a peaceful people native to Venezuela traveled up through the chain of the Lesser Antilles and settled the island they called Borinqu n They lived in thatched houses hunted and farmed and worked ceramics and textiles with great skill Several of their ceremonial ball courts which were used for certain social or religious gatherings have been discovered throughout Puerto Rico The Ta nos feared an evil spirit Jurac n who was responsible for violent storms and gave his name to the tropical hurricanes of the West Indies They also feared an earthly evil the Carib Indians who periodically raided their land for loot and captives The Ta nos fears were well founded The word cannibal derives from Carib a reminder of the way these marauders disposed of some prisoners The Arrival of the Europeans On 19 November 1493 Columbus was lucky enough to be met by the kindly Ta nos in fact the name Ta no meant friend and was used by the Indians to enable the Europeans to distinguish between them and the not so friendly Caribs The Ta nos were the ones who introduced the Spanish to tobacco corn on the cob and that archetypal Caribbean mode of relaxation the hammock Columbus christened the island San Juan Bautista honoring St John the Baptist It was the first colonist Juan Ponce de Le n who admiring a bay on the north coast declared it Puerto Rico rich port Sixteenth century mapmakers back in Spain mistakenly confused the names so that in the end the port became San Juan and the whole island was called a rich port once on the maps the names stuck A less innocent error was an American attempt to erase four centuries of Spanish history After the conquest of 1898 the first US military governor ordered that the name be spelled Porto Rico This semi Italian corruption didn t last long Today some nationalists still yearn for good old Borinqu n a name you ll see on many restaurants and bars Ponce de Le n had received permission to found a Spanish colony on the island in 1508 For reasons of security he settled a few miles inland from what is now San Juan The site was swampy and mosquito ridden and after a number of outbreaks of disease his fellow colonists abandoned him and moved to the future capital city They immediately began work on the formidable fortifications for which the city is still famous Ponce de Le n also suffered another setback He became involved in a power struggle with Columbus s son Diego who through his father s will had claims on the island The small colony could not cope with the egos of two such powerful men The Spanish crown solved the tense standoff by entrusting Ponce de Le n with another voyage of exploration His search resulted in the discovery of Florida While on a second expedition to colonize Florida in 1521 Ponce de Le n was critically wounded during an attack by Indians the explorer hoped to return Puerto Rico but lost his fight for life on the way back in Havana Cuba Ponce de Le n s successors imagined that the island was one big gold mine and set the Indians to work mining and panning They were wrong however the gold soon ran out The Spaniards then looked to agriculture to turn a profit and began growing sugar cane which had been introduced to the Caribbean on Columbus s second journey As the number of Ta no and Carib laborers declined due to disease and suicide plantation owners eventually began importing slaves from West Africa Puerto Rico quickly developed into a major port and trading post it was one of the last major ports Spanish galleons stopped in before sailing back to the motherland San Juan also became the center for the Catholic Church s evangelization of the New World numerous churches convents and monasteries were established throughout the island to aid in this effort A Beleaguered Island To the pirates and privateers who sailed the Caribbean in the early 16th century the fortress of El Morro at San Juan represented the might and the wealth of the Spanish Crown Lured by the promise of treasure galleons and stores of ammunition some pirates worked independently others however were employed by the various European crowns particularly the British to help carry on their power struggles in the colonial world Puerto Rico suffered from constant attacks The most poignant though not typical case involved raids against the coastal hamlet of San Germ n Two French pirate ships first ravaged the village in 1528 It happened again in 1538 and three times in the following five years After every attack the settlers put out the fires buried the dead and rebuilt San Germ n In 1554 after the sixth sacking the settlers decided to move inland to the town s present hilltop location With remarkable persistence the pirates climbed all the way twice just to pillage San Germ n More ominous than the French were the forces of Sir Francis Drake The great British navigator and adventurer operated in the Caribbean for years before he turned his attention to Puerto Rico In 1595 Drake learned that a 2 million peso gold shipment had just arrived in San Juan aboard a Spanish galleon This kind of booty was worth a battle even though Drake knew the city was well protected by a set of forts The British fleet dueled with the guns of El Morro fort and the defending warships in a long costly battle Then under cover of darkness Drake sent out attack boats to destroy the Spanish frigates But light from the burning ships gave El Morro s shore batteries a fine view of their target The English slunk away without the loot It was the only defeat of Drake s career within months he was dead El Morro was not however invulnerable A few years later a British fleet commanded by George Clifford the Earl of Cumberland shrewdly outflanked the fortress Far outnumbered by the 1 700 man invasion force the defenders of El Morro surrendered after a two week siege But the English flag did not fly over San Juan for long Four hundred of Cumberland s troops died in an epidemic of yellow fever and dysentery and the British had to withdraw less than three months after their victory The Dutch were the next to try in 1625 they succeeded in pinning the Spanish into the confines of El Morro but after looting everything of value they set fire to San Juan and departed Because surrender was never considered the Spanish and today s Puerto Ricans regard this episode as a victory Soon after this the Spanish began building a thick defensive wall all around San Juan With an average height of 40 feet 12 m it was a formidable site and is still one of the most impressive parts of the old city It seems to have impressed generations of marauders once it was complete they stayed away for more than 150 years A final British rally against Puerto Rico came in 1797 Seven thousand troops under Sir Ralph Abercromby landed east of San Juan and blockaded the city For two weeks the battle see sawed Finally as suddenly and unexpectedly as they had arrived the British retired According to one version it was all because of St Ursula and the 11 000 Virgins On the last night of the siege devout local women led by their bishop marched through the streets of old San Juan in a torchlight parade praying for deliverance The legend says General Abercromby heard the church bells tolling saw the lights mistakenly deduced that Spanish reinforcements had arrived and fled The End of Spanish Rule For Spain the 19th century was a bitter slide from imperial might to the status of a has been By the early 1800s independence movements had overthrown Spanish rule in most of the Western Hemisphere Madrid s most important remaining possessions were the island colonies of Cuba and Puerto Rico both of which were chafing under the yoke of colonial rule and the bitter system of slavery To squash subversive ideas about independence in Puerto Rico Madrid imposed ruthless military control The most memorable incident occurred in 1868 in the mountain town of Lares when government forces crushed an uprising of secessionists killing or jailing the insurgents and many innocent victims The event is remembered as El Grito de Lares the cry of Lares The colonial government could not however hold back the tide of change sweeping the Caribbean In 1872 one momentous decree abolished the 350 year old institution of slavery in Puerto Rico and in 1897 Spain cut the colonial ties and finally granted the island autonomy The long dream of independence seemed to have come true But eight months after Madrid had authorized home rule for Puerto Rico American troops arrived to take it away The Spanish American War was no great challenge for the US force that landed at Gu nica on Puerto Rico s calm south coast rather than at fortified San Juan Military resistance was spotty at best By starting at the soft underbelly the 16 000 troops of General Nelson A Miles gained control of the island in less than three weeks The central issue that had drawn Spain and the United States into war Cuba s struggle for independence was resolved in that island s favor Cuba s freedom was guaranteed by the Paris Treaty of 1898 But Spain s two other major colonies the Philippines and Puerto Rico simply changed hands becoming colonies of the United States Puerto Rico and the United States The population was initially little better off under its new landlord Most Puerto Ricans were tied to the large agricultural companies they lived in company houses and were paid in tokens that could only be spent at company stores They didn t starve but they didn t thrive either A few strong voices were eventually raised some proposed radical action while others advocated working within the system for a more democratic society One especially prominent activist was Mu oz Mar n Rivera who is credited with helping to move Puerto Rico toward the 20th century Washington gradually began to grant Puerto Ricans a greater degree of self government and representation In 1900 the first civil governor was appointed all the appointed governors were Americans until 1946 In 1917 Puerto Ricans won a mixed bag of benefits they were given more say in their internal affairs made citizens of the United States and declared eligible for conscription in World War I In the years between the World Wars there were continued efforts to change the island s status and improve its quality of life Some such as those who followed radical Pedro Albizu Campos took to violence which resulted in several assassinations though many more insurgents worked within the system More Puerto Rican draftees went to war in 1941 Even while poverty lingered from the Great Depression World War II caused continued hardship on the island because of its isolation in a dangerous sea But the 1940s saw the emergence of two great political figures Luis Mu oz Mar n son of Mu oz Mar n Rivera and founder of the new Popular Democratic Party and Rexford Guy Tugwell Governor of Puerto Rico from 1941 to 1946 These two men were instrumental in orchestrating an amazing economic expansion that almost single handedly converted the island from an underdeveloped backwater into a pace setting industrial society Under Operation Bootstrap which attracted hundreds of new factories to Puerto Rico through tax and other incentives the per capita income soared to the highest in Latin America Life expectancy rose from about 45 years in 1940 to an enviable 71 years today Pouring one third of its entire budget into education Puerto Rico cut illiteracy to about 10 percent The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico Politically recent history is less conclusive In 1951 the island s voters approved a new constitution still in effect forming a commonwealth between the United States and the free associated state of Puerto Rico though even the commencement ceremony was marred by violent demonstrations by radicals As a result Puerto Ricans now elect their own governor legislature and local officials and send a non voting representative to the US Congress In turn Washington runs the postal customs and immigration services handles defense and foreign relations and sends dollars particularly useful in times of crisis such as after hurricanes In recent elections power has alternated between parties backing the status quo and those preferring even closer ties with the United States though a referendum in 1998 defeated a move towards statehood A third force is often in the news but the parties pushing for independence establishing Puerto Rico as a separate nation have thus far gained only minority support at the polls The withdrawal of tax incentives for US companies operating in Puerto Rico by the Clinton administration in 1996 which has caused job losses and economic hardship is another thorn in the side of those who hope for a stronger and more self sufficient society On the other hand tourism which began in earnest in the 1960s brings increasing numbers of visitors and amounts of money to the island s economy
