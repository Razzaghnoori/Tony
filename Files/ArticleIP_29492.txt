 I Dream of Julia Imagine that you re a modestly ordinary fellow invited to a humble dinner party that you ask if you can bring a date and that you show up with Julia Roberts Hi this is Julia Where do we put our coats Jaws drop people fall all over themselves buddies goggle eyed take you aside How did you manage that What a shallow empty and pathetic reverie having one s worth enhanced by a gorgeous celebrity And how irresistible The scene described above is the heart of Notting Hill except that Julia Roberts is called Anna Scott great actress magazine cover girl object of worldwide idolatry and scrutiny The modestly ordinary fellow meanwhile the owner of a struggling travel book shop in the eponymous London neighborhood is impersonated by Hugh Grant who has made a specialty of teasing ordinary modesty into extraordinary adorableness The film directed by Roger Michell from a script by Richard Curtis Four Weddings and a Funeral 1994 is a brainy weave of satire and fantasy it would take a neurosurgeon to unwind its trenchant observations of our celebrity infatuated culture from its masturbatory People magazine worthy pipe dreams In this I suppose Notting Hill is remarkably in tune with the Zeitgeist The movie isn t simply a fantasy of a commoner winning a princess however it s also a fantasy of a princess publicly electing to be with someone below her station Since Hugh Grant doesn t fall below too many stations this goes down more smoothly than it would if he were say Danny DeVito But if Grant speaks through jaws aristocratically locked his William Thacker is meant to embody a scruffy downwardly mobile lifestyle as a consequence of his integrity he must share a flat with a cretinously vulgar couch potato called Spike Rhys Ifans and face a stream of dim customers who refuse to accept that his bookshop carries neither Dickens nor Grisham The script gives Grant a series of deadpan one upmanships what saves him from seeming like an utter snob is his habit of drawing attention to his own foolishness with a lovably self deprecating stammer When Anna Scott with her sunglasses and strong don t touch vibe appears from amid his shelves to ask about a particular guide to Turkey his recitation dribbles off hopelessly There s also a very amusing incident with a kebab among many amusing incidents His look of panic may be translated as Oh God don t I sound like a prat Kiss me How can she resist those floppy locks that sheepish grin Notting Hill spins such comic awkwardness into scenes of amazing charm Summoned to the star s suite for an impromptu date Thacker finds himself in the middle of a press junket for her latest film and ends up posing as a journalist from Horse and Hound a bit that at once lampoons the idiocy of celebrity interviews and forces the pair into a witty and sexy collusion You also get a taste of the world from which Anna is fleeing when Alec Baldwin unbilled never funnier shows up as her equally famous boyfriend radiating narcissistic entitlement as he paws his celebrated squeeze and bids Thacker forced this time into impersonating a room service waiter to adios those dirty dishes Scenes in the hero s middle class milieu skirt the sentimental One friend Gina McKee is confined to a wheelchair to remind us that life is full of unhappy as well as happy accidents But the movie recovers its high spirits whenever Emma Chambers appears as Thacker s raucous toothsome sister who blurts out when she meets Anna that the two could be best friends The screenwriter Curtis began his career with the hilariously acrid BBC sitcom Black Adder before writing The Tall Guy 1989 and Four Weddings and a Funeral a movie that irked me possibly because Grant passed up the alluringly neurotic Kristin Scott Thomas for the vapidly bovine Andie MacDowell possibly because its dizzy romantic badinage was interrupted for easy pathos involving a fatal heart attack and other real world calamities Curtis is ingenious in his slapstick farce and spoof mode less assured when the emotional ante is upped In Notting Hill he hasn t really thought through the character of Anna Scott He must know how lucky he is that Julia Roberts arrived with so much astounding baggage A friend of mine once worked for a big movie star When I asked if that star was a nice guy he looked at me the way Stephen Hawking might if you asked whether a black hole was a nice place Uh I suppose he s nice said my friend He s nice for a star But when you re a star and you go to restaurants for instance the waiters and owners fall all over you and send you drinks and food and eventually you take that kind of attention for granted and pretty soon you expect everything to revolve around you and then you get upset when it doesn t Stars he concluded sometimes bestow their favors graciously but they re never nice Being a star precludes niceness The best thing to be said about the Anna Scott of Roberts an actress certainly capable of playing nice is that she isn t nice for a second In fact Roberts seems to welcome the opportunity to be as flat and guarded as shut down as possible while still giving an ingratiating performance According to a profile in Vanity Fair Roberts protested the script s depiction of Anna s distraught reaction to the release of a nude video She argued that Anna would have learned not to let tabloid scandals get to her because that way lies madness The director reminded her as one might a small child that she was playing Anna not Julia but I side with the actress here Whatever depth this character has is the upshot of Roberts attempt to communicate something about her own celebrity to say that it has made her overdefended and that it s a constant battle to stay human in the face of so much attention Roberts began her career with a supernatural amount of charisma and sometimes wobbly technique She was a skittish thoroughbred who needed to be handled i e directed with care As she has become more self sufficient she has become more interesting She wasn t afraid to embrace the more heartlessly grasping side of her character in My Best Friend s Wedding 1997 and her turn as a strange Medusa like seductress on a recent Law Order was a tour de force I missed her in last year s Stepmom my raccoon had hepatitis She doesn t need her Pretty Woman laughing shtick to hold your attention She trusts her features which are huge and nearly clownlike in their dimensions but which somehow coalesce into a heart stopping symmetry Is it my imagination though or have those lips become even more pillowy Leave them alone Julia In Notting Hill Roberts takes rejection with a frozen smile Thus shielded she has never looked so exposed Her Anna is such a cauldron of unresolved impulses rage petulance fear deceptiveness promiscuity that it s no wonder that the filmmakers had to tack on a corny too pat coda that spells out the couple s happily ever afterhood There s no way we could otherwise picture a stable future Roberts has left the movie s cozy romantic fantasyland in a pile of jagged shards N otting Hill opens with an superfluous voice over that sets the scene and makes certain that the audience is oriented In contrast Bernardo Bertolucci s Besieged from a script that the director wrote with Clare Peploe has no narration and little dialogue The intent is to keep the audience disoriented It works maybe to a fault The film opens in Africa where the husband of Shandurai Thandie Newton is seized by soldiers for insolence toward the country s authoritarian ruler When we encounter the young woman again she has taken a job as the live in domestic at a huge and crumbling Roman townhouse belonging to an English loner named Jason Kinsky David Thewlis All day this gangling bug eyed oddball plays Scriabin on his grand piano while Shandurai dusts vacuums sews irons and launders Then he sends a ring down the dumbwaiter to her basement room by way of proposing marriage I frankly don t know what to make of Besieged which attempts to forge a complicated relationship between its protagonists through pure cinema and has won admiration for being allusive elusive elliptical and other words that begin with a and e enigmatic ambivalent evocative etc In one sequence Kinsky struggles to compose a piece while Shandurai vacuums The camera swings from side to side with Shandurai and her vacuum cleaner then from side to side with Kinsky and his chords as he becomes increasingly inspired Is this satire or does Bertolucci really mean to suggest a higher communion I fear the latter And are Kinsky s rippling Philip Glass like progressions meant to suggest profundity or empty pretentiousness I fear the former The movie has virtuoso passages Bertolucci is one of the few filmmakers whose technique is simultaneously sweeping and probing His camera sweeps and then stops to probe it fixes on an object and holds it up for scrutiny and then goes back to sweeping But what he means by what he shows is anybody s guess It s possible that Besieged is meant to be vaguely allegorical The African is seduced by the crumbling decadence of Europe while the European falls for the childlike simplicity of Africa But I sure hope not
