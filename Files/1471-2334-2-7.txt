 Background The replicative polymerase of herpes simplex virus HSV is comprised of catalytic Pol and processivity subunits UL42 9 11 HSV Pol is responsible in concert with other viral proteins for regulating the fidelity of DNA replication by selecting the correct nucleotides for incorporation and by proofreading or editing mispaired nucleotides 20 The Pol subunit contains intrinsic 3 5 exonuclease activity 14 15 16 and the N terminal region of the polypeptide encoding this function is highly conserved in other polymerases containing three segments referred to as Exo motifs 3 26 Thymidine kinase polypeptide TK is required for the activation of some antiviral nucleoside analogs e g acyclovir ACV and penciclovir PCV in order to inhibit viral DNA replication HSV with TK mutations may impair activation of these drugs and confer a drug resistant phenotype The natural phenomenon of spontaneous mutation which occurs in the absence of drug selection results in the accumulation of approximately six to eight TK deficient variants per 10 4plaque forming viruses in virus populations that have never been exposed to selective pressure 6 10 12 Furthermore HSV 2 clinical isolates were shown to have a higher frequency of spontaneous mutations resistant to ACV and PCV approximately 30 fold compared to HSV 1 isolates and the majority of these mutations are in tk Consistent with this observation HSV 2 strains also exhibited approximately a 20 to 80 fold higher spontaneous mutation rate to cidofovir HPMPC an inhibitor of HSV Pol resistance compared with HSV 1 21 Therefore these naturally occuring mutations are not unique to tk and TK substrates as detected with antiviral agents ACV and PCV but were extended with the direct Pol inhibitor HPMPC to other loci most likely pol Since mutations within the viral pol gene have been previously shown to affect spontaneous viral mutation rates 10 the higher frequency of errors associated with type 2 viruses may be an inherent property of the type 2 Pol To assess the direct contribution of polymerases from virus types 1 and 2 to mutation frequency recombinant HSV expressing a type 2 Pol within a type 1 viral genome were generated by marker transfer and examined along with a panel of other HSV isolates in two mutagenesis assays Materials and methods Cell lines compounds and viruses Vero ATCC passage 15 20

Construction of recombinant viruses Marker transfer experiments involved co transfection of HSV 2 pol coding region HSV 2 SB5 HSV 2 83D HSV 2 6652 and HSV 2 6757 described in 21 with HP66 viral DNA into Vero cells Recombinant virus was plaque purified to homogeneity in the presence of X Gal The pol coding region from the recombinant viruses was confirmed to be identical to their respective parental virus pol sequences by terminator cycle sequencing using an automated model 377 DNA sequencer Perkin Elmer Applied Biosystems Virus growth analysis To compare the ability of parental viruses and recombinant viruses to replicate in Vero cells with that of the wild type HSV 2 SB5 strain 3 10 5Vero cells were infected with each virus at a multiplicity of infection of 5 PFU per cell Virus progeny were harvested at different time points and titered on Vero cells All viruses yielded similar PFU ml data not shown Plasmid construction A non HSV gene template pSV110 was constructed by taking the plasmid pSV gal Promega and inserting the HSV 1 origin of replication ori S SmaI fragment 5 The plasmid pTK1 contains HSV 1 SC16 sequence coordinates 45 055 48 634 subcloned into the HindIII EcoRI site of pUC19 Invitrogen The plasmid pTK2 contains HSV 2 SB5 sequence coordinates 44 469 48 184 subcloned into the HindIII EcoRI site of pUC19 The plasmid pLacZ contains the LacZ coding region from pSV gal subcloned into the HindIII EcoRI site of pUC19 Transient replication rescue assay Vero cells were seeded at 3 10 5cells per 2 mL well in a six well plate and incubated overnight at 37 C The following day cells were transfected with 1 5 g of pSV110 and 1 g of salmon sperm DNA using Lipofectamine reagent according to the manufacturer s recommendations Invitrogen Following overnight incubation at 37 C the medium was removed and virus inoculated at an MOI 5 in 2 mL volume for 1 h Following overnight incubation at 37 C the cells demonstrated CPE and the infected cell monolayer was rinsed twice with 1X phosphate buffered saline Next cell monolayers were lysed by scraping into 1 0 mL of lysis buffer 0 6 SDS 0 01 M EDTA pH 7 5 per well The infected cell lysate was adjusted to a final concentration of 1 M NaCl inverted 10X and stored at 4 C overnight The samples were centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 C and the supernatant was collected treated with 100 g ml RNAse at 37 C for one hour Following that incubation 100 g mL Proteinase K was added and samples were incubated at 50 C for 2 hours After several phenol chloroform extractions the DNA was precipitated centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 C and the pellets resuspended in 50 l water and incubated at 37 C for 2 hours To remove non replicated templates 2 5 g of infected cell DNA was digested with Dpn I and precipitated centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 C and resuspended in 20 l dH 2 O One fourth of the DpnI treated DNA was transformed into DH5 cells recombination deficient bacterial cells Invitrogen The transformation mix was plated onto several LB AMP plates containing Xgal and isopropyl D thiogalactoside IPTG The number of blue colonies indicating no mutation in galactosidase gene and white colonies indicating mutation within galactosidase gene or promoter were determined An average of 300 000 colonies were recovered from three independent experiments for each virus infection Two control samples were included in each experiment to normalize for mutations induced by transfection or superinfection processes For the transfection control pSV110 was transfected into Vero cells mock infected and directly transformed into bacteria for blue white colony screening For the superinfection control pSV110 was transfected into Vero cells superinfected with HP66 Pol mutant virus which is unable to replicate and transformed into bacteria for blue white colony screening For the controls both DpnI and non DpnI treated samples were anlayzed The values in Table 2are presented as mutation frequency which is number of white colonies from test sample number of blue colonies from test sample number of white colonies from HP66 superinfection sample number of blue colonies from HP66 superinfection sample 100 S1 nuclease digestion assay Supercoiled plasmids 5 g were treated with 3 units S1 nuclease or mock treated in S1 nuclease buffer Invitrogen containing 100 mM final concentration of NaCl for 5 min at 37 C Reactions were stopped by performing two phenol and two phenol chloroform extractions DNA was precipitated with ethanol centrifuged and resuspended in dH 2 O for digestion with restriction enzymes as indicated Restriction digested samples were electrophoresed on a 0 8 agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide for visualization Two separate plasmid purifications were utilized for this study with similar results Results Pol recombinant viruses HSV 2 pol SB5 83D 6652 and 6757 described in 21 or HSV 1 pol SC16 and PAA r5 coding regions were co transfected with replication defective HP66 viral DNA containing a LacZ insertion within pol 17 into Vero cells to generate recombinant viruses Recombinant viruses were successfully obtained for all pols except wild type HSV 1 SC16 and the low error rate or antimutator HSV 1 PAA r5 10 The pol recombinant viruses were plaque purified and the pol genes completely sequenced along with those of their parental viruses to confirm the recombination event Three of the HSV 2 viruses HSV 2 SB5 HSV 2 6652 and HSV 2 83D had pol sequences consistent with wild type isolates found in GeneBank and were recently characterized 21 The pol from HSV 2 6757 a virus which showed a 300 to 700 fold higher error rate than HSV 1 SC16 by the tk mutagenesis assay previously 21 was found to contain three mutations compared to the other HSV 2 pols with one change residing in region VII which is shared among diverse DNA polymerases Fig 1 No amino acid changes were identified within the proofreading Exo domains The high frequency of errors generated by HSV 2 6757 did not appear to preclude its ability to replicate efficiently in culture In fact no significant differences in the growth curve of parental and recombinant viruses in Vero cells compared to wild type HSV 2 SB5 were apparent data not shown tkmutagenesis assay The proportions of virus resistant to ACV or PCV which arise during amplification of virus stocks in the absence of drug selection were measured by the method described by Hall et al 10 Plating efficiency assays were performed in MRC 5 cells at 3 g ml ACV which is 10 times higher than the average IC 50 for HSV 1 SVC16 and at 8 g ml ACV which is 10 times higher than the average IC 50 for the panel of HSV 2 viruses Notably whereas the four HSV 2 parental viruses had spontaneous mutation frequencies significantly higher than HSV 1 isolates Table 1 the frequency of errors from pol recombinant viruses expressing an HSV 2 Pol in an HSV 1 background were indistinguishable from HSV 1 SC16 when tested in MRC 5 cells In fact three of the type 2 pol recombinant viruses SB5PR 6652PR and 83DPR had error rates equal to or slightly lower than HSV 1 SC16 0 05 Results were similar for plating efficiency with PCV data not shown In this assay the HSV 2 Pol does not appear to be solely responsible for the difference in drug resistant spontaneous tk mutations observed between HSV 1 and HSV 2 strains Interestingly unlike the other pol recombinant viruses 6757PR containing the pol coding region from the supermutator clinical isolate HSV 2 6757 retained a high spontaneous mutation frequency This recombinant virus showed a sixty fold increase in mutation frequency compared to HSV 1 SC16 Table 1 This increase in errors is most likely the direct result of the mutations identified within the pol coding region and suggests that this virus may indeed possess a Pol defect in replication fidelity The fact that the 6757PR mutation frequency was 3 5 whilst parental HSV 2 6757 was 20 28 implicates the target template or other viral proteins in modulating spontaneous mutations Drug independent mutation frequency using non HSV DNA To eliminate any contribution of drug selection or tk gene template on the spontaneous mutation frequency in the tk mutagenesis assay non drug selected HSV replication dependent mutations within an unrelated prokaryotic gene were measured using a LacZ shuttle plasmid assay This assay employed transfection of a plasmid containing the 230 bp SmaI fragment of ori s the HSV origin of replication and a LacZ reporter gene into Vero cells This plasmid was confirmed to generate DpnI resistant progeny in Vero cells upon superinfection with the wild type HSV 1 and HSV 2 data not shown After superinfection DpnI resistant non methylated replicated plasmid DNA was rescued in E coli In the presence of X Gal bacterial colonies which turn blue do not contain mutations in the LacZ promoter or LacZ coding region However colonies remaining white contain mutations to impair LacZ expression Mutations can be introduced during replication by the viral proteins or also by the mutagenic processes of transfection and viral infection Since the process of transfection is often mutagenic pSV110 was transfected into Vero cells mock infected and rescued into bacteria to determine background frequency of mutation from the experimental process Transfection was found to confer a mutation frequency less than 0 002 6 white colonies in over 300 000 total colonies after analyzing non DpnI treated samples No colonies were recovered when treating the rescued DNA with DpnI Moreover to ensure that viral replication and not simply the process of viral infection is responsible for the mutations in a rescued plasmid a control transfection superinfection was performed using the pol mutant HP66 which is unable to replicate The mutation frequency contributed directly from the process of viral infection was 0 12 335 in over 280 000 colonies after analyzing non DpnI treated samples Less than 25 colonies were recovered when treating the rescued DNA with DpnI The data presented in Table 2was normalized by subtracting the mutation frequency for HP66 infection 0 12 The relative mutation frequency for the panel of viruses tested in the non HSV DNA mutagenesis assay are presented in Table 2 Consistent with recent data from Hwang et al 13 PAA r5 showed a minor increase in mutation frequency compared with wild type HSV 1 and HSV 2 Table 2 The presence of an antimutator phenotype with this viral polymerase in the tk mutagenesis assay was not apparent when using the non HSV DNA mutagenesis assay and therefore phenotype labelling may be dependent upon both the assay method and or the target gene Moreover the panel of wild type HSV 2 viruses and the PR viruses in this LacZ phenotypic assay had mutation frequencies similar or below that of wild type HSV 1 SC16 Thus the high proportion of errors associated with HSV 2 viruses appears specific to the tk mutagenesis assay HSV 2 6757 although not 6757PR conferred a slightly higher proportion of mutations in non HSV DNA in the plasmid assay than wild type HSV 1 and HSV 2 consistent with a mutator phenotype Sequencing of the Pol encoded from HSV 2 6757 confirmed several residue changes which may contribute to the higher error rate although the direct relationship of these individual mutations within the pol coding region to decreased Pol fidelity has not been confirmed Figure 1 It remains unclear whether a conserved residue change Lys to Arg at 943 in region VII a motif purported to participate in the recognition of the PPi and nucleotide substrates 27 or whether one or more of the other three residue changes identified in HSV 2 6757 pol cooperate to affect mutation frequency Anisomorphic DNA conformations Reiterated sequence elements are often observed to form an unwound S1 nuclease sensitive DNA conformation termed anisomorphic or left handed DNA when present in negatively supercoiled plasmids 22 24 Nuclease sensitive secondary structures within the HSV origin of replication are believed to be recognized by the viral origin binding protein and mutations that reduce this complex formation in vitro also reduce viral replication thereby indicating that localized torsional strain may occur during viral DNA replication 1 The tk mutagenesis assay measures replication dependent mutation frequency within the tk gene whereas the non HSV DNA mutagenesis assay measures errors within a bacterial LacZ gene Three pUC based plasmids were examined for the potential to form S1 nuclease sensitive structures pTK1 which contains a 3 6 Kb HSV 1 DNA fragment including the tk coding region pTK2 containing a 3 7 Kb HSV 2 DNA fragment including the tk coding region and pLacZ which contains the 3 4 Kb LacZ coding region These negatively supercoiled plasmids were treated with S1 nuclease or mock treated for 5 min After removal of the nuclease the plasmids were linearized with HindIII Figure 2shows that treatment of pTK1 and pLacZ with S1 nuclease did not alter the restriction enzyme profile suggesting that in this assay the formation of S1 nuclease sensitive structures was below the level of detection Fig 2 lanes 3 6 However pTK2 was readily digested with S1 nuclease which resulted in the appearance of four novel bands suggesting two potential nuclease hypersensitive sites Fig 2 lane 2 Additional restriction mapping studies suggest that the hypersensitive regions are within the viral DNA fragment and not in pUC DNA data not shown Discussion The tk mutagenesis assay has been utilized by ourselves and others 10 13 to determine both frequency and spectrum of mutations in the HSV tk gene following selection for drug resistance In this study we have extended the findings of previous work 13 by using pol recombinant viruses to examine mutation frequency in HSV Specifically this study evaluated the contribution of type 2 polymerase to mutation frequency when measured by the tk mutagenesis and non HSV DNA mutagenesis assays The control viruses HSV 2 6757 and HSV 1 PAA r5 demonstrated mutator or antimutator phenotypes respectively in the tk mutagenesis assay but not in the non HSV DNA mutagenesis assay Thus classification of a pol gene as mutator HSV 2 6757 or antimutator PAA r5 is not a general characteristic but is likely dependent upon the assay method and target gene This observation is consistent with the recent report of high mutation frequency within the SupF gene upon replication by PAA r5 13 Since the control viruses described above functioned as expected in the tk mutagenesis assay recombinant viruses expressing the HSV 2 polymerase within an HSV 1 genome were also examined Interestingly three wild type HSV 2 polymerases 6652 83D and SB5 showed mutation frequencies similar to HSV 1 SC16 rather than their parental virus when placed within an HSV 1 genome Only HSV 2 6757 maintained a high error rate 60 fold over that of HSV 1 SC16 when placed within an HSV 1 genome However the mutation frequency of this recombinant virus HSV 2 6757PR was not completely penetrant when compared to the parental HSV 2 6757 virus which showed a 400 fold higher percent of resistant mutants compared to HSV 1 SC16 An important distinguishing factor between the tk mutagenesis and LacZ test systems is the use of antiviral selectors to measure mutation frequency Silent mutations within the tk gene that do not impair susceptibility to antiviral agents or mutations resulting in lethality of the virus would escape detection as a mutation in the tk mutagenesis assay Futhermore the DNA sequence being replicated is unique between these systems and this could contribute to the differences in mutation frequency between assay systems The demonstration of S1 nuclease sensitive sites within the type 2 viral genome overlapping the tk coding region and the absence of such sites in the type 1 viral genome suggest that local topology may be different between these HSV 1 and HSV 2 Although the potential contribution of this supercoiling induced phenomenon to modulate mutation frequency during viral replication is unclear it could partially explain why the type 2 polymerases confer a high mutation frequency to HSV 2 genomes and a low mutation frequency when placed within an HSV 1 genome Changes in local topology could contribute to polymerase slippage and the incorporation of errors The inability of type 2 viruses to confer a higher mutation rate than type 1 viruses in the non HSV DNA mutagenesis assay is consistent with the absence of S1 nuclease hypersensitive sites in the LacZ gene fragment Furthermore the HSV 2 tk sequence used herein contained almost 69 G C content compared to the HSV 1 tk which has 65 of bases as G or C Melting temperature alone may not contribute to the difference in S1 nuclease sensitivity However alignment of the tk sequences showed that the type 2 gene had at least eight distinct stretches containing between 7 and 13 G C bases whereas the overlapping region in the type 1 tk had four or less G C bases This differential in more extensive G C rich regions supports the observations reported herein The data presented herein clearly demonstrate that polymerase alone may not account for the high mutation frequency associated with type 2 viruses in the tk mutagenesis assay In addition to the potential impact of target sequence and secondary structure topology on mutation frequency other viral replicative proteins including Pol accessory protein TK dUTPase and uracil DNA glycosylase may cooperate with Pol to modulate polymerase repair and nucleotide
