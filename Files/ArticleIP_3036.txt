 White Heat Should we be sad that James Cagney is slipping from memory or was it inevitable that his star would fade These days Cagney s image tends to flicker He s that tough guy who talks so fast you can hardly hear the words and who at the end of his films gets killed Few people know Cagney s performances as intimately as they know the high points of the performances of Humphrey Bogart or Jimmy Stewart or Cary Grant Or compare Cagney with fellow macho icon John Wayne The punk gangster s stock has fallen while the silent cowboy s keeps on rising What Americans do recall about Cagney they re likely to have picked up from imitators including of all people Sammy Davis Jr who loved to mimic his nasal rapid fire delivery and to re enact that moment at the end of his films when he gets plugged with what seems like 300 bullets and reels theatrically for 12 minutes before dropping dead Cagney s slow fade is especially surprising when you consider how much the genre he helped to invent the gangster film thrives As described by John McCabe in his old fashioned and sometimes overly affectionate new biography the street milieu that Cagney brought to the screen seems contemporary too He was born in 1899 on Manhattan s Lower East Side into an Irish family facing problems you can still see every week on NYPD Blue His father was a tragic combination of saloonkeeper and drunk who died relatively young during the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 His mother was a martyr with Irish red hair the stuff Oedipus complexes are made of He grew up all the way east on 76 th Street in Yorkville and although he seems to have been a mama s boy a loner who liked to read tough guys in the neighborhood gave him nicknames like Red Runt and Short Shit and forced him to learn how to fight A few of them also taught him Yiddish a language he adored and drew on throughout his life for insults He called his main career nemesis studio head Jack Warner the Schvontz one of Yiddish s many creative terms for prick Cagney s first showbiz gig was unplanned and inauspicious a musical revue about sailors in drag According to McCabe the need to support his fatherless family not vain hopes of becoming a star is what drove him He worked his way up in vaudeville perfecting a distinctive style of dance in which he stiffened his legs and stuck out his butt and he was playing a sniveling bootlegger on Broadway when Warner recruited him to Hollywood in 1930 While other movie companies of the early 30s filmed literary adaptations or drawing room comedies or musicals Warner Bros which specialized in no frills realism set Cagney to work in a cycle of social problem flicks movies drawn from headlines about striking milk truck drivers warring taxi unions and of course gangsters These films claimed to warn America about its urban ills but what Cagney s first breakout hit The Public Enemy 1931 conveyed was the charisma of the amoral hood He played Tom Powers a street punk who gets rich running booze during Prohibition grows too big for his britches and winds up being shot Other actors had played scum but only Cagney played scum with an awesome dignity like a predator in a nature documentary Years later Kenneth Tynan said this was the role that let audiences admit they d take a stinking lowlife over a fussbudget hero any day The career that followed is a good example of how shrewd the old studio system was at figuring out exactly what a star is supposed to do and an even better example of how the system locked stars into an increasingly stultifying caricature of their greatest roles Cagney riffed on this hard boiled persona for about a decade most harrowingly in Angels With Dirty Faces 1938 playing Rocky Sullivan a killer who freaks out just as he s about to go to the electric chair The audience is left to guess if Rocky is spineless or if he s just trying to convince all the kids who worship him that crime doesn t pay To keep his fans from getting bored he improvised what he called goodies little touches like kicking a chair out from under his co star Shortly before he died Cagney described to McCabe his method of acting Basically he listened Watch Cagney while someone else is speaking and you ll see a darting eye a quivering eyebrow a split second grin He hardly moves but he makes everyone on screen seem important and he creates a rare kind of in the scene suspense Nonetheless he kept getting stuck with hack directors and predictable scripts Relief came when he got to play the great Irish song and dance man George M Cohan in the musical Yankee Doodle Dandy 1942 At last a showcase for his stiff legged routine and a chance to be recognized as a wholesome patriot instead of a rat He thought he d broken out of his niche but Warner still wanted to boss him around So in 1942 Cagney became one of the first stars to start his own production company Unfortunately in his rush to change his image he picked a string of sappy pseudo profound roles He was a gentle country newspaperman Johnny Come Lately 1943 or a lovable alcoholic who sits in a bar all day musing over the destinies of his friends Time of Your Life 1948 A couple of times during this period he d test screen a film the audience would object to the new passive Cagney and he d have to shoot a new ending in which he went crazy and punched someone out McCabe leaves the impression that Cagney never got over this rejection of his sentimental side When he started out in show business he was something of a lefty living briefly on a quasisocialist commune in New Jersey sending money to striking Mexican lettuce pickers and naming Stalin and Gandhi as his favorite human beings in a survey in 1933 But he was less an ideologue than an idealist and as he got older his views shifted to the right In fact beneath Cagney s amoral public image there seems to have been a Norman Rockwell struggling to get out In his spare time he wrote naive mystical verse about God s presence in nature All space is filled with wondrous things Unseen by human eye Before us hover kings and queens With realms that float and fly Perhaps the most shocking fact revealed in Cagney is the actor s lifelong secret desire to leave Hollywood and go into agriculture He bought a number of farms and apparently loved to sit in the pasture and meditate on his cows Cagney s corniness never really worked on screen the goodies were drowned out by windy speeches but when he turned it upside down in White Heat his great 1949 comeback to the gangster genre he was unmatched as a ruthless pervert He played Cody Jarrett the head of a bank robbing gang who was trained in criminality by his mother and who though well into middle age still dotes on her with an infant s fierce love White Heat features two of Cagney s greatest primal tantrums in prison when he finds out that his mother is dead and moans like a maniac and at a chemical refinery where he screams Top of the world Ma and then gets shot by the police and consumed by fire To play someone this unpredictable today we might turn to an actor like Nicolas Cage But Cage s eruptions look narcissistic next to Cagney s When he snaps he s not responding to other people in a scene he s hearing voices in his head The other obvious comparisons to Cagney are Robert De Niro and Al Pacino but they re prestige actors cerebral introverted and usually not as funny I tried to think of a modern actor who is as natural as Cagney and to my surprise the name that made the most sense was John Travolta Like Cagney he has a dancer s grace In Saturday Night Fever his charisma elevated junk to greatness and in Pulp Fiction he played a dirt bag with just the right winking theatricality Also a few years ago when left to choose his own material Travolta made the hideous Phenomenon thereby demonstrating a Cagneyesque taste for treacly fables The search for a modern Cagney is a vain one nobody could compare to him So why do we remember Wayne so much better One reason is that Cagney didn t make enough really great films But there s a larger explanation Wayne had the good luck to rule over Westerns a genre that was set on wide open land and commemorated the past and dealt in stark moral truths a genre doomed to grow obsolete leaving Wayne to dominate the landscape a proud and lonely warrior Cagney s charisma launched what looks decades later like the most enduring film style of all He s been sucked into the cultural ether His skepticism and short fuse which once seemed so radical are taught at the Actors Studio His name may be vanishing but more than ever he s everywhere
