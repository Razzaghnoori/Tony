 Background Type 1 diabetes mellitus T1DM is a T cell mediated autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans with subsequent destruction of the insulin producing beta cells 1 Non obese diabetic NOD female mice a murine model for T1DM spontaneously develop diabetes by 30 weeks of age with infiltrating cells appearing around the pancreatic islets as early as at 3 4 weeks of age 2 T1DM susceptibility in the NOD mouse is linked to I A g7 the murine MHC class II gene that encodes a histidine at position 56 and a serine at position 57 in the chain in place of the more frequent proline 56 and aspartic acid 57 3 The development of diabetes is prevented in NOD PD mice which are NOD mice with I A g7 that carry a chain transgene with site specific mutations that restore proline and aspartic acid at positions 56 and 57 respectively 4 Furthermore because of the two amino acid changes in the additional transgenic MHC class II allele chain in NOD PD mice NOD PD mice recognize three additional peptide epitopes in the glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 GAD65 autoantigen 5 Among beta cell autoantigens GAD65 is an important initial target of the immune response that results in beta cell destruction and diabetes in both humans and NOD mice 6 7 8 9 While both humoral and cellular responses to GAD65 occur as early as 4 weeks of age in NOD mice 8 there is considerable evidence that beta cell specific T H 1 cells are the effectors of T1DM whereas T H 2 cells appear to have a protective role 10 Accordingly a shift of the autoimmune response from T H 1 to T H 2 predominance has represented a promising strategy for prevention of diabetes and other T H 1 mediated autoimmune diseases For example administration of GAD65 to young NOD mice has been shown to prevent insulitis and diabetes 8 9 apparently via induction of CD4 regulatory T cells with a T H 2 phenotype 10 Similarly treatment with immunodominant peptides of myelin can prevent or reverse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis EAE a T H 1 associated inducible autoimmune disorder that is widely used as a model for human multiple sclerosis 11 12 13 Unfortunately recent work indicates that the application of strategies to shift autoimmune responses from T H 1 to T H 2 predominance is not without risk Thus some of us recently showed that administration of two self peptides that can induce EAE myelin proteolipid protein peptide 139 to 151 PLP139 151 or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide 35 55 MOG35 55 can result in severe anaphylactic reactions 14 This result clearly indicated that severe allergic reactions to self peptides can occur in mice that have been induced to express pathology i e EAE related to autoimmunity to these peptides However it was initially unclear whether anaphylactic reactivity also could be elicited to self peptides that have been implicated in the development of a spontaneous autoimmune disorder In the present study we show that anti peptide autoantibodies and fatal anaphylactic reactions can be elicited by immunodominant GAD65 peptides in NOD mice that have been injected with these peptides intraperitoneally in incomplete Freund s adjuvant IFA as part of an attempt to induce tolerance and prevent the spontaneous development of T1DM Moreover while this manuscript was in review Liu and colleagues reported that anti peptide autoantibodies and fatal anaphylaxis can be induced in NOD mice that have been immunized with insulin B chain peptides B 9 23 or B 13 23 15 However in the Liu et al study the peptides were administered subcutaneously in saline without adjuvant As reviewed in Liu et al 15 several lines of evidence indicate that amino acids 9 23 of the insulin B chain also represent a major target of anti islet autoimmunity in T1DM Taken together with the findings reported herein this work indicates that anaphylactic reactions can be elicited in mice that have been immunized with pancreatic islet associated self peptides that also represent significant targets of autoimmunity in T1DM Results Anaphylactic responses to GAD65 and PD peptides In an attempt to induce a T H 2 shift 19 20 8 to 9 week old female NOD mice I A g7 were immunized by 3 weekly i p injections of the immunodominant G7 peptides GAD 206 226 217 236 286 300 or of the additional GAD65 peptides identified in NOD PD mice I A NOD PD GAD 333 345 K458 470R in IFA 5 As noted in the background section PD peptides are not immunodominant in NOD mice Indeed we originally included the PD immunized group because PD peptides are the immunodominant epitopes that are presented in transgenic NOD PD mice that do not get diabetes 4 5 Because of their unknown and potentially even protective role in the diabetes resistant NOD PD strain we felt that it was important to assess whether through a peptide therapy regimen PD peptides might be able to protect against diabetes by shifting T H 1 to T H 2 responses in NOD mice As our study unfolded and we found that G7 peptide therapy induced anaphylactic reactivity in NOD mice we felt that it was important to evaluate whether PD peptides might also induce allergic responses in the NOD strain As demonstrated in our study immunization of NOD mice with PD peptides can induce both a specific IgG1 response and also anaphylactic reactivity On the other hand as might be predicted PD peptides induced a less robust IgG1 response Figure 2 and also a lower incidence and severity of anaphylaxis see Table 1and Figure 1 when injected into NOD mice than did G7 peptides In an attempt to induce anaphylactic reactivity to peptides known to induce T H 2 responses associated with allergic reactions NOD mice were immunized using the same protocol with hen egg lysozyme and ovalbumin peptides HEL 81 96 OVA 323 339 21 22 23 As a negative control NOD mice received 3 weekly injections of saline emulsified in IFA Four weeks after the last of the 3 i p injections of peptides IFA or saline IFA mice injected with peptides IFA were challenged i p with the same peptides used for the immunizations dissolved in saline whereas mice that had been injected with saline IFA were challenged with saline alone By the day of challenge 10 15 of all mice had developed diabetes with the exception of the mice in the saline group 0 All of the mice challenged with G7 peptides developed severe anaphylactic shock 100 14 14 with the majority of them dying within 30 minutes after the injection 86 12 14 Table 1 In addition to the classical signs of anaphylaxis such as reddening of the skin prostration and respiratory impairment the mice underwent a dramatic drop in body temperature Fig 1 which confirmed the presence of anaphylactic shock Moreover the death rate from anaphylaxis was substantially higher than in any other group in which anaphylaxis occurred Table 1 On the other hand the clinical and physiological features of anaphylaxis elicited by the G7 peptides were similar to those observed in age and gender matched NOD mice undergoing IgE mediated passive systemic anaphylaxis Fig 1 Although the death rate was significantly higher in the G7 challenged NOD group 86 12 14 compared to the IgE sensitized DNP HSA challenged group none P 0 0001 by Fisher s exact test Table 1 those mice in either group that developed anaphylaxis exhibited quite similar drops in body temperature Fig 1B Similarly while the group of mice that was challenged with G7 peptides exhibited a higher incidence of anaphylactic responses than did the group challenged with HEL OVA peptides Table 1 the temperature changes Fig 1B and death rates Table 1 in mice that did develop a reaction were quite similar None of the na ve age gender matched NOD mice these mice received no injection prior to challenge that were challenged with G7 peptides showed any signs of anaphylaxis 0 9 P 0 0001 by Fisher s exact test for comparison vs G7 immunized G7 challenged mice Table 1 Fig 1 This result indicates that priming of these mice with G7 peptides is required for the elicitation of the allergic response Of the mice immunized with the PD peptides that are not immunodominant in NOD mice 43 3 7 developed anaphylactic shock at the time of challenge with PD peptides Table 1 Thus the incidence of anaphylactic shock in mice immunized and challenged with PD peptides was significantly lower than that in mice immunized and challenged with immunodominant G7 peptides P 0 0058 by Fisher s exact test Moreover of those PD immunized PD challenged mice that did exhibit an anaphylactic reaction the drop in temperature was less sustained than that in those mice in the other groups that exhibited anaphylaxis Fig 1B and only 1 of these mice died 33 Table 1 In accord with these results immunization of the NOD mice with PD peptides produced a less robust specific IgG1 antibody response than did immunization with the immunodominant G7 peptides see below As expected none of the mice immunized with saline IFA alone developed anaphylaxis upon i p challenge with saline Table 1 Fig 1 Notably in the mice immunized with G7 PD or HEL OVA emulsified in IFA anaphylactic responses were also provoked by the third i p immunization with peptides 10 12 in the G7 group 3 4 for PD 3 10 for HEL OVA However these anaphylactic responses were less severe than those induced by subsequent peptide challenge of the same mice with a less dramatic drop in body temperature data not shown and no deaths Finally although the numbers of mice that had developed diabetes by the day of peptide challenge in each of the immunized groups was small 10 15 there were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of anaphylactic reactions in these mice vs mice that were normoglycemic at the time of peptide challenge IgG1 IgG2a and IgE responses Antibody responses were analyzed by ELISA in serum obtained 2 to 3 days before the 4 week challenge with peptides or saline Mice immunized with the G7 peptides had high IgG titers against the G7 peptides with levels of IgG1 being significantly higher than those of IgG2a P 0 0001 by Mann Whitney U test 2 tailed Figure 2A Anti G7 IgG antibodies generally were not detectable in the other groups PD or HEL OVA immunized or IFA alone or in the non injected na ve mice The two exceptions were a single non immunized mouse with anti G7 IgG1 antibodies at a serum concentration of 90 g ml and one mouse immunized with HEL OVA with anti G7 IgG2a antibodies at a serum concentration of 492 ng ml Anti peptide IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies also were detected in PD Figure 2B and HEL OVA Figure 2C immunized mice although the magnitude of the antibody responses to these peptides especially the IgG1 response were substantially less than those to the G7 peptides Total IgE concentrations were slightly but significantly higher in the peptide immunized groups G7 PD or HEL OVA compared to those in mice injected with IFA and saline alone Figure 3 However the serum concentrations of total IgE were very similar in the mice that had been immunized with G7 PD or HEL OVA peptides Figure 3 Discussion This study clearly demonstrates that i p immunization of NOD mice with preparations of GAD65 self peptides in IFA can cause a marked shift towards a T H 2 like response as reflected by high levels of IgG1 Similarly Liu et al recently demonstrated that strong IgG1 responses can be induced in NOD mice that have been immunized subcutaneously with insulin B chain peptides administered in physiological saline 15 However both studies showed that anaphylaxis can be induced in such mice upon subsequent re challenge with preparations of the peptides used for immunization 15 Moreover the anaphylactic reactions in mice that had been immunized and challenged with G7 peptides were severe with reductions in body temperature that were very similar to those observed in mice exhibiting IgE dependent passive systemic anaphylaxis and with a very high fatality rate 12 14 mice or 86 Anaphylaxis also developed in some NOD mice that had been immunized and challenged with preparations of PD peptides that are not immunodominant in NOD mice although both the drop in body temperature and the death rate in these mice were significantly less than those observed in the mice immunized and challenged with G7 peptides There were both similarities and differences between our findings in the NOD mouse model of T1DM and those in the EAE model 14 Expression of EAE requires specific immunization with self peptides e g PLP 139 151 or MOG35 55 and these peptides generally are administered in complete Freund s adjuvant CFA By contrast T1DM develops spontaneously in NOD mice On the other hand induction of anaphylactic reactivity in NOD mice appeared to require immunization of the mice with GAD65 peptides in this model in IFA as na ve NOD mice challenged with G7 peptides exhibited no detectible reactions and none of them died Table 1 Thus in both the EAE model 14 and the NOD T1DM model this study and that of Liu et al 15 some form of artificial immunization with a self peptide preparation appears to be required for the development of anaphylactic reactivity to self This of course is not a surprising result Indeed it is challenging to conceive of any possible selective advantage that would be conferred by a propensity to develop under natural conditions potentially fatal allergic reactions to components of self It remains to be determined whether self peptide immunization protocols that induce anaphylactic reactivity do so simply because of the manner in which they present large amounts of self peptides to the immune system or because of other factors such as the presence in the peptide preparations of aggregates or other components beside self peptide monomers Whatever the underlying reason s for the development of anaphylactic reactivity to these self peptide preparations in both the EAE and the NOD T1DM models anaphylactic reactions occurred in mice that had developed strong IgG1 responses to the relevant self peptides with only modest changes in total IgE levels In humans antigen specific anaphylactic reactivity is thought to be mediated solely or primarily by IgE antibodies whereas it has long been known that either IgE or IgG1 antibodies can mediate anaphylaxis in mice reviewed in 14 15 and 17 However it has been reported that IgG1 dependent anaphylaxis in the mouse is associated with substantially less histological evidence of mast cell degranulation than is observed in IgE dependent anaphylaxis in that species 17 In neither of the models of autoimmunity that we have studied i e EAE T1DM in NOD mice was anaphylaxis associated with histological evidence of substantial mast cell degranulation 14 data not shown Taken together these findings suggest that IgG1 antibodies contribute importantly to the development of anaphylaxis in both of these models On the other hand we can not rule out some role for IgE antibodies in these reactions Indeed Liu et al 15 found that in NOD mice that had been immunized with peptide B 9 23 treatment with both anti Fc RII RIII and anti IgE monoclonal antibodies was required to prevent anaphylaxis upon challenge with the peptide Interestingly however Liu et al 15 did not detect IgE antibodies to B 9 23 or B 13 23 in the serum of their NOD mice By contrast mice that had been immunized with B 9 23 peptide at 10 or 100 g dose exhibited a robust and dose dependent IgG1 antibody response to the peptide 15 Thus in both B 9 23 peptide associated anaphylaxis Liu et al 15 and GAD65 peptide associated anaphylaxis our study anti peptide IgG1 antibodies contribute to the response However IgE antibodies also appear to contribute to anaphylaxis to B 9 23 peptides 15 and may also be involved in our model One point not yet clarified by the comparison of the present results those of Liu et al 15 and those of Pedotti et al 14 is whether the influence of thymic expression of the self peptide on the propensity to develop anaphylactic reactivity differs in the EAE and NOD T1DM models In the study by Pedotti et al 14 it was noted that the two self peptides that induced anaphylactic reactivity MOG 35 55 and PLP139 151 are not expressed in the thymus whereas the two peptides tested that did not induce anaphylactic reactivity PLP p 178 191 and MBPA C 1 11 are expressed at that site However both GAD65 and GAD67 mRNA can be detected in the thymic medullary epithelial cells in mice 24 Thus despite thymic expression of GAD65 and GAD67 at the level of mRNA NOD mice spontaneously develop autoreactivity to these islet and brain expressed proteins and re challenge of mice that have been immunized with peptides from GAD65 results in severe anaphylactic reactions On the other hand expression of GAD65 or GAD67 protein in the thymus has not yet been reported Similarly as reviewed in Liu et al 15 although several lines of evidence indicate that insulin is present in the thymus of mice and humans it is possible that the specific insulin peptides that induced anaphylaxis in their study are not ordinarily present in that site As a result it has not yet been demonstrated that anaphylactic reactions can develop to self peptides that are expressed in the thymus It should be emphasized that NOD mice have a partial defect in thymic negative selection 25 26 a defect in Fc RIIB that can negatively regulate anaphylactic reactions 27 28 and perhaps other genetic polymorphisms that may result in immunological hyperresponsiveness The same is likely to be true in at least some patients with type 1 diabetes and in patients in the pre diabetic phase Therefore because of the risk of induction of anaphylactic sensitization extreme caution needs to be used in developing any type of antigen specific immunosuppressive therapy for the prevention or treatment of T1DM This caution probably should be extended to all attempts to shift immune responses to self or foreign antigens from a T H 1 to a T H 2 response Indeed in a recent phase II clinical trial 9 of MS patients given an altered peptide ligand APL of a myelin basic protein epitope developed immediate hypersensitivity reactions after multiple injections of the APL 29 Thus it would appear that great care must be taken when injecting preparations of putative tolerogens in attempts to suppress T H 1 mediated autoimmune diseases Methods Mice Female NOD LtJ mice The Jackson Laboratory Bar Harbor ME were maintained on Lab Diet 5K52 Purina St Louis MO under filter top barrier conditions Mice were
