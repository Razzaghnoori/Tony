 Heard of Any Good Scandals Lately Dear Dad I agree with you entirely about the Times versus local newspapers As you know when we moved down to D C a few years ago we thought we would save a little money and a few pounds of trash per week by getting the Times only on weekends But right from the start we went into serious Times withdrawal Sure the Washington Post is a good enough paper and we like its local reporting but its foreign coverage doesn t compare to the Times the Op Ed page tends to counteract the effects of my morning coffee with the exception of the divinely cranky Michael Kelly on Wednesdays long may he rant and the editors often seem clueless about how to put together an attractive and readable paper They still haven t figured out that it s a good idea to put all the high technology features in a single weekly section the way the Times does However thanks to the Internet I have been indulging my Times addiction for several years now without any additional cost or trash it makes me wonder how many other people are doing the same and just how much money the Times has lost as a result As you say we re supposed to be talking about the news But what has been most interesting to me about the news in the past few months is what has not been there namely scandal It s as if the Lewinsky business was such a big greasy nauseating chunk of scandal to swallow that the politicians and chattering classes subsequently lost their appetite for the stuff at least temporarily Before Monica it seemed as if we had entered the age of the Permanent Floating Scandal There always seemed to be at least three or four stacked up over Washington at any one time like planes waiting to land at National Airport Whitewater Travelgate the FBI files the campaign finance scandals not to mention the extra auxiliary scandals around half the cabinet Since Iran Contra it s seemed as if there s been scarcely a week in which some Washington scandal didn t hit the front page of the Times or the Post with the reporters dropping hopeful hints about there being Much More to Come and how this might all ultimately Bring the President Down But since the Much More came and several additional large indigestible helpings on top of it and still the president didn t fall it s as if the press and the politicians have gone on a scandal diet sneaking in only an occasionally guilty snack like Newt Gingrich s mistress Ironically Clinton s last two years in office seem certain to be more free of scandal than Bush s or Reagan s And along with the demise of the special prosecutor the tone of the coverage has changed I certainly haven t seen much recently of the prestige media s dreadfully sententious hand wringing along the lines of Should we be dignifying with our attention these allegations about presidential fondling as detailed in the following 62 page special report and make sure not to miss the amazing revelations from the alleged victim s college roommate about her attitudes toward oral sex Instead the tone has been pretty straightforwardly condemnatory in regard to excess prosecutorial zeal and prurient exposures of private life Still this is an eminently self correcting situation The longer Washington remains without its traditional appetite for scandal the more careless powerful people will get and eventually one of them will get blown up in a big juicy affair which will have the politicians and pundits joyfully going off the diet and gorging on all the sordid details Of course as our sainted editor here at Slate Michael Kinsley has often said the real scandal is not what s illegal but what s legal and going on all the time Do you think there s any chance that the media s temporary diet will encourage more reporters to look at this other kind of scandal instead of dreaming about being the next Bob Woodward Well I see I ve gotten to the end of my page and a half and haven t gotten to the news either like father like son So why don t you begin Any thoughts on Chechnya John McCain Love David
