 PRESENTATION of CASE A 25 y old woman presented with pulmonary embolism She had been taking without apparent complication norgestimate ethynil estradiol Ortho Tri Cyclen 0 180 0 215 and 0 250 mg norgestimate cycles and 35 g ethinyl estradiol for 2 y followed by the same drug combination but with a lower dose of ethinyl estradiol Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo 25 g ethinyl estradiol for 14 mo A nonsmoker she lacked a relevant family history and was vigorously athletic One month prior to presentation she developed neck pain disc protrusion at C5 C6 was detected by magnetic resonance imaging The patient was prescribed valdecoxib 20 mg twice a day b i d for 2 wk Her neck pain resolved However towards the end of this treatment period she developed left sided pleuritic chest and shoulder pain after a 6 h car ride She was started on cyclobenzaprine 10 mg b i d and continued on valdecoxib Her left sided pain abated gradually However 18 d later she developed right sided chest and shoulder pain A diagnosis of left iliac vein thrombosis and bilateral pulmonary emboli was based on a computed tomography scan She was heparinized and continued on therapy with warfarin 5 mg b i d and enoxaparin 60 mg b i d Despite this a ventilation perfusion scan performed 13 d later showed multiple pulmonary emboli Figure 1 Currently the patient is on warfarin 2 5 mg daily while completing a 6 mo warfarin regimen Her warfarin is well tolerated and otherwise the patient is in good health DISCUSSION Coxibs selective inhibitors of cyclooxygenase 2 COX 2 increase the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke 1 3 prompting concern for patients with established cardiovascular disease Caution may also extend to individuals predisposed to thrombosis by genetic or environmental factors Risk factors for spontaneous thrombosis include oral contraceptives genetic predisposition to a hypercoaguable state and prolonged periods of stasis 4 6 At least two risk factors pertained to this patient The patient had been taking oral contraceptives for 3 y prior to the index event albeit without recognized thrombotic complication It is possible that despite this extended period of apparent tolerance the embolic events were solely related to use of the oral contraceptives 4 The relatively small risk of venous thromboembolism attributable to oral contraceptive use may interact geometrically with the similarly small absolute risk of a procoagulant mutation such as Factor V Leiden 5 However documented genetic risk factors such as abnormalities in lupus anticoagulant anti thrombin III proteins C and S plasma homocysteine anticardiolipin 2 glycoprotein antibody and prothrombotic mutations in Factor V and prothrombin were excluded It remains possible that the patient was genetically predisposed to thrombosis by a mutation in an undetermined factor Finally prolonged stasis such as that which occurred during the 6 h car trip may account for the clinical event 6 However the absolute risk is small and the patient had made this trip on multiple occasions devoid of apparent clinical complications during the prior 3 y The risk of thrombosis from valdecoxib has now been established 3 7 and this together with its propensity rarely to cause Stevens Johnson syndrome without a mitigating benefit over traditional nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs has led to its withdrawal from the market The cardiovascular hazard of coxibs appears likely to be attributable to the suppression of COX 2 derived prostacyclin 1 8 Deletion of the prostacyclin receptor in mice does not cause spontaneous thrombosis but rather enhances the response to thrombotic stimuli 9 This is consistent with the fact that a cardiovascular signal from a coxib is most easily detected in patients with hemostatic activation such as was observed under placebo controlled conditions in two trials in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass grafting 7 and anecdotally in patients with connective tissue disease 10 Although this case does not establish a causative linkage with valdecoxib the clinical event was not manifest until three potential risk factors were combined oral contraceptives prolonged stasis and coxib treatment Given the multiplicative interactions of risk factors for thromboembolic disease and the apparently untoward concurrence of two of them the contraceptive pill and frequent road trips for the preceding 3 y the rapid occurrence of the clinical event following initiation of the coxib suggests a causative link to the COX 2 inhibitor However it also remains formally possible that this temporal relationship was a coincidence This case report has been reported to the regulatory authorities and to the manufacturer of valdecoxib Just as the small absolute risks of thrombosis attributable to oral contraceptives and prothrombotic mutations may interact dramatically 5 selective inhibitors of COX 2 may also interact with genetic and environmental factors that predispose to the risk of thrombosis
