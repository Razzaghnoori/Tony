                            Theres a cheap common and mostly safe drug in daily use for centuries by hundreds of        millions of people that only lately has been investigated for its therapeutic potential        for a long list of common ills The list includes Alzheimer disease Parkinson disease        depression and anxiety schizophrenia attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD and        even pain and obesity Why has interest in this potential cureall been slow to develop        One reason in its current forms the drug offers pharmaceutical companies no possibility of        substantial profit Another perhaps more important the drug is reviled as the worlds        most addictive The drug of course is nicotine        Nicotine is an alkaloid in the tobacco plant         Nicotiana tabacum  which was smoked or chewed in the Americas        for thousands of years before European invaders also succumbed to its pleasures and shipped        it back to the Old World Nicotine has always been regarded as medicinal and enjoyable at        its usual low doses Native Americans chewed tobacco to treat intestinal symptoms and in         Jean Nicot de Villemain sent tobacco seeds to the French court claiming tobacco had        medicinal properties and describing it as a panacea for many ailments Higher doses are        toxic even lethalwhich is why nicotine is used around the world as an insecticide Yet        few of the horrendous health effects of smoking are traceable to nicotine itselfcigarettes        contain nearly  other compounds that play a role Until recently nicotine research        has been driven primarily by nicotines unparalleled power to keep people smoking rather        than its potential therapeutic uses        Nicotine locks on to one group of receptors that are normally targeted by the        neurotransmitter acetylcholine Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors nAChRs are ion channels        threaded through cell membranes When activated either by acetylcholine or by nicotine        they allow selected ions to flow across the cell membrane In vertebrates nAChRs are all        over the autonomic and central nervous sytems and the neuromuscular junction A nAChR is        composed of five polypeptide subunits Figure  but there are many nAChR subtypes made of        different subunit combinations a diversity that helps explain why nicotine can have so        many different physiological and cognitive effects        It is now conventional wisdom that acetylcholine and nicotine act at these receptors to        alter electrochemical properties at a variety of synapses which can in turn affect the        release of several other neurotransmitters This wisdom exists thanks in part to work by        Lorna Role and her colleagues at Columbia University in New York City In  we turned        peoples attention to how nicotine works as a modulator tuning synapses and increasing the        gain on transmitter release Role recalls Although all nAChRs are activated by nicotine        other drugs could be found or designed that affect only a subset of these receptor types        If you can dissect out the important players with respect to which nicotine receptors are        tuning a particular set of synapses then that provides another way to potentially target        the therapeutics                    Nicotine and the Brain        People with depressivespectrum disorders schizophrenia and adult ADHD tend to smoke        heavily which suggested to researchers that nicotine may soothe their symptoms Common to        all these disorders is a failure of attention an inability to concentrate on particular        stimuli and screen out the rest Nicotine helps Researchers at the National Institute on        Drug Abuse have shown via functional magnetic resonance imaging that nicotine activates        specific brain areas during tasks that demand attention Box  This may be because of its        effects shared with many other addictive drugs on the release of the neurotransmitter        dopamine Schizophrenia is a disorder largely of the dopamine system says John Dani of        the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston Texas Dopamine signals in the brain occur in        two modesa kind of background trickle punctuated by brief bursts Its thought that        schizophrenics have a hard time separating that background information from important        bursts Weve shown that nicotine helps to normalize that signaling by depressing the        background but letting the bursts through well he says Ill be surprised if theres not        a cotherapy to help schizophrenics that takes advantage of nicotine systems in less than        a decade        Nicotine may be the link between two genes that appear to figure in schizophrenia        Sherry Leonard and Robert Freedman of the University of Colorado in Denver Colorado have        shown that expression of the gene for the alpha  neuronal nicotinic receptor is reduced in        schizophrenics and have argued that alpha  abnormalities lead to attention problems        Researchers in Iceland and elsewhere have shown that a different gene for the growth        factor neuregulin also appears to figure in the disease Neuregulin Role and her        colleagues have shown governs the expression of nAChRs in neurons and helps to stabilize        the synapses where they are found The researchers are currently studying interactions        between neuregulin and alpha  which Role thinks will prove important        Smokers also have lower rates of neurodegenerative disorders and nicotine improves        cognitive and motor functioning in people with Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease The        prevailing hypothesis is that nicotine increases release of neurotransmitters depleted in        those diseases Dani and his colleagues have recently shown that acetylcholinesterase        inhibitorswhich block the degradation of acetylcholine and hence prolong its actionused        to treat Alzheimer disease also stimulate dopamine release They suspect that        malfunctioning of the dopamine system may be affecting noncognitive aspects of dementia        such as depressed mood and that this might be alleviated by nicotine        Paul Newhouse and his colleagues at the University of Vermont in Burlington Vermont        are studying nicotine drugs as potential therapeutic agents for cognitive dysfunction        Newhouse a longtime nicotine researcher is heading the first study ever to examine the        efficacy and safety of nicotine patches for treating mild cognitive impairment thought to        be a precursor of Alzheimer disease The researchers hope to see a positive effect on        attention and learning Newhouse also heads two studies of nicotinic stimulation in ADHD        using the patch nicotine blockers and some novel drugs that activate nicotine        receptors                    Nicotine and Pain        Nicotines salutary effects in patients with neurodegenerative and mental disorders have        been studied a lot and are fairly well known Two much newer topics of academic research        are nicotines potential for pain relief and for treating obesityNicotine itself has        provided modest pain relief in animal studies Although the analgesic effect of drugs that        mimic acetylcholine were originally attributed to a different class of receptors it is now        clear that nAChRs play an important role in the control of pain For instance epibatidine        a drug that is extracted from the skin of an Ecuadorian frog and that acts at nAChRs has        been shown to be  times more potent than morphine at blocking pain in animals Current        animal research is aimed at discovering just where how and which classes of nAChRs work        against pain with the aim of developing more selective drugs        Meanwhile nicotine is also being investigated as an analgesic in humans For example        Pamela Flood an anesthesiologist at Columbia is investigating nicotines future as a        postoperative analgesic She recently completed a pilot study of  women undergoing        gynecological surgery All the women had access to unlimited morphine and also got either a        single mg dose of nicotine nasal spray or a placebo The placebo group had peak pain        scores of eight out of a possible ten in the first hour after surgery Women who got        nicotine averaged a pain score of five Despite the small sample size Flood says the        results were highly significant As far as I know this is the first clinical study to use        nicotine for analgesia and it was much more successful than I ever would have        imagined        The nice thing about nicotine and drugs like nicotine is that they have opposite side        effects to anesthetics Instead of being respiratory depressants they are respiratory        stimulants Instead of being sedating they increase alertness So theoretically this class        of drugs is actually the perfect thing to add to an opioid regimen The fact that theyre        synergistic was a fortuitous thing that we had never looked at and neither had anybody        else                    Nicotine and Weight Gain        Nicotine may be the most effective drug around for weight control As exsmokers know        to their rue one of the worst things about quitting cigarettes is putting on poundsas        much as  of body weight Something about being addicted to nicotine and then going off        it causes massive increase in weight Role points out        YoungHwan Jo in Roles lab is looking at a particular brain circuit involved in        motivational behavior especially feeding behavior It is lodged primarily in the lateral        hypothalamus but has projections all over the cortex especially the nucleus accumbens        which is the center of reinforcement This is where information that has come in to the        thalamus and the hypothalamus is relayed to cortical areas with some sense of salience or        remembrance It presumably is involved in changing perception and motivation for eating        Its not I have to eat this its I want to eat this says Role        Jo has been comparing the synaptic effects of nicotine which reduces appetite to those        of cannabinoids which stimulate it Control of these projection neurons seems to be        oppositely regulated by these two Role notes It doesnt necessarily mean weve found        the root of the munchies but it at least points to pathways that these things have in        common Jo is also examining how nicotine and cannabinoids modulate these pathways in        genetically obese mice and also their interactions with leptins Role says tuning these        pathways up or down might be a reasonable aim If that could be done in a selective        fashion maybe that could be introduced in appetite control Certainly I seeantagonism of        some of these pathways that nicotine activates or the complementary activation of the        cannabinoid pathways as very important targets for therapeutics with respect to the        anorexia thats associated with chemotherapy        Ming Li and his colleagues at the University of Texas in San Antonio Texas are        studying nicotines effects on weight and on expression of genes that nicotine upregulates        orexin and neuropeptide Y and more recently that it also regulates leptin signaling All        three molecules regulate feeding behavior controlled by the hypothalamus In the weight        study nicotinetreated rats not only lost weight they lost about  of their body fat        compared to salinetreated controls The researchers suggest that among its other effects        nicotine alters fat storage        The University of Texas researchers have scoured the literature for genes related to        nicotine and they are developing microarrays to study the expression of these genes        Figure  While nicotine seems to affect all the molecules known to influence weight Li        says its clear the story is even more complex Thats the reason we keep looking at        different molecules to find key targets involved in this regulation The ultimate hope is        to develop new drug applications        Dani predicts that weight control is likely to be one of the earliest nicotinebased        therapies Theres a very good chance that the first drug is unlikely to benicotine        itself but will take advantage of nicotinic receptors in the therapy he says I know        there are drugs now being tested by drug companies just for that purpose                    Nicotines Future        Developing new drugs that selectively target specific subtypes of nicotine receptors is        an expensive albeit potentially lucrative proposition And therein lies a question Will        nicotinebased therapy consist mostly of costly new drugs from the pharmaceutical industry        Or can less expensive nicotine products like the patch chewing gum and nasal spraywhich        are generally intended for smoking cessation but widely available usually without        prescriptionfind their way into the worlds medicine cabinets        Its a little early to call whether nicotine will be used itself as a therapeutic agent        or whether these more specific drugs that are being produced or maybe even used in        combination with other drugs may be the most important way to go says Dani But he        doesnt see the medicinal use of plain nicotine as very likely Dani points out that the        bodys own agent acetylcholine acts over milliseconds to activate nicotinic receptors        whereas nicotine itself stimulates these receptors for hours That lengthy action means        that although nicotine activates the receptors it then often turns particular receptor        subtypes off again a process called desensitization Its hard to predict inside of a        body what youre getting Am I getting an activation or am I turning the receptors        off        Yet much of the work to date showing nicotines effectiveness on a huge range of        disorders has involved products available at any drugstore and intended to help people quit        smoking Newhouse is using patches for mild cognitive impairment Flood has demonstrated        pain relief with nasal spray and will use patches in her next study And Role feels that        gum hasnt been adequately explored for its therapeutic potential Nicotine gum she notes        is a better imitator of smoking than the patch because it delivers brief hits rather than a        steady supply Shes also uncertain whether natural nicotine has been studied enough But        Role also points out that nicotine has its serious problemsaddictive potential        cardiovascular damage and especially when delivered through the mucosa cancer        Dani says People are probably going to have to find creative ways to understand which        subtypes of nicotinic receptors theyre turning on and which ones theyre desensitizing        Maybe drug delivery methods will matter Maybe subtype specificity will matter Its less        than a decade that weve known how important nicotinic receptors are Now we have to move        forward from there        Weve made an enormous amount of progress on understanding the biology of these        receptor systems and how to target them What has been trickier has been to develop an        appropriate pharmacology that allows one to selectively target agents for particular        therapeutic purposes with an adequate safety index Newhouse says But some of the drugs        that are coming on in human trials now are very promising So Im cautiously optimistic        that were on the road to developing some useful nicotinic therapies
