 Movies G I Jane Hollywood Pictures After panning Demi Moore s performances in The Scarlet Letter and Striptease as stolid and humorless most critics say that this movie revives her career Cast as an indomitable woman who endures hellish training with an all male Navy squadron Moore becomes perversely spectacular Janet Maslin the New York Times and transcends the movie s banal premises and predictable conclusion Richard Schickel Time But some critics find the fascination of director Ridley Scott Alien Thelma Louise with Moore s suffering hopelessly sadistic And others say she is as humorless as ever See Sarah Kerr s review in Slate and the G I Jane site Mimic Dimension Films Reviewers are divided over whether this unusually dark horror film starring Mira Sorvino as a scientist

leaning critics such as historian Jackson Lears writing in the New Republic say that the widespread adoption of Taylor s theories amounted to a horror story in which cold blooded management stripped workers of their last shreds of autonomy Conservatives call Taylor s vision benign It certainly came in handy when Hitler was rampant writes George Will in the New York Times Book Review Music The
