        what magazines are you reading these days     well i get a uh quite a few uh weve said that our our magazine subscriptions uh really add up to a strange bunch but i get i get Business Week uh i get one called uh Dulcimer Players News i get uh uh the Washington Post uh Weekly magazine uh we get Time uh and then i get uh uh well i guess i dont get any electronics magazines anymore i get uh electronics uh news newspaper uh what about you   well i get the three um weeklies Newsweek and Time and US News i also get Sports Illustrated guess those are the only ones i get weekly and then once a month we get a whole slew of them we get Money Magazine and um Southern Living and Country Living and   hm   and um my wife has a whole ton of them she subscribes to   oh yeah  yeah   a whole whole bunch of those   well   well i guess i guess the good thing about these um weekly magazines especially how they put things in them you know they have time to at least put things in perspective   yeah   but uh you know i guess the bad thing is they dont have the immediacy of you know radio or TV or a or a newspaper but they certainly can you know give you a bigger picture on things than than the than the daily media can   yeah yeah that little bit of the of the whys behind whats happening and not just the the facts yeah i uh   they can be responsive too i know this summer US News was going to take a week off in August and then when the attempted coup came along they quickly came out with an issue an issue that they werent going to do     yeah   which shows that theyre that theyre certainly are responsive to changing events   yeah yeah well i know that yeah and the category that i forgot is the the uh professional uh ones im im a member of uh I triple E and uh uh ACM Association for Community Materials i get uh three or four uh the magazine magazine form things uh that way uh too so uh i i dont know what the what the status is in general of of people reading magazines i i certainly uh do a lot of it and and uh newspapers for that matter but i uh ive heard that the trend in reading in general and and in especially newspapers is down that people just   well i think youre right i think trend in reading i think one reason that the Times Herald folded and other papers folded is the people are reading newspapers less than they used to and i guess that means they must be reading magazines and you know other written stuff less too   yeah i think i think so i i dont i havent heard exactly how its effecting the magazines maybe not quite as much but uh i think that the more and more people are just depending on the TV for what what news they do get and   of course then you have the specialty magazines like magazines on baseball or Golf Digest or or knitting or crocheting and all these things   oh yeah yeah   that have a selective market  that just aim at one kind of thing those maybe its that the that the special purpose magazines are doing better and the ones that are more general arent doing as well   that could be that could be because theres not theres not really an alternative uh  uh source for that kind of kind of information but uh     yeah i guess if you want to find out a specific item you have nowhere else to turn if you want to find out the the latest in gardening trends unless you read a gardening magazine youre not going to find this anyplace else   yeah yeah yeah   whereas if you want to know what happened in in in Russia today you can turn on the radio or TV and you dont really have to read a paper or magazine to find out something   right   that may be it and with desktop publishing and stuff i think a lot more magazines that are that aim just smaller market will be coming out   yeah i i wonder if that i wonder if that will uh uh make things different ive heard that uh read an article just last week about fax newspapers coming out and wonder if theyll do that with uh you know magazine kinds of things as well i uh was it uh uh Skip uh Bayless   yeah i heard uh i heard it too Skip Bayless wasnt it yeah   from the Times Herald is doing a a fax sports column   yeah i read three times a week hes going to fax you the sports column i dont know i dont know how that will catch on   uh no but uh uh it was interesting uh   yeah i thought that i that would be interesting to to see though   um kind of and it they for a long time theyve been talking about that you know that that moving away from paper magazines uh i guess would it be included in that in terms of of uh computer access and stuff but that that doesnt really seem to have caught on to the extent that they keep predicting uh   well you know you you you dont have time
