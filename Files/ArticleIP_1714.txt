 British Prime Minister Tony Blair s promise to give military support to the United States in any conflict with Iraq received less than wholehearted support in the British press The liberal Guardian led its front page Monday with a story about growing unrest within the ruling Labor Party about Blair s policy Left winger Tony Benn a former Cabinet minister told the newspaper Britain has just taken over the Presidency of the European Union We have had a lot of speeches about how Britain is going to speak for the Union Europe doesn t support this Why should a British Prime Minister go to Washington and do everything he s told by Clinton In its main editorial the Guardian supported U N Secretary General Kofi Annan in calling for more time to resolve the crisis with diplomacy not force Surprisingly the conservative Rupert Murdoch owned Sunday Times took a similar view Bombing Saddam is a policy without a goal it said The West knows bombs will not lead to his overthrow but feels it has to do something In this it has lost sight of its true objective to oust Saddam in the pursuit of a peace in the Middle East and a semblance of human rights in Iraq The strategy is a desperate one it might encourage someone inside Iraq to kill him But it is a hope not a policy Another conservative British newspaper the Sunday Telegraph backed military action although it said When President Clinton orders cruise missiles to be fired and bombs to be dropped it will not be Saddam Hussein who suffers It will be the civilians of his country and almost certainly the women and children among them The British government committed to an ethical foreign policy had been desperately seeking a high minded moral justification for bombing Iraq it said They have failed to find one because there isn t one The only justification for bombing Iraq is the crude utilitarian calculus violence now by the West should help to prevent future violence on a far greater scale by Saddam Its sister newspaper the Daily Telegraph said Monday in an editorial titled Be Ready for War that the United States and Britain must face the knowledge that an air campaign alone cannot guarantee Iraqi compliance Absent unlimited access for weapons inspectors ground troop deployment was the only way to find and destroy Iraq s cache of chemical and biological weapons Washington and London could be at the start of a long and escalating campaign the editorial concluded Even the ultraconservative tabloid the Daily Mail urged Blair to be wary about using force against Saddam Will strafing Iraqi military installations one more time make the Middle East a safer place or will it only serve to perpetuate Saddam s malign influence by perversely giving him added kudos with his long suffering people it asked The Corriere della Sera of Milan carried an interview with former U S Secretary of State James Baker in which he urged a much heavier bombardment of Iraq than the pin pricks of the Gulf War We will have to strike his Saddam s palaces military installations and also civilian infrastructures from bridges to power stations he was quoted as saying I am sorry that the Iraqi people will have to suffer but the fault is Saddam s not ours Baker said that although the anti Iraq coalition of the Gulf War could not be resurrected America today was not isolated France has become closer to us and some Arab states that appear to be keeping their distance are in reality supporting us he said He added that this time Israel should respond if attacked by Iraqi missiles The situation today is quite different from the situation seven years ago he said Then there were several Arab states in the coalition and it was important that Israel stay out of a prolonged conflict Now a brief Israeli reprisal would seem justified to everyone La Repubblica of Rome announced in an editorial the end of the New International Order The United States allies above all the Europeans presented a front in total disintegration it said Only Great Britain is unconditionally on the U S side France Germany and Italy are in discussions with the United States but are closer to the position of those countries led by Russia that are firmly opposed to military intervention It is a heterogeneous front that includes China moderate Arab countries like Egypt and radical ones like Libya as well as Iran This is the beginning of a revolution in the world political order and its outcome will be determined by that of Clinton s battle with the Third World countries which are equipping themselves with weapons of mass destruction If Saddam wins the eclipse of American hegemony will begin We are in an era of great unknowns In Davos Switzerland for the World Economic Forum Iran s 37 year old Vice President Masumeh Ebtekar told Corriere della Sera that Iran would be on the side of the Iraqi people in the event of a U S attack This was primarily for humanitarian reasons she said but we also have other fears Iran has one of the greatest concentrations of refugees in the world she said 3 5 million of whom 2 5 million are Iraqis You can imagine how we might view the prospect of a new conflict Asked if she thought it was possible to negotiate with Saddam Hussein she replied Personally I have my doubts The liberal Israeli daily Ha aretz reported that both Israel and the United States believed that Iraq had no interest in involving Israel in any military confrontation with the West but that the United States had agreed to supply more defense equipment to Israel if the conflict with Iraq becomes more acute It also reported that many thousands of people around the country had been queuing up for gas masks In an account of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright s visit to Jerusalem Ha aretz said she was frustrated by the lack of progress in the Middle East peace talks and had told both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat I am sick and tired of hearing you giving me a pile of complaints about the other side Zippergate coverage has dwindled in European newspapers though the Paris evening paper France Soir had a front page comment Monday headlined Monica s Eyes claiming that Lewinsky s passionate look in photographs left no room for doubt about her relationship with the president There was no need for her to confess to anything for those eyes were the two principal witnesses in the case and gave irrefutable proof of her passion it said Outstripping Zippergate in column inches Monday was the imminent execution of Karla Faye Tucker which was the subject of the editorial in the liberal Independent of London Welcoming the Rev Pat Robertson s espousal of Tucker s cause the Independent said Let us hope that more and more Americans will come to realise that if it is wrong to execute her because she is a God fearing woman then it is wrong to execute anybody The Italian newspapers all prominently reported a letter to Gov George Bush of Texas from Pope John Paul II asking for a gesture of clemency that would contribute to the creation of a culture more favorable to respect for life As Prince Charles arrived Monday in Sri Lanka for an official visit marking the 50 th anniversary of its independence from Britain he was reported to be considering canceling a plan to confer a knighthood there on the expatriate British writer Arthur C Clarke 2001 A Space Odyssey following a front page story in the London Sunday Mirror reporting claims that Clarke had paid for sex with young boys In the Times of London Monday Clarke was quoted as saying There is no truth whatsoever in the allegations that the Sunday Mirror are making against me and they are very hurtful But the newspaper reported that British diplomats were seeking a formal categorical denial of the allegation by Clarke if the investiture ceremony was to go ahead at the British High Commission in Colombo Wednesday
