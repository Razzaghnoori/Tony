          and hello there so i guess the question is do you have any pets what do you have   hi yes we well we have a cat yes named Bounce actually its Bounce the uh about third   a cat named Bounce Bounce the third okay   yeah uh thats because  when i was little i had a storybook about a cat named Bounce and   and the name stuck with you   and the cat was um gray and white in particular had to be gray and white so all the Bounces have been gray and white we also have a rabbit   okay very good a rabbit   named Coco Bunny   and i assume that now the rabbit doesnt get out right the rabbits in in the cage okay   right the rabbit is in a cage outdoors only year round and this rabbit has been with us for um  oh six seven eight eight years   one now do you just have one rabbit in other words it never multiplies  okay   one rabbit No  thats for sure and uh thats actually all the pets we have at this time   well ive ive had uh i had three Cocker Spaniels uh up until about   how about you   um four or five i guess about four years ago and they they were all very old twelve thirteen and fourteen fifteen and they died and but i believe the a child must have a   um hum umhum yeah   pet to grow up with so on my uh kids fourth birthday his birthday present was a Basset Hound   right oh   which as he calls it a basket hound but thats okay yes but uh anyway so yes we have the Basset Hound who is now two years old and in fact it just had the lovely uh   oh yeah  cute uhhuh   yesterday i got to take the dog to the veterinarian for his shots   oh boy   thats one of the uh to me one of the things i dont care about having a pet about   did right yeah does he live indoors or outdoors outdoor yeah thats kind of   no hes an outdoor dog uh hes a very low maintenance dog uh we actually have a uh an automatic feeder and we have an automatic waterer so he always has plenty of water   umhum um umhum   so i dont have to worry about going out there and like for example im going on this two week vacation hell be fine   yeah ooh how nice   no one even has to look after him although we have a neighbor whos going to come over you know say hello just to keep him happy but uh   umhum hes just in the fenced backyard and   hes in a very well fenced backyard that has openings so he can look out and see the kids and chase the kids and he likes that   yeah well how nice yeah that sounds like a good situation thats about how i would like to have a dog if i had a dog       see our cat is also um well outdoors and in the garage at one time she was an indoor cat and then she started to do things in the house that i didnt appreciate     claw now has it been declawed   no no no no well   it has not oh you should have you ever thought of having it   well no because shes outdoors   okay okay   so if shes outdoors i dont want her declawed   true true true   um but she um she was kind of a feisty feisty feisty little character when she was little and as she has gotten older because shes about seven years old   now my wife would very much like to have a cat because she she grew up with a cat then uh the cat lived indoors and the whole bit i just dont care for cats i dont know what it is about it but she i guess because   would she yeah yeah well theyre so independent a lot of people dont i   yes they are you cant say come here i mean it just doesnt you know   thats true  it could just stand there and stare at you in a strange way in fact my cat right now is just rubbing up against the the wood on the door here staring       with a look of dont you want       to feed me or to pick me up and love me  yes you sweet thing   hum well we have a humongous uh our back what do you call it the uh living room has nothing but       one big window after another so its all windows and we can look out in the backyard and were always seeing the dog and the dog you know hes   umhum umhum   he he knows when were in the room because when were in the room and just come walking down the hall whatnot hell come and and look at us you know well wave at him hell come back to you you know yeah   umhum so he is sociable even though he even though hes outdoors yeah   yes he is hes very most loving dog youve ever had i cant i cant really i cannot imagine not having a dog   yeah my boys and um my husband have been talking recently about having a dog but we dont have a a fenced in backyard and we dont want a fenced in backyard were on a corner and we look out at a creek and a park and we just you know one reason we   well what you have to do is have an indoor dog   yeah i guess it would have to be and we   and they can be very nice too after after theyve been trained   yeah thats true yeah well thats right   and they do require a lot of training   yeah yeah thats for sure   now my dog he you know weve got him trained that we could bring him inside but once we bought the new house my wife said uhhuh no no hes not coming inside this house so   uhhum um  well pets pets really are hard on houses i mean theres just no doubt about that weve my husband was in really estate for a while and you know he had more problems over pets um in both rental houses and houses that people owned and other people looked at it and didnt like the way it smelled and so so thats my main   umhum and they do get the carpet uh  soiled sometimes   objection yeah i mean even even the best trained one you know is going to have problems from time to time and you just cant really get that that smell out and   yes well i tell you what ive got some uh carpet uh cleaner that uh you know its some type of dog smell smell away it works wonderful it really really does   umhum well thats good when we moved into this house both dogs and cats had been in it and um we did not realize that there was a problem and after we moved in it was so bad that we had to go ahead and um recarpet the entire house   oh   and uh when they pulled the carpeting up it was so bad on the back there were so many spots you just wouldnt believe and um they they we had to have a exterminating company come in and they had to treat the concrete slab     oh come on   and they had to wear you know gas masks and stuff so we moved everything from one half of the house to the other half and you know then got took took that well actually both   now this is from a cat or a dog okay   that um took that part of the carpeting up and then treated that and we had to stay out of the ho use for you know ten hours or something and then we came back and then they put the new carpet down there moved the furniture back to that half of the house and had had to do it again   because yes dogs need training but cats usually dont even need any training seem like they automatically go to their little litter box they think yeah   yeah no they usually dont yeah yeah so anyway weve had that that was a very bad experience  well i dont really think were going to have any more indoor pets   well in fact if were getting ready to go on our vacation my little six year old now hes saying we need to buy a mother dog to take care of uh       Copper while were gone i said  you dont buy mother dogs you buy little puppies   so theyd have company right well it really is fun to have two pets together umhum yeah   and and and my wifes saying uhhuh  no well we had three at one time we had three in the backyard all at one time and they played and they also humped on each other all the time but you know they   yeah yeah but they must really have fun together it its cute to see several several at a time like that   oh they did although ill tell you what it really would scare me like now in the summer when this hot uh when theyre playing that hard i you know its im not sure if that was that good for them or not   oh yeah umhum   but our dog does have plenty of company let me because of the uh we have a   just the kids   the fence that we have has slats in it so he can see outside and he is constantly chasing the kids and people walk in our neighborhood hes always and were on the corner too so you know he has a lot of traffic going by and he   umhum   umhum
