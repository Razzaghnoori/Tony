 well what s your favorite shows oh gosh that s hard to say it s um used to be a big Twin Peaks fan but they ve made me mad so i haven t watched them in a while in a while uh huh um oh i watch a lot of uh public we watch public television a lot Mystery and hm oh oh i oh i really like Mysteries uh huh that s one of my favorite yeah Mystery and uh Masterpiece Theater yeah i watch that occasionally when yeah there s something really interesting on um hum but uh oh out out outside of that i it s hard to have a i don t really watch a whole lot yeah i don t not anymore i don t there s just nothing on it yeah i got i got sort of hooked on that uh Dark Shadows have you yeah i when i watched it originally i didn t know it was a i don t know it was going to be a series i thought it was just a movie um and so i started watching it and all of a sudden stay tuned next week and i went what and then it blows into this whole series thing so i sort of had to stay with it yeah is is it good is it not really it it it s it s gotten to the point it s getting ridiculous now and yeah they they just had the uh season finale and i don t i don t know what they accomplished but i think the writers just figure well let s just do anything and yeah we ll we ll have a couple of months to come up with some new ideas yeah that that s that s kind of what happened on Twin Peaks they did all this big building up building up building up and then the the solution was ridiculous i had it figured out by the third yeah yeah i thought i already had it figured out and i did and that made me mad yeah i don t like programs that i can figure it out yeah um the only one that i watch religiously is LA Law um hum i really like that well my parents my parents really like LA Law yeah that s that s my favorite is it good i ve i ve always heard it was really good well i m i m a struggling law student oh and i the reason i like it is because they give you good law in there do they yeah it s not like these other programs where they just make up anything they want oh yeah and they they throw little tidbits out that are really good you know like they they at least you know they ve been in a courtroom before um hum of course i mean it s got its bad side so it s limited by the format and obviously you don t get into court as quickly as they seem to make it out that you do oh of course yeah oh no they re they re in California and they re they re waiting list is about four years four or five years for a civil case ooh Lord so uh yeah i mean you know it s very difficult to it d be nice if justice traveled that quickly but but it sure it it sure doesn t yeah it would yeah no not at all you know the wheels of justice grind slowly yeah well it s not really justice s fault but that s on a another whole subject altogether yeah i ll agree with you there i ll agree with you oh i know i know the shortcomings too yeah yeah yeah oh let s see what oh i guess i ve got a two year old so we do Sesame Street everyday uh well not it s not on my that s not on my list of no not it not no it s a it s not something now there was some of the some of the classes i m in i think i m in Sesame Street but uh yeah some of the professors i think imitate Big Bird uh oh yeah have an intellectual role of Big Bird that s pretty good that s it i mean Big Bird would make a good judge better than some of the judges i ve seen oh that s true that s true yeah i ve got my own pet peeve about judges but uh oh well we re stuck with them yeah yeah that we re kind of stuck with them sort of like lawyers you know oh um let s see what else is oh i like A E i wish i wish we got i wish we got that on our cable system we don t there s always good stuff on A E they don t have A E on cable in Dallas well not where i am not we re we re in far north we re i mean we re uh huh i m thirty five miles north of Dallas in McKinney it s a small town there s only one cable system here and i ve called griped about them not having A E A E but they don t have it i mean in Dallas they do oh oh yeah i ll tell you the um uh A E and Discovery and CNN i couldn t i couldn t live without those oh yeah i watch oh i like C i like CNN s new uh news coverage better than anybody s oh yeah i i just leave it when i m home during the day i just leave it on just to listen to it yeah during during when the war was real hot and heavy we just had it on CNN all day long yeah best coverage yeah oh the oh much better than anybody else s yeah uh the networks got sort of ridiculous with they they they felt like they had to interrupt normal programming for all this but they didn t have anything to say now they re plus they had all the inaccuracies were ridiculous then they d come back five minutes later and contradict themselves to oh it was just get it was ridiculous so i just oh yeah yeah yeah well the coverage was a little bit ridiculous anyway i mean um hum it it it got far more coverage than it should have i it was it was beautifully played out thing i mean yea h oh yeah it it roused the patriotism of the of the country and all that sort of stuff and but uh they they interrupted for no good reason a lot yeah exactly i mean and sometimes they they would now i like Jeopardy and Jeopardy comes on here at seven o clock uh huh uh huh and for i don t know it must have been two or three weeks there they were doing this expanded nightly news oh yeah you know and i m going i will never get to see Jeopardy again rehash it was just rehash rehash total oh yeah i m saying what are you telling me that you didn t tell me in your first half hour nothing and i i know i know the scud attack scud attacks are some are exciting to somebody but after you ve seen them seen them for two weeks in a row nothing yeah oh well there goes a patriot missile oh well that s good that s good across the black sky a white streak yeah oh boy golly gee well maybe maybe we re a bit uh uh oh jaded yeah we are and and because television s brought everything into your living room yeah well i it was interesting it was interesting but it wasn t an exciting war it really wasn t no i mean there there there was nothing to it i mean which is that s good that s good but i mean yeah i m happy for that for TV coverage it s pitiful i m happy for that but but unfortunately i sort of had the inside track because i d been in the i d been in the military for thirteen years and i worked and i worked in intelligence oh oh and and there was no contradiction in turn yes another one of those military intelligence ha ha that s what that s just like justice for all yeah but i mean my goodness there s they re sitting here making all this big deal out of the Iranians i know and i m sitting there thinking to myself uh huh sure um hum i mean they ve poured billions of dollars into this stuff but those stupid people can t read comic strips i mean how do you expect them to operate tanks no they can t it s put it in Russian yeah i mean they can t even read their own language yeah it it it was just it was the coverage just went way too far yeah i it just totally ridiculous i mean the Israeli s could have fixed the whole problem years ago if they just sent sent their guys in there and killed Saddam oh that s that s what my husband says he says just send the Israeli s in to to pick off Saddam they ll they d love it i mean that s right i mean the Israeli s aren t they re not afraid of anything huh uh no see what happens when they when they take a plane load of their citizens down in oh yeah that doesn t uh that doesn t that situation doesn t sit around and develop very long no i just wonder what s going to happen to the hostage to the the hostages that s over in Lebanon now that you hear all kinds of things all right i i i think everybody s jumping to conclusions i don t think anything s going to change you don t think so i just no first off i don t think the the Middle Eastern situation s going to change i don t think that oh that s true oh are you kidding but they all hate each other they re not yeah they re not going to come up with they re not going to come up with a peace plan or any of this kind of crap huh uh you know you you see them on interview they interview everybody and everybody says the same things um hum yeah that they always have well they they get Oshmid Yakomo you know the janitor for the US Embassy and you know oh yes i know yes i keep saying when are they going to knock on my door and interview me they ve talked to everybody else in the world yeah really and it was it was real it was even worse here in North Carolina because because a lot of the was it matter of fact all the units the Marines and and uh the F the F 16 squadrons came out of North Carolina did they so every night on the local news they were down in Fayetteville or they were down in Goldsboro and they were talking to the military wives you know oh yeah oh yeah and and i and i understand the way they feel about their husbands and wives being over there and all that but to get on camera and just oh this is so terrible i just i don t what we re going to do well i m thinking to myself oh yeah you know what do these people think they were getting into when they joined the military they re they re voluntary army you know i m going it what did you think it was uh huh a paycheck uh huh yeah they do they think it s a paycheck you know run around and and play soldier well the reservists sure do we had a reservist here in North Carolina who who yeah who s unit was ordered up and he refused to go we had a doctor that did t hat here i hope he got busted oh yeah she did yeah the uh this this guy did too he ended up going to Leavenworth which is good i m glad yeah i mean just when uh the they military paid for her education um hum and they kept having her on the news every night and then and then she that s right then she didn t want to do her obligation yeah uh huh ooh she s she s in hot water well i you know i m not i m not racist or anything but one of my one another one of my pet peeves is they had a lot of Black on the news talking about how unfair it is because the Blacks are poor and therefore they don t have a choice but go in the military oh yeah oh yeah so there s more of them getting killed than the Whites oh yes now to me that doesn t make any damn sense it nobody forced
