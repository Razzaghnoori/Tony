 Background Traditionally the animal body cavity coelom has played a major role in interpretations of metazoan evolution from groups e g flatworms lacking a coelom to those e g nematodes with a false coelom and finally to the bulk of animal phyla having a true coelom Coelomata 1 2 There has never been complete agreement on animal phylogeny and classification but most researchers have divided living coelomate animals into deuterostomes echinoderms hemichordates urochordates cephalochordates and vertebrates and protostomes arthropods annelids mollusks and other phyla based on differences in early embryonic development An analysis of small subunit ribosomal RNA 18S rRNA sequences challenged this arrangement by placing acoelomate and pseudocoelomate phyla in more derived positions among the protostomes and in further defining a clade Ecdysozoa of molting animals that includes arthropods and nematodes 3 This Ecdysozoa hypothesis has influenced diverse fields 4 and interpretations of developmental evolution in animals 5 6 7 Since its publication evidence has appeared both for and against this hypothesis 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Knowing the branching order of the major animal lineages especially those three with fully sequenced genomes is of importance to diverse fields such as medical genetics physiology neurobiology paleontology and astrobiology With a genealogy of animals it will be easier to determine the origins and inheritance of mutations genes gene functions and structures The three possible relationships of these animal phyla are I arthropods vertebrates II arthropods nematodes and III nematodes vertebrates The first hypothesis corresponds to the traditional grouping Coelomata and the second corresponds to Ecdysozoa 3 For convenience we will use these names in reference to the two hypotheses while recognizing that this study by necessity involves only a subset of all animal phyla The third hypothesis will be referred to as hypothesis III Fig 1 To test each hypothesis sequence alignments of more than 100 nuclear proteins were assembled and subjected to a series of analyses designed to reveal biases that could result in an incorrect phylogeny Results and discussion Analyses of the individual protein datasets using neighbor joining 16 show that most 62 support Coelomata while 25 support Ecdysozoa and 13 support hypothesis III Supplemental Table 1 four taxon analysis Of the 25 proteins in which support for one of the three hypotheses is significant 95 the results are 84 21 proteins 16 4 and 0 respectively for those ten proteins with a highly significant 99 topology the results are 90 9 proteins 10 1 and 0 respectively The four proteins showing significant support 95 for a hypothesis other than Coelomata were reanalyzed using maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood bootstrap values were not significant using other methods Such divided results are typical of single gene analyses because of limited information 400 amino acids necessitating combined analysis Coelomata was supported significantly 100 bootstrap confidence posterior probability 1 0 when the 100 four taxon protein alignments were concatenated and analyzed using neighbor joining maximum parsimony maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference Fig 2A Using the Shimodaira Hasegawa SH test 17 this maximum likelihood topology was significantly different from the alternative hypotheses of Ecdysozoa P 0 001 and Hypothesis III P 0 001 These results agree with earlier studies involving 10 36 nuclear proteins 8 9 11 To test the stability of Coelomata to taxon sampling we included new sequences of the planarian Dugesia japonica Phylum Platyhelminthes in 100 five taxon protein alignments Supplemental Table 1 five taxon analysis The results upon concatenation with this additional taxon were unchanged Fig 2B Coelomata continued to be significantly supported 98 bootstrap support posterior probability 1 0 and the alternative hypotheses were both rejected using the SH test P 0 001 although the relationships among the basal phyla Nematoda and Platyhelminthes could not be resolved Another potential bias is the specific taxa included in an analysis For example the original support for Ecdysozoa was obtained only with a particular genus of nematode Trichinella that had a short branch in the 18S rRNA tree 3 To test this phylogenies were constructed using different species of nematodes The Coelomata hypothesis was significantly supported 97 bootstrap support posterior probabilities 1 0 Ecdysozoa rejected by SH test P 0 006 Hypothesis III rejected by SH test P 0 027 using either a genus in a different order Brugia 18 proteins or Trichinella six proteins Fig 2C 2D To further address the possibility that these results could be biased by taxon sampling we included representatives from all available phyla for each protein The results indicate that an increase in the number of taxa does not decrease single protein support for Coelomata in fact the trend is the reverse Fig 2E Simulation studies have shown that incomplete taxon sampling does not increase topological errors and that most error is caused by limited sequence data 18 In the initial study defining Ecdysozoa 3 rate variation was considered to be the major bias affecting the phylogenetic position of nematodes In the 18S rRNA gene nematodes typically have long branches indicating an increased rate of sequence change Other nuclear genes also show this pattern but to a lesser degree 8 9 Phylogenetic methods can accommodate moderate amounts of rate variation among lineages without producing an incorrect phylogeny 19 However if the rate of change is sufficiently large longer branches in a phylogeny will sometimes attract one another 20 If that happens an ingroup species with a long branch may move to a more basal position in the tree In analyses of the 18S rRNA gene nematodes typically appear basal to arthropods vertebrates Because the use of a short branch nematode Trichinella resulted in a tree whereby nematodes clustered with arthropods the basal position of nematodes in typical 18S analyses has been interpreted as long branch attraction 3 If nematodes cluster basally because of long branch attraction then the strongest support for Ecdysozoa should be obtained with the slowest evolving proteins This was tested in an analysis of 36 nuclear proteins 8 but the results were equivocal Therefore we tested this suggestion with our four taxon data set of 100 proteins ordered by rate of evolution Rate orders were determined in two ways i nematode branch length and ii vertebrate arthropod pairwise distance The 100 proteins were grouped into concatenations of 10 proteins and 20 proteins to increase statistical resolution The results show support for Coelomata at all rate orders but the support is significant with the slowest evolving proteins regardless of rate measure or number of proteins combined Fig 3 Concatenations of slow evolving proteins also show compositional homogeneity pairwise disparity index test P 0 05 21 suggesting the basal position of the nematode results from true phylogenetic signal and not compositional bias Support for Coelomata was weakest with the fastest evolving proteins which also showed compositional heterogeneity indicating that Ecdysozoa not Coelomata may be the result of a rate bias compositional bias or other artifact To ensure that this result was not affected by mutational saturation in our data set the mean number of variants per variable site was determined for each protein and averaged for ten groups of proteins ordered by evolutionary rate Fig 4A As predicted variable sites in the faster evolving proteins showed a higher number of variants than those in slow evolving proteins We also examined the minimum number of nucleotide changes required for sites where only the nematode sequence varied Fig 4B Slow evolving proteins showed a smaller number of nucleotide changes required to alter amino acid identity while faster evolving proteins required more changes Thus the nematode sequences in the slow evolving proteins do not appear to be mutationally saturated Finally the affect of lineage specific rate variation on support for Coelomata was tested with the use of relative rate tests Presumably the selective elimination of genes with long branches will increase statistical support for the correct topology Individual proteins from the four taxon data set were each subjected to two different relative rate tests 22 23 Proteins determined to be rate constant at the typically applied stringency level 5 significance and at two greater stringency levels 10 and 40 significance were concatenated and bootstrap support was determined using neighbor joining The results of the two tests were similar As stringency increased 40 83 of proteins were rejected and the relative nematode branch length to the arthropod and vertebrate branches dropped from 16 to 0 However in all cases Coelomata remained highly significant Fig 5 Thus the suggestion that a basal position of nematodes is the result of long branch attraction 3 can be rejected Supplemental Table 1 Proteins analyzed and bootstrap support for each alternative hypothesis Table SuppInfo doc The importance of knowing the branching order of these species is illustrated by the immediate and wide acceptance of the Ecdysozoa hypothesis and its use in tracing patterns of developmental evolution 5 6 7 10 However in the initial analysis of 18S rRNA sequences 3 Ecdysozoa was statistically significant only when a paralinear distance method was used three other methods did not yield significant bootstrap support In that study Ecdysozoa also was not significant using any method when the flatworm sequence was included 3 Subsequent analyses of the 18S rRNA gene have been interpreted differently 24 25 but none has yielded statistically significant results supporting Ecdysozoa Moreover the molting cuticles of arthropods chitin and nematodes collagen are not homologous 4 The significance of other morphological characteristics bearing on the position of nematodes continues to be debated 26 Besides the 18S rRNA evidence other genetic evidence for the grouping of nematodes and arthropods has come from qualitative interpretations of Hox gene 10 and thymosin 12 evolution In the case of Hox genes support comes from a single posterior gene sequence Y75B8A 1 of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans argued to have greater amino acid similarity with a posterior Hox genes of Drosophila and Priapulus 10 Unfortunately the Hox homeodomain is a short 60 amino acid region with many sequence differences between these taxa Definition of sequence signatures is qualitative and has not been tested statistically In a subsequent study of nematode posterior Hox genes other researchers were unable to determine if the simple nematode Hox cluster of six genes is an ancestral or a derived condition 13 In the case of thymosin a sequence signature also has been argued to support a grouping of Drosophila and Caenorhabditis 12 However it is a gene family known to have paralogs within animals the position of introns differs between sequences from the two species and only four other metazoan taxa were surveyed In addition knowing the presence or absence of a gene can be problematic without the complete genome sequence of an organism in this case genomes were known only in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis Thus although suggestive it is too soon to judge the significance of this sequence signature One difficulty with interpreting such qualitative evidence including Hox gene orthology is that almost any pattern can be found in nature if one looks In other words sequence signatures have not yet been surveyed systematically and objectively In contrast sequence evidence from randomly selected genes analyzed phylogenetically provides a more unbiased database amenable to statistical analysis Conclusions Although it is possible that a basal position of nematodes is the result of some unknown and widespread bias not yet identified a simpler explanation is that the grouping of nematodes with arthropods is an artifact that arose from the analysis of a single gene 18S rRNA The results presented here suggest caution in revising animal phylogeny from analyses of one or a few genes or sequence signatures Although many other aspects of animal phylogeny remain unresolved our results indicate that insects arthropods are genetically and evolutionarily closer to humans vertebrates than to nematodes Materials and methods DNA sequences from Dugesia japonica 27 were used to search the public protein database Entrez for orthologous counterparts in Drosophila melanogaster Caenorhabditis elegans Homo sapiens Arabidopsis thaliana Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe When available sequences from other major animal phyla e g Mollusca Echinodermata Annelida also were obtained In addition the database was searched for all proteins from two other nematodes Brugia and Trichinella with orthologs in Drosophila Homo and Arabidopsis Saccharomyces or Schizosaccharomyces Arabidopsis was used as the primary outgroup 95 out of 100 proteins in the four taxon analysis 94 out of 100 proteins for the five taxon analysis all proteins in Brugia and Trichinella analyses yeast was used as the outgroup when Arabidopsis sequences were unavailable or paralogous This was because many more genes were available for rooting with the plant than with the fungus All three kingdoms are about equidistant from each other in terms of branch lengths 9 and therefore a plant serves about equally well for rooting an animal phylogeny as does a fungus Orthology was assessed using reciprocal BLAST searches of the public protein database those sequences receiving high scores in each search were also analyzed phylogenetically to ensure orthology Short 100 amino acids sequences were omitted Sequences were aligned using Clustal X 28 and each alignment was visually inspected Primary analyses of aligned protein data sets were conducted

addition phylogenetic analyses were conducted with maximum likelihood JTT F option 31 and maximum parsimony Max Mini Branch Bound option 29 on combined data sets in all cases they resulted in similar
