 Waiting for Nov 5 L ast week in Slate Jodie T Allen and Bill Barnes proposed using advanced Microsoft software to condense the transcripts of the presidential debates Compression is the right approach but more of a human touch is needed Rather than reduce political dialogue to straightforward facts and proposals perhaps we should try to bring out the singular aesthetic vision that wells up in even our most robotically pre programmed politicians Too many facts too much information We need to make politics more beautiful melancholy strange The vast audience that attends the plays of Samuel Beckett or reads the poetry of John Ashbery is sadly neglected in our political process Here is a compressed transcript of the debates All the words were actually spoken They are presented completely out of context but in perfect accord with what the transcriber believes to be the inward poetic essence of each candidate Note Bob Dole s remarks required less editing than the others Act I Hartford Conn Clinton from a high rocky outcrop I want I will try I ran I wanted you took me Let s keep it going We cut let s balance We cut let s pass We passed let s expand We passed let s keep

exaggerator because he just liked to exag Clinton I think my ideas are better Dole I have my own little foundation Just did I haven t before Clinton I support school choice I support school choice Dole I like young people I like teachers Clinton The results are highly ambiguous Dole George McGovern is a friend of mine Clinton Our plan is better Dole I ve never discussed Whitewater I m
