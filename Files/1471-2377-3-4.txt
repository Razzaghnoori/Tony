 Background Selection of Candidate Genes for ISGS The candidate genes for this study include the gene encoding fibrinogen and the genes encoding platelet glycoprotein GP receptors Ia IIa Ib IX V and IIb IIIa In selecting candidate genes for an association study effects of polymorphisms on structure function or expression of a gene product should be considered Failure to consider the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism when searching for polymorphisms associated with stroke might result in mistaking association for causation 2 We studied genes related to thrombosis because the importance of thrombosis in acute ischemic stroke has been established conclusively in numerous clinical trials of treatment and prevention 3 4 5 6 7 8 We focused on genetic variations in the fibrinogen gene cluster because of the efficacy of fibrinolytic agents in the acute treatment of ischemic stroke In addition we studied genes encoding for platelet receptors because of the efficacy of platelet anti aggregant therapy in preventing first time and recurrent ischemic strokes To restrict the choice of polymorphisms worthy of further study we constructed an evidence table from reports appearing in MEDLINE indexed English language journals describing cross sectional or longitudinal studies of at least one thrombosis gene polymorphism in at least 100 patients with stroke Results were classified as positive or negative according to whether a significant association P 0 05 was found between stroke or carotid atherosclerosis and a polymorphism Because it is biologically plausible that a prothrombotic polymorphism may exert a differential effect across different ages sexes and ethnic groups we classified studies as having positive results even if they had only one positive subgroup We considered a polymorphism worthy of further study if it was not already a clearly established stroke risk factor and if at least one association study was positive Regarding a possible relationship to stroke risk most studies of hemostasis genes have been inconclusive at best and unconvincing at worst On the basis of the evidence we concluded that the polymorphisms of factor VII R353Q factor XIII Val34Leu plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 4G 5G and prothrombin G20210A were not worthy of further investigation because large studies had consistently yielded negative results Table 1 For similar reasons we decided not to study factor V R506Q G1691A i e the factor V Leiden mutation despite its apparent association with cerebral vein thrombosis 9 Although unknown point mutations in the coding regions of these genes may relate to stroke and relevant variations in gene expression elements may exist we decided to focus on more immediately high yield candidate genes The results of three large European studies listed in Table 1led us to conclude that the fibrinogen gene might be a promising candidate Fibrinogen is a 340 000 Da GP consisting of three polypeptide chains and The genes that encode these polypeptides reside on chromosome 4q in a cluster In a study of the fibrinogen G455A polymorphism Kessler et al 10 did not find an overall association between genotype and stroke but heterozygosity for the A allele was associated with large vessel ischemic stroke P 0 045 Schmidt et al 11 observed an association between carotid atherosclerosis and the C148T polymorphism in a population based cross sectional study of persons with normal neurologic status Carotid atherosclerosis was seen in 53 6 of persons with the C C genotype 54 1 of those with the C T genotype and 88 of those with the T T genotype P 0 003 Abnormal results on carotid ultrasonography were significantly more common in the T T genotype group OR 6 29 95 CI 1 91 to 20 71 Data from the study by Carter et al 12 on the G448A polymorphism of the fibrinogen gene suggested that mechanisms linking fibrinogen and the development of cerebrovascular disease may be different in men and women Several studies listed in Table 1suggested that polymorphisms of genes controlling the three platelet glycoprotein receptors Ia IIa Ib IX V and IIb IIIa which play a role in adhesion might also be promising candidate risk factors for stroke GP Ia IIa integrin 2 1 is involved in collagen induced platelet aggregation It does not bind collagen monomers but it does bind collagen fibrils and immobilized collagen Binding of GPIa IIa to collagen induces a conformational change in receptor structure that enhances affinity Thus one platelet GP of interest is GPIa Carlsson et al 13 compared the GPIa 2 C807T genotype distribution in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attacks with that in hospitalized patients without cerebrovascular disease and in healthy blood donors An association between the polymorphism and stroke was not seen overall However there was an overrepresentation of the C807T polymorphism in patients with stroke age 50 years or younger n 45 versus age matched controls OR 3 02 95 CI 1 20 to 7 61 No such overrepresentation was detected in older patients The second platelet GP of interest is GPIb a transmembranous platelet GP molecular weight 143 000 that forms noncovalent complexes with GPIb GPIX and GPV to form the GPIb IX V receptor which is involved in shear stress induced platelet activation by binding to von Willebrand factor vWF This receptor may be particularly relevant in large vessel atherosclerotic ischemic stroke because high shear stresses like those seen in atherosclerotic arteries increase ligand receptor affinity The receptor may also have a role in so called aspirin failure in which patients suffer stroke despite taking daily aspirin prophylaxis Cyclooxygenase inhibition by aspirin has little effect on initial aggregation in response to shear forces One GPIb polymorphism is referred to as VNTR because it consists of a variable number of tandem repeats of 39 base pairs each repeat leading to a 13 amino acid addition that pushes a vWF binding domain further away from the platelet membrane surface Another is human platelet antigen 2 HPA 2 a mutation that codes for either a thr HPA 2a or met HPA 2b at position 145 The HPA 2 site resides next to the vWF and high affinity thrombin binding sites In a case control study of these polymorphisms Gonzalez Conejero et al 14 found that cerebrovascular disease was associated with both the C B genotype of the VNTR polymorphism OR 2 83 95 CI 1 16 to 7 07 P 0 0114 and the allele of the HPA 2 polymorphism Of the 104 patients with cerebrovascular disease 22 11 carried at least one allele compared with 10 58 of controls OR 2 40 95 CI 1 04 to 5 63 P 0 0244 Neither polymorphism showed significant differences related to age sex or type of cerebrovascular disease Both polymorphisms also correlated with coronary artery disease but neither correlated with deep vein thrombosis This is the converse of what Ridker et al 15 and others found for factor V Leiden Taken together the studies suggest that polymorphisms predisposing to arterial thrombosis may differ from polymorphisms predisposing to deep vein thrombosis This hypothesis supports the rationale for a hemostasis candidate gene association study such as ISGS which investigates ischemic stroke specifically and does not regard all acute thrombotic events whether arterial or venous as a single clinical entity The third candidate platelet GP gene controls GPIIb IIIa integrin IIb 3 a transmembranous heterodimer with several ligands including fibrinogen fibrin fibronectin and vWF Many receptors are involved in platelet adhesion and many agonists stimulate platelet aggregation but platelet aggregation requires GPIIb IIIa When platelets aggregate GPIIb IIIa binds to fibrinogen and vWF Binding to vWF gains importance under conditions of high shear stress Carter et al 16 found no overall association between the P1A2 polymorphism of the GPIIb IIIa gene and cerebral infarction confirmed by computed tomography CT However a subgroup analysis showed significant genotype distribution differences in nonsmokers The risk of stroke was greater in nonsmokers heterozygous for the P1A2 allele than in those homozygous for P1A2 OR 2 37 95 CI 1 19 to 4 74 P 0 01 Information on young stroke patients was limited n 37 but in a logistic regression model that included P1A genotype status smoking hypertension and diabetes the OR for stroke in those possessing the A2 allele was 1 68 95 CI 1 00 to 2 82 P 0 05 This study highlights the need for further studies of the interaction between genes and environmental factors in this case smoking in attempts to elucidate inherited stroke risk Aims The primary aim of ISGS is to test the association between ischemic stroke and the following putative risk factor polymorphisms fibrinogen C148T G448A and G455A GPIa C807T GPIb HPA 2 and VNTR and GPIIb IIIa P1A Exploratory aims are to investigate whether any association found between ischemic stroke and the panel of tested polymorphisms is contingent on sex age ethnic origin smoking status or stroke subtype and to investigate whether hemostatic gene sequence variations are associated with 90 day functional outcome after acute ischemic stroke Methods Design and Overview The ISGS is a prospective multicenter study using a case control design Fig 1 Patients and control subjects are screened at one of five clinical centers Appendix 1 Additional file 1 stroke status is verified the index stroke for each patient is subtyped and baseline clinical and demographic data are collected Blood samples are collected from all enrolled patients and control subjects by means of a one time venipuncture The samples are shipped to a central DNA bank for processing and storage and the processed DNA samples are sent to a central genetics laboratory for genotyping The genotype data are then merged with the clinical stroke and follow up data and analyzed to ascertain potential associations between stroke risk and genes for fibrinogen and platelet GPIa GPIb or GPIIb III Additional file 1 Click here for file Study Population Patients With Stroke Cases Each patient with suspected stroke admitted to a participating center is evaluated by a study neurologist according to current standards for care 17 18 The evaluation includes patient history physical examination CT or magnetic resonance imaging MR of the head and laboratory testing Where clinically indicated the evaluation may also include carotid ultrasonography MR CT or digital subtraction angiography transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography resting and ambulatory electrocardiography intracranial arterial imaging and additional blood testing Adult men and women who meet the following criteria are entered into the study 1 diagnosis of first ever ischemic stroke confirmed by the study neurologist on the basis of history physical examination and head imaging by CT or MR 2 enrollment within 30 days after onset of stroke symptoms 3 attained 18th birthday by the time of enrollment 4 complete blood cell count casual or fasting blood glucose prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time available and 5 written informed consent from the patient or surrogate Stroke is defined according to the World Health Organization criteria 19 as rapidly developing signs of a focal or global disturbance of cerebral function with symptoms lasting 24 hours or longer or leading to death with no apparent cause other than vascular origin A diagnosis of ischemic stroke is made only if the patient has a clinical diagnosis of stroke and if a CT scan or MR of the brain done after onset of symptoms either is normal or shows the relevant infarct Patients with hemorrhagic transformation of an infarct remain eligible Time of stroke onset is defined as the time when the subject was last noted to be at baseline neurologic status If the patient awoke with stroke symptoms the time of onset is taken as the last time the patient was known to be awake and without any symptoms of stroke We restrict enrollment to within 30 days after onset of symptoms from the first ever stroke to avoid potential survival bias 20 21 22 23 The date of enrollment is the date of obtaining signed informed consent Exclusion criteria parallel those of the Siblings With Ischemic Stroke Study SWISS 24 Patients who are already enrolled in SWISS are not eligible for participation in ISGS To be able to assess the extent to which enrolled patients represent all potential subjects clinical study coordinators at each site keep logs of every eligible stroke patient who is offered participation in the study whether or not they are enrolled The logs will contain initials and date of birth of the eligible stroke patients date of screening sex and race ethnicity Controls Controls are adult men and women who have attained their 18th birthday at the time of enrollment have not had a stroke are unrelated by blood to patients enrolled in the study and who give written informed consent to participate in the study We confirm that controls have not had a prior stroke by means of the Questionnaire for Verifying Stroke free Status QVSS a structured interview that was validated in an adult population age 60 years using systematic review of electronic medical records as the benchmark 25 The QVSS was further validated in an independent population using history and physical examination by a study neurologist as the benchmark 26 Interviewers administering the QVSS may exclude a subject they judge to be an unreliable historian on the basis of a global impression of moderate or severe impairment of speech language hearing or memory Hospitalized patients being treated for coronary or peripheral vascular disease are not eligible for enrollment as controls but nonhospitalized subjects with a history of these conditions are eligible Cases and controls are matched one to one Matching criteria are sex and age within 3 years for patients who are younger than 30 years and within 5 years for patients who are 30 years or older We recruit controls mainly from among spouses and unrelated friends of the patients Each center has a backup plan for recruiting community volunteers should there be a lag in recruitment of properly matched controls 27 Data Collection Structured Interview A structured interview is conducted by the study coordinator with each patient case or surrogate and each control subject to explain the study obtain informed consent and obtain standardized information on baseline medication and demographic medical social and behavioral variables Information regarding race and ethnicity is recorded according to self report A proband derived family history is taken for all living or deceased full siblings all biological children and both biological parents 28 Investigators do not independently verify stroke status of family members as part of this protocol Self reported cerebrovascular histories are obtained for all patients and control subjects by administering the QVSS during the baseline interview 25 Medical Records Study coordinators review the medical records of the initial evaluation of stroke cases to complete case report forms for documenting eligibility and baseline data and to construct the abstracted medical record used for stroke subtyping The following information is recorded on the case report forms patient history physical examination CT or MR of the head white blood cell count platelet count and hemoglobin concentration casual or fasting blood glucose prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time vital signs height weight blood pressure and temperature international normalized ratio lipid profile plasma homocysteine concentration and size and location of the symptomatic cerebral infarct as seen on head imaging The clinical coordinator also constructs the abstracted medical record used for subtyping of the index stroke by copying admission notes physician progress notes discharge summaries radiology reports electrocardiograms echocardiography reports laboratory reports and rehabilitation notes Investigators and coordinators use standardized definitions for major medical and surgical comorbid conditions Appendix 2 see Additional file 2 Because blood pressure typically falls during the first few days after an acute ischemic stroke we have adopted a modification of the Northern Manhattan Stroke Study NOMASS technique 29 in which we use the systolic and diastolic blood pressure values measured after admission to the hospital floor or intensive care unit rather than measurements taken by the emergency medical service or in the emergency department Blood pressure is measured from the left brachial artery if attainable with a sphygmomanometer with the patient sitting upright If the patient is bedbound the measurement is made with the head of the bed elevated to at least a 45 angle Additional file 2 Click here for file Characterization of Ischemic Stroke An on site study appointed neurologist confirms the diagnosis of ischemic stroke and the time of stroke onset by interviewing patients or any available observers present when the stroke was first noticed 30 The examiner seeks corroborating evidence such as ambulance reports and carefully screens for the possibility of onset during sleep The severity of the neurologic deficit is assessed within 48 hours of the patient s enrollment in the study by means of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale NIHSS 31 administered by a certified examiner The first CT or MR obtained is used to measure infarct size by means of standardized criteria Appendix 3 see Additional file 3 Prestroke functional status is assessed retrospectively by the study coordinator with the Oxford Handicap Scale 32 Acute poststroke functional status is assessed with the Oxford Handicap Scale 32 Barthel Index 33 34 and Glasgow Outcome Scale 35 within 48 hours of enrollment Subtyping of the index ischemic stroke is done centrally on the basis of the abstracted medical record by a neurologist adjudicator blinded to genotype data and personal indentifiers Because final subtype diagnosis has been shown to vary from initial diagnosis in approximately one third of cases 36 the adjudicator uses all available and relevant information obtained after completion of the stroke work up The Trial of ORG10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment TOAST 37 Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project OCSP 38 and Baltimore Washington Young Stroke Study BWYSS 39 classification systems are used for subtyping Additional file 3 Click here for file Follow up of Stroke Patients Patients with stroke are followed up by the study coordinator at the center from which they were recruited The coordinator reassesses patients by using the Oxford Handicap Scale Barthel Index and Glasgow Outcome Scale by telephone interview 90 14 days after onset of stroke symptoms Coordinators preferentially interview the patients themselves However if acquired deficits of speech language or cognition prevent the patient from participating in the telephone outcomes assessment a surrogate history is taken from a caregiver or live in relative Coordinators will also record mortality and history of cause of death from collateral sources Genetic Data The study coordinator at the local center obtains two tubes of peripheral blood from each patient and each control subject collected in a 10 mL 8 5 mL draw acid citrate dextrose solution A ACD tube The blood samples are shipped to a central DNA bank by overnight courier and assigned a unique repository identifier Lymphocytes are isolated and 0 5 mL of blood is retained in the original tube as a quality control specimen for identity testing Isolated lymphocytes are cryopreserved using controlled rate freezing and stored at the liquid phase of nitrogen The DNA bank prepares high quality high molecular weight DNA from the cell pellet using a modification of the salting out procedure of Miller et al 40 Quality control studies on DNA consist of estimation of quantity by OD260 OD280 ratio estimation of integrity by gel electrophoresis and restriction digestion and verification of identity by microsatellite analysis and sex determination Transformation of lymphocytes is done using Epstein Barr virus and phytohemagglutinin Lymphocyte cultures are expanded to produce sufficient stock for 10 to 12 ampules All cell cultures are done in the absence of antibiotics Cryopreservation is again done by controlled rate freezing Samples are stored at the liquid phase of nitrogen In house and remote fail safe stocks are generated The following routine quality control studies for cell culture are performed recovery of frozen stock and determination of viability sterility testing for bacterial and fungal contamination testing for mycoplasma contamination by polymerase chain reaction PCR and confirmation of the identity of the culture by comparing the DNA fingerprint of the culture with that of the quality control specimen If the first attempt fails a second aliquot of cryopreserved lymphocytes can be transformed Genotyping is done at a central genetics laboratory Currently the following sequencing methods are used but the laboratory will be responsive to technological advances in the field PCR is carried out in a 75 L volume on 40 ng genomic DNA by use of plain primers under standard conditions with a 57 to 52 C 0 5 C cycle touch down annealing temperature To remove excess unincorporated primers that would compete as sequencing primers in the cycle sequencing reaction the amplified product is filtered with MultiScreen PCR filters Millipore and resuspended in 50 L The sequencing reaction is carried out using the BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing kit Applied Biosystems as per the manufacturer s conditions To remove excess dye terminators the sequencing product is purified by ethanol precipitation and resuspended in 10 L of HiDi formamide The samples are then denatured and electrophoresed on an ABI 3100 capillary analyzer Data analysis is carried out with a software suite ABI consisting of Sequencing Analysis base calling Factura heterozygous base detection and Sequence Navigator sequence comparison Adverse Events All adverse events and serious adverse events will be recorded by the study coordinators and forwarded to the statistical center Potential physical risks are minimal and relate to the one time phlebotomy An independent medical safety monitor will review summary reports of adverse events and serious adverse events periodically and will forward assessments to the study Principal Investigator Outcome Measures The main end point of the study is whether any of the polymorphisms the fibrinogen polymorphisms C148T G448A and G455A and the platelet GP polymorphisms GPIa C807T GPIb HPA 2 and VNTR and GPIIb IIIa P1A are associated with ischemic stroke Thus patients with stroke will be compared with controls as to frequency and distribution of these polymorphisms Other end points include potential associations among these polymorphisms and individual subtypes of ischemic stroke ethnic origin or 90 day poststroke functional outcome and mortality Additional analyses will include testing for interactions between inherited susceptibility genotype and environmental exposures e g smoking Data Analyses Several types of analyses will be performed to assess the relationships between outcome binary and continuous and risk factors both genetic and environmental The statistical techniques we use to analyze the data depend on the distribution of the independent predictor and dependent outcome variables When the outcome variables are categorical i e stroke yes no we will use chi square tests and logistic regression techniques when the outcome variables are continuous with or without inclusion of collected longitudinal data we will use repeated measures analysis of covariance ANCOVA techniques Cases will be compared with controls with respect to predictor variables of interest and with respect to genotypes that may provide increased risk for stroke Where needed adjustments for potential covariates age sex hypertension etc will also be included in these analyses To perform the above comparisons we will use logistic regression a statistical technique for modeling the relationship of a binary outcome and a set of independent or predictor variables 41 For our case control comparisons a second series of analyses relates to the distribution of polymorphisms within the selected candidate genes in the cases stroke positive and controls stroke negative Each subject will be characterized by the polymorphism or mutation found at each candidate gene Different analytical strategies need to be employed for the different candidate loci under study For the fibrinogen gene cluster it is proposed that the genotype be considered as a binary variable that is as a single nucleotide polymorphism SNP with two possible alleles since the outcome of polymorphisms in genes of this cluster has resulted in apparent increased risk for ischemic heart disease through increased circulating fibrinogen levels Thus initial analyses using members of the fibrinogen cluster or with other candidate genes such as GPIb will focus on each case control being classified by the presence of a risk allele yes no with comparison of SNP allele frequencies between groups stroke control For other candidate genes GPIb etc distributions of genotypes or strata determined by alleles or haplotypes can be established for comparison For example GPIb has a series of polymorphisms that may define an allele of interest Extending SNPs to haplotypes has the advantage of increased information yet decreased power in small samples due to the increased number of possible haplotypes to be tested Restriction of haplotypes by binning may provide some increase in power yet it assumes previous knowledge of risk haplotypes These few haplotypes can be used to establish strata in the analyses proposed In separate analyses the SNP polymorphism status can be considered to be an exposure variable Thus risk factor distributions can be compared between exposed subjects with a polymorphism in a candidate gene and those not exposed without a polymorphism For levels of continuous risk factors this analysis will compare means by analysis of variance methods For dichotomous risk factors contingency table methods can be used In the case control analyses each candidate locus can be analyzed individually as a potential modifier of disease risk stroke and as a determinant of other intermediate continuous trait end points To evaluate the relationships between gene interaction gene gene and interaction between inherited susceptibility genotype and environmental exposures e g hypertension or smoking several strategies can be employed One approach is stratification by genotype at each candidate locus with analysis of case status with the second genetic or environmental exposure For dichotomous exposures this reduces to a comparison of contingency tables within genotype strata A second approach uses logistic regression Logistic regression can be used for continuous risk factors within genotype strata Similarly multivariate logistic regression can be used to predict group membership stroke vs control based on age sex environmental risk factors that appear significant in univariate analyses and genotype s with first order interaction terms of genotype with environment and gene 1 with gene 2 Sample Size and Study Power We intend to enroll a total of 900 participants including 450 patients with ischemic stroke cases and 450 stroke free volunteers controls at five academic medical centers in the United States over 3 years Estimates of potential for recruitment were based on the assumption that the rates of hospitalized stroke cases at the five participating hospitals will remain at 1999 levels throughout the patient recruitment phase of the study We anticipate that the study population will be approximately two thirds white and one third African American giving sample sizes of approximately 300 each for white patients with stroke and control subjects and 100 each for African American patients with stroke and control subjects Thus for the above analyses we are concerned primarily with dichotomous outcomes with fixed sample sizes 100 300 or 450 stroke cases and 100 300 or 450 controls Power for any analyses involving continuous measures can be approximated using an independent t test comparison between the incident cases and controls In the case control study the power to address specific issues relating to the genetic associations is dependent on the sample size available the frequency of the polymorphisms in the fibrinogen cluster and other candidate genes and the size of the effect to be detected The power is determined on the basis of the frequency of the SNP in the control group and the detectable difference in SNP allele frequency in the control group For example if an SNP has a frequency of 0 40 in the total group of controls n 450 we can detect with 75 power a 20 difference in cases 0 20 0 40 0 08 or frequencies greater than 0 48 or less than 0 32 in cases This is obviously a small difference or a relatively weak genetic relative risk Using this same example we would have 46 power in whites and 22 power in African Americans For the African American group we generally have power for relatively high frequency polymorphisms in controls approximately 45 50 and detectable differences of 40 in cases 0 20 difference Thus we could detect an SNP allele frequency of 0 70 in cases and 0 45 in controls with 80 power In general the power to detect gene environment interaction effects is less than that for main effects and is dependent on the type of interaction For example using methods discussed by Goodman 42 the power to detect interactions for multiple scenarios is possible For these scenarios 2 2 tables can be used to describe the overall main effects of genetic and environmental risks i e both the genetic and the environmental risk factors display a main effect size odds ratio of about 4 For large interactions we have 99 statistical power Only in the smallest subgroup would power be appreciably affected For example for the African American group 100 cases and 100 controls with the same distribution of individuals as above the power to detect the large interactions OR of 0 33 in controls OR of 5 33 in cases would still be 99 while the power to detect the modest interaction OR of 0 80 in controls OR of 1 50 in cases would be reduced to 13 Ethical Considerations Local institutional review boards IRBs governing each clinical center have approved the study protocol Written informed consent is obtained for every study subject To the extent permitted by local IRBs surrogate consent is permitted for patients rendered incompetent by stroke to avoid biasing the study toward discovery of risk factors for mild or moderate stroke but not severe stroke Genetic information has the potential to adversely affect insurability and employability 43 44 An individual s genetic information could also lead to stigmatization within a family and a community 45 Because of the highly sensitive nature of genetic information we have developed the following plan to prevent intentional or unintentional misuse of genetic data which is in keeping with the Privacy Workshop Planning Subcommittee Guidelines of the National Action Plan on Breast Cancer 46 Every ISGS investigator who obtains or has access to genotypic data is blinded to individual personal identifiers and every investigator who obtains or has access to individual personal identifiers is blinded to genotypic data Personal identifiers are defined as individual names addresses phone numbers fax numbers and e mail addresses Personal identifiers and linkage codes are kept only at the clinical center where the study subject was enrolled and will not be recorded on case report forms or stored in the study electronic database Experimental research data are not placed in a participant s medical record There have been various opinions regarding whether family members should be considered human subjects in pedigree research and when it is permissible to waive consent 28 47 48 49 In ISGS no personal identifiers are collected on family members The protocol of ISGS calls for centrally banking DNA and creating immortalized cell lines Unlike the situation in clinical trial research no broad consensus on research ethics exists among investigators and eligible participants in the field of human molecular genetics research Of recent contention are procedures for ensuring ethical future use of stored genetic material 50 51 The potential for future use of DNA should be anticipated even if the specific studies cannot be known A future use agreement should respect genetic privacy rights and autonomy of human subjects while encouraging scientific inquiry Establishing a transparent and ethically sound future use agreement for research in this field facilitates multicenter collaborations and future research After reviewing available policy statements from genetics societies and governmental agencies we developed the following list of key principles which are incorporated into a future use agreement governing DNA banked for this study 1 Subjects must provide informed consent to the original study at the time of DNA collection 2 The original study must have a rigorous procedure in place to protect privacy of study subjects prior to DNA collection 3 Patients should have the option to consent to or refrain from participation in future research at the time of the initial consent process 4 Levels of consent must be clear explicit and exclusive e g original study only any stroke study any study 5 Applications for future use need to be reviewed formally 6 Study investigators can release DNA for future use only after determining whether the new study conforms to the type of research permitted by the donor 7 All specimens are stripped of direct personal identifiers before future use 8 Anonymous data sets with genetic information from different studies may be merged for hypothesis generating analyses We believe that this carefully developed publicly scrutinized future use agreement is a unique strength of this study and hope that this proactive approach will avoid some of the rancorous misunderstandings that other investigative groups have encountered in genetic and pedigree research 51 Discussion Defining the molecular basis for the inherited component to ischemic stroke risk will require converging lines of evidence from various methodologies including genomewide screens 24 and candidate gene association studies Collection of DNA samples from a large cohort of ischemic stroke pedigrees is logistically challenging Collection of DNA samples from patients with stroke and unrelated stroke free controls is more feasible Some stroke genetics research has been done in the context of epidemiological studies for example a study by Ridker and colleagues 15 tested for an association between factor V Leiden and stroke One limitation of this approach is that there may be relatively few stroke end points in an epidemiological study particularly because stroke myocardial infarction and vascular death are often combined as the primary end point Furthermore for various reasons epidemiological studies may include a selected population for example only one sex or a limited socioeconomic stratum The use of such highly selected samples may compromise the ability to generalize the findings of a genetic association study Genetic association can be studied within the context of a clinical trial of an intervention for primary prevention In a prevention study DNA would be available both from patients with stroke and from stroke free controls but the intervention may alter the outcome stroke sufficiently to confound interpretation of the results of a genetic association study A genetic study in the context of a randomized trial of treatment of stroke patients is a robust study design when the goal is to discover genetic determinants of stroke outcome or response to therapy pharmacogenomics However such a study design may not achieve the goal of discovering genetic risk factors for stroke because no genetic material from stroke free controls outside of the study would be available Furthermore highly restrictive criteria for eligibility into a clinical trial can drastically limit the representativeness of a study population For example in one study of intra arterial thrombolysis for treatment of acute ischemic stroke 12 323 patients with stroke were screened and only 180 patients were selected 4 Other stroke studies include only patients with nondisabling strokes 52 or include only patients with moderate to severe strokes 4 Because ISGS is a dedicated stroke genetic association study it has broad eligibility criteria relative to clinical trials of drugs or devices We expect this to enhance the external validity of the results of the study Additionally we have given careful attention to appropriate selection of controls 27 The controls are concurrently enrolled at the same centers as are the patients and controls are also screened for a medical history of stroke or transient ischemic attack and for the presence of symptoms of stroke or transient ischemic attack which may have occurred in the absence of a corresponding medical history A unique strength of ISGS is that the protocol was specifically developed to permit valid future pooled analyses with the ongoing affected sibling pair linkage study SWISS 24 53 which uses genome wide screening within a cohort of pedigrees to identify chromosomal regions rather than specific polymorphisms that are linked to stroke Conducting a candidate gene association study in cases and controls has advantages compared with the genome wide linkage approach in siblings Isolated cases are more likely to be available than sibling pairs increasing the potential for statistical power Furthermore determination of phenotype is often retrospective in genome wide linkage studies because it is rarely possible to enroll all affected members of a pedigree shortly after onset of stroke In contrast the case control approach allows prospective phenotyping of all subjects at the time of onset of stroke which may be more reliable than retrospective phenotyping This is an advantage because ischemic stroke has a heterogeneous phenotype and distinctions between specific clinical subtypes of ischemic stroke may be relevant 54 55 To address the heterogeneity of the ischemic stroke phenotype ischemic stroke is subtyped by a genotype blinded adjudicator in both ISGS and SWISS ISGS and SWISS also use the same definitions for ischemic stroke and comorbidity and the same criteria for classifying stroke mechanism Both studies use the same key exclusion criteria for example both studies exclude iatrogenic and vasospastic ischemic stroke patients and exclude the same mendelian and mitochondrial disorders In addition the stroke free status of controls in ISGS and of discordant siblings in SWISS is verified using the same structured interview instrument i e the QVSS 25 We anticipate that the two studies will complement each other in contributing to the broad long term objective of defining the molecular basis for inherited ischemic stroke risk List of abbreviations BWYSS Baltimore
