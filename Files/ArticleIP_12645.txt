 Do as I Say Not as I Do By way of introducing our subject providing for the material needs of a baby a caveat Whatever it is you don t need it In other words do as I say not as I ve done It is permissible I believe to shop like a mad dog for your first child and when Daughter No 1 arrived nearly two years ago I did But when my auxiliary daughter appeared on the scene last month I learned not one lesson from the mistakes of previous rampages A sort of shopping psychosis overtakes the mind of a father fresh from the delivery room It might be rooted in some sort of primal hunter gatherer type urge the kind that afflicts most men when they enter a Price Club Of course we need 24 gallons of WD 40 honey You never know when they re going to stop making it Conquer this urge and you may graduate the first month of parenthood without fielding a call from an American Express security officer worried about unusual activity on your card Here then a quick guide to what you need and what you don t This is obviously a subjective guide written by the kind of flawed individual who actually considered buying an electric baby wipe warmer It is also the briefest of guides each subcategory of baby products is worthy of book length discussion Finally it is utilitarian If you are the sort of person who must have a Kate Spade diaper bag knowing full well that a Kate Spade diaper bag is a waste of 250 I can t help you D iapers Diaper bags are a good place to start since they are unnecessary A 20 knapsack and a 2 dry down an absorbent washable pad are perfectly sufficient substitutes Diapers are however necessary and I would suggest as a first step the purchase of Price Club diapers which come in huge cartons and cost about 25 percent less than the equivalent number of Pampers Warehouse club diapers aren t as handsome or sturdy looking as premium or supreme diapers but even standard diapers today can absorb the contents of a camel s hump without leaking Avoid premium diapers that contain emollients or aloe vera which don t transfer to the baby s skin The only diaper worth paying a premium price for is one that changes itself There is no downside this pun was genuinely unintended to Price Club baby wipes whose very inferiority make them a better product Most premium brands Huggies Pampers and the like are soaked to an absurd degree with whatever strange chemical cleansers all wipes are soaked in Price Club wipes however are packaged with more modest amounts of cleansing liquid presumably to save the manufacturer money Which is fine because wipes that are too wet must then be followed up with several dry cloth swipes which can irritate the skin As for electric baby wipe warmers one of which in my local high end baby superstore Buy Buy Baby awful names are a hazard of this trade sold for 24 99 I have this to say As much as I want my children to be sheltered from the cruelties of life on earth I think they should get used to the fact that sometimes their asses will get cold One more note as we leave the diaper department An indispensable purchase is a Diaper Genie a brilliant little contraption that is a vast improvement over the open diaper pail A Diaper Genie which generally sells for around 25 accepts dirty diapers through a hole on top and with a few twists of a canister seals the diapers in plastic and eliminates most of the smell It does not provide Level 4 biohazard containment ignore the optimistic odor free claim made on the box but it will do in most cases C lothing Even if you are only moderately popular and come from a modestly sized family you will receive on the birth of your first child at least 500 worth of Baby Gap clothing Which means that a gift of Gap stock rather than Gap clothing should be far more welcome There are those who decry the style hegemony of Baby Gap but I am not one of them The clothing is relatively inexpensive durable and returnable The point is this There are plenty of places to dump 100 on a pair of awfully cute baby overalls that will be worn exactly three times but 100 baby overalls like subzero freezers and Land Rovers are a sign that you have too much money Car safety On issues of child safety I take the SDI position which is to say there is no such thing as too much defense spending Hence the Ford Explorer parked outside which I would upgrade to an Expedition except that I live in a neighborhood filled with Naderite public interest lawyers who would firebomb my house if I drove anything so offensive Two tons of metal are not enough to defend your children however A maximalist position on safety means only one car seat will do the Britax It is more expensive than the run of the mill Century line of car seats a Britax runs above 200 but it is made of material so hard it would crack your knee if you walked into it and its belting system is far more encompassing and elaborate than the average car seat s H ome safety Every baby superstore features a section that could be called the Wall of Death At Buy Buy Baby the suburban Washington store with which I m most familiar the Wall of Death rises 16 feet into the air and stretches 10 feet wide and every inch of the wall is covered with child safety products some of which are absolutely useless and most of which I have bought I haven t got around to installing the toilet lid locks yet Obviously outlet guards and rubber padding for low furniture the Coffee Tables of Death with which most parents are familiar are necessary but the Wall of Death preys on parental fear Hence a product called fireplace gas valve safety covers whose purpose was too obscure for me to understand and the VCR Lock which according to the packaging prevents child from inserting objects into cassette opening Another way to prevent a deadly epidemic of object insertions is to move the VCR Incidentally the best way to keep a child from drowning in the toilet is to keep an eye on the child or the toilet excessive reliance on safety products tends toward lower vigilance Then there are the baby monitors arguably a necessity if you live in a big house and can t hear the baby crying in her room and also a necessity if you re interested in intercepting police transmissions but is the Child View Monitor and Television for 149 99 really necessary You can t even use it to spy on a nanny since it has no hidden camera capabilities Breast pumps Ask someone else C ribs You can spend 500 or 1 000 on a crib or you can spend 200 Spend 200 All cribs do the same thing which is stand there All cribs sold in reputable stores meet current safety standards so no worries in that regard Shoes Payless ShoeSource or the equivalent is the way to go Actually barefoot is the way to go but in those places where a small child should wear shoes such as needle strewn playgrounds it is a waste of money to spend more than 10 99 on a pair of shoes We bought Daughter No 1 three pairs of 35 shoes which she outgrew in a month and wore so rarely in that month that amortized the shoes cost 10 per wearing money that could have been better spent on fireplace gas valve safety covers T oys An endless subject one that I m hesitant to tackle and my children aren t old enough for me to comment on Furby with any authority One general observation though The wrapping paper is always more interesting to a baby than whatever s inside so my gift suggestion would be a cardboard box wrapped in bright red paper and filled with Tupperware and wooden spoons That is if you can stand the noise produced by wooden spoons hitting Tupperware The general subject of toys is a sensitive one in my house because it is on toys that I am a serial spender An example Four days after my second daughter was born I was dispatched to Buy Buy Baby to find some sort of bassinet accouterment worth about 9 50 I returned home two hours later with 300 worth of toys including a stuffed mounted furry rhino head that cost 89 99 At the time I somehow believed that my daughters would grow up healthy and secure if they just had a stuffed mounted rhino head in their room I don t know why I believed this The rhino head has since been returned and I am banned from toy stores until such time as I regain my bearings It was a foolish purchase I see now for 89 99 I could have bought three electric baby wipe warmers Or one third of a Kate Spade diaper bag
