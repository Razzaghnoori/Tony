        Jeff what do you think are you paying to much in taxes     i certainly think that in some cases i am but uh i think its mostly on the federal area were i dont see as much maybe for for my money as uh i might uh i thought of school taxes as well and i was very involved in schools uh in the local community a couple years ago and it was pretty easy to see where it went all there but i guess i have the same opinion that some American have that uh uh its all fat       how about you   well i i im one of those that im kind of glad i dont get all the government i pay for   i tell me more i dont understand     well i just ship off so much money to the federal government and if they really uh took it and and did things to govern me well that would be a lot more government than what i think i need   uh   oh uh the one i guess that on a daily basis the one that bother me is the sale tax im paying eight and a quarter percent on sale tax       yes at   yeah that that adds up   yeah and and you know you you put put your money down on the counter thinking that is enough to pay for it then you need another dollar because you had not guess right on the sale tax   uhhuh it certainly adds up quickly yes and ive heard it said that of course that effect that effect us across the board in terms of social economic uh areas everybody pays that sale tax   oh yes   um i guess thats i i guess im luck here i only pay five percent and   that that sound great to me   well if you want to move here uh all you have to do is find a job so i guess you trade things off one way or another       yeah i suppose so       yeah there there has been a lot of going on in Texas in term of financing schools uh there some judge decide that we had to have pay equal amount to students i mean you know education dollars per student all across the state well as you know its very large state   umhum cool   and it certainly cost more in in some areas than it does in others   exactly they uh   and the they they call it the robin hood plan plan taking from the from the mostly prosperous urban district or suburb district and passing it alone to the rural districts so i dont know that thats going to be in the courts for a long time     i would think so uh that sort of thing has been tried here and the results are results the results were not too hardening uh and the belief here is uh kind of education what do we need that for   huh well that thats about the attitude here is just that you know if if youre paying for your local tax youre paying your local school district you can see some results of it but its if you stop and think that some of that money is going to go get shipped off to South Texas or something   yeah   you it its almost like i dont know socialism or something isnt it   exactly uh and i would think base upon my experience you have to have some of that uh consider uh some of these places in Idaho that have a school district of a total of about two hundred or three hundred children   yeah   and there a certain amount of overhead in running a school district uh for instance those kids may be spread out uh over an area where driving the buses you may go forty or fifty or even sixty miles and can you really expect the uh the people in that district to support all that overhead of getting the kids to and from school so some of the money come through the states from all people in the state basically equal well base upon their income to im sorry i i take i that back a little bit of it comes from their income uh to support doing thing like that and thats probably okay uh its kind of like telephone where uh the folk that live in the middle of town subsidize for people that have lines that go out for four or five miles   uhhuh   uh the other thing that we have is a property tax and that tend to subsidies part of it also uh the disadvantage there of course the people get into is they say hey i dont have any kids in school ive been retried for thirty five years and im still paying for somebody education   i know huh huh yeah   i i guess im a believe in yes you have to you have to have some overhead just like uh i never used the fire department but at the some time ill hate to have to ante up before they got here     yes its true       thats true do you have income tax and   yes yes yes we still pay that i suspect its not quite a higher percentage as you may pay   we dont have a state income tax yet   well   huh its coming       its its on its way i im almost certain   yeah   uh but thats why we have that eight and a quarter percent sales tax   i i certainly thats true   and and you know the the damage
