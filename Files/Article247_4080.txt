 Lighten Up Steve Brill Tucker Ooh Steve Brill Do I really want to say what I think about him and then have to read a 25 page analysis of my various journalistic indiscretions in Brill s Con Job Including a discography of all the free copies of Beastie Boys CDs I received in the mail and kept Even though we never actually ran a review The trouble with him and his self police force is they have no sense of humor Ombudsmen Agate type footnotes Geez My heart aches for the days of the old Spy when columnists hid behind pseudonyms skewered Abe I m Writing as Bad as I Can Rosenthal and other Times men and recounted delicious personal details about editors I d never heard of who left the bathroom without washing their hands etc Instead we get pots calling kettles black and not just pots but rich and powerful pots with rich and powerful friends Lighten up Steve Let he who is without synergy cast the first stone For what it s worth my somewhat obvious street corner view is that the conflicts of interests that drive Brill nuts are inevitable Media mergers and gobblings up and the like have made it impossible for us to do our jobs if we re obligated to disqualify ourselves from covering companies or people a we do business with b we have a personal relationship or history with or c are in competition with I m not saying I like it I m just saying there it is Where Brill goes wrong is in failing to distinguish between the most innocuous and naturally occurring conflicts from those lipstick smeared ones that could have and should have been avoided In the former category I put say Entertainment Weekly s decision to review the Pok mon movie which was released by Warner Bros what s it gonna do not run a review In the latter I put the Times decision to keep Bernie Weinraub on the movie business beat all that time after his wife ascended to the ranks of studio muckety muck And I won t even mention the sort of logrolling that routinely goes on in the book review biz the most recent example of which involves a certain D C based weekly political magazine that shall remain nameless But not shameless Into the latter category alas I must also put at least one of your current employers which each seem to be piece of a big honking conglomerate as is mine Can you tell that I m dying to talk about Alex Unpronounceable Last Name s Talk piece in yesterday s Times In a way I admire what Tina Brown is doing he said respectfully protecting his future job prospects Rather than mincing around on the edges of the conflict of interest minefield she s charging down the middle ignoring the explosions to her left and right What I don t admire is her pretending however energetically that she s doing something other than shilling for the Weinsteins Knowing that insert blonde starlet here appears on the cover because she s got a movie coming out doesn t make me want to read the story less or more Whereas Tina s insisting that she put Elizabeth Hurley in an extraterrestrial fashion spread because it was a cute idea and not because she starred in My Favorite Martian a film available right now on video from Miramax s parent company Disney totally and completely strains credibility My advice Out yourself Come clean Tattoo Bob on one set of knuckles and Harv on the other like Belushi in Blues Brothers It s not as if we ll stop reading the magazine or start Before I sign off I must point out my favorite wire story of the week month and year Reuters reported yesterday that a Canadian tourist has filed a 1 5 million lawsuit because his penis was allegedly crushed in a Starbucks No not in a roaster he was in the bathroom making as they say a grande when he reached back for the toilet paper and inadvertently got himself caught between the seat and bowl But did he wash his hands Brill get me rewrite Regards Evan
