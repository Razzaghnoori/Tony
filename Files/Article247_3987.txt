 Weekend Cocktail Chatter Sometimes it s worth remembering that the everyday business of Wall Street even in these bull market days is quite mundane And I m not talking just about the brokers and traders who are still out there trying to hit that bid for 50 000 shares at 60 I m also talking about the analysts like the Salomon Smith Barney analyst who today started coverage of General Motors with a hold recommendation Think of it Why General Motors right now And starting it with a hold It s like a restaurant critic who s forced to specialize in different gradations of bland Or a movie reviewer spending his time explaining why Music of the Heart got two stars instead of one and a half Or but I prattle on Anyway the big news of the week was of course the Microsoft decision except that the big news was how little news the decision made on Wall Street at least in terms of moving the market as a whole or even the company s stock which now stands only a point or so below where it was when Judge Jackson handed down his ruling Actually the decision did help Microsoft s competitors including especially the Linux companies Apparently something can simultaneously be unimportant to a company and incredibly important to the companies it s competing against It s the inscrutable wisdom of the market And so on to Cocktail Chat 1 In a truly phenomenal decision the Delaware Chancery Court ordered three top executives at Computer Associates to give back 9 5 million shares of stock worth 558 million And I already spent it on Pok mon cards will not be an acceptable defense 2 Priceline com introduced its newest and most baffling innovation You can now offer bids on the price of groceries Airlines make seats available to Priceline because they re perishable commodities if no one uses them they re a total loss and hotels do the same with empty rooms So what items are grocery stores going to make available Day old bread batteries that are about to expire and mystery meat Well This is going to be big Really big 3 The Sci Fi Channel announced that it will begin broadcasting a weekday talk show with medium John Edward who is known for his uncanny ability to see dead people Just like the kid in The Sixth Sense Variety said Sci Fi was hoping to appeal to viewers who are not necessarily believers of the occult Apparently only if the show featured someone who could actually raise the dead would it appeal to believers in the occult 4 On its opening day of trading Cobalt Networks saw its shares better than quintuple rising from 22 to 128 In other words Cobalt went from being a micro cap stock to a mid cap stock in the space of six hours 5 In what was touted as a major vote of confidence by investors in the new direction being taken by Metro Goldwyn Mayer the company raised 721 million in a successful stock rights offering that allowed current shareholders to buy additional shares at a discount MGM said 99 3 percent of its shareholders exercised their rights Of course 89 percent of MGM is owned by Kirk Kerkorian who exercised all his rights So what really happened is that Kerkorian gave MGM another 650 million to play with But I suppose that is a vote of confidence of sorts 6 Citing attorney client privilege Sunbeam is refusing to turn over to the SEC a report by Skadden Arps on the company s financial woes despite the fact that the SEC has subpoenaed the information Perhaps by the time it surfaces there will be 18 pages missing from it 7 Amazon com s stock rose more than 15 percent after it announced Monday that it would be holding a press conference Tuesday to disclose major new initiatives Then it fell almost the same 15 percent Tuesday after it actually held the press conference One wonders what would have happened if at the press conference it had only announced that it would be holding another press conference the next day
