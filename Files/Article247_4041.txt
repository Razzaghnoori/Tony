Post off lead and an Los Angeles Times front piece all reflect on what the 106th Republican Congress has accomplished in a year which began with Senate acquittal of Clinton The Post notes the 106th was notable more for what it did not do than for what it did NYT and LAT concur Failures include the inability to restructure Medicare and Social Security and pass gun control legislation or the 792 billion tax cut and the rejection of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty The Post and NYT cite the overhaul of Depression era laws limiting the interaction of banks securities firms and insurance companies as the 106th s most significant feat The LAT notes it but says the GOP s most striking accomplishment was promising to end the long standing practice of using Social Security revenues to finance other parts of government The Democrats backed them up on their pledge NYT emphasizes the congressional Republicans post impeachment resentment of Clinton an idea echoed by the LAT The NYT
