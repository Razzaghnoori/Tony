 Background High resolution mapping and chromosome walking critical steps in the positional cloning of a mutant gene may become problematic and tedious without high density molecular markers Although a number of molecular marker maps are available for various species further resolution of the target region is often required as markers may be irregularly spaced along the chromosome owing to uneven rates of recombination In addition focusing the genetic interval reduces the time and resources necessary for chromosome walking Comparative mapping is based on regions of microsynteny between two organisms and provides a powerful technique for enriching molecular markers in the region surrounding a gene of interest A number of researchers have suggested that map based cloning in economically important crop species can be expedited by utilizing chromosomal microsynteny between the target and a model species 1 2 3 The recently completed sequence of the entire genome of Arabidopsis thaliana 4 now provides a catalog of ordered reference genes immediately applicable to other higher plant species 5 Conservation of synteny is well documented in closely related species within the same family for example Arabidopsis and Brassica oleracea 6 rice and barley 7 and tomato potato and capsicum 8 9 Recent comparative sequence analyses and mapping studies have indicated that microsynteny and macrosynteny are also well conserved between Arabidopsis and evolutionarily divergent species such as tomato 10 11 or soybean 12 Thus comparative mapping has the potential to rapidly identify additional molecular markers in a region of interest in those species The single gene diageotropica dgt mutant of tomato Lycopersicon esculentum displays a pleiotropic phenotype that includes reduced auxin sensitivity 13 A number of physiological and molecular studies suggest that a Dgt dependent auxin signal transduction pathway regulates a subset of early auxin response genes 14 15 16 17 however the nature of the Dgt gene is still unknown We have been using a map based cloning strategy to isolate the Dgt gene previously mapped to the long arm of chromosome 1 8 On the basis of recent comparative sequence analyses showing well conserved microsynteny between the tomato and Arabidopsis genomes within relatively small regions 10 11 we applied microsynteny based comparative mapping to facilitate the positional cloning of the Dgt gene and successfully reduced the genetic interval with new molecular markers Results Identification of microsyntenic regions in Arabidopsischromosomes Using restriction length fragment polymorphism RFLP and RFLP derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence CAPS markers Figure 1 based on previously published tomato genetic and RFLP maps 8 initial studies mapped the dgt locus to a region of around 0 8 cM near the bottom of the long arm of tomato chromosome 1 Of 1 308 backcross BC 1 individuals screened 10 plants were determined to be recombinant between markers TG269 and CT190 whereas no plants were found to be recombinant between TG389 and dgt Figure 1 To identify additional genes within that region by finding microsyntenic regions in Arabidopsis nucleotide sequences of the three RFLP markers most closely linked to the dgt locus TG269 TG389 and CT190 were used to identify homeologous sequences in the Arabidopsis genome database 18 BLASTN matches with an arbitrary threshold expect value E value of less than 0 01 were investigated as significant matches Three putative microsyntenic regions MSRs were identified in the Arabidopsis genome Figures 1 2 In MSR1 homeologs of all three tomato RFLP markers were found in the same linear order on two adjacent Arabidopsis bacterial artificial chromosome BAC clones from chromosome 4 Arabidopsis accession numbers are in parentheses F20M13 AL035540 and T9A14 AL035656 The Arabidopsis homeologs of TG269 TG389 and CT190 in MSR1 had corresponding E values of 4e 3 2e 7 and 3e 5 respectively The Arabidopsis homeologs of markers TG269 AT4g38850 TG389 AT4g38730 and CT190 AT4g38580 encode a small auxin upregulated protein SAUR a hypothetical protein of unknown function HP and a farnesylated protein FP respectively The second microsyntenic region MSR2 spanned two Arabidopsis BAC clones F11l11 AL079347 and M4E13 AL022023 and was also located on chromosome 4 but only yielded homeologs for tomato markers TG269 and CT190 E values of 1e 3and 8e 3 respectively The third microsyntenic region MSR3 was located on Arabidopsis chromosome 2 and spanned Arabidopsis BACs F26H11 AC006263 and F7O24 AC007142 This region only contained a homeolog to TG389 AT2g21120 E value of 9e 4 However additional auxin regulated genes were identified in this region AT2g21200 to AT2g21220 which made continued analysis potentially beneficial In addition this region had previously been reported to be syntenic to MSR1 19 Therefore we also included MSR3 in the comparative analysis of genes in MSRs between tomato and Arabidopsis Close inspection of the microsyntenic regions detected by BLASTN analysis suggested that the genomic microstructure was highly conserved in all three MSRs Eighteen of 45 genes 40 identified in MSR1 also have homologs in MSR2 and or MSR3 Figure 2 The order of the microsyntenic genes was highly conserved in the three regions with the colinear pattern of three genes phospholipase like protein pEARLI 4 cyclophilin type peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerase PPI and a cluster of SAUR and auxin induced proteins COSAP serving as a common footprint for these MSRs At the same time variation in syntenic genes by gene duplication and or translocation was also evident in all three MSRs For example the sequences of PPI AT4g38740 phosphatidylinositol specific phospholipase C precursor PPLC AT4g38690 and disease resistance response protein DRRP AT4g38700 of MSR1 are duplicated only in either MSR2 or MSR3 PPLCs AT4g34920 AT4g34930 and DRRPs AT2g21110 AT2g21120 remain tandemly duplicated in MSR2 and MSR3 respectively whereas PPI AT4g34960 appears to have been translocated after gene duplication in MSR2 High resolution mapping of the dgtlocus by MEST markers Because Arabidopsis MSR1 contained homeologs in common with three RFLP markers in the dgt region of tomato we used it as our main target region to search for corresponding tomato homeologs MSR1 contained 25 intervening genes between the homeologs of TG269 and CT190 TBLASTN analysis of each intervening Arabidopsis gene against the Tomato Gene Index 20 generated 260 TBLASTN hits that were chosen for further investigation on the basis of the original annotation of the Arabidopsis gene and a low expect value e 20 From those 40 robust PCR products were obtained and selected for development into new CAPS markers The original 40 products provided 30 new CAPS markers Table 1 that were used for PCR based genotyping against the informative mapping population Figure 3 The 10 previously identified informative recombinant plants as well as an equal number of non informative plants were used to analyze the new microsyntenic EST MEST markers Of the 30 CAPS markers tested six MEST markers mapped in the dgt region Two MESTs BG643476 putative protein PP and TC85079 EF hand containing protein like protein EFP identified a crossover between TG269 and TG389 dgt and one MEST TC98260 glycine rich protein GRP revealed a crossover between TG389 dgt and CT190 These three new markers which flank dgt narrowed the target region from 0 8 cM to 0 15 cM in our small mapping population Three MEST markers TC89380 PPI TC92082 PPLC and AW624844 DRRP co segregated with TG389 and dgt Most of the MEST markers derived from MSR1 have paralogs in other MSRs but BG643476 PP AT4g34830 and TC85079 EFP AT4g38810 are unique to MSR1 and MSR2 respectively Figure 2 We screened a BAC library with TG389 and obtained two BAC clones 52M1 and 9302 Each tomato BAC clone was estimated to be approximately 120 kb in length by pulsed field gel electrophoresis data not shown but neither contained marker TG269 or CT190 sequences data not shown to allow confirmation that the dgt locus was located on either BAC clone When both BAC clones were probed with the newly identified MEST molecular markers TC98260 the intervening marker between TG389 and CT190 was detected only on BAC 52M1 whereas BG643476 and TC85079 the intervening markers between TG269 and TG389 were present only on BAC 93O2 Figure 4 The three MEST markers that co segregated with TG389 were detected on both BAC clones These results permitted partial ordering of the newly identified MEST markers and demonstrated that the dgt locus was present within the two BAC clones Subsequent BAC end sequencing and BLAST searches of the Tomato Gene Index identified BAC 9302 and 52M1 insert DNA ends nearest the telomere as containing genomic nucleotide sequence for two previously identified MESTs TC92082 and TC98260 respectively This information placed TC92082 between TC98260 and the MEST markers that co segregated with TG389 Figures 3 5 The BAC end sequences nearest to the centromere for BACs 9302 and 52M1 were identified as BG643476 PP and TC87127 chalcone synthase like protein CHSP respectively BG643476 was confirmed as a MEST when the sequence was later posted to the tomato EST database The BAC end location placed BG643476 between markers TG269 and TC85079 Taken together these results strongly suggest that TC85079 and TC98260 are the closest flanking molecular markers to dgt present in the two overlapping BAC clones containing TG389 BLAST searches of the BAC end sequences against the Arabidopsis Information Resource TAIR database further confirmed microsynteny between the dgt region of tomato chromosome 1 and the three MSRs in Arabidopsis Figure 5 As would be expected if microsynteny were maintained two additional markers TC87150 amidophosphoribosyi transferase APRT and TC47447 basic leucine zipper transcription factor bZIP were determined to be non informative MEST markers with respect to our positional cloning strategy because they fell outside TG269 However their sequences maintained microsyntenic alignment and co segregated with tomato RFLP marker TG258 data not shown which is proximal to TG269 on chromosome 1 see Figure 1 Given no rearrangement of tomato chromosome 1 and that microsynteny between tomato and Arabidopsis genomes remains firm the predicted order of the new MEST and BAC end generated markers in tomato would be as follows TC47447 TC87150 TG269 BG643476 TC85079 TC87127 TC89380 TG389 AW624844 TC92082 TC98260 CT190 centromere to telomere Figure 5 The exact order of these markers and the position of dgt will be determined by complete sequencing of tomato BACs 93O2 and 52M1 Discussion With the sequencing of the entire Arabidopsis genome comparative mapping and homeology based gene cloning is now available in other species via microsyntenic alignment of molecular markers and genes against the sequenced reference genome 21 Although exceptions to the blanket application of this approach have been noted 22 our study successfully applied microsynteny analysis between the tomato and Arabidopsis genomes to facilitate positional cloning of the Dgt gene in tomato Using three sequential tomato RFLP markers from our target region we searched the Arabidopsis genome database and found three MSRs in the Arabidopsis genome that enabled us to construct a detailed molecular map of the target area Comparison of the three MSRs from the Arabidopsis genome shows that the content and order of the genes are well conserved within these regions MSR1 and MSR3 exhibit reverse polarity compared to orientation of tomato RFLP markers whereas the chromosomal segment MSR2 has the same polarity as tomato Using information from the three Arabidopsis MSRs we identified eight new molecular markers on tomato chromosome 1 two of which narrowed the genetic distance to the dgt locus from 0 8 cM to less than 0 2 cM and provided the necessary data to confirm the location of the dgt locus on two overlapping BAC clones thus avoiding the need for a chromosomal walk Our strategy for microsynteny based comparative mapping was straightforward and simple First the BLASTN program at TAIR was used to identify microsyntenic regions in Arabidopsis containing homeologs of tester markers tomato RFLPs in similar order within a relatively small physical interval 1 2 cM Several published reports supported our strategy of using simple computer based comparisons between tester and reference nucleotide sequences Two recent comparative sequence analyses clearly presented microsynteny of a 105 kb BAC DNA insert 10 and a 57 kb cosmid DNA insert 11 from tomato chromosomes 2 and 7 respectively to their homeologous counterparts in the Arabidopsis genome Paterson et al 23 suggested that 43 to 58 of chromosomal segments of less than 3 cM remain colinear in distantly related species Direct nucleotide sequence comparisons BLASTN were used for each search as this provides a more stringent test of homology between tomato and Arabidopsis sequences than do the conceptual translations of DNA sequences TBLASTX that can be used for less stringent comparisons between evolutionarily divergent species 12 In our study BLASTN searches using default parameters enabled us to find a high level of microsynteny without encountering any major differences between the highest scoring matches in either TBLASTX or BLASTN searches data not shown However the E value for each BLAST hit was quite different between TBLASTX and BLASTN suggesting that an arbitrary threshold E value is critical to determine acceptance of BLAST matches between evolutionarily distant nucleotide sequences and to place the homeologs on Arabidopsis chromosomes The occurrence of multiple MSRs as a result of segmental duplications on the Arabidopsis genome has been demonstrated by other comparative sequence analyses 10 12 Most MEST markers identified in this study were conserved in at least two MSRs suggesting that the use of genes conserved in multiple MSRs increases the probability of obtaining microsyntenic markers that are conserved between two species Using gene annotations in the Arabidopsis genome database this simple computer based analysis not only avoided the time and cost required for hybridization based experimental methods 24 25 26 but also allowed us to make informed decisions as to the location of unidentified genes of interest as well as intervening genes between test markers in the target area The second aspect of the comparative microsynteny approach was identification of tomato ESTs homeologous for the coding sequence of each Arabidopsis gene in the most closely related MSR PCR primer sets were designed from sequences of high scoring ESTs and robust PCR products were obtained from 15 of the ESTs Thirty of the PCR products were then converted to co dominant CAPS markers and used to genotype a small number of informative recombinant plants The use of ESTs in comparative mapping has been successfully applied to Brassica species 24 25 and maize 27 However the success of EST derived CAPS markers depends on a well established EST database The Tomato Gene Index of The Institute for Genomic Research TIGR is the third largest sequence database for plants and provided 131 988 EST sequences at the time of this study 20 28 The tentative consensus TC sequences of assembled ESTs can be used for integration of complex mapping data and identification of orthologous genes between divergent species 28 Expressed gene sequences were used in this study as they can be converted to molecular markers more consistently than non coding regions when comparing distantly related species 12 Moreover two recent comparative sequence analyses using monocots versus Arabidopsis 29 and dicots versus Arabidopsis 11 clearly showed that exon sizes are well conserved in homeologs even between monocots and dicots whereas intron length varied in rice versus barley and tomato versus Arabidopsis In BLAST searches using either the processed nucleotide sequence or the predicted protein sequence of an Arabidopsis gene the score of each BLAST match was clearly higher and the E value was significantly lower when compared to the use of either non processed nucleotide sequence or intergenic nucleotide sequence Presumably use of the predicted protein sequence of an Arabidopsis gene increases the probability of identifying the microsyntenic EST in comparative mapping of distantly related species considering the average substitution rate 6 10 9 nucleotide site year of nucleotides in plants 30 and the separation 112 million years ago of tomato and Arabidopsis 10 The MEST derived comparative map indicating that three regions of the Arabidopsis genome are related to each other Figures 2 5 supports the hypothesis that at least two rounds of duplication occurred in the Arabidopsis genome followed by selective deletion of genes and or minor rearrangements 10 Minor rearrangements of microsyntenic genes could potentially impede high resolution mapping if placement of the syntenic markers within a relatively large segment indicated a missing sequence fragment as reported for the comparative mapping of maize and sorghum 31 Given that several genes exist between the homeologs of the two closest flanking MESTs TC85079 EFP and TC98260 GRP and neither a deletion nor local rearrangement of the Dgt counterpart has occurred in the MSRs the Dgt counterpart could be one of the annotated genes between the homeologs of the two closest flanking MESTs It remains to be seen however whether additional tomato genes are present in the region Our results indicate that comparative microsynteny based mapping can facilitate positional cloning of a target gene when information on genomic location is limited Ku et al 32 recently utilized microsynteny based comparative mapping to add new molecular markers in a 0 067 cM region defined by a previously determined 100 kb BAC clone containing the ovate locus in tomato Here microsynteny based comparative mapping was used to define the position of the Dgt gene within a much larger region 0 8 cM of the tomato genome by contributing six intervening MEST markers initially derived from Arabidopsis gene sequences between TG269 and CT190 The approach proved to be less technically complicated than other fingerprinting methods and points to several co segregating genes for further investigation as potential Dgt candidates We anticipate that this general approach will contribute significantly to the development of dense molecular marker maps for a variety of higher plant species to expedite map based cloning Materials and methods Mapping population A mapping population consisting of 1 308 backcross BC 1 plants derived from a backcross between L esculentum cv Ailsa Craig dgt dgt F 1 L esculentum cv Ailsa Craig dgt dgt L pennellii Dgt Dgt were initially screened with RFLP markers localized to the distal end of chromosome 1 8 RFLP analyses were performed to identify markers closely linked to the Dgt gene Figure 1 Two RFLP markers TG269 and CT190 were converted to CAPS markers 33 and established as flanking markers to Dgt approximately 0 8 cM apart Ten plants were identified as recombinant within this interval and were designated as the informative recombinant population in this study Ten non recombinant plants were randomly selected for use as the non informative population Comparative sequence analysis Arabidopsis genome database searches were performed with BLASTN software in TAIR 18 Tomato EST database searches were performed with TBLASTN software in the Tomato Gene Index at TIGR 27 The resulting tentative consensus TC sequences or high scoring singleton EST sequences were analyzed and used to design PCR primers Further sequence analysis was carried out with the Genetics Computer Group 10 GCG Madison WI program Alignments of conserved regions within a multigene family
