 They Got Game Prudie I m beginning to think that it s my role in life to cheer you up Because I m stuck covering these guys for the next year I have to take a much rosier view Otherwise I d be a miserable kvetch And I genuinely think that each of the top four presidential contenders Bradley McCain Bush Gore possesses interesting attributes Neither Gore nor Bradley may be dynamic campaigners but they re solid serious wonks They have a history of putting important issues on the map Bradley took on tax reform and the Soviet Union Gore has the environment technology etc Both have bucked the party line on big issues Meanwhile Bush and McCain are tinkering with conservatism in an interesting fashion They have little patience for libertarians and they have a relatively expansive role for the federal government in their policies To listen to Bush talk about compassionate conservatism is to realize that Republicans may have learned something from Newt Gingrich s disastrous reign as party leader Look at the way that Republicans are talking about education this year During the Newt era Republicans objected to all forms of national education testing and standards They would spout ridiculous hyperbole about the educrats Anything the Department of Education touches they would scream will turn to liberal shit It hurt your ears to hear their screeds Now Bush has a plan that includes national standards and tests You can dispute his plan on the merits but it s innovative There s a front pager in the Washington Post on the eye chip a nifty little innovation that could cure blindness Somehow it involves a camera mounted on a pair of glasses that transmits signals to the brain Pretty damn cool That means it s not a far stretch to imagine that someday soon sports junkies will be able to have ESPN transmitted straight to their brains Speaking of vision I am giving some thought to laser eye surgery The question has provoked quite an identity crisis My specs have defined me since age 6 I am Frankie Coke Bottle Lens Foer I would appreciate a little Prudie input into my decision Finally I d like to get mushy and pay homage to a childhood hero Charles Barkley the great power forward who retired from basketball last night The Round Mound of Rebound used to obnoxiously proclaim I am not a role model But he was All of us short cagers with potbellies placed him on a pedestal Though a mere six feet five Barkley would routinely battle men five inches taller and win He would win based on intellect an acute understanding of the physics of the game and hustle Many people despised Barkely for his big mouth and poor manners He would routinely flick the bird to fans and brawl Just last month he tried to land a punch on Shaq s head But he charmingly admitted to being a jerk And he could be as sentimental and schmaltzy as a Neil Simon play In other words he was a jerk with a big heart and an awesome game Massa Who s Your Massa Honey
