 The Four Lilliputians Received last night Listen anything out of Perot s mouth would sound like pearls of wisdom after Alan Keyes attack on John McCain this afternoon for being soft on Nine Inch Nails Keyes is getting a major free ride for his bizarreness because of his alacrity in accusing anyone who doesn t go soft on him of racism Republicans who denounce similar tactics by Jesse Jackson might want to be heard from at some point And while we re at it Trump has got to be thinking to himself Perot and Forbes both borderline rich wackos get taken seriously purely by their persistence Why not me Aside from the fact that Perot doesn t have funny hair and Forbes got rid of his it s a good question Hatch gets treated like a joke by the analysts for his quixotic bid yet Forbes is regarded as a believable candidate If as I recall the candidates running in the Democratic primary in 92 were known as the seven dwarves what index of Lilliputianism is appropriate for Keyes Bauer Forbes and Hatch Before I go back to bed and try to shake this damn flu one more thing the lovely piece in today s New York Times advertising column about the Cash machine which digitally compresses the pauses and long syllables out of talk shows so that local stations can sell more commercial time A long time ago when I was doing a satirical news show at a rock station in Los Angeles they bought an analog tape machine with a rotating head the premise being that it wouldn t change the pitch of records but would slyly speed them up to make room for more commercials Dubbed the Q bomb the machine gathered dust in the back room when management found that it made every record run through it sound like it was being played underwater La plus a change Be well Harry
