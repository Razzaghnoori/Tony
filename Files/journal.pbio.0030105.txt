                            The Fourth International Conference on Neuroesthetics was not a large event but it was        an unusual one Held on a single day in the basement auditorium of the Berkeley Art Museum        at the University of California at Berkeley it brought together a typically motley        collection of intellectuals who would willingly give over a sunny Saturday to an        opportunity to learn from a panel of distinguished speakers This was not the unusual part        Nor was it unusual that the meeting was touted as an interdisciplinary event bringing        together the best and brightest of different fields These days and perhaps it has always        been the case interdisciplinarity is the rule rather than the exception of innovative        science        What set this meeting apart was the fluid progression from art to science in content as        well as in style The artists were more or less scientific the scientists more or less        artistic The topic was empathy Empathy in the Brain and in Artmore particularly        mans and not just mans ability to recognize and respond to the expressions of others        What do we respond to in an expression and what are the mechanisms in the brain that        underlie these responses And as the primatologist Frans de Waal Emory University        highlighted how much of our empathic natures do we share with our ape cousins        In a slide presentation of her work and sources of inspiration portrait photographer        Judy Dater clearly captured with great sensitivity an infinite variety of poignant        expressions However when asked she could not clearly articulate the choices she had made        in posing and photographing her subjects could not give dimensions to the criteria she was        using In contrast the performance artist Leonard Pitt had clearly made a science out of        expression His physical demonstrations with Balinese masks carved into iconic images of        happiness sadness or anger gave the audience insight into the variety of subtle        expression that could be attributed to the mask with simple postural adjustments Happiness        melted into melancholy sadness into ennui Its not about moving he observed its        about not moving        The psychologist Paul Ekman University of California at San Francisco brought the        official stamp of academia to his science of expression documenting in the language of        trainingdependent effects on recognition the subtle range of expressions and        microexpressions we can identify For a practical example he showed a clip from testimony        in the O J Simpson trial of a moment in which the infamous houseguest Kato Kaelin was        caught out in a lie A fleeting hostile look crossed his otherwise carefully schooled        features invisible until pointed out unmistakable after        Where the artist and psychologist show us the richness of the human behavioral        repertoire the neuroscientist tries to break behaviors down into manageable testable        predictions of the associated brain activity In contrast to the feasts of expression        presented by other speakers the faces representative of basic emotions used by the        cognitive neuroscientist Ray Dolan University College London to study the neural activity        engendered by expressions seemed almost too caricatured to be meaningful But Dolan        introducing his subject through the portraiture of American colonial artist Gilbert        Stewart deconstructed the information we derive from the expressions of others into five        categoriesfamiliarity identity emotion intentionality and characterand was able to        describe neural activity associated with carefully constructed experiments to probe each of        these facets        Physiologist Vittorio Gallese University of Parma prompted many nods of satisfaction        from the audience with his findings of activity in areas of the brain controlling movement        when people simply watched the actions of others see also the Research Article by Iacoboni        et al in this issue of         PLoS Biology DOI journal pbio  Susan Langer in her        book         Mind An Essay on Human Feeling  has defined empathy as the direct        physical reaction inherent in the perception of others an         involuntary breach of individual separateness and to see the neural        resonance to see that the same activity patterns were being recreated in actor and        observer was to give substance to the intuition of empathy        Themed meetings particularly when the theme does not conform to one discipline are        hard to pull off It can be nearly impossible to convince successful professionals on the        lecture circuit to modify the presentation of their own work to support such a theme In        that respect this meeting was no different from manysome speakers were hardpressed to        conform to the theme and it is not clear that many attendees learned information of        practical value to their work from speakers across disciplines        However it is not often that scientists have the luxury of stepping back and        appreciating the context of their work in quite this way It is not for instance usually        appropriate to begin a paper on an apoptotic signaling pathway with a philosophical        digression into the nature of Death The abstract dimensions that the visual neuroscientist        Alice OToole University of Texas at Dallas gave to facial characteristics are supposed        to shed light on how we instantaneously recognize the friend we have not seen in  years        The electrophysiological signals in the brain that neurophysiologist Aina Puce West        Virginia University described when we view simple movements is ultimately meant to explain        how we identify with the subtle shrugging of shoulders that can transmute insouciance into        insecurity        By reducing the problem to its simplest most controlled form scientists hope to shed        light on the complexities of life Auditory physiologists are supposed to tell us how we        hear And yet it will be a long time before they can explain music heard so deeply that it        is not heard at all but you are the music while the music lasts T S Eliot as quoted        by the conference organizer Semir Zeki University College London But the richness of        the goal makes the journey all the more rewarding
