 Background Organisms must be able to respond to their environment to survive In plants mechanisms have evolved for sensing and responding to hormonal and environmental signals both biotic for example pathogens and abiotic for example heat cold light and salt drought stresses To elicit a response the perceived signal must be conveyed to the cellular machinery Messengers such as Ca 2 cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP hydrogen peroxide H 2 O 2 and nitric oxide transduce the perceived stimulus to proteins that initiate a response Ca 2 is one of the important messengers that mediate plant responses to hormones developmental cues and external stimuli 1 2 3 It is implicated in regulating such diverse and fundamental cellular process as cytoplasmic streaming thigmotropism gravitropism cell division cell elongation cell differentiation cell polarity photomorphogenesis and plant defense and stress responses 1 3 4 The Ca 2 concentration in the cytoplasm Ca 2 cyt is maintained in the nanomolar range approximately 100 200 nM whereas the concentration in organelles and cell wall is in the millimolar range 1 3 5 6 Several signals hormonal abiotic and biotic have been shown to cause transient elevation of Ca 2 cyt 1 2 5 6 7 This transient increase in Ca 2 cyt is sensed by Ca 2 binding proteins 4 8 9 The conformation of the Ca 2 binding protein changes on binding Ca 2 resulting in modulation of its activity or its ability to interact with other proteins or nucleic acids and modulate their function or activity The Ca 2 sensors in plants can be broadly divided into four major classes 2 9 calmodulin CAM class A CAM like and other EF hand containing Ca 2 binding proteins class B Ca 2 regulated protein kinases class C and Ca 2 binding proteins without EF hand motifs class D Three classes A B and C contain proteins with EF hand motifs This motif is a helix loop helix structure that binds a single Ca 2 ion 10 The loop consists of 12 residues with the pattern X Y Z Y X Z The residues X Y Z Y X Z participate in binding Ca 2 and the intervening residues are represented by asterisks Asp or Asn is usually found at X and Y Asp Asn or Ser at Z a variety of residues at Y usually Asp Asn or Ser at X but this position is more variable and usually Glu at Z 11 The helix loop helix is only 29 residues long the E helix being residues 1 10 the loop 10 21 and the F helix 19 29 11 Residue 1 is often Glu E and a Gly at residue 15 is highly conserved as is Ile at residue 17 It has been reported that some of the EF hand domains do not bind Ca 2 11 In quiescent cells proteins with EF hands are in an apoprotein form when Ca 2 cyt increases they bind Ca 2 and change their conformation Some EF hands can also bind Mg 2 for example the third and fourth EF hands of troponin C bind Ca 2 Mg 2 whereas the first and second EF hands are Ca 2 specific 12 Ca 2 Mg 2 discrimination relies on the affinities of the EF hands for these cations which is dependent on the types of amino acid residues in the binding loop 11 13 EF hands can be present in proteins with no other known domains as is the case for CAM or in proteins with other domains such as a protein kinase In most cases EF hand motifs are found in pairs and proteins with four EF hands usually have two domains with a pair of EF hands in each Calpain is an exception to the pairing rule It comprises a large subunit with five EF hands at the carboxyl terminus and a small subunit that also has five EF hands The two unpaired hands in these subunits pair to form a heterodimer 14 The large superfamily of EF hand proteins has been divided into 66 subfamilies on the basis of differences in number and organization of EF hand pairs amino acid sequences within or outside the motifs affinity for Ca 2 and or selectivity and affinity for target proteins 11 Of the subfamilies 28 consist of a unique single member The EF hand proteins used in the classification by Nakayama et al 11 include proteins from animals plants fungi and protists with plants represented in only nine of the 66 subfamilies Several EF hand proteins have been identified in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana including several CAMs 15 16 17 18 a Ca 2 binding protein CaBP 22 19 touch induced proteins TCH2 and TCH3 20 centrin 21 Ca 2 dependent protein kinases CPKs 22 calcineurin B like proteins salt overly sensitive3 family CBLs SOS3 23 24 fimbrins 25 respiratory burst oxidase homologs Rbohs 26 27 a phospholipase 28 29 channel proteins 30 31 a NAD H dependent glutamate dehydrogenase 32 a protein phosphatase 33 34 a NaCl inducible protein 35 and a Ca 2 binding protein in pollen 36 Some have been identified by screening with animal homologs whereas others have been identified by sequencing the genes induced in response to biotic and abiotic signals The first method would miss plant specific EF hand proteins and the second method relies on comprehensive analysis of all genes that might be induced or activated by various signals With the recent completion of the sequencing of the A thaliana genome the first plant genome to be sequenced new methods of identifying genes encoding proteins with specific domains have become possible 37 Insight into the function of the proteins can be gained by identifying and characterizing EF hand proteins encoded in the Arabidopsis genome Classification of the EF hand containing proteins can be a starting point in identification of Ca 2 binding proteins that might be involved in a particular cell process With this in mind we searched the Arabidopsis genome for genes encoding proteins with EF hand motifs We used three approaches to identify EF hand containing proteins in Arabidopsis First we analyzed data from the Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences MIPS A thaliana database MAtDB 38 39 second we carried out BLAST searches using different known EF hand sequences nucleotide and amino acid against the Arabidopsis genome database and third we searched the literature We identified 250 EF hand or putative EF hand proteins This estimate represents a maximum number of possible EF hand containing proteins in the Arabidopsis genome as our analysis was very inclusive Of these 250 proteins only 47 have been reported in the literature Of the 250 73 were identified by only one prediction program as having an EF hand and the rest were identified by two or more programs Further study is needed to verify Ca 2 binding activity of many of these proteins Each protein sequence was analyzed for domains other than EF hands Several have a variety of domains which may be useful in determining protein function Results and discussion Identification of EF hand containing proteins To identify EF hand containing proteins in Arabidopsis the protein sequences listed as having EF hands in the InterPro Domain Table at MAtDB 39 were retrieved Each protein sequence was then analyzed for the presence of an EF hand motif and other domain s using InterProScan 40 There are many databases for analyzing proteins using different approaches to search for patterns profiles and hidden Markov models 41 InterProScan was chosen because it integrates SWISS PROT PROSITE PRINTS Pfam ProDom SMART and TIGRFAMs programs into a single comprehensive format Therefore scanning one site is the equivalent of scanning seven databases that use different approaches 40 The Inter Pro Domain Table at MAtDB listed 219 proteins as having EF hands Eighteen sequences did not have EF hands identifiable by InterProScan and so were eliminated from our analysis We also did sequence similarity searches using three different EF hand proteins that have been characterized in Arabidopsis The nucleotide and protein sequences of Arabidopsis CAM4 a protein containing four EF hands were used to do BLAST searches TbIastN BlastP against the Arabidopsis genome at MAtDB 39 We also used the protein sequences of a Ca 2 dependent protein kinase CPK1 and a small protein with one EF hand domain At2g46600 Proteins showing similarity to these proteins were checked for the presence of EF hands using InterProScan as above Additional EF hand proteins were found that had not been included in the MAtDB Inter Pro domain table We also searched the literature for reports of EF hand containing proteins in Arabidopsis that had been identified by various experimental approaches Additional EF hand proteins were identified from this search Together these searches resulted in identification of a possible total of 250 EF hand containing proteins Tables 1 2 3 Seventy three of the EF hands were identified by only one of the seven prediction programs included in InterProScan These proteins which are indicated in bold in Table 1 could be false positives Further studies are needed to verify the Ca 2 binding ability of these putative EF hands It is however worth noting that the activity of two of the proteins in this category AtPLC1 and KCO1 has been shown to be dependent on Ca 2 31 42 All proteins are listed by their protein ID number except CAM6 which has not been assigned an ID number CPKs and closely related CRKs CPK related protein kinases are listed in Table 2 as this is a large family of proteins that has been relatively well studied in Arabidopsis The InterPro domain table also lists the EF hand containing proteins for Saccharomyces cerevisiae 29 Caenorhabditis elegans 139 and Drosophila melanogaster 132 The number of EF hand proteins in the human genome was given as 83 with a note that the number may be an underestimate as a result of the stringent E value cutoff used for the analysis 43 Figure 1ashows a comparison of the number of EF hand containing proteins in sequenced eukaryotic organisms and the percentage of the total number of genes represented by genes encoding EF hand proteins Our analysis revealed that there is possibly a very large number of EF hand proteins in Arabidopsis We used TargetP 44 to identify cellular targeting signals in all the EF hand proteins The results from this analysis show that EF hand proteins are present in all major subcellular compartments Tables 1 2 3 Ca 2 binding proteins with no recognized EF hand Table 3lists proteins that were reported in the literature as proteins containing EF hand like domains but where the InterProScan of these proteins did not identify any However the proteins were shown to bind Ca We included proteins with sequence similarity to these proteins in Table 3 We did not include these proteins in the total number of EF hand proteins nor in the phylogenetic analysis Caleosins are proteins with similarity to a rice protein that was shown to bind Ca 2 45 A localization study in rapeseed using an antibody to AtClo1 showed the presence of this protein in the ER and lipid bodies 46 Clo3 was shown to be induced by abscisic acid and to bind Ca 2 47 The InterPro documentation IPR000308 for 14 3 3 proteins describes them as a large family of proteins that are primarily homo or heterodimeric within all eukaryotic cells They appear to effect intracellular signaling by regulating the catalytic activity of the bound protein by regulating interactions between the bound protein and other proteins or by controlling the localization of the bound protein The 14 3 3 protein GF14 was shown to bind Ca 2 and the binding was localized to loop 8 of GF14 48 49 Seven other proteins showing strong similarity to GF14 have the exact sequence in the loop considered to be the EF hand and so were included in Table 3 Several other proteins showing similarity were divergent in this loop and so were not included SUB1 was identified as a protein involved in the cryptochrome and phytochrome signaling pathways 50 Guo et al 50 identified two EF hand like domains and demonstrated binding of Ca 2 by SUB1 SUL1 and 2 are proteins showing similarity to SUB1 but their sequences diverge somewhat in the EF hand domains Number of EF hands The number of EF hands in each protein varied from one to six Figure 1bshows the number and percentage of proteins having a specific number of EF hands As stated above most EF hand proteins have pairs of EF hands which facilitate binding of Ca 2 11 There are a large number of proteins with an odd number of EF hand motifs 1 3 or 5 Several possibilities are suggested by this observation The proteins with an odd number of EF hand domains may function as homo or heterodimers they may bind Ca 2 in a weaker manner there may be another cryptic Ca 2 binding motif that is not identifiable but is functional or they may not bind Ca 2 at all Many of the proteins containing a single EF hand motif were identified by only one prediction program and could be false positives Examples of these possibilities can be seen in EF hand proteins that have been isolated and characterized previously The K channel protein KCO1 has one identifiable EF hand but another region within the protein also shows similarity to an EF hand Although Ca 2 binding of KCO1 was not tested the activity of the channel was shown to be Ca 2 dependent 31 AtPLC1 one of a small family of phosphatidylinositol specific phospholipase Cs PLCs has a putative EF hand but Ca 2 binding was not evaluated 42 No other AtPLC has an EF hand domain but the amino terminal sequences of several other family members have two sets of a helices that may correspond to EF hand domains 29 The putative EF hand loop of AtPLC1 lies between two of the a helices The actin binding activity of most fimbrins is inhibited by Ca 2 51 AtFIM2 was shown to be Ca 2 independent suggesting this single EF hand protein does not bind Ca 2 25 51 The respiratory burst oxidase family see Table 1 has nine members in Arabidopsis that have either one or two EF hands 26 27 An alignment data not shown of these proteins however shows the presence of EF hand like sequences for the missing EF hand domain in the one EF hand proteins Keller et al 27 identified two EF hand domains in RbohA which both bind Ca 2 in vitro RbohF in this report and Torres et al 26 although only one is recognized by InterProScan The ability to bind Ca 2 was not addressed for single EF hand proteins ABI1 or GDH2 32 33 The CBL SOS3 family of proteins see Table 1 shows the presence of three EF hand domains 23 52 Kudla et al 23 however identified a sequence that represents a variation of the EF hand domain that may be a fourth EF hand AtCP1 a protein with three EF hand domains also has a fourth EF hand like sequence at the end of the protein but it is truncated and may not be functional 35 The reported proteins with two EF hand domains include two pollen associated proteins and the Rboh proteins see Table 1 Three of the proteins with two possible EF hands were identified by only one prediction program The CAM family and proteins closely related to CAM CaBP 22 PM129 TCH2 and centrin Table 1 and most of the CPKs Table 2 have four EF hand domains The two proteins with six EF hands are TCH3 and an unknown protein At4g27790 which are only 13 similar and thus are not likely to represent duplicate genes Although the significance of the number of EF hand domains in various proteins is not known they may differ in their affinity for Ca 2 and thereby function to fine tune Ca 2 mediated cellular activities Identification of other domains in EF hand containing proteins Table 4lists the other domains found in the EF hand containing proteins their InterProScan accession numbers and general type of protein or domain As shown in Table 1 some of the proteins predicted to have other domains have putative EF hand motifs identified by only one prediction program shown in bold in Table 1 Schematic diagrams of representative EF hand proteins are shown in Figure 2 As can be seen the calmodulin like proteins have the EF hands distributed throughout the protein and no other domain is present Other proteins have the EF hands at one end or the other or in the middle of the protein with enzymatic or regulatory domains preceding or following the EF hands Some of the domains listed in Table 4either contain an EF hand within the domain or are a specific type of EF hand These include EPS15 repeats calflagin recoverin and S100 IcaBP EPS15 repeats are protein protein interaction modules of about 95 residues that were first identified in tyrosine kinase substrates EPS15 and 15R The first of three sub domains in EPS15 may include a Ca 2 binding domain of the EF hand type Calflagins are flagellar Ca 2 binding proteins found in Trypanosoma cruzi and T brucei that have motifs similar to EF hands Recoverin is a retinal Ca 2 binding protein that belongs in the EF hand family of proteins Some of the EF hand proteins contain an Arabidopsis retrotransposon ATHILA ORF 1 protein domain and one has an En Spm like transposon protein domain As shown in Table 4 domains found in various enzymes are present in many of the EF hand proteins Because of the presence of EF hand motifs in these proteins regulation of these putative enzymes is likely to be Ca 2 dependent The diversity of enzymes that contain EF hand s indicates that a wide range of cellular processes is likely to be regulated by Ca 2 It is also of interest that some proteins in a family have EF hands and others do not suggesting differential regulation of protein family members Several identified domains indicate that some EF hand proteins interact with other proteins or themselves or with nucleic acids Table 4lists domains that are involved in interaction with protein or DNA Cell processes that EF hand proteins may be involved in are suggested by domains found in transcription or translation proteins including elongation factors and the bHLH domain found in transcription factors Domains such as potassium channels pollen allergen Bra r II mitochondrial carrier proteins the cation Ca 2 and Na pore region and nucleoside transporters suggest possible functions One EF hand protein has a domain found in NPH3 protein a photoreceptor interacting protein that is essential for phototropism Another EF hand protein has a jacalin domain found in lectins These domains in EF hand proteins should help in evaluating the function of these proteins For instance the EF hand protein identified as having a pollen allergen Bra r II domain is similar to an EF hand protein from pollen APC1 isolated by Rozwadowski et al 36 They showed APC1 s affinity for Ca 2 and the potential for a Ca 2 dependent conformational change Motifs such as the ATP GTP binding region suggest that the proteins containing them interact with or bind to certain molecules PTM is the site for attachment of phosphopantetheine the prosthetic group of acyl carrier proteins in some multienzyme complexes PTS_HPR_SER is a serine phosphorylation site found in HPr a protein in the phosphoenolpyruvate dependent sugar phosphotransferase system in bacteria and UIM ubiquitin interaction motif is a receptor for polyubiquitination of polypeptide chains Phylogenetic analysis of EF hand containing proteins Group I proteins None of the proteins in group I Figure 4 has been reported in the literature Some of them contain domains that give clues to their function including elongation factors DNA protein or ATP GTP binding proteins and others Tables 1and 4 Group II proteins Group II includes KCO1 AtPLC1 and the two fimbrins Figure 5 that have been reported in the literature Table 1 Two other proteins show similarity to KCO1 and may also be Ca 2 regulated K channels A family of phosphatidylinositol specific phospholipase Cs have been isolated but only one of them AtPLC1 has an EF hand domain Figure 2 and see also 29 42 AtPLC1 a protein isolated as a dehydration and salt stress induced gene was able to hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol 4 5 bisphosphate and the activity was completely dependent on Ca 2 42 AtFIM1 was identified as an EF hand containing protein Figure 2 however Kovar et al 51 found that AtFIM1 was Ca 2 independent and so this may be a non functional EF hand as pointed out by McCurdy and Kim 25 Four other proteins in the MatDB are similar to AtFIM1 but only one has an EF hand motif Two small subgroups nucleoside transporters and mitochondrial carrier proteins also fell into group II Figures 2 5 As far as we know Ca 2 binding studies have not been done for these proteins Group III proteins CBL SOS3S fall into group III Figure 6 The first CBL SOS3 was isolated as a protein involved in salt stress SOS3 and as a calcineurin B like protein CBL1 23 24 Ten CBL SOS3S have been identified 13 Expression of CBL4 is induced by drought cold and wounding stress In animals calcineurin is a heterodimer composed of a regulatory B subunit and a protein phosphatase catalytic A subunit CBL SOS3S show similarity to the B subunit Figure 2 SOS3 was however shown to interact with a protein kinase 53 and a family of interacting protein kinases has been identified 54 55 56 Both Albrecht et al 55 and Kim et al 54 have identified the domain in the kinases required for the interactions of protein kinase with CBL SOS3 AtCP1 which contains three EF hands Figure 2 is another NaCl stress induced protein that has been shown to bind Ca 2 35 A bean homolog of AtCP1 has been shown to be associated with the hypersensitive response 57 A subgroup of proteins identified in this search show similarity to the protein phosphatase 2A regulatory B subunit One of these At5g44090 AF165429 was reported in the literature 58 They have one EF hand domain but contain no other identifiable domains Figure 2 One other protein of interest in this group KIC KCBP interacting CCD 1 like protein was identified as a protein that interacts with KCBP kinesin like calmodulin binding protein a protein known to interact with and be regulated by Ca 2 calmodulin 59 60 KIC has only one EF hand Figure 2 and is similar to a wheat Ca 2 binding protein CCD 1 61 Group IV proteins Group IV contains the calmodulins CAMs and closely related proteins such as CaBP 22 centrin and the TCH gene proteins Figures 7 CAMs are highly conserved small molecular weight acidic proteins of 148 amino acids listed as 149 the starting Met is cleaved following translation The four EF hands two pairs connected by a central helix bind four molecules of Ca 2 11 14 Binding of Ca 2 to CAM results in a conformational change which then allows CAM to interact with target proteins to modulate their activity or function 3 18 62 Nine Arabidopsis CAMs have been reported in the literature 15 16 17 18 20 Seven of these are highly conserved having 148 amino acids CAMs 1 7 with only 1 4 amino acid differences between them CAM6 has not been given a protein identification number BLAST searches with CAM6 pick CAM7 as the closest sequence However at the nucleotide level they are only 86 identical There are two ESTs that are 83 and 94 identical to CAM6 but only 72 and 86 identical respectively to CAM7 CAM8 and CAM9 are divergent CAMs They have 151 rather than 148 amino acids and vary considerably in the fourth EF hand domain Although they complemented a yeast calmodulin CMD1 mutant they did lot form a complex with a basic amphiphilic helical peptide in the presence of Ca 2 unlike conventional CAMs that do 18 As can be seen in Figure 7 they do not fall into the same group as the other CAMs with CAM9 being more divergent than CAM8 No other EF hand proteins have 149 amino acids although others do have a few more or less Table 1 Expression studies of the Arabidopsis CAM genes show that they are differentially expressed in different tissues and circumstances For CAM1 CAM2 and CAM3 CAM1 was the only one expressed in roots and CAM3 could not be detected in floral stocks CAM1 CAM2 and CAM3 are inducible by touch stimulation but at different levels and with different kinetics 15 CAM4 CAM5 and CAM6 were all expressed in leaves but only CAM4 and CAM5 were detected in siliques 17 Different Arabidopsis CAM isoforms also differ in their affinity for the same protein 60 63 Two proteins induced by touch rain wind wounding and darkness TCH2 and TCH3 are also in group IV and are related to the CAMs TCH2 has 161 amino acids with four EF hands and TCH3 has 324 amino acids with six EF hands Another CAM like protein CaBP 22 is closely related to the conventional CAMs Figure 7 It has 191 amino acids 66 ammo acid sequence identity with CAM 79 in the EF hand domains and has been shown to bind Ca 2 19 Centrins are a little more distantly related to CAMs Figure 7 An Arabidopsis centrin gene ap3 3a was isolated as a gene rapidly induced after pathogen inoculation 21 One other EF hand protein is 65 similar to centrin suggesting there are two centrin genes in Arabidopsis Two proteins reported in the literature fall into a subgroup of CAM like proteins A novel EF hand protein PM129 Figure 2 was isolated from a cDNA library that over represents plasma membrane associated proteins 64 The other protein APC1 is a pollen Ca 2 binding protein that is a member of the pollen allergen family 36 Another protein At3g03430 is 89 similar to APC1 They are the smallest of the EF hand proteins having only 83 amino acids Figure 2 Group V proteins The 34 CPKs and three CPK related protein kinases CRKs make up almost all of group V Figure 8 The other three proteins in the group do not have any other identifiable domains CPKs are serine threonine protein kinases with a CAM like domain CLD usually containing four EF hands with two exceptions Table 2 Figure 2 These kinases have been called CDPKs however we use the most recent designation namely CPKs 22 65 66 Three of the eight CRKs in Arabidopsis have one EF hand domain However sequence alignment of the EF hand regions of CPKs and CRKs revealed that CRKs contain degenerate EF hand motifs Figure 2 CPKs are present only in plants and some protozoans The PlantsP database 65 reports that most of the CPKs and CRKs contain transmembrane and N myristoylation domains TargetP predicts that some CPKs and CRKs are targeted to the chloroplast or mitochondria 44 The cellular localization for most of these protein kinases needs to be confirmed experimentally CPKs range from 453 to 646 amino acids Table 2 with four distinct domains a variable region at the amino terminus approximately 22 184 amino acids a serine threonine protein kinase domain approximately 275 amino acids an autoinhibitory domain also called the junction region approximately 31 amino acids and the regulatory CLD approximately 165 amino acids Figure 2 The auto inhibitory domain is involved in inhibiting the enzyme activity in the absence of Ca 2 whereas the variable region at the amino terminus may account for their substrate specificity and or localization 22 CRKs have similar domain organization as compared to CPKs Figure 2 Most of the CPKs contain fatty acylation sites including those for myristoylation and palmitoylation which seem to be necessary for targeting to membranes and for protein protein interactions 67 The protein kinase domain in CRKs shows strong sequence similarity to the kinase domain in CPKs but the autoinhibitory and CLDs in CRKs show weak sequence similarity to the corresponding domains in CPKs CPKs have basal activities in the absence of Ca 2 as a result of the presence of the autoinhibitory region Ca 2 binds the EF hands of the CLD which results in intramolecular rearrangement and relief of autoinhibition 22 68 Eight CPK isoforms have been shown to be activated by Ca 2 66 69 70 71 The presence of multiple isoforms of CPKs in the Arabidopsis genome implies that they may be involved in specific Ca 2 signaling networks may respond differentially to changes in oscillation frequency magnitude and duration of Ca 2 signal or may have temporal and spatial patterns of expression and localization Little is known about the function and substrates for CPKs in Arabidopsis CPK1 is known to interact with 14 3 3 proteins 72 and is involved in the inactivation of a Ca 2 pump 73 Expression of CPK10 and 11 is inducible by cold and drought 70 74 75 An Arabidopsis CPK phosphorylates tonoplast intrinsic protein TIP a putative water channel protein 76 Substrates of CPKs in other plants have been identified and can be used to deduce the function of homologs in Arabidopsis The PlantsP website database 65 is a valuable source of information on CPKs Besides the inclusion of the full length sequences of CPKs and CRKs in the overall phylogenetic analysis a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the protein sequence of the CLD region of CPKs and CRKs Figure 10 Similar trees were obtained using either full length CPKs CRKs Figure 8 or the CLD region of the CPKS CRKs Figure 10 As shown in Figure 10 the CPKs form five distinct subgroups I V The CRKs are most closely related to subgroup IV The tree made using full length sequences Figure 8 has four subgroups members of subgroups III and V in Figure 10fall into one subgroup in Figure 8 Group VI Figure 9shows the remaining proteins that do not fall into one of the other five groups It includes the respiratory burst oxidase homology proteins Rbohs ABI1 GDH2 and TPC1 Plant defense responses include production of reactive oxygen species oxidative burst 77 Torres et al and Keller et al 26 27 isolated Arabidopsis homologs Rbohs to the gp91 phox subunit of the neutrophil NADPH oxidase which generates a similar oxidative burst in neutrophils Six Rbohs A F have been isolated experimentally and three others have been identified in the Arabidopsis genome Figures 2and 9 RbohF called RbohA in Keller et al 27 like animal Rboh enzymes is an intrinsic plasma membrane protein but unlike animal Rboh it has EF hands that were shown to bind Ca 2 27 Both Leung et al and Meyer et al isolated the ABI1 gene 33 34 ABI1 is similar to serine threonine phosphatase 2C which in animals is Mg 2 or Mn 2 but not Ca 2 dependent Figure 2 ABI1 is induced by abscisic acid and was shown to regulate stomatal aperture in leaves and mitotic activity in root meristems 33 34 A second ABI gene ABI2 was isolated using ABI1 as a probe 78 The protein encoded by the cDNA had an eight residue insertion in the EF hand domain that does not conform to the EF hand signature A similar situation holds for glutamate dehydrogenases Two genes were isolated one coded for a dehydrogenase with an EF hand GDH2 Figure 2 and the other one without GDH1 32 Studies by Furuichi et al 30 indicate that TPC1 is a two pore channel that mediates Ca 2 influx It has two EF hand like motifs located in a hydrophilic domain that connects the two transmembrane regions containing the pores 30 Ca 2 binding was not shown experimentally for ABI1 GDH2 or TPC1 Three proteins in this group have a domain present in a small GTPase protein Figure 2and Gtp in Figure 9 Another three member group Pyr in Figure 9 of proteins has a domain for FAD dependent pyridine nucleotide disulfide oxidoreductase FAD_pyr_redox Figures 2and 9 Conclusions A plant s adaptively variable behavior or plasticity during its lifetime has been described as plant intelligence 79 and Ca 2 and its sensors are key players in this adaptive behavior The large number of potential EF hand containing proteins indicates how Ca 2 cyt changes can profoundly affect a wide array of cellular processes Plants seem to have a large number of EF hand containing proteins some of which have homologs in non plant systems whereas others are unique to plants In addition plants also have unique sets of proteins that interact with Ca 2 sensors 80 Signals from stresses such as pathogens drought cold and salt are mediated by EF hand proteins 20 23 3 42 57 Hormones induce EF hand proteins 46 78 as do pathogen attacks 21 26 Some EF hand proteins such as small GTPases and potassium channels are involved in signaling 31 Others appear to be involved in developmental pathways For example the S 100 domain proteins are involved in cell growth and differentiation cell cycle regulation and metabolic control 40 The wide variety of domains in EF hand proteins also shows the diversity of the processes in which Ca 2 is involved However many of the EF hand proteins give little clue as to their function and may lead us in many other directions as their functions are elucidated The complexity of the Ca 2 messenger system is increased through the existence of families of proteins At the first level calmodulin adds complexity first in the number of isoforms present in Arabidopsis The regulation of expression and the kinetics of interaction of these isoforms with different proteins can lend complexity to cell signaling A second level of complexity is the number of proteins identified that interact with calmodulin At least 100 calmodulin binding proteins CBPs have been identified in Arabidopsis 80 Differential expression of these proteins in cell types developmental periods and in response to signals adds more complexity to the pathways that can be regulated by CAM The CPKs a very large family of protein kinases also add complexity to Ca 2 regulation Although the mechanism of regulation may be similar in each CPK Arabidopsis CPKs may differ in their affinity for Ca 2 in general and in the presence of their specific substrate in particular CPK s affinity for Ca 2 is many times higher in the presence of substrate than in its absence 22 The involvement of only specific CPKs in stress responses has already been shown 74 Identification of the substrates for each CPK and their temporal and spatial expression will be needed for elucidating the pathways of Ca 2 control in plants Other families such as the phosphatases Rbohs and CBL SOS3S also contribute to the complexity of Ca 2 involvement in the regulation of many processes Characterization of more Ca 2 binding proteins will lead to further understanding of the roles of Ca 2 and cross talk among various components of Ca 2 signaling and other messengers in plants Materials and methods Identification of EF hand containing proteins Proteins containing EF hands were first identified using the InterPro Domain Table at MIPS A thaliana database MAtDB 39 The protein sequences of the 219 proteins listed at MAtDB were obtained and analyzed for EF hands and other domains using InterProScan 40 Proteins not showing EF hand domains were eliminated from the list To identify proteins not listed in the InterPro Domain Table at MAtDB BLAST searches were done with three different EF hand containing proteins calmodulin KIC and a Ca 2 dependent protein kinase CPK1 BlastP searches were done for KIC and CDPK and BlastP and TbIastN for calmodulin 39 Sequences for proteins showing sequence similarity to these proteins were also checked by InterProScan and any protein containing an EF hand domain but not found on the InterPro Domain Table was added to the list A literature search for Arabidopsis proteins containing EF hands was also done using PubMed at NCBI National Center for Biotechnology Information 81 Identification of domains and organellar targeting signals Information about domains other than the EF hand domain was collected from the InterProScan searches done for each protein sequence Targeting information for each protein was obtained from the MAtDB general report that includes the results of TargetP 39 Phylogenetic analysis The full length sequences of all proteins identified by InterProScan as containing an EF hand including those that are identified by only one prediction program were aligned using MEGALIGN A heuristic method using PAUP 4 08a generated 100 trees A majority rules consensus tree was computed from the 100 trees For the CPKs and CRKs a second alignment was done using the CAM like domains A bootstrap method of PAUP 4 06a with 100 bootstraps was used to generate the tree
