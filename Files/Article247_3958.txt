 Shattering Glass Steagall Redux The Washington Post and USA Today lead with a joint anti urban poverty initiative between President Clinton and House Speaker Dennis Hastert R Ill to be announced today The plan will dovetail White House ideas such as tax credits for banks that lend to poor neighborhoods and House GOP ideas such as the elimination of capital gains taxes on property sales in these renewal communities The New York Times runs this story inside and says the plan is vague and will yield little until Clinton is out of office The Los Angeles Times leads with the life without parole sentence given to Aaron McKinney who on Wednesday was convicted of the second degree murder of Matthew Shepard in Wyoming The NYT reefers this story with an above the fold photograph the same used by the LAT of Shepard s mother who argued against the death penalty The NYT leads with congressional approval of a landmark bank overhaul by 362 57 in the House and 90 8 in the Senate President Clinton is expected to sign the financial services legislation which reverses the 1933 Glass Steagall Act by allowing commercial banks securities firms and insurance companies to expand into each other s territory creating one stop financial shopping for consumers See the Oct 23 TP Shattering Glass Steagall The Post s story focuses almost entirely on what it sees as the lenient consumer privacy provisions in the bill The Wall Street Journal notes that at the last minute a sentence was inserted in the legislation exempting the second biggest credit card issuer GE Capital from even these privacy provisions On the Post opinion page Ralph Nader predicts that the deregulation will cause another savings and loan type debacle The NYT off leads Pfizer s hostile takeover bid of 82 4 billion for Warner Lambert which had just announced a friendly 72 billion merger with American Home Products The Post s story run inside does the best job of contextualizing The pharmaceutical industry is fragmented with inefficiencies in research and few new products it also fears that that Medicare may start to cover prescription drugs which could lower prices The Journal s online edition reports that early this morning the board of Warner Lambert which already makes the anti cholesterol drug Lipton in partnership with Pfizer opposed the Pfizer bid The NYT seems to think that Warner Lambert will attempt to fend off Pfizer in the courts but the Journal notes that Warner Lambert s anti takeover defenses are weak Shareholders through a spontaneous mail in election can dismiss the entire board at any time The Journal waits until the 31st paragraph to mention that Pfizer s chairman sits on the board of the paper s parent company Dow Jones The Post fronts George W Bush s poor performance in a foreign policy pop quiz Asked by WHDH TV in Boston to name the leaders of Chechnya Pakistan India and Taiwan Bush could name only Taiwan s president Lee Teng hui On the LAT opinion page Selig Harrison a senior fellow at the Century Foundation argues that the U S should formally end the Korean War as part of a missile limitation treaty with the North The South signed an armistice in 1953 but pledged to reunite Korea in the future and so did not sign a peace treaty In 1998 Pyongyang offered to let the U S monitor its long range missiles as long as the U S takes a neutral role in the peninsula that is guarantees peace regardless of whether it is the South or the North that invades the other A report released by a House Republican advisory group Wednesday made no mention of North Korea s 1998 offer The Post reports that NYT columnist Abe Rosenthal a 50 year Times veteran got fired yesterday In his last column Rosenthal touches on his days as the Times strong fisted executive editor in the 70s and 80s When you finish a story I would say read it substitute your name for the subject s Rosenthal relates If you say Well it would make me miserable make my wife cry but it has no innuendo no unattributed pejorative remarks no slap in the face for joy of slapping it is news not gutter gossip and as a reporter I know the writer was fair then give it to the copy desk The Post notes that Rosenthal was the last of the old Times bulls who included Russell Baker and James Reston Naomi Wolf tells the NYT that the rumors circulating about her Gore advising are not true She never advised him about clothes she says and she mentioned alpha and beta only in passing in one memo As for her exorbitant fee she says I have written a whole book about how women should not have to apologize for making the same fees men make Also I m a reasonably successful writer and I had to close down my whole shop to write memos for Gore She concedes that it was Gore who wanted the payments concealed In the Post s Style section Ann Gerhart explores the Beltway s fascination with theWolf story Why Gerhart asks has no one risen to her defense Is it because she s radical Is it because she s ambitious Is it because she s not a card carrying member of the political consultancy consortium of America Because of the money Because she s a girl Because she s a girl who writes
