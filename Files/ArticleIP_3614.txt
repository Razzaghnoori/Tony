impressed So that was what it was all about Your writing has no bigger fan than EW but I must admit to finding some of the later novels a bit shall we say murky Large charming party at the Cineplex Odeon the young Waldorf Astors Mr Balfour Ld Lady Elcho Dcess of Manchester Lady Essex c c All seemed delighted but for poor Teddy who ran screaming from the theater during the first reel his nerves no doubt Miss Bonham Carter was splendid She ought to play Lily Barth if The House of Mirth ever makes it out of turnaround Is it true they re giving the Merchant Ivory treatment to your Golden Bowl Can t say I ever made it quite to the end of that one either Have you looked over the Modern Library list yet As Scribner authors neither of us is likely to find much favor in a list of books sold by Mr Cerf Still I fear that to the younger generation we must represent the literary equivalent of tufted furniture and gas chandeliers Ulysses alas is No 1 Have you driven into this fog It s a turgid welter of pornography the rudest schoolboy kind uninformed unimportant drivel The ingredients of soup do not make soup without the cook s intervention The same goes for Mr Kerouac Your Devoted Edith From henjam msn classic com To wharton mount com listserv deadauthorsguild org Cc Re 100 romans Dearest Edith The drab unblinking question that presents itself is that compilation to which you refer whose arrival though unwelcome is in no way resistible Of the part that is mine to pass over in silence is perhaps the course both of humility and of humilit That the number of my own works chosen should be trois is a matter for neither protestation nor ingratitude Yet that such an ordering hardly induces in the author of the aforementioned trois such satisfaction as might be hoped to accrue to one looking down with Olympian detachment from beyond the vale of longevity is a statement the validity of which cannot be called readily into question It is unlikely to fail to play upon the suspicions of such a one that the composition of his most highly esteemed should be that most lately converted into a wan cinematic confection of fretsome abbreviation Neither however could a figure such as he neglect the observation that the personage with whom the former is now abstractly in conversation was accorded the merit of only dues livres and that those due were accorded a position more terrestrial which is to say well below those of the former on the list Such a point once made could not resist the tendency to instill feelings of envy and ressentiment on the part of an author perhaps better compensated and perhaps more popular but in the view of the critical intelligence if any such fitful and discredited light may still be conceived as being within our sphere not really as good as mine Thus it is an expression of both discretion and a great humble reverence for the feelings of others to leave such a point unmade and unwinced at Though it may be additionally unpenworthy there is another point that heavily impels making It is that of all the volumes some eminent some too much esteemed in the trail of fashion there is one included that so transgresses the hesitational boundary of propriety as to induce a feeling of stammering dyspepsia Attention is called to the uncouth Mr Roth whose effluviations are so juvenalianly unspeakable that I cannot bear to utter their title This work it cannot be refrained from being pointed out has as its chief topic that exercise that in our own great palmy day was considered least worthy of writerly elucidation That this basely erotic occupation that was to our own contemporaries so unsupportable should form the core of the work in question might be thought to constitute a disqualification To such vulgarian depths does this fascination descend that there is in one place depicted an act of rank unsalubrious congress between him and a comestible whose ingestion by familial others is ineluctably and tenebrously foreordained I speak here of the liver scene For a work whose climax depends on feelings of the most passionate revulsion to be esteemed ahead of your own labors so far superior as to be undeserving of inclusion in the same tormented sentence is my dearest Edith an insult insufferable to all whose reverence for literature anglais is to be warranted To commiserate against so great and gaping an injustice presents itself as a course of action perhaps less unwise than others Yours faithfully fond Henri From gatsby prodigy net To wharton mount com Cc ernie erols com listserv

place down there in Key West It s a small place but a good place There are cats and a lot of rain and when it rains the cats all come inside the house The biggest cat is named Hem There are some smaller cats too with names like Scott and Sherwood and Dos The big cat is bigger than the others and also braver and probably a better writer But some people who don t know any better think the little cats are pretty cute One day I ll put them in a bag and drown them in the river for their own good In Florida the cats drink milk but we humans all drink rum It s not very good rum but in Florida rum is the drink to drink so we drink it Sometimes we mix the rum with Coke and sometimes we don t mix it with anything depending on how thirsty we are Rum and Coke is a good drink but not if you re thirsty If you re thirsty you want water but never Rum and Coke Here s 400 bucks You can pay me when you see me unless I see you first Hell you were saying something about a list I couldn t quite make out what you were saying but I knew it was about a list Scott a list is a fine thing if you re young and you re high up on it But when you re a little older and not so high up you see that

Insult as e mail the e mail as insult Mailer had always thought highly of William Faulkner Once when he was younger he had read Faulkner s As I Lay Dying cover to cover Privately he had found it a bit confusing Why was the mother a fish But he knew that people thought it was a fine novel and he resented that he hadn t written it himself Faulkner was a Southerner probably a racist and hard to understand Mailer was a Jewish New Yorker beloved by black people and a comparatively easy read not to mention a fine lay Still Mailer thought Faulkner and Mailer were a lot alike Both were great American writers between them they had written many of the best 100 novels of the 20 th century Both drank heavily at times liked to get paid for what they wrote and had contempt for lesser talents Mailer thought Faulkner thought highly of Mailer as well maybe as highly as Mailer did himself Mailer had sent Faulkner every book he had ever written all with flattering inscriptions and never received so much as a thank you Mailer suspected that Faulkner had read them all and wished he had written them himself Possibly Faulkner had never so much as looked at them He had heard somewhere that Faulkner had died Still Mailer was irked He felt that it had all been a big literary game Mailer was not a critic of Southern literature but he privately wondered whether posterity might not judge John Jakes a better novelist than Faulkner sources close to Mailer tell Mailer So to be called Hemingway on a budget by Faulkner made Mailer angry It made Mailer very very angry So angry did Mailer become that Mailer took the big picture of Faulkner that hangs over Mailer s desk and smashed it into a million pieces After he did that there were just pictures of Mailer hanging there Mailer recognized that this reaction was not very mature but Mailer had bigger things to worry about than minding his literary manners Mailer didn t understand why people were treating him like a dead writer either Just recently Mailer had published his autobiography and a book about Jesus Mailer had the inspired idea to combine the two subjects in one book Bill Faulkner never had an idea that good or if he did no one could understand it Mailer thought to himself that next time he saw Faulkner he would probably sock him one in the kisser No Mailer thought the next time he ran into Faulkner at a swanky literary party he would return Faulkner s insult with his usual witty insouciance Mailer hated those parties but he hardly ever missed one Your books stink Mailer imagined himself saying Mailer can t understand a word of them From dharmabum nirvana net To mailer daemon com listserv deadauthorsguild org Cc beats evillage com Re On the list Norm Easy on the benzedrine man Me I was just pleased to be on that list with famouswriters like Paul Bowles and William Golding That cat Saul Bellow was on there too It made me think about the time Neal and I went to see him in Chicago in 1949 I came in by Greyhoundbus from Milwaukee It was an ordinary Greyhoudbus with runaways and oldfolk and the Greyhoundbusdriver in his Greyhoundbusdriver s cap not saying much of anything but just driving the bus toward Chi Neal didn t have the busfare so he hotwired a car not to steal it but just to ride ride ride for the thrill of it like some magnificent highflying parkpigeon Along the way Neal had married or maybe just kidnapped a Scandinavian extracted girl from Kenosha named Inga Inga had blond curls and beefy arms like a stevedore and was excited about seeing the bigcity but said she wanted to go home and was going to call the police if he didn t take her Neal should have been worried about Inga being jailbait but at that point he was pretty focused on medieval literature and kept on reciting passages from Chaucer and El Cid and talking about how Giotto was a better painter than Van Gogh nokidding We were crashing at a cold water flat on the South side with a guy called Phil and Phil s aunt and her chihuahuas The chihuahuas had been shaved real close to the skin so there wasn t much to them just a lot of pointy ears and dogyapping They must have been pretty cold in those Chi winters and when they were hungry they d claw at your shins Neal wanted to invite Sanchez and Marylou and Freddie Engels over for a sexorgy but Dave s aunt was out of chihuahuafood so before we could do that we had to get something for the dogs to eat As soon as we stepped outside Phil s aunt s apartment a cruiser spotted us and tailed after us at a slow crawl down the street Neal had ditched his freebuick but apparently we looked like some hipsters who had pulled off a jewelry heist downtown They didn t stop us on suspicion but just kept tailing us at a distance which made us twitchy since Inga kept saying she was going to turn us in for being hopheads and whiteslavers and a lot of other stuff I couldn t understand because it was in Swedish We knew they were cops because they had copuniforms and were driving a copcar So we stopped in a dark dingy old South side tavern to think over our plans and have some coldbeers When we came out of there Inga had split and we realized we were on Congress Street Congress Street shoots out West for an amazing distance which is where we were headed so we hijacked a lettuce rig pistol whipped the driver wham and made straight for Joliet As we were riding through the sweetsmelling American night Neal looked up from the book he was reading Les aventures de la dialectique by Maurice Merleau Ponty which he had lifted from the philosophy section of Kroch s Brentano s in the Loop He turned to me and the driver of the rig who was wearing a lettucepicking outfit and a red bandanna tied around his mouth and said Oh man we completely forgot to go see Saul Bellow And now we re all on the same list of goodbooks I m sohappy As ever Jack From virginia bloomsbury net To dharmabum nirvana net Cc bloomsburygroup bloomsbury net listerv deadauthorsguild org Re Who s afraid of V W My dear Mr Kerouac Yes of course I too am pleased to be on the list All these last several decades I have been overwhelmed with feelings of horror despair annihilation nothingness barrenness void One could say that I have been in a poor mood For To the Lighthouse to place fifteenth provides a moment of cheer for it proves that someone has indeed read to the end of it But a moment of cheer quickly passes What after all is a list A hundred books perhaps seventy five perhaps only fifty The end of each arrives and soon another book is published a book is reviewed more books appear List succeeds list Lists turn into libraries Some of these books are borrowed from the libraries These books seethe with plots with characters with life suspense In other books little occurs A group of persons goes somewhere or does not go somewhere or contemplates going somewhere but delays the decision about whether to go The words fly past two hundred words six hundred words one thousand five hundred words two thousand words The words turn into pages one hundred pages two hundred pages three hundred pages four hundred pages The alphabet is recounted B follows A D is preceded by C then comes E then F then G then H then I If L could be reached that would be something But L is very hard to attain very few people in the whole of England ever attain L Not many even get so far as K And what of M and the murky letters which follow M which include U R and W Who can even speak of W which shimmers at the North end of the alphabet scarcely visible from D When I think of D an image comes into my head that I am powerless to resist it is the cross section of a mackerel Please forgive my digression what else can one call it except perhaps maundering which has made me forget entirely what I had been about to tell you It is nothing of importance Perhaps something about Vanessa or Lytton or Vita or Lady Ottoline or Maynard who as I write pursues Duncan around the garden with lust in his heart a croquet mallet Such gossip pales beside this maundering this reverie for which I am intensely thankful for nothing so solaces me calms me in the perplexity of life and miraculously raises its burdens as this sublime power this divine talent for writing endlessly about hardly anything at all one should no more interrupt it while it lasts than one should break the crockery in one s home and leave the shards lying on the kitchen floor for no reason Though yes I have done that at times as well Write if you find work V
