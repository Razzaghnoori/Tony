 What Al Gore Doesn t Want You To Know Dear Mim If as I postulated in my book Hello Kitty is a conspiracy of very small girls to take over the world I wish they would hurry up and get their act together because I absolutely do not think they could do a worse job than very rich old and middle aged men I say this with some authority since I have discovered conclusively that world may well be about to end This information came from the unlikely source of the normally ultraconservative London Sunday Telegraph in which Jenny McCartney reports how a United Nations science project has discovered things are much worse than we hitherto imagined A quarter of the world s mammals are at serious risk of extinction 80 percent of the forests have now been cleared and most coral reefs are either dead or dying This is not to mention the huge chunks of ice that keep falling off Antarctica or the radiation fallout from the Japanese nuclear plant accident that we re expecting momentarily here on the West Coast I m somewhat surprised our imminent demise has been ignored by the U S media and entirely disappointed that the Post couldn t have come up with a headline like Planet Earth Fat Lady About To Sing Even Al Eco boy Gore has kept quiet on this one although I suspect his handlers told him to ix nay on the pocalypse ay not only because folks don t want to hear the bad news but also because of all those voters who believe that the United Nations will annex the country during Y2K chaos take away our guns and put us all in camps Believe me they re out there I met of lots of them while I was promoting my conspiracy book Since I m about as daunted by the prospect of walking around with a sign saying The End Is At Hand as you are by public speaking I will take the entirely selfish way out Feed the cat hope things hold together long enough for my next two novels to get into print watch a lot of E Channel TV and resume all vices since mere self destruction no longer matters It d be nice to make enough money to spend the last days in the Roppongi red light district of Tokyo I was there with my band earlier in the year and it seemed the perfect place to spend Armageddon The Hello Kitty uprising might also be in full swing Tiny schoolgirls with automatic weapons putting Klebold and Harris to shame I don t believe Bob Dylan wears a toupee but I will ask Susan she knows about these things There is no hair inside the Gates of Eden My last word on the Backstreet Boys is that Howard Stern has a magnificent parody of I Want It That Way called Get KY If nothing more fascinating comes up remind me tomorrow to tell you why George W is really being given so much money to get elected My authority on this is no less than Jane s Defense Weekly so watch out Also did you see that the Enquirer has an interview with the mother of one of Kathie Lee s slave garment workers in El Salvador Maybe this world should be doomed Love Mick
