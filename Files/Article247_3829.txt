 What Is Moore s Law Last month in Science magazine a scientist wrote that the computer industry is in serious danger of violating Moore s Law What is he referring to Moore s Law is really just a prediction that the processing power of the state of the art computer chip will double every 18 months It s named after computer engineer Gordon Moore a co founder of the Intel Corporation In 1965 Moore observed that since the invention of integrated circuits or microchips in 1959 the number of transistors that a chip of constant surface area could hold had doubled once every year or two Integrated circuits are the basic units of computer logic and memory and transistors are the on off switches that allow digital information to be transmitted processed and stored The more transistors you can pack on a circuit the more powerful the circuit becomes Moore simply predicted that this pattern would continue Even though it s not really a law Moore s prediction has held true for the past three decades In fact its hallowed status has made it self fulfilling Chipmakers and industry analysts now set their goals and forecasts based on Moore s Law And because chip prices have decreased even as capacity has risen the computer processing power available to consumers at a given price has doubled even more quickly Since Moore s Law depends on the continuous shrinking of transistors scientists generally agree that it will eventually be violated Previous predictions that it would break down have proved incorrect and most scientists expect Moore s Law to hold for at least 10 15 more years But the Science article suggests that Moore s Law may encounter physical limits sooner Transistors have already shrunk to one five hundredth the width of a human hair To adhere to Moore s Law within five years engineers would have to create transistors that are only a few dozen atoms across a feat that might be impossible since atomic movement is so difficult to predict Click here to read the New York Times non technical piece on the Science article Engineers are currently investigating new materials and technologies that might allow Moore s Law to survive this latest challenge Next question
