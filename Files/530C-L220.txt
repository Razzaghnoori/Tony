 November 18 1991 Name Address City ST Zip Dear Mr Name Thirty five years is a long time to have been a part of the law school community As a 56 graduate I have since witnessed many changes in both legal education and the law school An obvious change is a physical one the old Maennerchor Building where I and many of you attended law school no longer exists However its history has been maintained in the present law school building through the display of its stained glass windows and the old oak fireplace Its history is also recognized by the Maennerchor Society whose members are the school s staunchest and most important supporters The enclosed brochure provides information on the old law school building the Society and the programs supported by private funds As an alumnus and Chairman of the Maennerchor Society my task now is to beat the drums for financial contributions of at least 1 000 from alumni and friends of the school You know that funding for public higher education is declining nationwide Our state appropriation is not now nor has it ever been sufficient to fund for example all of the costs associated with faculty research student programs scholarships seminars guest speakers and the law library The result is that we must think of the law school in financial terms as a private institution We must recognize that the school s ability to provide a quality legal education is dependent on our Annual Fund and endowment These comments for better or for worse are not accompanied by heartrending pictures of faculty members standing in bread lines nor with sap shots of undernourished law students However the school does have specific needs some quite visible and others somewhat subtle which are not being adequately met by legislative appropriations student tuition and fees I have also enclosed a brief report on those areas which would be helped by your annual contribution Because of the school s success the satisfaction and pride that you can take in your law degree continues to be enhanced Our challenge is to maintain the tradition of our past and to become even stronger in the future We cannot accomplish this goal without the financial help of our alumni and friends The Maennerchor Society brings together persons who share a desire to provide enduring and generous support for the law school I urge you to join the Maennerchor Society this year In the back of the Maennerchor Society brochure you will find a pledge card and reply envelope for your 1991 contribution Your gift to the law school will be an investment in our continued excellence Sincerely John M Holt 56 Chairman JH ch Enclosures Obviously if all alumni were to contribute 1 000 in 1991 we would have a tremendous story to tell However we recognize that gifts at the Maennerchor Society level are not possible for all If circumstances do not permit your participation in the Maennerchor Society please do contribute at one of the levels recognized annually by the school Maennerchor Society 1 000 or more Dean s Council 500 999 Barrister s Club 250 499 Law School Associates 100 249
