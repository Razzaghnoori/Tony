 Phat Head Warren Beatty is legendary for possessing both a politician s promiscuity and a politician s wariness of genuine commitment People are lured into developing projects with him for years at a time until unable to decide whether to go ahead or not he stops returning their phone calls When Beatty does commit his insecurities present formidable obstacles It s said that one director was driven nearly to homicide after being forced to spend six hours lighting each shot and allegedly to employ a technician whose sole job it was to hold a cardboard triangle next to a light so that the star s jowls would be covered by a shadow Professional wishy washiness has had unhappy consequences for Beatty himself most recently in Love Affair 1994 the best forgotten remake of An Affair to Remember a listless vanity production with the impact of something viewed through the wrong end of a telescope Beatty s politics might be those of a hipster but his aesthetics since Shampoo 1975 have been those of a fuddy duddy I recount Beatty s history in this gossipy way to suggest why his latest movie Bulworth has been praised as such a radical departure for its star director and why in some ways it is A screwball political satire about a senator played by Beatty who loses his senses and begins to babble the truth on the stump the film has a kamikaze comic spirit that s spectacularly disarming particularly coming from its hitherto overcautious auteur not to mention a major studio owned by right of Attila Rupert Murdoch Puffy features on Beatty in various non Murdoch magazines and newspapers have suggested that Fox which was contractually obligated to make and release Bulworth has tried to bury the picture thus ensuring its status as a cause c l bre among pundits who d love to stick it to Rupert even if that means enriching his company Right on Warren Give it to the Man And while Wag the Dog and Primary Colors have taken disrespect for American politicians to levels undreamed of since the nose thumbing days of the counterculture political satire is still a rare enough bird in this country for a sighting to be cause for joy I don t want to rain too hard on Bulworth s parade only drizzle a little The film is fun but it s also thin repetitive and intoxicated with its own outrageousness and it s as familiar in its leftist paranoid way as an Oliver Stone picture Beatty doesn t spend much time setting up the premise or making it psychologically plausible and the opening plays like choppy notes for what follows Sen Bulworth a California Democrat up for re election is weary of the mealy mouthed speeches and fund raising Sleepless and depressed and in a loveless marriage he takes out a contract on his own life Being aware of his imminent assassination makes Bulworth politically reckless Before an African American congregation in South Central Los Angeles he discards his feel good paean to the new millennium and tells his stunned audience that he hasn t returned to their neighborhood since the riots because the photo op has passed and that no Democrat will ever pay attention to them because they don t give any money to campaigns Charged up by the rhythms of the crowd his newfound candor and the sight of a dishy dreadlocked young woman Halle Berry Bulworth embarks on a hallucinatory odyssey that includes a stop at Kentucky Fried Chicken a fund raiser at a mogul s mansion at which he lectures the appalled big Jews on their greed and the lousiness of their movies and a visit to the bowels of the inner city where he placates gun toting black juveniles by buying them ice cream and standing up to the white cops who stop to harass them Along the way he dons hip hop garb and employs rabidly populist raps to say the sort of things that well you just don t say if you want people and PACs to give you money to run for office This being a satire Bulworth s campaign is reborn and suddenly he s not so eager to be shot The years of Clinton double talk have primed us all for Bulworth but Beatty is peddling his own less flagrant brand of bull He has used this template in the past The actor is enamored with martyrdom with the fantasy of reclaiming his potency seducing the unseducible and getting blown away at the height of his prowess by an intolerant society Variations can be found in Bonnie and Clyde 1967 The Parallax View 1974 Reds 1981 and Bugsy 1991 but the real precursor to Bulworth is Heaven Can Wait 1978 in which the soul of a young buck enters the body of a square old white guy who wins over skeptics and then is cruelly cut down This time the square old white guy becomes the White Negro and a champion for the homies who stare at him in amazement and nod their heads as if to say Yes this man is a brother This man gets it The fantasy comes within an inch of seeming pathetic but Beatty who co wrote the script with Jeremy Pikser is savvy enough to give Bulworth a coked up campaign manager the brilliant Oliver Platt whose jittery attempts at black slang throw the senator s more soulful conversion into relief Bulworth might be white but at heart he s supposed to be a real nigger The movie s satirical vision never extends to its hero Beatty pounds us over and over with his one joke and with slapsticky cuts to Bulworth s would be assassin until the movie arrives at a bad pretentiously mystical ending What s striking though is how superbly he maintains the movie s comic momentum even when he runs out of ideas The normally tentative filmmaker clearly draws strength from his character s go for broke mindset His camera becomes increasingly energized and Bulworth s gung ho tastelessness takes on an exhilarating life of its own Everybody s gotta fuck everybody until we re all the same color he rants Beatty might be making up for Reds where out of fear of alienating his Reagan era audience he kept John Reed s Communist ideology under wraps Watching Bulworth you can see what turns Beatty on about campaigning You get a glimpse of the star who taught Gary Hart to talk politics out of one side of his mouth and pick up babes out of the other Beatty was to politicians what Keith Richards was to rock stars those who tried to imitate him ended up OD ing Beatty s glee in seducing us with language overrides the movie s shaky construction and embarrassing hero worship If you didn t know better and I hope you do you d be tempted to give him your vote
