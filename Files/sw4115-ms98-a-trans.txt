        it sounds like you feel like taxes are probably too high     well i think theres a big waste of our tax dollar   it does seem that way i was trying to think of whether we pay more tax now than we did ten or twenty years ago but it doesnt seem like we get as much out value for the tax dollar   we dont uh we it theres theres too much um uh pocket stuffing uh going on as far as different companies contracting to do things for the county and do uh projects for the state and you know course they they prove that all the time on over the TV   uhhuh   you know   yeah it does seem like the special interest groups are what what keeps taxes high   but i right that uh i just i just pay you know more taxes than than i can imagine if i could get ive got a little piece of property   uhhuh   i just i mean when i tell you little piece of property i mean ive got five and a half acres its out in the country and if i could get what theyre charging me for taxes on that i would sell it in a minute   oh boy   you know so that thats why i just dont uh theres a lot of you know a lot of expense as far as our taxes and all the all the hidden costs that they spend our money on that that they shouldnt be spending our money on but uh i im im very uh im a single parent so im very touchy about taking every damn dime i make   yeah that does make it difficult   it does        really does are you you are you accountant an accountant or   uh well i used to work in finance but i i dont any longer   uhhuh   i was also trying to think of whether our tax rates are high compared to other countries i seem to recall that uh many many other countries have higher tax rates than ours but they may also get better value for the dollar thats the real question   right well you know ive i can handle the i can handle the tax money the amount of taxes that i pay i can handle that   uhhuh   but it you know when you hit all the uh bad roads and uh and you hear of all the misuse of the money and that   right   thats a thats a bigger   right thats whats irritating   problem to me than than having to pay them   Its also irritating that you we keep hearing a lot of lip service about how  how to make it better and how to spend it more wisely but they never to seem hear that that it changes or improves   right       well i think i think one of our uh and this is really not the total uh thing uh not totally on taxes but one of our things is our on our uh the our         Federal Government is our uh why in the world they dont get rid of       one of the houses either get rid of the senate or get rid of the Congress you know get rid of one of those housing systems and uh because thats costing thats costing the taxpayer multimillions multimillions   uhhuh   and uh but they govern each other and they they vote their selves in to staying in where they are you know and um i dont ive never understood uh you know why i there is one state what state is in the United States that only has one housing i meant one governing body   um i dont remember hearing that   okay there is theres one state ive i in fact i dont know whether its New Hampshire its a northern state um or New England state that has one housing body and uh one governing body and um   uhhuh   you know they their taxes are are more well spent but uh no ive you know i disagree with a lot of things but um a lot of things i cant change but uh what state what part of the country are you from   im from Texas but now i live in California   okay       im course im im from Texas too but i im think my the two counties that i pay taxes in are two of the highest tax rate counties there are anywhere around here       which counties are that where where do you live   so i live in uh my i have some my little piece of land is in uh Benedict County and i live in Smith County     and what state is that in   Texas   still in Texas   still in Texas you hear this Texas accent           yeah   i cant get rid of it   course in Texas at least you still dont  have income tax   well i think we pay it in other ways       i think we i really think we pay it in a lot of other ways its funny to me too that uh why the government taxes has a tighter higher tax rate for a single person than they do for a married couple
