 Background NFAT Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells is a family of transcriptional activators that stimulate the expression of genes including those encoding immunomodulatory cytokines 1 2 3 4 5 The transcriptional effects of individual NFAT family members including NFATp NFATc NFAT3 NFAT4 x and NFAT5 are beginning to emerge For example NFATp NFATc and NFAT4 participate in the activation of T and B cells 1 6 NFATc appears to be critical for proper cardiac muscle cell differentiation 7 and NFAT3 functions in cardiac hypertrophy 8 NFAT4 x has been implicated in development of immature thymocytes 5 NFAT5 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of osmotic stress response genes 9 10 All NFAT proteins except NFAT5 exist as phosphoproteins and are maintained in the cytoplasm of resting cells 2 3 11 12 NFAT nuclear localization is regulated by the action of a specific phosphatase and a number of kinases 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 In the case of T cells antigen stimulation elicits a calcium dependent signaling pathway that results in the activation of calcineurin which directly dephosphorylates NFATp in preparation for nuclear import 11 22 Once in the nucleus NFAT can bind DNA elements in target promoters often in association with other resident and co induced nuclear proteins 1 Sequence comparison of NFAT proteins revealed that the DNA binding domain and a region referred to as the NFAT homology region NHR share sequence similarity while other regions of the NFAT proteins share little or no sequence similarity a schematic of NFATp is shown in Figure 1A 1 The DNA binding domains are similar among all NFAT members 4 5 10 23 24 and allow NFAT proteins to bind DNA with sequence specificity as monomers 4 NFAT proteins except NFAT5 contain NHRs located N terminal to the DNA binding domain that function to regulate nuclear localization in cells 12 15 25 NFAT proteins are highly phosphorylated in the NHR and the phosphatase calcineurin binds directly to sequences in the NHR 11 12 13 15 19 25 26 27 Regions outside of the NHR and DNA binding domain are thought to contain transcriptional activation domains For example the N and C terminal regions amino acids 1 171 and 727 927 respectively of murine NFATp function as activation domains when fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain in transient transfection assays in Jurkat cells 28 The C terminal regions of NFAT proteins are unique in sequence and may be responsible for functional differences among NFAT family members A number of activators can interact with NFAT to potentiate synergistic activation of transcription on NFAT responsive promoters that characteristically consist of multiple NFAT specific sites One example is the interleukin 2 IL 2 promoter which contains five NFAT binding sites in a region spanning 250 bp upstream of the TATA box 29 30 Four of the IL 2 NFAT sites are part of composite elements consisting of NFAT and AP 1 sites that direct the cooperative binding of NFAT proteins and AP 1 components 30 In biochemical experiments the DNA binding domains of NFAT proteins with the exception of NFAT5 are sufficient for cooperative DNA binding in association with Fos Jun heterodimers 4 10 11 As supported by structural analysis of the NFAT cJun cFos DNA complex physical interactions between the DNA binding domain of NFAT and the basic leucine zipper regions of cJun and cFos enhance their interaction with DNA 31 To date biochemical analysis of NFATp and other NFAT members has been conducted using only portions and not the full length versions of these proteins Recovery of smaller soluble truncated forms of NFAT proteins is feasible relative to the more difficult task of isolating active forms of full length NFAT proteins Although such domain based investigations have been constructive in studying the activity and the properties of the NFAT DNA binding domains a biochemical analysis of transcriptional activation and regulated nuclear association of NFAT necessitated the characterization of full length proteins This is mainly because the domains exhibiting the transactivation properties and those controlling nuclear association are located in regions flanking the central DNA binding domain We therefore established protocols for expressing and purifying full length recombinant human NFATp Utilizing a reconstituted transcription system we found that NFATp is a bona fide transcriptional activator and that activation requires regions of NFATp outside the DNA binding domain In addition we discovered that human NFATp produced in insect cells using a recombinant baculovirus is a phosphoprotein that demonstrates calcineurin regulated association with nuclei in vitro Results and Discussion Expression and purification of N terminally tagged NFATp We chose to begin our analysis of NFAT proteins in vitro by working with human NFATp B isoform amino acids 1 921 Figure 1A A recombinant baculovirus was created for the expression of full length human NFATp with an N terminal HA tag HA NFATp was purified from baculovirus infected Hi five cell extracts using anti HA affinity chromatography followed by elution with an HA epitope peptide Figure 1B The expressed HA NFATp protein was visible above background in infected Hi five cell extracts and was efficiently depleted by the anti HA resin Figure 1B This purification resulted in protein that was nearly homogeneous We also found that HA NFATp could be purified from cell extracts by DNA affinity chromatography using an immobilized double stranded oligonucleotide containing two high affinity NFAT binding sites followed by elution with NaCl Figure 1C HA NFATp binds DNA alone and cooperatively with cJun cFos To test the DNA binding activity of recombinant HA NFATp and the ability to bind DNA cooperatively with cJun cFos we performed DNase I footprinting We used a DNA fragment from the human IL 2 promoter that contains a high affinity NFAT site 45 NFAT site and a composite element consisting of a low affinity NFAT site and a low affinity AP1 site to which the DNA binding domain of NFAT has been shown to bind cooperatively with AP 1 proteins 4 11 When increasing amounts of HA NFATp were added to IL 2 DNA in the absence of cJun cFos the 45 NFAT site was protected from DNase I digestion but as expected DNase I digestion of the composite element was unaffected Figure 2 lanes 1 5 In other studies we found the observed equilibrium dissociation constant obs K D of recombinant HA NFATp for a high affinity NFAT site mouse IL 4 promoter to be 1 nM data not shown cJun cFos alone protected the AP 1 site of the composite element Figure 2 lane 6 When increasing amounts of HA NFATp were added to IL 2 DNA in the presence of cJun cFos clear protection of the entire composite site was observed Figure 2 lanes 7 10 From DNase I footprinting studies Figure 2and data not shown we conclude that recombinant HA NFATp binds DNA both on its own and in cooperation with AP 1 proteins cJun cFos and cJun cJun HA NFATp activates transcription in a reconstituted in vitro system We tested purified HA NFATp for the ability to activate transcription in vitro In designing an NFATp responsive DNA template we positioned three high affinity NFAT binding sites upstream of the adenovirus E1b TATA box and the CAT gene RNA transcripts produced from the NFAT 3 E1b CAT plasmid in vitro can be detected by primer extension Initial in vitro transcription studies were performed using a nuclear extract from unstimulated Jurkat T cells As shown in Figure 3A HA NFATp activated transcription under these conditions Activation was dependent on the NFAT sites in the DNA template since a template lacking NFAT sites did not respond to HA NFATp Figure 3B Although synergistic transcriptional activation presumably resulting from the cooperativity between NFATp and AP 1 has been well established NFATp transactivation in the absence of AP 1 has not been demonstrated directly For example even though the NFAT sites in the DNA template used in the transcription experiments in Figures 3Aand 3Bwere high affinity NFAT binding sites that were not part of a composite element it remained possible that AP 1 proteins in the nuclear extract contributed to the activation observed An analysis of the transcriptional properties unique to NFATp required the use of a reconstituted transcription system that is responsive to human NFATp independent of AP 1 activity To this end we used an in vitro human RNA polymerase II transcription system reconstituted from highly purified native n and recombinant r proteins including r TFIIA r TFIIB n TFIID r TFIIE r TFIIF n TFIIH and n RNA polymerase II Using a promoter containing five high affinity AP 1 sites we found that this transcription system responds well to recombinant cJun cFos but does not respond to cFos alone Figure 3C This experiment demonstrates that the purified transcription system is largely if not entirely devoid of AP 1 proteins When NFATp was added to the reconstituted transcription system it activated transcription to high levels from the DNA template containing three high affinity NFAT sites Figure 3D This demonstrates that NFATp is a bona fide transcriptional activator Activation domains of NFATp are required for transcriptional activation in vitro Functional analysis of regions of murine NFATp fused to the yeast GAL4 DNA binding domain using transient transfection assays detected two distinct transactivation domains within the N and C terminal regions of NFATp 28 In this study however transcriptional activation by NFATp was not dependent on the identified transactivation domains The minimal DNA binding domain of NFATp was sufficient to stimulate reporter gene activation presumably by recruitment of endogenous AP 1 components through cooperative DNA binding It is not possible to assess the true transactivation function of NFAT proteins in reporter assays that use a promoter comprised of NFAT AP 1 composite elements in cells with high levels of endogenous AP 1 proteins Our finding that recombinant HA NFATp activates transcription in a reconstituted transcription system provided compelling evidence that NFATp is a bona fide activator If NFATp acted alone to stimulate transcription in the reconstituted transcription system then the activation we observed would be dependent on the activation domains of NFATp We therefore applied in vitro biochemical methods for the characterization of NFATp functional domains Recombinant baculoviruses were created for the expression of full length NFATp amino acids 1 921 and the minimal DNA binding domain of NFATp amino acids 391 583 fused to GST GST NFATp 1 921 and GST NFATp 391 583 were expressed in insect cells purified on glutathione sepharose beads and eluted with glutathione Figure 4Ashows the purity of these two proteins as assessed by SDS PAGE and staining with coomassie brilliant blue Both proteins were competent for binding a high affinity NFAT site when tested in electrophoretic mobility shift assays Figure 4B The transactivation properties of the two proteins were tested by in vitro transcription using the reconstituted transcription system and a DNA template consisting of three high affinity NFAT sites upstream of the adenovirus major late core promoter and a 200 bp G less cassette As shown in Figure 4C GST NFATp 1 921 activated transcription while GST NFATp 391 583 did not activate transcription Thus regions outside of the minimal DNA binding domain were required for transcriptional activation in a reconstituted transcription system Taken together our results directly demonstrate that NFATp is a transcriptional activator Recombinant HA NFATp is phosphorylated and exhibits regulated association with nuclei in vitro In unstimulated T cells NFATp exists in a highly phosphorylated form that when analyzed by SDS PAGE has an apparent molecular weight that is significantly larger than its predicted molecular weight 2 22 26 When T cells are stimulated NFATp is dephosphorylated by calcineurin and it migrates farther on SDS gels than its phosphorylated counterpart Similarly when NFATp is purified from unstimulated T cells and subsequently dephosphorylated by calcineurin in vitro its migration on SDS gels increases i e its apparent molecular weight decreases 2 11 26 Most of the many phosphorylation sites in NFATp are in the N terminal region of the protein 15 27 Upon purifying recombinant HA NFATp we noticed that the protein migrated at an apparent molecular weight similar to the native NFATp in unstimulated T cells approximately 140 kD when compared to size standards This led us to hypothesize that the recombinant HA NFATp purified from baculovirus infected insect cells was phosphorylated To test this hypothesis and to determine if phosphorylation of a distinct region of HA NFATp was responsible for aberrant migration in SDS gels we expressed and purified full length HA NFATp and three deletions HA NFATp 331 921 HA NFATp 1 722 and HA NFATp 331 722 All four proteins were expressed in insect cells from recombinant baculoviruses purified by anti HA affinity chromatography and eluted with HA epitope peptide After purification we treated the four proteins with a combination of calcineurin and calmodulin to remove phosphates attached to serines and threonines on the recombinant proteins The phosphatase treated proteins as well as mock treated controls were resolved by SDS PAGE and visualized by silver staining As shown in Figure 5A the apparent molecular weight of full length HA NFATp was significantly decreased by the phosphatase treatment demonstrating that recombinant HA NFATp purified from insect cells is phosphorylated The shift in migration of HA NFATp was dependent on both calcineurin and calmodulin and was not efficiently produced with other phosphatases data not shown Of the three deletion proteins only HA NFATp 1 722 showed a change in migration upon phosphatase treatment the positions at which both HA NFATp 331 921 and HA NFATp 331 722 migrated on SDS gels were not affected by phosphatase treatment Thus the N terminal region of NFATp amino acids 1 330 was required to observe a phosphorylation dependent decrease in migration of the recombinant HA NFATp This suggested that the major phosphorylation sites on insect cell produced NFATp were in the N terminal region as is the case for native NFATp in mammalian T cells 27 This was confirmed by performing mass spectrometry on peptides recovered from a tryptic digest of recombinant NFATp W Clements and J Goodrich unpublished data The phosphorylation state of NFATp controls its nuclear localization in cells Specifically phosphorylated NFATp is cytoplasmic and upon dephosphorylation NFATp accumulates in the nucleus 1 Upon discovering that recombinant HA NFATp was phosphorylated in its N terminal region we asked if the phosphorylation state of HA NFATp would influence its ability to associate with nuclei in an in vitro assay Nuclei were prepared from HeLa cells HA NFATp was either treated with calcineurin and calmodulin or mock treated and the two proteins were then mixed with the nuclei After incubation nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation and thereby separated from unbound protein which remained in the supernatant The nuclei were washed and protein associated with the nuclei as well as protein in the supernatants was solubilized in SDS sample buffer resolved by SDS PAGE and analyzed by protein immunoblotting with anti HA antibody As shown in Figure 5B the majority of phosphorylated HA NFATp was found in the supernatant and not in the pellet while approximately 50 of the dephosphorylated NFATp was found associated with nuclei Moreover when HA NFATp 331 722 which was not highly phosphorylated was tested in the nuclei association assay it was primarily found in the pellet with the nuclei regardless of whether it was treated with calcineurin or not data not shown Taken together these data lead us to conclude that the phosphorylation state of recombinant HA NFATp can control its association with nuclei in vitro in a manner that is very similar to the regulation of nuclear association observed for NFAT proteins in cells Conclusions We have found that human NFATp is a bona fide transcriptional activator and that regions outside of the central DNA binding domain are required for NFATp to activate transcription Our experiments in a reconstituted transcription system lacking contaminating AP 1 proteins and using DNA templates with high affinity NFAT sites demonstrate that NFATp can function as a transcriptional activator on its own We have also shown that recombinant NFATp purified from insect cells is a phosphoprotein that exhibits association with nuclei in vitro only after dephosphorylation by calcineurin The recombinant full length and deletion mutants of human NFATp used in the studies described here as well as the methods that we have developed will be valuable for future biochemical studies of the function of NFATp in DNA binding transcriptional

generated in two steps First pBS NFATp 391 583 was created using single stranded pBS KS NFATp NdeI for site directed mutagenesis with two oligonucleotides a unique in frame ATG codon contained in an
