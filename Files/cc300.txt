 Introduction There are approximately 400000 cases of sepsis reported each year in the USA leading to about 100000 deaths annually 1 2 3 Indeed mortality from sepsis in most series is reported to be between 25 and 40 with Gram negative bacteria being the most commonly encountered pathogens 3 4 5 The severity of sepsis may distinguish those who may benefit from therapeutic blockade of their excessive and maladaptive immune response from those who may not Consequently a practical way to determine the presence and severity of sepsis is essential Although systems of evaluation based on clinical observations and physiologic parameters are helpful they have been of limited use for predicting morbidity and mortality in individuals with inflammatory conditions especially in surgical populations 6 7 8 9 10 An early indicator of tissue injury should improve the predictive capability of these systems Although several cytokines have been proposed as markers of disease severity they are often transiently elevated or detected only in local pools 7 In this regard recent studies in humans have revealed that the prohormone of calcitonin CT procalcitonin ProCT as well as its component peptides offer promise of being early and useful predictive markers of systemic inflammation 11 12 13 CT is a neuroendocrine NE peptide that was once thought to be exclusively a hormone of thyroid origin Its principal function appears to be the conservation of body calcium stores in certain physiologic states such as growth pregnancy and lactation and the maintenance of bone mineral in emergency situations by means of attenuation of the activity of osteoclasts 14 Further study has revealed that CT is produced extrathyroidally by NE cells throughout the body and may have multiple functions 15 16 CT is initially biosynthesized as a larger ProCT polypeptide which is subsequently cleaved enzymatically into its components including the mature active hormone Fig 1 Interestingly in humans with severe systemic inflammation very high serum levels of ProCT and its component peptides are accompanied by normal or only slightly increased levels of mature CT 17 In order to investigate whether serum ProCT levels might correlate with the severity of illness in sepsis and thus might provide a convenient marker we employed a rodent model of quantifiable Escherichia coli peritonitis modified for use in the hamster 18 This model was then utilized to determine the metabolic perturbations associated with the procalcitonin peptide levels observed with sepsis Materials and methods Animals Male Golden Syrian hamsters weighing 80 140g Harlan Animals Indianapolis Indiana USA were housed in a controlled environment and were exposed to 12 h light dark cycles The animals had unrestricted access to water and standard rodent chow throughout the experiments This study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center Washington DC Bacteria Escherichia coli O18 K1 H7 were obtained from Dr Alan S Cross Division of Communicable Diseases and Immunology Walter Reed Army Institute of Research Washington DC USA The bacteria were grown in 100 ml of LB Broth Fisher Scientific Pittsburgh Pennsylvania USA at 37 C in a shaker water bath to log phase and stored in 250 l aliquots at 70 C until use On the day of an experiment a 250 l aliquot of bacteria was thawed and grown in 100 ml LB broth at 37 C in a shaker water bath to log phase The optical density of the specimen was measured at 600 nm on a Stasar III spectrophotometer Gilford Instruments Oberlin Ohio USA and quantified by interpolation on a previously constructed curve of optical density plotted against colony forming units cfu Additional specimens were taken from the stock solution and diluted and plated to confirm the counts estimated by spectrophotometry Intra abdominal pellets Bacterial suspensions of 2 0 10 8 1 0 10 9 2 0 10 9 or 4 0 10 9cfu ml E coli were pipetted in 0 5 ml aliquots into 8 mm plastic embedding molds Shandon Upshaw War rington Pennsylvania USA Each pellet for implantation was made by adding 0 5 ml sterile molten agar at 50 C to the bacterial suspension after which the mixture was allowed to solidify at room temperature The final number of viable colony forming units of bacteria in each pellet was 1 0 10 8 5 0 10 8 1 0 10 9 or 2 0 10 9cfu pellet Experimental protocol Mortality studies Individual hamsters were assigned to four groups n 16 group to receive progressively increasing inocula of bacteria After adequate anesthesia with 50 mg kg pentobarbital via intraperitoneal injection the abdomen of each animal was prepared with 70 alcohol and incised in the midline Bacterial sepsis was induced by implanting one pellet in the right lower quadrant of the peritoneal cavity of each animal The abdominal incisions were then closed with non absorbable suture Animals were caged individually given unrestricted access to water and rodent chow and monitored for mortality over a 72 h period Total iCT studies After intraperitoneal implantation of agar pellets with progressively increasing doses of E coli separate groups n 10 group were killed for serum total immunoreactive i CT determinations Since mortality was evident but not prohibitively high at 12 h we chose this timepoint to determine serum total iCT levels Therefore 12 h after animals were challenged with E coli they were anesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital 50 mg kg and exsanguinated by open cardiac puncture The blood was collected in individual tubes and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min The serum specimens were transferred to individual glass tubes sealed with parafilm and stored at 70 C until radioimmunoassay Serum was also obtained from a patient with documented Gram negative sepsis and was stored at 70 C to be assayed with the hamster serum samples following G 75 Sephadex gel filtration for the purpose of comparison of molecular forms as described below Metabolic studies Male hamsters n 16 group underwent intraperitoneal implantation of agar pellets impregnated with 2 10 9cfu E coli O18 K1 H7 according to the above implantation protocol This high dose was chosen for its ability to induce a significant increase of ProCT at 12 h in the proceeding experiments Animals were killed in the previously described fashion at 3 6 12 or 24 h after septic challenge Their sera were analyzed for serum total iCT per the radioimmunoassay described below as well as for total serum total calcium and serum albumin using a standard serum multichannel analyzer Radioimmunoassay The samples were allowed to warm to room temperature and were pipetted into labeled glass test tubes in 1 0 ml aliquots to which 100 l dextran blue B 2000 2 000 000 Da Sigma Chemical Co St Louis Missouri USA was added Five milliliter glass columns were rinsed with 1M ammonium hydroxide acetonitrile 1 1 and deionized water after which fine grade polyacrylamide gel columns 5ml were prepared BioGel P 2 100 200 mesh Bio Rad Laboratories St Louis Missouri USA using a glass bead to support the gel The samples were applied to the columns and eluted with 0 1 M ammonium bicarbonate containing 0 1 Triton X 100 Pierce Rockford Illinois USA The specimens containing dextran blue were then recovered in their original test tubes to which ethyl alcohol was added in a 2 1 volume ratio These mixtures were then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 30 min after which the supernatant for each was decanted into new tubes and the pellet discarded The solvent was removed using a Savant SpeedVac Plus SC110A over 2 4 h The residue for each sample was then reconstituted to the original specimen volume using gelatin buffer 0 2 gelatin in borate buffer with 0 01 merthiolate and 0 1 Triton X 100 Using these techniques peptide recovery is approximately 80 The radioimmunoassay design was similar to that previously reported 19 Initially hamster serum total iCT from gel filtration studies was determined by using an antiserum to the carboxyl terminal portion of mature human CT Ab4 This antiserum reacts with the CT molecule whether it is in the free amidated 32 amino acid mature form or within its precursor propeptides ie procalcitonin the conjoined calcitonin calcitonin carboxypeptide I CT CCP 1 or the free immature unamidated CT Subsequent studies were performed with a new antibody R1B4 which has ten times the crossreactivity of Ab 4 with the prohormone The buffer was 0 2 gelatin 0 13 M H 3 BO 3 containing 9 g NaCl 2 g gelatin 1 ml Triton X 100 and 0 1 g merthiolate l at pH 7 5 The antiserum was preincubated with standards or unknowns 20 100 l in 0 2 ml at 4 C for 4 days After addition of 50 l 125I hCT and 200 l gelatin buffer incubation was continued for 2 days After adding 50 l goat anti rabbit IgG bound to iron particles incubation was continued in 0 5 ml for 1 day Bound and free hormone were separated with magnetic tube racks Maximum bound 37 sensitivity 1g 50 B Bo 50pg Gel filtration Similarly to work previously reported 20 constituted extracts in 1 10 ml 0 2 gelatin or 0 2 HSA were applied to calibrated 2 5 100 cm columns containing G 75 superfine Sephadex Pharmacia Biotech Piscataway New Jersey USA suspended in 0 1 human serum albumin 1 g HSA 0 1 mol NH 4 HCO 3 and 0 1 g merthiolate l at pH 7 5 at 4 C One hundred fractions 120 drops or 5 5 ml tube were collected during 48 h in 16 100 mm borosilicate glass culture tubes The void volume VV was based on the peak elution volume EV of blue dextran and the salt volume SV was based on the peak EV of Na 125I The Kav for individual components was determined according to the formula Kav EV VV SV VV Results Mortality The mortality rates at 72 h for animals receiving progressively increasing doses of bacteria n 16 group were 0 20 70 and 100 respectively Differences in mortality between all groups including control animals n 17 were significant by Chi square P 0 001 Furthermore these values represent a direct relationship between the size of the inoculum of E coli and mortality Fig 2 Serum total iCT levels Hamsters which were subjected to these graded doses of sepsis n 10 group had serum total iCT levels at 12 h mean SEM of 250 90 380 60 1960 490 and 4020 510 pg ml respectively Control animals n 17 had serum total iCT levels of 21 2 pg ml All groups were statistically distinct except between 0 and 20 mortality P 0 001 Kruskal Wallis one way ANOVA Fig 3 Molecular species of the total serum iCT The molecular species of the total serum iCT in the serum was determined by radioimmunoassay of fractions obtained from Sephadex gel filtration of pooled hamster sera as described above The molecular mass of the predominant species of iCT measured ie 90 was approximately 14 000 Da From previous data 31 it is known that this fraction corresponds to ProCT which in humans is 12795 Da As shown in Fig 4 this molecular fraction in the hamster co elutes with the ProCT fraction in the serum of a septic patient 17 Metabolic studies Serum total iCT levels among groups exposed to a high dose of E coli n 13 15 and killed at 3 6 12 and 24 h increased from a baseline of 21 2 pg ml mean SEM to 78 3 542 100 3570 920 and 4240 1080 pg ml respectively The changes in serum total iCT at all time points except between 12 and 24 h were statistically significant one way ANOVA P 0 001 Total serum calcium levels at these timepoints were 11 6 0 1 12 1 0 2 9 4 0 2 and 10 6 0 4 mg dl The decrease at 12 h was statistically significant per MannWhitney rank sum test P 0 05 Simple linear regression reveals an inverse correlation between total calcium levels and total iCT r 0 81 Serum albumin levels varied minimally at 3 6 12 and 24 h from a baseline of 3 3 0 1 g dl and therefore did not account for the decrease in measured calcium Discussion The characteristics of the inflammatory response in sepsis suggest that successful treatment requires a clinically useful marker which can indicate the severity of illness and which is expressed early enough in the sepsis cascade to allow therapeutic interventions to be initiated in a timely manner 4 Additionally insights into the biosynthesis regulation and physiologic activity of such a marker may illuminate some of the causative factors in the pathophysiologic and clinical events of the sepsis syndrome Furthermore the marker itself may prove to be a therapeutic target Serum levels of ProCT as well as its component peptides are massively elevated in burns 11 heat stroke 21 systemic infections 13 and other inflammatory states 12 22 Using an antiserum to CT which recognizes the free mature CT the immature CT within the ProCT molecule and the conjoined CT CCP 1 peptide we have demonstrated that levels of serum total iCT are also elevated in the septic hamster Then utilizing gel filtration techniques we showed that much of this iCT was in the form of ProCT this is similar to the human subject with sepsis 17 23 Our findings indicate a positive correlation between ProCT component peptides and the degree of sepsis In this model the series of metabolic experiments furthermore reveal that ProCT is temporally associated with and inversely correlated with serum total calcium levels CT is a single chain 32 amino acid peptide that originates from the CALC I gene on chromosome 11 16 In humans the highest concentration of tissue iCT is in the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland However iCT can be detected throughout the body in NE cells of various tissues Indeed in humans the lungs contain more total iCT than does the thyroid gland 24 While mature CT has diverse effects on various target tissues its overall physiologic significance in normal individuals is not well understood In health its principal role is to protect against excessive bone turnover during times of increased need by attenuating the activity of osteoclasts 25 CT and its precursors however may exert other effects in health or in disease 16 The polypeptide precursor of CT pre procalcitonin undergoes cleavage of its leader sequence early in posttranslational processing to yield ProCT and several constituent peptides Fig 1 In normal regulated secretion ProCT is trafficked through the Golgi apparatus and then packaged into dense core secretory vesicles 26 27 Proteolytic processing within the trans Golgi and the secretory vesicles culminates in the formation of the active mature secretory product CT which is released by exocytosis at the apical surface of the NE cell In the absence of an appropriate signal at the plasma membrane these vesicles serve as storage repositories for mature CT In severe systemic inflammation in humans however enormous levels of ProCT and other component peptides appear in the serum while mature serum CT remains normal or only minimally elevated 17 The cellular source of this increase in serum levels and the reasons that ProCT and its component peptides are not processed to the mature hormone are unknown In inflammatory states ProCT and its related peptides appear to be secreted by a continuous bulk flow constitutive pathway in which only limited conversion to mature CT occurs 28 One might postulate that severe inflammation causes such a profound hypersynthesis of the prohormone that the NE endoproteolytic machinery is overwhelmed This may result in a marked shift to the constitutive pathway of secretion resulting in an incomplete processing of precursors In this respect a shift to constitutive secretion has been reported to occur by the experimental induction of dysfunctional prohormone convertase enzymes or by injury to the plasma membrane 29 Perhaps some cytokines may induce constitutive secretion by such a process 30 31 It is also possible that ProCT and its component peptides are released by non NE cells which normally possess regulatory mechanisms limiting the expression of ProCT mRNA these inhibitory mechanisms may be deregulated by unusually high levels of inflammatory mediators Stimulation of synthesis in such non NE cells would result in a preferential production of ProCT because these cells lack the enzymes for complete prohormonal processing It is unknown what impact if any this increase of ProCT and related peptides has on patients Hypocalcemia is a common finding in critically ill and especially septic patients Indeed the development of hypocalcemia in the critically ill has been shown to be associated with a poor prognosis 32 33 ProCT contains within its structure the immature CT molecule therefore very high and sustained levels of ProCT might mimic one of the pharmaco physiologic activities of CT which is the lowering of serum calcium levels In our experiments we noted that total iCT levels peaked at 12h following the septic insult This was concurrent with a significant decrease in serum total calcium Nevertheless this association does not prove a causal relationship between elevated ProCT levels and hypocalcemia Also the relationship with ionized calcium was not determined in this study The early and marked hypersecretion of ProCT and its component peptides in inflammatory states makes them promising serum markers for the sepsis syndrome These peptides are released into the central circulation and may act systemically as opposed to many of the known mediators of sepsis which are released locally and often act in an autocrine or paracrine fashion An important feature of ProCT and some of its component peptides are their long half lives which contribute to their potential usefulness as serum markers Indeed elevated levels of ProCT peptides have been found to persist at least 24 h following an appropriate stimulus in contradistinction to other markers such as tumor necrosis fctor whose levels may be only transiently elevated after an inflammatory challenge 34 35 Thus they provide a long lasting target to evaluate the effects of immunoneutralization Accordingly we recently reported that ProCT markedly contributes to mortality in experimental sepsis and that immunoneutralization of this molecule diminishes mortality in our model of hamster sepsis 36 In summary our animal experiments demonstrate an association between levels of serum ProCT and its component peptides with the degree of sepsis reinforcing clinical findings that these peptides are useful markers for this condition and may predict mortality Further experiments to examine the cellular source pathophysiology and metabolic activity of ProCT and its component peptides are warranted Such studies may determine the role of these hormonal peptides in inflammation and sepsis
