 okay yeah how many children do you have i have four and i have three what do you have boys girls i have uh three boys and one girl the girl s adopted i have uh huh i have two girls and one boy yeah do you have grandchildren yet uh yeah i got two grandchildren oh i got ahead of you there i got three and one on the way no but uh i know when my children were growing up we did spend a lot of time together yeah uh uh school activities and my my boy was in hockey yeah and of course the girls uh and and uh myself we rooted you know we didn t participate but we did a lot of family things together yeah we had animals for the children you know our horses and that kind of thing and uh school activities type stuff yeah yeah my kids were involved in sports uh huh football and baseball and uh huh whatever did you find the time to attend but uh oh yeah oh yeah we did too when they were growing up we did we were out in the middle of a desert out in Ridgecrest California i think that s kind of the key don t you huh i think that s kind of the key yeah is to not be in the big city yeah there wasn t a lot of other things for them to do right and uh so when when they participated in sports or whatever well uh all nearly all the parents went and yep we did that too and the children where um when in fact when my youngest was about two we decided to get out of the city and go to the country yeah i mean it s not as vast a country as like you know where you people are from because i lived in Abilene for a little while yeah and uh i know what nothing is when i moved out there yeah you know it the city itself is great but i mean you go in the in the uh car for a drive and you could see nothing for miles and miles and miles we came back when they were teenagers uh huh and of course uh then they came to the big city as teenagers and that the time with them wasn t as much as it was when they were out there in the small yeah town out in the middle of the desert uh huh but they at least they had the background yeah and the the home uh the family type unit you know and i think when kids have that they don t get into as much trouble or seek to right you know do other things that are really not good for them you know yeah gosh our our kids were fortunate they had good good other kids to play with yep same here uh maybe it s not like it is nowadays really when there s so much uh some drugs and everything else no no i know i m so happy that i had mine had mine when i did and that i m not having them now i think about it yeah i would not want to raise a a child today no no from scratch you know from start and plus i think that the uh mothers the husbands and wives both having to work yeah it s not a matter of choice anymore i think most people no it s a necessity yeah it s a and uh it that takes so much time away from your kids yeah yeah i well uh of course at the at the time i worked third shift to be with my kids during the day yeah you know and then uh my uh husband was with them at night yeah so they were always with a family member you know yeah and babysitters and uh day care and all that stuff kids don t really bond anymore yeah the mother s aren t there well i i i told my wife that uh i don t know what young kids just starting out nowadays especially if they have uh have some children if if they re trying to buy a house both of them have to work in order to pay for a house oh yeah yep uh and the kids really spend more time at school or with a babysitter then they do with their parents exactly but you know uh i wonder by the time they get through paying out for all the day care center and everything else is it really worth all that yep rather than to wait until the children are like in school yeah and then go for that type of goal i think that too many people want everything now yeah yeah i told like we had to save and plan and uh huh do without and that kind of stuff where it s now the credit cards and yeah i mean they just go and buy it you know yeah well kids nowadays they want to start out with a exact three bedroom brick house yep and when we started out well we started out in first of all in an apartment and then rented a a duplex exactly sure and then went from a duplex to a little old two bedroom frame house that s my point and and i think that they should like learn how to crawl before they walk but uh uh huh it s it s too much it and it s too accessible yeah and they get into it and they re over their heads i think that s why there s so many divorces too yeah because the money becomes uh an issue the children become an issue the jobs become an issue and it s like you know what s left yeah just to argue and that type of thing you know uh huh i m i m i really feel for young parents nowadays i do i do i i just don t uh see how they re like between a rock and a hard spot yeah it really is awful i think maybe the company should do more with day care centers and that type of thing it might bring families closer yeah or mothers to children you know because they re able to spend some time yeah they brought that up at TI i don t know how many times to to uh have a day care at yeah for working mothers but uh TI never has seen fit to do it no huh but there are a few companies here in Dallas that do yeah i think that s great because i mean you know you you it s less guilt you feel knowing that you have to leave them everyday if you can go in and see them for ten or fifteen minutes around a lunch hour or yeah just know they re close by yeah you know it s it s very hard well it was nice chatting with you well do you work at a Attleboro or does your or your husband yes i do i do no i do oh you do yeah okay i work in uh building twelve in Attleboro oh well of course i always see see uh Attleboro mission on teen news and everything else but uh never been up there oh you should come it s it s a it s a nice place in the summertime though don t come in the winter yeah yeah i started to
