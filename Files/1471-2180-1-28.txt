 Background Despite tremendous progress in developing anti retroviral drugs to combat HIV there remains a need for an effective HIV vaccine This need is particularly pressing in third world countries where demographics and economics make drug therapy difficult to deliver Although HIV infection elicits neutralizing antibodies and a cellular immune response against the virus reviewed in 1 2 and there exist exposed uninfected EU individuals that appear to have acquired resistance to infection by HIV 3 4 the hallmark of HIV infection is the almost universal inability of humans to mount an immune response that can prevent the eventual development of AIDS An effective vaccine will require not only the design of effective immunogens but also the design of optimized protocols of immunogen delivery As a live attenuated vaccine for HIV is considered difficult to test and dangerous to implement 1 2 5 6 7 8 9 various alternatives to HIV could be considered as potential live vectors for HIV immunogens including enteric bacteria poxviruses vaccinia and canarypox small RNA viruses e g poliovirus and Semliki Forest virus Rhabdoviruses e g vesicular stomatitis virus DNA viruses e g adenovirus and adeno associated viruses and even naked DNA to achieve expression in living host cells 2 10 Dengue possesses several advantages which favor its choice as a vector for HIV immunogens As a flavivirus it replicates entirely in the cytoplasm through RNA directed RNA polymerization and is incapable of integrating into the host genome Flavivirus replicons can replicate inside cells and achieve prolonged expression of high levels of virally encoded proteins with minimal toxicity 11 12 and are unable to recombine or mutate to produce infectious HIV particles Finally by eliciting an immune reaction against the dengue non structural proteins remaining in replicons dengue virus replicons may induce a protective immunity against dengue which would not predispose vaccinated individuals to DHF Properly administered dengue virus replicons expressing HIV epitopes might thus serve as dual vaccines conferring protection against dengue virus as well as HIV The challenges in developing a safe and effective HIV vaccine are many and varied Choice of immunogen is clearly problematic Critical epitopes may be masked by glycosyl groups and or tertiary structure 13 14 15 and 16 The extensive genetic variability of HIV complicates immunogen choice and the high rate of mutation increases the likelihood of the rapid development of resistance Furthermore the method of immunogen delivery e g purified subunits or inactivated virus vs various forms of live expression can determine the relative nature and extent of humoral and cell mediated immunologic responses Priming with various types of live expression followed by boosting with purified subunits is currently favored as a method to obtain stronger immunologic responses that either method alone reviewed in 1 and 2 Previously acquired immunity to a viral vector such as vaccinia may influence its efficacy in inducing immunity against heterologous proteins being delivered 16 17 18 19 and it may be wise to provide physicians with HIV vaccines based on a variety of vectors to handle a variety of clinical situations The use of live dengue as a vaccine or as a vector for heterologous immunogens has historically been considered problematic because of the pathologies associated with dengue infection Although dengue fever DF is usually self limited dengue hemorrhagic fever DHF is considerably debilitating and frequently fatal 20 However DHF is unlikely to result from or be promoted by the vectors reported here The enhanced replication of virus seen in dengue hemorrhagic fever is generally seen upon reinfection by dengue virus of a serotype different from previous infections and is believed to be mediated by antibodies against viral structural proteins so called antibody dependent enhancement of infection or ADE These cross reacting antibodies actually promote viral uptake by macrophages 21 22 The main challenge in using live dengue in humans is thus avoiding the development of antibody dependent enhancement ADE of infection by antibodies against the pre M and E proteins of one dengue strain which weakly cross react with the pre M and E of a second infecting dengue strain Since the replicons reported here lack the major viral structural protein genes they are not only incapable of sustaining a spreading infection but also are incapable of eliciting antibodies against the missing structural proteins They should neither induce DF nor promote DHF Dengue virus has a typical flavivirus genome structure as described in Figure 1 The structural proteins C pre M M and E are involved in packaging export and subsequent entry The non structural proteins NS1 NS2A NS2B NS3 NS4A NS4B and NS5 include an RNA directed RNA polymerase and a protease function involved in cleaving certain positions of the long viral polyprotein which contains all the viral genes 23 24 The four serotypes of dengue virus 1 through 4 share approximately 60 74 amino acid residue identity with one another in the E gene 25 and induce cross reacting antibodies 26 Two strategies suggest themselves for circumventing the problem of ADE from dengue vaccination One strategy is to immunize with multiple strains of dengue virus to elicit high affinity neutralizing antibodies against the multiple dengue serotypes At least one vaccine to do this using dengue vaccine candidates DEN 1 PDK13 DEN 2 PDK53 DEN 3 PGMK 30 F3 and DEN 4 PDK48 has been in clinical trials 27 28 A second strategy is to induce immunity only to viral proteins other than pre M and E Several studies have shown that the nonstructural glycoprotein NS1 can play an important role in protection against dengue Mice immunized with purified dengue 2 NS1 protein injected intramuscularly and boosted after 3 days and two weeks were protected from developing lethal dengue encephalitis upon subsequent challenge with dengue 2 virus 29 Similarly mice immunized with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing authentic NS1 30 were protected against the development of dengue 4 virus encephalitis when challenged by intracerebral injection Inoculation of mice with specific combinations of monoclonal antibodies Mabs directed against dengue 2 NS1 31 also protects against lethal virus encephalitis upon intracerebral dengue 2 challenge Other nonstructural proteins are also immunogenic and may participate in eliciting protection 32 Previously we have reported the successful construction of several dengue virus replicons which replicate intracellularly without the pre M and E proteins required to form infectious virions including one replicon which can be expressed from transfected DNA 12 Towards the goal of devising a live dual vaccine based on only non structural dengue proteins and heterologous HIV material we report here that these replicons can be harnessed to express heterologous genes including HIV gp160 and gp120 Upon introduction into a host s cells these sub genomic fragments should replicate intracellularly and support prolonged expression of dengue and heterologous immunogens without producing the deleted dengue structural proteins and without forming infectious virions Results In various previous attempts to express heterologous genes in full length wild type dengue virus we experienced a very poor success rate despite attempts to clone heterologous material into various positions of the genome data not shown Our first efforts to determine whether or not heterologous material could be readily expressed in dengue replicons was to clone the comparatively tractable green fluorescent protein GFP into the pre M E replicon into the position from which the pre M and E genes had been deleted Figure 1 GFP was readily visualized in cultures 48 hours post transfection with pre M E GFP as seen in Figure 2 Encouraged by the success with GFP we next looked at pre M E replicons with HIV 1 env material cloned into the position of the deleted pre M and E genes We analyzed two clones pre M E gp120 and pre M E gp160 expressing HIV 1 gp120 and gp160 respectively Figure 1 Expression of genes in the pre M E gp120 replicon was reproducibly visualized at 48 50 hours post transfection Figures 3 4 at a level of approximatley 1 of the cells but in many experiments the corresponding cultures transfected with the gp160 replicon pre M E gp160 either no fluorescence could be visualized not shown or only fluorescent cells with a bizarre morphology characterized by debris and or degenerative appearance could be visualized Figure 5 However when we harvested cultures earlier at 36 hours post transfection with pre M E gp160 intact fluorescing cells were readily found though the morphology still appeared atypical compared to either that of cultures transfected with wild type dengue virus and dengue replicons 12 or the pre M E gp120 replicon see Figure 6 To serve as effective vaccines it is preferable if not necessary that expression systems be capable of expressing immunogens for longer than a couple of days Although we knew from previous experiments 12 that dengue replicons could survive for at least 7 days in culture the limited durability of cells transfected with gp160 expressing replicons raised the question of whether or not cells transfected with pre M E gp120 replicons could survive for similarly long times in culture When cultures transfected with pre M E gp120 were trypsinized and replated on day 7 post transfection and then analyzed on day 9 post transfection fluorescent cells were readily visualized Figure 7 In comparison to cultures that were not trypsinized on day 7 post transfection however these cultures had fewer intact fluorescent cells and more debris not shown Although this suggests that gp120 expression from a dengue replicon stresses cells we did find fields with adjacent gp120 positive cells suggesting that at least one cell division between day 7 and day 9 had occurred in a cell successfully transfected with pre M E gp120 Figure 7 right panel A 9 days of culture post transfection with pre M E gp120 only about 0 1 of the cells or less were positive not shown which represents a considerable decrease from 48 hours post transfection In the experiments described above and in Figures 3through 7 expression of dengue replicons with heterologous material from HIV was followed either using anti HIV sera or anti dengue sera depending on the experiment To demonstrate that the same cells were expressing both dengue proteins and HIV proteins we used a double label technique with FITC detecting HIV proteins and rhodamine detecting dengue proteins Figure 8demonstrates the concordance of dengue virus protein and gp120 expression in cultures 4 days post transfection with pre M E gp120 Figure 8 The more extensive background of auto fluorescence encountered when visualizing the rhodamine fluorescence makes low levels of specific rhodamine fluorescence more difficult to discern but clearly all intact cells positive for HIV are also positive for dengue proteins The rhodamine positive spot in the lower left of the panel is cellular debris and is also positive for dengue proteins but the FITC fluorescence was not well reproduced by digital photography though it still may be visualized on certain monitor computer combinations Similar results were obtained at 7 days post transfection Figure 9 Discussion Our finding that dengue virus replicons can express heterologous genes including HIV envelop for prolonged periods of time in cell culture without selection represents a significant step in developing a new vector system potentially capable of delivering immunogens to any host in whose cells the dengue replicons can replicate Flavivirus replicons have previously been demonstrated to express heterologous genes for up to 41 days in tissue culture in Kunjin 11 However these experiments were done in the presence of selection for the heterologous genes cloned into the replicons We have demonstrated heterologous gene expression in the absence of selection for up to at least 9 days post transfection with chimeric dengue replicons Although we have formally demonstrated expression not replication our previous demonstration of the replication 12 of dengue replicons lacking heterologous material suggests that the replicons described here which contain heterologous material are indeed replicating Evidence that cells continue to replicate and express replicon proteins in both daughter cells after transfection with these chimeric replicons further supports the implication of chimeric replicon replication Ideally to serve as dual vaccines against dengue as well as against other pathogens the replicons should express the dengue NS1 protein 29 30 31 32 So far attempts to visualize NS1 production by Western blots have failed presumably because of the low transfection efficiencies However we have previously argued that the replication of dengue replicons could not take place in the absence of the essential non structural gene NS1 which implies that NS1 is being made The frequencies and fluorescence intensities of replicon positive cells seen in the experiments reported here are comparable to those seen for dengue replicons lacking heterologous material 12 suggesting that replication of the pre M E replicons containing heterologous material is occurring as well The finding of at least one closely apposed pair of cells expressing high levels of replicon proteins on day 9 post transfection two days after trypsinization and replating Figure 7 right panel not only implies replicon replication but also implies the expression of NS 1 protein as well The definitive demonstration of effective NS 1 production will have to await studies of the immune response in animals immunized with these replicons Choice of immunogen remains problematic for these vectors Clearly HIV 1 gp160 is too toxic for prolonged expression Even the gp120 expressing replicon seems mildly toxic in that the frequency of gp120 positive cells declines with time in culture post transfection with pre M E gp120 not shown However as noted above we have seen at least one instance of putative cellular division at least 7 days after being successfully transfected by pre M E gp120 Figure 7 right panel Experiments are now in progress to determine the feasibility of long term expression of other HIV 1 immunogens including gag and tat Conclusion Demonstration of long term protein expression by a gp120 expressing replicon alone of course does not demonstrate that the chimeric dengue replicons constitute an effective vaccine However at the very least they add to the potential armamentarium available to the vaccinologist It is highly likely that a successful HIV vaccination protocol will involve multiple immunogens and delivery protocols For instance mice immunized with attenuated Friend leukemia virus FLV develop an immune response whose efficacy is dependent on the additive effects of at least three separable spleen cell populations 33 By analogy it may be necessary to devise multiple strategies to obtain a similarly complex and effective immune response in humans against HIV In animal models of HIV different immunogens and modes of immunization can induce different modes of protection with varying degrees of effectiveness 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 Harnessing multiple immune responses may be the answer to designing an effective HIV vaccine 1 and the availability of multiple vectors may facilitate the harnessing of multiple responses Much work obviously remains to be done to develop dengue replicons as effective vectors for HIV immunogens More work needs to be done on determining the ability of dengue replicons to express other potential immunogens including HIV 1 gag tat reviewed in 41 and env genes with deleted hypervariable regions see 42 Animal studies in our lab are currently being initiated to determine the nature of the immune response such vectors can induce in mice and these studies will presumably need to be extended to primates Finally effective delivery systems will need to be devised Although our successful development of a plasmid which can express a dengue replicon from transfected DNA facilitates delivery by DNA vaccination 12 the development of packaging cell lines which can package these replicons into virions would be a major step forward towards a vaccine which could be conveniently administered in typical clinical situations Experiments are currently underway in our laboratory to develop such packaging cell lines Materials and methods Culturing of dengue Virus Dengue virus strains DEN1 WP and DEN2 NGC kindly provided by Dr Lewis Markoff 43 44 were passaged in monkey LLC MK2 cells at
