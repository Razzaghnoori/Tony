 okay so who s your uh favorite team who do you think the Dallas Cowboys the Dallas Cowgirls huh yeah well they did have a fairly decent year finally this year um hum at least they re coming around yeah they re going to get better i mean you know well i mean you know i think uh once Jimmy Johnson gets his system established uh they ll do all right yeah as long as Troy Aikman doesn t get hurt again that kind of killed them at the end of the season last year um hum so i don t i don t even know who your favorite team is actually i m a Viking fan okay i think i did know that i just forgot okay and they haven t been doing too hot so yeah has Herschel Walker done much for them no in fact in fact the Cowboys got the best end of that deal definitely well he was a good player i guess i don t know he just never i don t know for a while there he just i ve never been over impressed with him well he could always get past you know he d get past like six or seven tackles and just keep spinning around and get on into the end zone but um i guess you never could really see him play because with the Cowboys while he was with the team the rest of the team was pretty poor so you couldn t really tell if it was just him or the team and i always just assumed he was too good for the rest of the team but i don t know well who s the running back is it Sammy Smith or is it Emmitt Smith Emmitt Smith Emmitt Smith yeah he s been doing real good i m pretty impressed with him so far did he did he actually play in the Pro Bowl i remember he was like a backup and then somebody got injured and he was supposed to go yeah i m not sure yeah i kind of i haven t been keeping up with football i mean in the fall i i can go on and on about football but since it s kind of off season it s kind of hard to think back about all that but uh uh who else is uh uh there s you know Mike Lynn from the Minnesota Vikings he used to be the general manager starting the World Football League yeah some uh and that and he was trying to keep uh uh uh i can t even think of the guy s name either the coach of the Vikings um i have no idea Burt Jerry Burns no earthly idea going to keep he was going to keep him as the coach somehow but uh i don t know i d like to see the Vikings get revamped somehow how did they end up this year did they did they make it to the play offs at all well they started out really bad they went like one and six and then they won five or six in a row um um hum so they were in a shot to make the play offs and they screwed up the last couple of games kind of like the Cowboys huh yep i guess you can except i think the Cowboys are on the upswing i don t know about the Vikings yeah just hadn t heard much about them lately and the Cardinals were kind of like the Cowboys in fact they were doing better than the Cowboys and the Cowboy Cowboys came on strong at the end of the season and the Cardinals got killed by the Cowboys so yeah well the Cardinals i don t know i think the Cowboys probably have a a better team they just at the end of the season the kind of got messed up with Aikman getting hurt because uh Laufenberg just couldn t never really get it together at all of course he sat along the sidelines all season he never really got in a game never did a whole lot oh don t make any excuses for him well i m just saying i shouldn t i shouldn t blast him like that say oh well Laufenberg got out there and blew it for them i mean he didn t get to see much action but it s too bad because now now you know he had a shot and and didn t look too good and so no one is going to have much faith in him any more um hum in fact i think they re getting a different guy for a backup quarterback i haven t uh i haven t kept up with it lately but i remember reading something a few months ago about them signing somebody else on or or trying to go after somebody or trade for somebody but it wasn t anybody i d really heard of but i heard on the radio this morning or yesterday morning that uh Aikman s back in practicing doing real real well um who is it Michael Irvin uh huh he said that uh Aikman was hitting him right on the numbers every time so sounds like he s going to be all right for next season they re just trying not to overwork him right now until he gets his shoulder uh back in shape it was his shoulder wasn t it that he had problems with i don t know yeah think it was i think it i think it was his shoulder he had surgery on but anyway they re trying to keep him you know keep him uh from reinjuring anything but anyway but uh well i got my uh thirty day notice yesterday thirty day notice for what um i m done where i work oh really so anyway i guess we can t talk much more about that but i just thought i d throw that in there what oh okay maybe i ll call you back after after the recording is finished actually i think we have talked about football for five minutes i i can t remember oh we i ve always ran out of time ever since i ve done this really i usually have too they always say you ve talked your ten minute limit yeah i ve done that once or twice i didn t look at the clock when we started talking so i guess we should talk about football a little bit longer just to be sure we got five minutes in make sure we get our cash flow yeah so other than the Vikings who do you like um actually when i was younger i was a Cardinal fan too remember Jim Hart uh oh Jim Hart was playing Terry Metcalf was on the Cardinals this was a long time ago yeah uh i don t know who else i ve ever that s about it i was always a Viking fan i think i was into the Cardinals for a little bit um hum back when they were in Saint Louis and and yeah oh of course since they ve been to Phoenix they haven t been uh all that impressive i guess i guess i ve always been a Cowboy fan other than that i mean you know when i ve you know when you grow up in a city that has the you know one of the greatest football teams until the last few years you kin d of tend to yeah well the Cowboys were America s football team there s no question about that so get caught up in it yeah yeah i mean it it was really exciting growing up when when the Cowboys were really big because my parents would always have season tickets and they d go to all the games and you know the hype were just unbelievable it s just you know the last oh i guess probably since about eighty four about eighty five was when they started kind of going downhill really but you know i m just used to always growing up and hearing Cowboys Cowboys Cowboys and you know Super Bowl and all this other stuff so i can t you know i m not going to decide i don t like them just because they re having a few bad years i mean i think they ll pull out of it and you know they ll they ll wind up being good again they ve got some lot of really good young players that are going to that are going to uh do pretty good i think but they re raising prices on their tickets so they re banking on doing good next season again what are they going up to thirty bucks or something i think tickets are yeah thirty or thirty two for really good tickets see they they sectioned it out even more they used to just have like uh first of all it was all one price and then they sectioned it out to end zone and then everything else and now they re sectioning it off to like from the from one twenty yard line to the other one just on the lower levels is the highest price and then the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level and then like from the twenty to the ten yard line and then they re some sections kind of in the corner areas and then the cheapest of course is going to be the end the direct end zones but um they have about four or five different prices now that they re structuring it with but obviously yeah they re all going up even more or less is what it s going to do so now the tickets even got lower than the lowest one last year um you know i m not sure i m not positive i didn t i didn t really think about that i just remember trying to figure out where you could get that was real close to the good section but in the little bit cheaper but not that i ll ever go i hadn t been to a Cowboys game last time last time i went to the Cowboys game was during that um NFL strike or the when they had the scab team teams in there and it was the uh Dallas and Washington Redskins game and i went because my dad can usually get a hold of some free tickets because a lot of those doctors have season tickets and they um if they re not going to use them they ll give them to somebody else so my dad i went with my dad to a game that one time but that wasn t a real you know it was it was the scab teams it was kind of you know it was kind of different i guess and before that it s been quite a few years i ve been wanting to go to a game i just never never have gotten around to it so maybe this year Texans cheap cheaper i guess that s interesting i almost lost our electricity here
