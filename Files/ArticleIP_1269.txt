 Television Thomas Jefferson PBS Feb 18 and 19 9 p m EST Unlike Ken Burns other epic documentaries Civil War was nine hours long and Baseball 18 his biography of the third president is a brief three hours In every other respect however critics find it numbingly familiar The usual skillful Burns package of period music lush photography almost prurient avidity for the grainy feel of sacred relics and delighted to be here voice overs John Leonard New York At times you may feel you ve tuned into a commercial for Colonial interiors or an online flower show Walter Goodman the New York Times Burns earns muted praise for his evenhanded if inconclusive portrait of Jefferson particularly for his treatment of the Sally Hemings question and Jefferson s contradiction riddled approach toward slavery

latest Jane Austen adaptation from the general backlash against Jane Austen adaptations Kate Beckinsale s Emma is judged superior to Gwyneth Paltrow s in the movie released last year The Beckinsale version is darker and less accessible says the New York Times Sarah Lyall Movies Absolute Power Castle Rock Entertainment Despite a screenplay by William Goldman and performances from acting heavyweights Gene Hackman and Judy Davis reviews of Clint Eastwood s latest directorial effort are mixed at best A plot in which Eastwood as a cat burglar spies Hackman as the U S president murdering his mistress is deemed cartoonish and incredible Frankly Mars Attacks had a better handle on the White House says the Washington Post s Rita Kempley Eastwood s character would have to be telepathic to keep popping up as he does whenever the plot needs him says the Wall Street Journal s Joe Morgenstern On the other hand Eastwood s performance is said to have saved the movie from itself Eastwood makes the most of his vibrant geezerhood says Morgenstern This time he even pokes fun at it Castle Rock has stills and clips Blood and Wine 20 th Century Fox Films Director Bob Rafelson s follow up to his 1970 classic Five Easy Pieces bombs Doggedly sincere says New York s David Denby Bad tempered and bad for you says The New Yorker s Anthony Lane Rafelson s take on a Miami family s lust rage and greed the usual trio of forties noir emotions is too straight almost TV movieish Denby The characters keep laying into each other as if to slam home the message for what it s worth that everybody hurts sometime Lane Books Gladstone A Biography by Roy Jenkins Random House Across the Atlantic Lord Roy Jenkins biography of the Victorian prime minister was universally applauded The Economist called it quite simply a masterpiece of the biographer s art American critics have been less fulsome A very decent try at an immensely difficult subject writes Norman Stone in the New York Times Book Review Common complaints Jenkins a retired British politician projects onto Gladstone such pet concerns as European unity He also writes confusing prose It is something of a lazy book As in if I had more time I would write a shorter letter says the Los Angeles Times Richard Eder The New Yorker s Adam Gopnik is the lone American enthusiast Part of the fun of course lies in the hair raising displays of Victorian energy Gladstone in the midst of his political career produced a three volume study of Homer two long books on Church and State and a new translation of Horace s Odes Asylum by Patrick McGrath Random House We don t usually associate Gothic novels with elegance and discretion but these are the defining features of Patrick McGrath s work writes Michael Wood in the New York Times Book Review Asylum is credited with achieving new levels of restraint The story of a psychiatrist s wife who falls in love with a murderous patient it culminates in a departure into madness that is perfectly pictured but beyond analysis says Wood McGrath earns extra plaudits for suppressing his usual fondness for the fantastic Asylum is closer to Hardy than Poe says Phil Baker in the London Times See the Random House site for excerpts from Asylum Hungry Ghosts Mao s Secret Famine by Jasper Becker Free Press Becker Beijing bureau chief for the South China Morning Post describes in gory detail how Mao Tse tung s industrialization program the Great Leap Forward of 1958 created a devastating famine 30 million dead more than the combined tolls of Hitler and Stalin Becker succeeds in establishing the famine as one of the worst atrocities of all time Richard Bernstein the New York Times He does this despite the Chinese government s continued effort to cover up the incident and by way of interviews with survivors that provide us with a chilling view of the famine as it was experienced by ordinary villagers Paul Pickowicz the Wall Street Journal Art Henry Darger The Unreality of Being The Museum of American Folk Art These bizarre some say grotesque watercolors by the reclusive some say mad Chicago janitor Henry Darger 1892 1973 receive unanimous acclaim The appeal lies partly in the weirdness of his obsessions scantily clad little girls with penises so pungently suggestive of an imagined world says New York s Mark Stevens There is also his power of formal arrangement and his sense of color Robert Hughes Time Critics disagree however on Darger himself was he a psychopath or an undiscovered genius He is not better than a trained or insider artist writes Stevens but he taps sources of power now lost to sophisticated art See Slate s review by Larissa MacFarquhar Updates In the New York Times Book Review Kathryn Harrison the author of a forthcoming memoir about incest
