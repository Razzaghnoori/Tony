 Background The application of UHCT for the diagnosis of acute ureteric colic has positively influenced the practice of urology and uro radiology The technology allows the rapid and accurate determination of the presence of stone in the urinary tract Since the pioneering study on the role of UHCT in the evaluation of ureteric colic by Smith et al 1 in 1995 a number of studies have shown the superiority of non contrast enhanced CT over IVU and Ultrasonography 2 3 4 5 Its sensitivity and specificity is reported to be more than 95 and 96 respectively 1 2 3 4 5 6 An important disadvantage is a higher radiation dose to the patient 7 Denton 8 noted a difference of 2 5 mSv versus 4 7 mSv in the radiation dose to the patient between IVU and UHCT performed for renal colic Advantages of UHCT includes rapid scan time avoidance of contrast related hazards cost effectiveness high accuracy and its ability to suggest an alternative diagnosis for flank pain This last characteristic of UHCT is valuable in diagnosing many significant diseases earlier in their course which may be helpful in decreasing the associated morbidity In this study we are presenting our initial experience of diagnosing alternative or additional diseases on UHCT performed for the evaluation of acute flank pain Methods The radiologist s reports on CT CT films and medical records of 233 consecutive patients performed between July 2000 and August 2001 at a University Hospital for suspected renal ureteral colic were reviewed The UHCT were obtained on a Cti pro single slice helical CT scanner General Electrical medical systems Milwaukee WI The exposure factors setting were KVp 130 and mAS 200 250 All scans were obtained from the upper border of T12 vertebral body to the lower border of symphysis pubis using 5 mm collimation without the use of oral or intravenous contrast material Patients were placed in supine position with full urinary bladder at the time of the UHCT Additional prone films were taken whenever the radiologist needed a better description of suspected distal ureteric calculi Radiological diagnoses of clinical entities otherwise suspected were analyzed All relevant radiological biochemical serological investigations as well as per operative findings were also analyzed Results From July 19 2000 to August 15 2001 233 patients had UHCT for the evaluation of acute flank pain Ureteral calculi were identified in 148 examinations 64 findings of recent passage of calculi in 10 4 and no calculus in 75 32 scans Thirty two of the conservatively managed patients were lost to follow up and therefore were not included In the remaining 201 patients sensitivity and specificity of UHCT in diagnosing calculi was 99 and 98 respectively while ve and ve predictive value was 99 and 98 respectively Twenty eight patients 12 had alternative or additional diseases other than renal ureteric or bladder stone disease diagnosed on UHCT Table 1describes in detail the alternative or additional diagnoses In 71 of these cases diagnosis was confirmed by the surgical procedure biopsy and biochemical evaluation in case of pancreatitis as shown in Table 1 Discussion A wide variety of significant or potentially significant diagnoses can be identified on UHCT performed for suspected ureteral renal colic 9 10 11 12 13 Apart from its high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing stone disease the characteristic of UHCT which discriminates it from other modalities is its ability to pick up other unsuspected significant clinical entities Early diagnosis of diseases such as appendicitis cholecystitis pancreatitis diverticulitis and leaking aortic aneurysm that require urgent and prompt treatment could affect the associated morbidity and mortality associated with such diseases In a large series of 1000 UHCT for suspected renal ureteric colic Katz 13 reported 101 patients 10 with alternative or incidental diagnosis Table 2shows some of the major series published to date on this subject Among the major series published on the subject 9 10 11 12 13 the incidence of unsuspected clinical entities was 10 15 The disease pattern is remarkably similar in most series Table 2 In one report from Albert Einstein Medical Center Philadelphia Marcella et al 8 noted an unusually high incidence of incidentally discovered renal cell cancer There is low incidence of diverticulitis in South Asia and we have found no case of diverticulitis in our series by comparison to other series It is important that in the absence of ureterolithiasis particular care should be taken to rule out alternative diagnosis for flank pain In our series early diagnosis of pancreatitis cholecystitis mesenteric lymphadenitis pyelonephritis and appendicitis initiated early treatment The alternative diagnosis of eight tumors in our series and similar trends in other series is interesting It suggests that UHCT may change the prognosis in many cases that would otherwise be diagnosed late Conclusion A wide variety of significant alternative or additional diagnoses can be reliably identified on UHCT performed for suspected renal ureteric colic In the present series such diseases were diagnosed in 12 of cases Unlike most series from the West we did not note any case of diverticulitis Competing interests None declared Authors contribution NAA
