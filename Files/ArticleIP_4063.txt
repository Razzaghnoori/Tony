 La Dolce Vita Barbara Kopple s recent ironically titled Wild Man Blues chronicled the European tour of Woody Allen and his Dixieland jazz band Those who endured it I felt caged which might have been Kopple s intent saw the celebrity polite but frozen faced as star struck well wishers attempted to make conversation with him then moaning that he wished he could be back in his New York apartment or editing room I m not sure if Allen was ever a public person but his social skills have visibly eroded after 25 years of self imposed isolation of hiding behind his wealth and celebrity If anyone was not in a position to give us insight into the corrosive vacuity of our culture it s Allen who s so out of touch that he reportedly cast Kirstie Allen in his last film Deconstructing Harry without ever having seen Cheers and whose idea of sexual audacity in his new one is to have a hooker Bebe Neuwirth another actress he never saw on Cheers teach a repressed hysteric Judy Davis how to give a blow job by sliding a banana in and out of her mouth Allen doesn t go to big premieres or Academy Award parties and Celebrity is his idea of what he s missing The movie which was the celebrity studded opening night attraction of the New York Film Festival and will soon arrive at a theater near you is more entertaining than it ought to be but then Allen has evolved into a first rate director Last year Roger Ebert ridiculed something I wrote about Deconstructing Harry The result is more rambunctious and more fun than any movie he has made in years What puzzles me is why it still adds up to something so anemic and coldly distasteful It s always nice to be noticed but Ebert s implication that it s silly to be conflicted about the work of an artist even one whose technical and emotional smarts have matured at different rates is willfully obtuse As a piece of cinema music Celebrity is limpid and graceful and Sven Nykvist s black and white photography gives the images a luster that s often exhilaratingly at odds with the degeneracy being portrayed Episode after episode has a pleasing shape with wittily protracted takes and on the button punch lines But here we go again Roger I found the movie cheap muddled and thoroughly devoid of insight If you think I m divided on Allen Roger you should hear me on Bill Clinton The picture s entree into this dolce vita is Kenneth Branagh as Lee Simon a celebrity profiling magazine writer and failed novelist who s also peddling an action screenplay but with a strong personal crisis Lee comes on to virtually every beautiful woman he meets and has an amazing amount of success for someone so otherwise unsuccessful and so thickened with dissipation Branagh plays the part with a Woody Allen stammer maybe the dumbest creative decision he has made since casting Robert De Niro as Frankenstein s monster As written the character has no center and Branagh s mimetic turn allows him to skip along the surface of the part while people in the audience whisper He sounds like Woody Allen Nearly 30 years ago Allen wrote a brilliant short story about a man who goes to the hospital to visit a dying acquaintance and then returns on a daily basis portraying himself as a saint because he has the hots for the attending nurse Allen brings the same lacerating self hatred to his protagonist here but with no new wisdom forced to explain himself Lee can only stammer incoherently In Long Day s Journey Into Night Eugene O Neill has Edmund Tyrone his alter ego announce Stammering is the native eloquence of us fog people For Allen stammering is the acquired eloquence of obfuscators His fog is self induced It s also protective The very idea of public culture seems to fill him with dread and it s hard to think of a single piece of meaningful social intercourse in the entire movie People at parties are bimbos or phonies or worst of all critics Lee s jittery ex wife Robin Davis turns the head of a sweet producer Joe Mantegna who puts her on television to interview billionaire vulgarians and exhibitionistic freaks She becomes a celebrity and achieves solidity while Lee remains arrested chasing glassy eyed supermodels and flaky twentysomething actresses He is in a star studded hell For someone so appalled by celebrity Allen exploits it deftly casting big name actors to fill out parts that would otherwise be recognized as pathetically underwritten In Celebrity he gets a lot of mileage out of Davis playing yet another poetically discombobulated basket case gorgeously Winona Ryder even more breathtaking in black and white Mantegna Famke Janssen Gretchen Mol Melanie Griffith giving Lee a blow job and Leonardo DiCaprio as a hotel room trashing pretty boy superstar Allen gets more than he deserves from DiCaprio whose brief appearance is the highlight of the picture He s meant to embody everything shallow and psychotic about stardom the conception is out of tabloid tales of Johnny Depp but the actor has never looked as beautiful with the chiseled insolence of a young Elvis Presley and the bearing of a Greek god Every idea in the sequence is banal but DiCaprio reminds you why movie stars sometimes deserve to be worshipped Perpetually dissatisfied Allen s protagonist hops from one fabulous babe to another but never comes close to wholeness His one attempt at something solid a novel is vindictively destroyed by a jilted lover There s only one copy a device that was stale a century ago when Hedda Gabler burned Ejlert Lovborg s manuscript and in the age of word processors is just inane In linking Lee s self destructiveness to the culture in which he s enmeshed Allen reminds me of Newt Gingrich who blamed Susan Smith s drowning of her children on liberals and the counterculture before it was revealed that the young woman s disturbed psyche had more to do with the nocturnal visits of her stepfather a higher up in the state s Republican Party In one sequence Allen ridicules plastic surgeons and the aging wealthy women who cling and kowtow to them This from a man in his mid 60s who casts himself opposite increasingly younger starlets a man who argues that taking up with a girl barely out of her teens is a mark of purity Allen s sanctimoniousness makes me understand why people trash hotel rooms In Celebrity the protagonist peddles a script about an armored car robbery but with a strong personal crisis That sounds a little like Ronin which has won rave reviews for its poker faced depiction of rootless professional assassins among them Robert De Niro and Jean Reno who get double and triple and quadruple crossed and come to question the meaning of their existence Well not really The audience gets double crossed too in the climax but by then so many people have had their heads casually blown off that it s hard to care who s doing what to whom and why Directed by the veteran John Frankenheimer Ronin doesn t have the shorthand syntax of a 90s thriller It has a gritty feel and a tight methodical one thing after another tempo Bystanders are mowed down innocent people are blown away cars go careening down twisty French streets and Frankenheimer just keeps barreling ahead substituting noise and brutality for a point of view Or does he want us to think that his emotionless linearity is an Existential point of view I was absorbed by Ronin for an hour or so but gradually realized that I was wearing De Niro s dyspeptic scowl A three Maalox thriller Clay Pigeons gets off to a jolly start before petering out into hiply modernist irresolution Both violent and absurd it features a hero Joaquin Phoenix who s guilty of a sexual indiscretion but gets more than he bargained for when the distraught husband of his mistress commits suicide and makes it look like a murder committed by guess who Pretty soon Phoenix is under suspicion for a whole bunch of killings he didn t commit including those of a prolific serial killer The film smoothly directed by David Dobkin has a neat farcical structure but is too in love with its overly tight lipped protagonist and deadpan pacing See it for Jeneane Garafolo as a sour sarcastic FBI agent and Vince Vaughn as a rhinestone cowboy trucker whose unlined face and bland bonhomie grow more hilariously creepy with each passing corpse What Dreams May Come weds an epic sometimes visionary depiction of the afterlife to a script and story with fewer psychological layers than the average Hallmark card Featuring the random deaths of young children fatal automobile accidents a suicide and a lot of after death romping amid watercolored lilies it s about as deadly as a movie can be without literally emitting mustard gas
