 Synopsis Introduction A spectrum of autoantibodies is now known to be specifically associated with RA There continues to be uncertainty as to what stage of the disease each of these autoantibodies develop and whether they are associated with unique clinical features Aims To help address these questions a spectrum of autoantibodies known to be associated with RA in a cohort of patients with early synovitis was evaluated Methods An inception cohort of 238 patients having peripheral joint synovitis of less than 12 months duration was evaluated clinicially then followed prospectively for 1 year Patients were classified as having RA on the basis of fulfilling the 1987 criteria Serum samples collected at the time of the initial evaluation were tested for anti Sa and anti RA 33 using immunoblotting and to pro filaggrin AFA anti CCP and calpastatin anti RA 1 using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay techniques AKA were detected using immunoflurescence on human epidermal tissue RF was tested by nephelometry HLA DRB1 alleles were determined using sequence specific primers Initial and 1 year radiographs were evaluated for the presence of erosions Results Of the 238 patients with synovitis of recent onset in the cohort 106 45 met RA criteria 102 96 of whom met the criteria on their initial visit Diagnoses in the remaining patients included 22 9 with reactive arthritis 14 6 with psoriatic arthritis or another form of spondylarthropathy 11 5 with another well defined rheumatic diagnosis and 85 36 with undifferentiated arthritis The RA patients were significantly older than the nonRA patients 46 13 versus 39 13 P 0 001 had higher mean swollen joint count 13 8 9 7 versus 2 3 2 3 P 0 001 and higher C reactive protein CRP level 1 9 1 9 versus 1 6 2 4 P 0 01 Table 1summarizes the prevalence of the various RA associated antibodies in patients diagnosed as having RF positive RF RA RF negative RF RA and nonRA Regarding the characteristics of these tests RF had the highest sensitivity at 66 and all the other antibodies individually were less than 50 sensitive AFA anti Sa anti CCP were greater than 90 specific for RA while RF and AKA were 80 90 specific and anti RA 33 and anti RA 1 was not specific for this diagnosis The data further indicate that adding any one of AFA AKA anti Sa or anti CCP to RF increases the specificity for RA from 80 to 90 In the absence of RF the presence of one or more of these antibodies carried a sensitivity of only 31 for RF RA with anti Sa being the most specific at 98 Overall there was a high degree of correlation between AFA AKA anti Sa or anti CCP this being highest between anti Sa and anti CCP odds ratio 13 3 P 0 001 Despite this high level of correlation of the 101 patients who were positive for at least one of these four autoantibodies 57 were positive for only one suggesting considerable variability in individual reactivity patterns RA has been shown in multiple populations to be associated with HLA DRB1 alleles encoding for the shared epitope SE In this study as illustrated in Table 2 the presence of each of these autoantibodies was significantly associated with having two shared epitope alleles even when only the RA patients were considered Patients with anti Sa antibodies were predominantly male 61 versus 28 P 0 01 had significantly higher swollen joint counts 18 12 versus 13 9 P 0 02 and higher CRP levels 2 6 3 mg dl versus 1 6 1 4 mg dl P 0 03 at the initial visit Despite subsequently begin treated with significantly higher doses of prednisone 4 8 6 0 mg day versus 1 8 3 3 mg day P 0 01 and more disease modifying antirheumatic drug therapy 1 4 0 8 versus 0 9 0 7 disease modifying antirheumatic drugs P 0 01 the anti Sa positive RA patients had a higher frequency of erosions than the rest of the RA patients 60 versus 33 P 0 03 Neither RF nor SE were associated with the disease severity measures and analyses evaluating all the other autoantibodies failed to reveal a similar trend Discussion Despite a well documented lack of specificity RF continues to be a central part of the definition of RA primarily because of its favourable sensitivity profile In our cohort RF had a sensitivity of 66 a specificity of 87 and an overall accuracy of 78 for the diagnosis of RA AFA anti Sa anti CCP were all highly specific for this diagnosis and when any of them were present in conjunction with RF the specificity for RA approached 100 Potentially of more importance to the clinician is the diagnostic value of these antibodies when RF is not detectable Our data indicate that only 31 of RF RA patients had any of AKA AFA anti Sa or anti CCP and that anti Sa was the most specific for this diagnosis This modest level of sensitivity suggests that testing for this spectrum of autoantibodies carries little advantage over RF alone in diagnosing early RA AFA AKA and antiperinuclear factor APF have all been proposed to identify a common antigen present in the skin protein pro filaggrin It has continued to be puzzling why a skin antigen would be targeted relatively specifically in a disorder that is primarily articular A potential explanation for this may relate to the demonstration that citrulline appears to be an essential constituent of the antigenic determinants recognized by AKA APF and AFA The citrulline rich pro filaggrin molecule makes an ideal substrate for detecting this reactivity Moreover the SA antigen which unlike pro filaggrin is detectable in rheumatoid synovium has recently been shown to also be citrullinated It is thus possible that AKA AFA APE and anti Sa all recognize one or more citrullinated antigens Despite this possibility the modest degree of concordance between them in individual patient sera suggests that it is unlikely that a single antigen is involved in generating these responses This study provides evidence suggesting that anti Sa antibodies appear to be a marker for a subset of early RA patients whose disease may be more severe and erosive Moreover it was determined that anti Sa AFA and anti CCP were all highly associated with SE particularly two copies We examined a spectrum of potential RA severity indicators including the number of swollen joints CRP level and presence of early radiographic erosions Our data indicate that anti Sa was more highly associated with these measures of RA severity than any other parameter including the most accepted prognostic indicators RF and SE In conclusion it is demonstrated that antibodies directed against putatively citrullinated antigens including SA filaggrin keratin and CCP are the most specific for RA and are detectable early in the disease course It will be of interest to find out whether the cumulative prevalence of specific autoantibody subsets tends to increase over time as this would suggest that the mechanisms underlying the development of these reactivities continue to evolve over the course of the arthropathy Introduction Autoantibodies can be detected in a spectrum of rheumatic diseases where they may be highly associated with distinct clinical syndromes These are often helpful for diagnosis and to some extent prognosis In RA RF is detected in 70 80 of patients with established disease and is an integral part of the definition of this disorder AKA APF AFA and anti Sa have all been shown to be associated with RA and appear to be more specific than RF for this disease 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Anti RA 33 10 11 12 and anti RA 1 13 have also been shown to be prevalent in RA patient populations but not specific for this disease There is an evolving understanding of the antigens to which these RA associated antibodies are directed although their ultimate pathogenic role if any continues to be unclear AKA APF and AFA identify epitopes carried by keratin profilaggrin and filaggrin respectively 3 6 14 15 These proteins follow a common post translational pathway which involves a peptidyl arginine to citrulline deimination This modification appears to be central to specific antigenicity giving rise to epitopes recognized by sera from RA patients 16 17 Anti Sa antibodies are directed towards an unknown antigen that is abundant in placental tissue and rheumatoid synovium 7 Interestingly the Sa antigen also appears to be citrullinated 18 Anti RA 33 antibodies recognize the A2 protein an antigen found in the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein of the splicosome 19 Anti RA 1 antibodies are directed towards domains 3 and 4 of calpastatin the natural inhibitor of calpains which are members of the cysteine proteinases that have been implicated in articular damage 13 This spectrum of autoantibodies has been evaluated primarily in cohorts of patients with well established RA A number of important questions are unresolved regarding the stage of the disease at which each of these antibodies arise and whether indeed some may antedate the clinical expression of this disorder The fact that RF AKA or APF could sometimes antedate the appearance of clinical RA by several years has been reported 20 21 22 Anti Sa AFA and anti RA 33 have been reported to be present in early RA patients although the cohorts studied have generally been small and the clinical characterization of the patients not detailed 1 8 9 23 24 Anticyclic citrullinated peptide anti CCP has recently been evaluated in a cohort of patients with early synovitis and was found to be more specific than RF for early RA while having comparable sensitivity 25 Recently the clinical features and human leukocyte antigen HLA associations of a well characterized cohort of patients with synovitis of recent onset were presented 26 In the current study we sought to determine the prevalence and diagnostic value of the RA associated autoantibodies in this heterogeneous cohort of patients with early synovitis Sera obtained within 12 months of symptom onset were tested for these antibodies and their presence was related to disease features and subsequent clinical course over a 1 year period Our data indicate that AFA anti Sa and anti CCP are all highly specific for early RA but demonstrate only a modest degree of concordance in the sera of individual patients Anti Sa identifies a subset of male RA patients with severe disease Methods Patients Two hundred and thirty eight patients were recruited to an early synovitis study at the National Institutes of Health protocol 94 AR 194 The study patients had persistent synovitis 6 weeks of at least one peripheral joint which had been present for less than 1 year Patients with traumatic septic and crystal induced arthritis were specifically excluded Patients underwent a complete clinical evaluation The number of swollen joints was determined by evaluating for the presence of effusion and or synovial thickening in 66 peripheral joints hips were excluded Patients were then followed clinically over a 1 year period Routine laboratory data were obtained on each visit including an evaluation of acute phase reactants Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the hands and feet were either available for evaluation or obtained at the time of assessment A second set of radiographs was obtained at the 1 year visit All radiographs were evaluated for the presence of erosions Although a proportion of the radiographs were felt to have possible or questionable erosions only patients with definite erosions on either set of radiographs were included in the definition of erosions At the completion of the year of observation patients who were diagnosed as having RA had all met the 1987 American College of Rheumatology ACR criteria 27 on at least one visit If a patient had met ACR criteria but with follow up was unequivocally diagnosed as having another well characterized rheumatic disease this individual was not included in the definition of RA Detection of autoantibodies IgM RF was measured by nephelometry and a level 20 IU ml was considered positive Anti Sa antibodies were detected by immunoblot as previously described 7 A partially purified preparation of placental Sa antigen was provided by one of the authors HAM and the western blot assay performed blindly by another GS RA 33 was detected using immunoblot as described previously 19 Filaggrin was obtained from human epidermis and purified using reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography After covalently coupling to 96 well plates AFA were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA as previously described 1 5 The cutoff level for positivity OD 0 15 was determined on the basis of results of sera from 100 middle aged 40 65 years blood donors Antibodies to CCP were evaluated after generating a cyclic peptide from linear citrulline containing peptides by substituting serine residues by cysteine Anti CCP were detected using ELISA as previously described with the linear peptides 17 Control peptides had an unmodified arginine rather than citrulline The cutoff level for positivity OD 0 3 was determined on the basis of generating 100 specificity for RA in previous assays using local normal controls AKA were detected using immunoflurescence Sections of human breast epidermis were used and the slides were read independently by two observers AR and CZ Any slides in which the observers did not agree were reread and a consensus agreed In all cases the detected autoantibodies were of the IgG class The results were not corrected for total IgG levels HLA typing HLA DR typing was done by the molecular polymerase chain reaction sequence specific primers methods using specific oligonucleotide sequences as primers as previously described 28 Shared epitope SE alleles included DRB1 0101 0102 0401 0404 0405 0408 1001 1402 Statistical analysis Patient groups were compared using analysis of variance of the Kruskal Wallis test for continuous variables and using the Chi squared test for proportions The significance level for associations between individual autoantibodies and HLA DRB1 alleles was adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method Statistical analysis was performed using Epi Info statistical software Center for Disease Control Atlanta GA USA http www cdc gov epo epi epiinfo htm Results Prevalence of the autoantibodies in the patient cohort Table 1indicates the prevalence of a spectrum of known autoantibodies and of the RA associated antibodies in patients diagnosed as having RF RA RF RA and nonRA In total 87 patients were RF positive 17 of whom did not meet RA criteria any point during the study period and were classified as having undifferentiated arthritis Antinuclear antibodies were detected in 65 238 27 patients and were of comparable prevalence in the patient groups Less than 10 of the patients in all groups demonstrated antibodies to SSA SSB dsDNA ribonucleoprotein RNP and Sm Of the RA associated antibodies tested AFA anti Sa anti CCP and AKA were all significantly more prevalent in the RF RA group compared with either the RF RA group or the nonRA group Anti RA 1 antibodies were detected in 35 of the cohort with no significant difference between the groups Anti RA 33 antibodies were detected in three patients in the cohort Please note the prevalence of anti Sa antibodies was significantly higher in the RF RA group compared with the nonRA group 14 versus 2 P 0 01 but there were no differences in the prevalence of the other autoantibodies between these two patient groups In total 90 106 85 of the RA patients and 75 132 57 of the nonRA patients had at least one of the RA associated antibodies Diagnostic value of antibodies for RA The diagnostic value of the individual antibodies for RA is shown in Table 3 RF had the highest sensitivity at 66 and all the other antibodies were individually less than 50 sensitive AFA anti Sa and anti CCP were greater than 90 specific for RA while RF and AKA were 80 90 specific and anti RA 1 was not specific for this diagnosis The data further indicate that adding any one of AFA AKA anti Sa or anti CCP to RF increases the specificity for RA from 80 to 90 In the absence of RF the presence of one or more of these antibodies carried a sensitivity of only 31 for RF RA with anti Sa being the most specific at 98 At the completion of the study of the 37 132 28 nonRA patients positive for one of AFA AKA anti Sa or anti CCP 12 had some form of spondylarthropathy 4 had a connective tissue disease and 21 continued with a diagnosis of undifferentiated arthritis Correlation between antibodies in patient sera Previous studies have generally suggested a high degree of correlation in RA patient sera between AFA AKA anti CCP and anti Sa We tested the correlation between these antibodies in the patient sera The correlation was highest between anti CCP and anti Sa odds ratio OR 13 3 P 0 001 and lowest between anti Sa and AKA OR 2 4 P 0 09 In total 101 patients had at least one of the four antibodies 64 of whom had RA Of these 101 patients 57 were in fact positive for only one antibody AKA 20 AFA 12 anti Sa 6 anti CCP 19 Only seven patients were positive for all four antibodies Seropositivity for anti CCP and AFA was determined on the basis of an ELISA cut off level as described in the Methods section The relationship between the titers of these two antibodies and between each of them and RF was examined There was a significant correlation in the titers of anti CCP and AFA in individual sera r 0 46 P 0 001 Titers of both anti CCP and AFA were not correlated with RF titers When only anti CCP positive patients were examined the mean CCP titer was significantly higher in the RF positive patients n 44 compared with the RF negative patients n 10 1 07 0 55 versus 0 6 0 34 P 0 01 A similar tread was seen with AFA although this did not reach statistical significance Of note also the mean RF titer for RF positive patients who did not meet RA criteria did not differ from the RF positive patients who were diagnosed as having RA 202 172 versus 207 169 P not significant RF Sa AFA and CCP are highly associated with shared epitope in early RA RA has been shown in multiple populations to be associated with HLA DR alleles encoding for the SE We sought to determine if specific autoantibodies were particularly associated with SE alleles in our cohort These data are presented in Table 2 Overall the SE alleles were highly associated with the diagnosis of RA OR 3 0 P 0 0001 RF AFA anti Sa and anti CCP were all associated with SE alleles particularly two copies Interestingly 6 6 patients with 0101 0401 were positive for at least one of these autoantibodies Anti Sa antibodies identify a male predominant subset of RA patients with severe disease Table 4demonstrates that in comparison with all other RA patients RA patients with anti Sa antibodies were predominantly male 61 versus 28 P 0 01 had significantly higher swollen joint counts 18 12 versus 13 9 P 0 02 and higher CRP levels 2 6 3 mg dl versus 1 6 1 4 mg dl P 0 03 at the initial visit Despite subsequently being treated with significantly higher doses of prednisone 4 8 6 0 mg day versus 1 8 3 3 mg day P 0 01 and more disease modifying antirheumatic drug therapy 1 4 0 8 versus 0 9 0 7 disease modifying antirheumatic drugs P 0 01 the anti Sa positive RA patients had a higher frequency of erosions that the rest of the RA patients 60 versus 33 P 0 03 Table 4further indicates that neither RF nor SE was associated with the disease severity measures and analyses evaluating all the other autoantibodies failed to reveal a similar trend data not shown Of interest only six RA patients demonstrated the presence of nodules and this feature was more associated with RF and SE than with anti Sa Analysis of the nonRA patients did not reveal any clinically meaningful associations with any of the autoantibodies Discussion A cohort of patients with synovitis of recent onset was evaluated and we sought to determine the prevalence and potential clinical utility of a spectrum of autoantibodies that has been shown to be associated with RA To date most of the studies evaluating these antibodies have been in patients with established well characterized disease and their prevalence and diagnostic value in patients with early inflammatory arthritis has not been defined Our study evaluated patients within a few months of the onset of synovitis and then followed them for a 1 year period to determine the best clinical diagnosis In particular we sought to determine how sensitive and specific each of the antibodies alone and in combination were for early RA We utilized the accepted definition of RA using the 1987 ACR criteria 27 Of note a large epidemiologic study of patients with early inflammatory arthritis found that the proportion of patients who met the ACR criteria increased if the criteria were applied cumulatively over a 5 year period 29 Although the duration of follow up in this study was shorter we found that almost all of the patients who had met the RA criteria at the completion of the study period had done so on their initial visit Despite a well documented lack of specificity RF continues to be a central part of the definition of RA primarily because of its favorable sensitivity profile In our cohort RF had a sensitivity of 66 a specificity of 87 and an overall accuracy of 78 for the diagnosis of RA AFA anti Sa and anti CCP were all highly specific for this diagnosis and when any of them were present in conjunction with RF the specificity for RA approached 100 Potentially of more importance to the clinician is the diagnostic value of these antibodies when RF is not detectable Our data indicate that only 31 of RF RA patients had any of AKA AFA anti Sa or anti CCP and that anti Sa was the most specific for this diagnosis This modest level of sensitivity suggests that testing for this spectrum of autoantibodies carries little advantages over RF alone in diagnosing early RA This study provides evidence suggesting that anti Sa anti bodies appear to be a marker for a subset of early RA patients whose disease may be more severe and erosive These data are consistent with observations in a French RA cohort where anti Sa and SE were associated with severe radiographic erosions 9 Indeed it was determined that anti Sa AFA and anti CCP were all highly associated with SE particularly two copies We examined a spectrum of potential RA severity indicators including the number of swollen joints CRP level and presence of early radiographic erosions Our data indicate that anti Sa was more highly associated with these measures of RA severity than any other parameter including the most accepted prognostic indicators RF and SE In particular there was a significantly higher prevalence of radiographic erosions in the anti Sa positive RA patients compared with the rest of the RA population despite the fact that the anti Sa positive patients had received significantly higher doses of prednisone and more disease modifying antirheumatic drug therapy Interestingly the anti Sa positive subset in this cohort was strikingly predominated by males 61 of Sa positive versus 28 of Sa negative RA patients P 0 001 It has recently been shown that in comparison with female RA patients male RA patients tended to develop erosions earlier in the disease course 30 The finding that anti Sa antibodies are associated both with male gender and with severe early RA further emphasizes the importance of gender differences in the clinical expression of this heterogeneous disease AFA AKA and APF have been proposed to all identify a common antigen present in the skin protein pro filaggrin 1 3 4 5 6 It has continued to be puzzling why a skin antigen would be targeted relatively specifically in a disorder that is primarily articular A potential explanation for this may relate to the demonstration that citrulline appears to be an essential constituent of the antigenic determinants recognized by AKA APF and AFA 16 17 The citrulline rich pro filaggrin molecule makes an ideal substrate for detecting this reactivity Moreover the Sa antigen which unlike pro filaggrin is detectable in rheumatoid synovium has recently also been shown to be citrullinated 18 It is thus possible that AKA AFA APF and anti Sa all recognize one or more citrullinated antigens As with previous studies the current study documents a good overall correlation between these antibodies Nevertheless the data clearly indicate that reactivity to CCP does not capture that complete spectrum of AFA AKA and anti Sa reactivity Indeed it has been shown that 56 of patients who were positive for one or more of these antibodies were positive for only one and that only 7 of these patients were positive for all of them Similarly previous studies evaluating AKA APF and AFA have shown varying degrees of discordance in the seropositivity of individual patient sera 3 4 5 14 Moreover there was a spectrum of reactivity patterns seen when RA sera were tested against various citrulline containing peptides 17 Together these data are most consistent with the hypothesis that individual RA patients respond to unique antigenic determinants that may preferentially be citrullinated but that are likely distinct from those of targeted by other RA patients It was surprising to discover that anti RA 33 antibodies were all but absent in this cohort of patients particularly in view of the previously reported prevalence of 20 40 in other RA cohorts 10 11 12 This antibody was reported to have a prevalence of only 6 in a Finnish cohort of early RA patients 24 It should be pointed out that the testing for anti RA 33 including that performed in the current study was all performed in the same laboratory GS The reasons for this discrepancy are unclear and may represent inherent differences in the populations studied Alternatively it is possible that the development of anti RA 33 reactivity increases as the diseases progresses Longitudinal follow up of early RA cohorts such as the present one will help to further clarify this issue In the current study it was demonstrated that antibodies directed against putatively citrullinated antigens including Sa filaggrin keratin and CCP are the most specific for RA and are detectable early in the disease course It will be of interest to find out whether the cumulative prevalence of specific autoantibody subsets tends to increase over time as this would suggest that the mechanisms underlying the development of these reactivities continue to evolve over the course of the arthropathy
