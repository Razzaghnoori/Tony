Saudi Arabia to acquire a U S visa he and his travel companion 9 11 hijacker Ahmed al Nami both applied for and received visas on October 28 2000 Hamlan never returned to Afghanistan probably dropping out either because he changed his mind or because his family intervened In December 1999 while still in high school in Saudi Arabia Hamlan became involved with a group that gathered periodically to watch jihad propaganda tapes and was encouraged by a mentor named Bandar Marui to pursue jihad especially as practiced in the Bosnia Herzegovina and Russian Afghan wars and a book titled Gladiator of Passion As instructed Hamlan acquired a passport on February 15 2000 and agreed to go to Afghanistan after the hajj in mid March 2000 He and two travel companions obtained Pakistani visas in Sharjah UAE and traveled to Islamabad where al Qaeda facilitator Hassan Ghul took them to a guesthouse managed by Abu Zubaydah Days later two men helped Hamlan cross the Pakistan Afghanistan border At the Khaldan camp Hamlan received military training courses Upon hearing that the camp was to be closed he and others traveled to al Faruq camp near Kandahar where they received more training He also met and proclaimed allegiance to Bin Ladin at this time Injured during a further training session Hamlan was assigned to guard the airport where he met future hijacker Ahmed al Nami whose recent laser eye surgery had interrupted his training An individual named Abu Basir al Yemeni indoctrinated the two in Bin Ladin s anti U S position and extolled the virtues of martyrdom Hamlan and Nami eventually agreed to approach Abu Hafs al Mauritani about participating in a suicide operation The day after visiting Abu Hafs Hamlan and Nami heard from Abu Basir that Bin Ladin was planning an attack against the United States After taking their passports Abu Basir arranged for Hamlan and Nami to meet Bin Ladin and instructed them to use the following phrase to express their desire to become martyrs I want to be one of this religion s bricks and glorify this religion The al Qaeda leader accepted both applicants In October 2000 Abu Basir took Hamlan and Nami to Kandahar to meet KSM who impressed on them the high expectations for martyrs and instructed them on using coded telephone numbers He returned their passports which had been altered and now contained forged tourism stamps for Singapore Malaysia Turkey and Egypt KSM told them to meet with Atef before returning to Saudi Arabia where they should contact hijacker future 9 11 hijacker Waleed al Shehri for additional documentation After meeting with Atef Hamlan and Nami traveled by car and by air to an address KSM had given them inTehran where arrangements were made for them to fly to Qatar From Qatar they traveled onward to the UAE and then to Mecca Nami contacted KSM and received coded instructions to go to Jeddah call Waleed al Shehri and obtain visas at the U S consulate In Jeddah they briefly shared an apartment with Shehri who provided them with directions to the consulate and showed them how to fill out the visa application After acquiring visas Hamlan and Nami presented their passports to Shehri for inspection and returned to Mecca Nami called KSM who told them to return to Afghanistan the next day Despite instructions to the contrary Hamlan insisted on calling his family before leaving Saudi Arabia because he had begun to have second thoughts after acquiring the visa Told by his brother that their mother had fallen ill Hamlan decided not to return to Afghanistan even after Nami reminded him of his allegiance to Bin Ladin and commitment to complete the suicide mission In Riyadh he told his brothers that he had been on jihad in Chechnya Fearing that they might ask for his passport he removed the U S visa as later confirmed by forensic analysis performed by Saudi authorities Hamlan returned to college and resumed living with his parents who confiscated his passport Thereafter Hamlan received a visit at the college from a former associate at al Faruq camp Khalid al Zahrani who asked why he had not returned to Afghanistan Zahrani admitted having been sent by KSM to convince Hamlan to return to Afghanistan Hamlan never did Intelligence report interrogation of detainee Mar 16 2003 10 Abderraouf Jdey a k a Faruq al Tunisi A Canadian passport holder he may have trained in Afghanistan with Khalid al Mihdhar and Nawaf al Hazmi and received instruction from KSM with Atta and Binalshibh A letter recovered from a safehouse in Pakistan apparently written by Sayf al Adl also suggests that Jdey was initially part of the 9 11 operation at the same time as the Hamburg group A videotape of Jdey s martyrdom statement was found in the rubble of Atef s house near Kabul following a November 2001 airstrike together with a martyrdom video of Binalshibh While both Binalshibh and Khallad confirm Jdey s status as an al Qaeda recruit KSM says Jdey was slated for a second wave of attacks but

2004 p 47 Although U S authorities have not uncovered evidence that anyone met with Atta or Binalshibh in Spain in July 2001 Spanish investigators contend that members of the Spanish al Qaeda cell were involved in the July meeting and were connected to the 9 11 attacks In an indictment of the Spanish cell members dated September 17 2003 the Spanish government relies on three main points First is a 1997 trip to the United States by Ghasoub al Abrash Ghalyoun a Syrian living in Spain During the trip Ghalyoun videotaped a number of U S landmarks including the World Trade Center The Spanish indictment alleges that an al Qaeda courier was in Ghalyoun s town in Spain shortly after the trip and that the courier probably delivered the tape to al Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan Second the Spanish government contends that during the relevant time period an individual named Muhammed Belfatmi was near the town where the Atta Binalshibh meeting took place and that Belfatmi traveled to Karachi shortly before September 11 on the same flight as Said Bahaji one of Atta s Hamburg associates and even stayed at the same hotel Finally Spanish authorities rely on an intercepted telephone conversation between cell leader Imad Eddin Barakat Yarkas and an individual named Shakur in August 2001 in which Shakur describes himself as entering the field of aviation and slitting the throat of the bird Shakur has been identified by Spanish authorities as Farid Hilali Although we cannot rule out the possibility that other facts will come to light as the Spanish case progresses to trial we have not found evidence that individuals in Spain participated in the July meeting or in the 9 11 plot See Baltasar Garzon interview Feb 13 2004 Indictment Central Investigating Court No 5 Madrid Sept

1999 these briefings were conducted based on slides created by the CIA s Bin Ladin unit See Richard interview Dec 11 2003 We were able to review the slides to identify the subjects of the respective briefings 2 The exact number of persons who receive the PDB varies by administration In the Clinton administration up to 25 people received the PDB In the Bush administration distribution in the pre 9 11 time period was limited to six people The Commission received access to about four years of articles from the PDB related to Bin Ladin al Qaeda the Taliban and key countries such as Afghanistan Pakistan and Saudi Arabia including all the Commission requested The White House declined to permit all commissioners to review these sensitive documents The Commission selected four representatives the Chair the Vice Chair Commissioner Gorelick and the Executive Director as its review team All four reviewed all of the more than 300 relevant articles Commissioner Gorelick and the Executive Director prepared a detailed summary reviewed by the White House for constitutional and especially sensitive classification concerns that was then made available to all Commissioners and designated staff Except for the August 6 2001 PDB article the summary could not include verbatim quotations for example the titles of the articles but could paraphrase the substance Two of the articles the December 4 1998 hijacking article in chapter 4 and the August 6 2001 article discussing Bin Ladin s plans to attack in the United States in this chapter were eventually declassified 3 The CIA produced

fabricator FBI report Daily UBL Radical Fundamentalist Threat Update ITOS Threat Update Webpage Aug 1 2001 The FBI conducted an extensive investigation of the two individuals who were stopped after being observed taking photographs of two adjacent buildings that contained FBI offices The person taking the photographs told the FBI that he was taking them for a co worker in Indiana who had never been to New York and wanted to see what it looked like The picture taker was in New York to obtain further information regarding his pending citizenship application He had an appointment at 26 Federal Plaza where the relevant INS offices were located This same building houses portions of the FBI s New York Field Office Before going into the building the individual pulled out the camera and took four photographs When the FBI attempted to contact the co worker and roommate who had requested some photographs it was determined that he had fled without receiving his last paycheck after learning that the FBI had asked his employer some questions about him Further investigation determined that he was an illegal alien using forged identity documents Despite two years of investigation the FBI was unable to find the co worker or determine his true identity The FBI closed the investigation on June 9 2003 when it concluded that it was unable to connect the men s activities to terrorism

s permission to share this information at the meeting Jane also apparently did not realize that one of the agents in attendance was a designated intelligence agent so she could have shared all of the information with that agent regardless of the caveats No one who was at the meeting suggested that option however DOJ Inspector General interview of Steve B Sept 16 2002 DOJ Inspector General interview of Jane July 16 2003 These caveats were different from the legal limits we discussed in section 3 2 The Attorney General s July 1995 procedures concerned FISA information developed in an FBI intelligence investigation This however was NSA information These particular caveats were the result of the Justice Department s and NSA s overabundance of caution in December 1999 During the millennium crisis Attorney General Reno authorized electronic surveillance of three U S persons overseas Because the searches were not within the United States no FISA warrant was needed Reno approved the surveillances pursuant to section 2 5 of Executive Order 12333 with the proviso that the results of these particular surveillances not be shared with criminal investigators or prosecutors without the approval of the Office of Intelligence Policy and Review Because of the complexity of determining whether particular reporting was the fruit of particular surveillances NSA decided to place these caveats on all its Bin Ladin related reporting not just reporting on the surveillances authorized by Reno As a result these caveats were placed on the reports relating to Mihdhar even though they were not covered by Reno s December 1999 order See DOJ memo Reno to Freeh FISA surveillance of a suspected al Qaeda operative Dec 24 1999 NSA email William L to Karen C distribution restrictions Dec 10

Request Aug 29 2001 The analyst s email however reflects that she was confusing a broad array of caveats and legal barriers to information sharing and rules governing criminal agents use of information gathered through intelligence channels There was no broad prohibition against sharing information gathered through intelligence channels with criminal agents This type of sharing occurred on a regular basis in the field The court s procedures did not apply to all intelligence gathered regardless of collection method or source Moreover once information was properly shared the criminal agent could use it for further investigation 81 FBI email Jane to Steve NSLU Response Aug 29 2001 Jane says she only asked whether there was sufficient probable cause to open the matter as a criminal case and whether the criminal agent could attend any interview if Mihdhar was found She said the answer she received to both questions was no She did not ask whether the underlying information could have been shared Jane interview July 13 2004 The NSLU attorney denies advising that the agent could not participate in an interview and notes that she would not have given such inaccurate advice The attorney told investigators that the NSA caveats would not have precluded criminal agents from joining in any search for Mihdhar or from participating in any interview Moreover she said that she could have gone to the NSA and obtained a waiver of any such caveat because there was no FISA information involved in this case There are no records of the conversation between Jane and the attorney Jane did not copy the attorney on her email to the agent so the attorney did not have an opportunity to confirm or reject the advice Jane was giving to the agent DOJ Inspector General interview of Sherry S Nov 7 2002 Jane asked the New York agent assigned to the Mihdhar search to sign a FISA acknowledgment form indicating the agent understood how he had to treat FISA information Because no FISA information was involved she should not have required him to sign such a form To the extent she believed incorrectly that the Attorney General s 1995 procedures applied to this situation there was in fact an exception in place for New York DOJ Inspector General interview of Sherry S Nov 7 2002 More fundamentally Jane apparently understood the welter of restrictions to mean in workday shorthand that any information gathered by intelligence agencies should not be shared with criminal agents This was incorrect DOJ Inspector General interviews of Jane July 16 2003 Nov 4 2002 82 FBI emails between Steve B and Jane re NSLU Response Aug 29 2001 While the agent expressed his frustration with the situation to Jane he made no effort to press the matter further by discussing his concerns with either his supervisor or the chief division counsel in New York 83 Attorney General Ashcroft testified to us that this and similar information sharing issues arose from Attorney General Reno s 1995 guidelines discussed in chapter 3 and specifically from a March 1995 memorandum of then Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick John Ashcroft testimony Apr 13 2004 DOJ memo Gorelick to White Instructions on Separation of Certain Foreign Counterintelligence and Criminal Investigations Mar 4 1995 We believe the Attorney General s testimony does not fairly or accurately reflect the significance of the 1995 documents and their relevance to the 2001 discussions Whatever the merits of the March 1995 Gorelick memorandum and the subsequent July 1995 Attorney General procedures on information sharing they did not apply to the information the analyst decided she could not share with the criminal agent As discussed earlier the reason Jane decided she could not share information was because the initial information on Mihdhar had been analyzed by the NSA This reason was unrelated to either of the 1995 documents The Gorelick memorandum applied to two particular criminal cases neither of which was involved in the summer 2001 information sharing discussions As the FBI agent observed in his email Part A of the 1995 procedures applied only to information obtained pursuant to a FISA warrant None of the Mihdhar material was FISA information There was an exemption for the Southern District of New York from Part B of the 1995 procedures so they did not apply Also the 1995 procedures did not govern whether information could be shared between intelligence and criminal agents within the FBI a separation that the Bureau did not begin making formally until long after the procedures were in place The 1995 procedures governed only the sharing of information with criminal prosecutors Even in that situation the restriction obliged running the information through the OIPR screen What had happened as we discussed in chapter 3 was a growing battle within the Justice Department during the 1990s and between parts of Justice and the FISA Court over the scope of OIPR s screening function and the propriety of using FISA derived information in criminal matters The FISA Court s concern with FBI sloppiness in its FISA applications also began to take a toll the court began designating itself as the gatekeeper for the sharing of intelligence information the FBI was required to separately designate criminal and intelligence agents and the court banned one supervisory FBI agent from appearing before it By late 2000 these factors had culminated in a set of complex rules and a widening set of beliefs a bureaucratic culture that discouraged FBI agents from even seeking to share intelligence information Neither Attorney General acted to resolve the conflicting views within the Justice Department Nor did they challenge the strict interpretation of the FISA statute set forth by the FISA Court and OIPR Indeed this strict interpretation remained in effect until the USA PATRIOT Act was passed after 9 11 Simply put there was no legal reason why the information the analyst possessed could not have been shared with the criminal agent On August 27 Jane requested the NSA s permission to share the information with the criminal agents but she intended for the information only to help the criminal agents in their ongoing Cole investigation She still did not believe they could be involved in the intelligence investigation even if the NSA permitted the information to be shared DOJ IG 9 11 Report July 2 2004 p 339 The next day the NSA notified its representative at FBI headquarters that it had approved the passage of the information to the criminal agents NSC email Carlene C to Richard K Response to FBI Sanitization Request Aug 28 2001 Thus Jane had permission to share the information with the criminal agent prior to their August 29 emails 84 DOJ Inspector General interview of Robert F Dec 18 2002 FBI electronic communication Los Angeles lead Sept 10 2001 85 Hazmi and Mihdhar used their true names to obtain California driver s licenses and open New Jersey bank accounts Hazmi also had a car registered and had been listed in the San Diego telephone book Searches of readily available databases could have unearthed the driver s licenses the car registration and the telephone listing A search on the car registration would have unearthed a license check by the South Hackensack Police Department that would have led to information placing Hazmi in the area and placing Mihdhar at a local hotel for a week in early July 2001 The hijackers actively used the New Jersey bank accounts through ATM debit card and cash transactions until September 10 Among other things they used their debit cards to pay for hotel rooms and Hazmi used his card on August 27 to purchase tickets on Flight 77 for himself and his brother and fellow hijacker Salem al Hazmi These transactions could have helped locate them if the FBI had obtained the bank records in time There would have been no easy means however to determine the existence of these accounts and obtaining bank cooperation pre 9 11 might have been problematic The most likely means of successfully finding the men in the short time available was one not often used pre 9 11 for suspected terrorists an FBI BOLO be on the lookout combined with a media campaign This alone might have delayed or disrupted the plot even if the men had not been physically located before September 11 But this would have been considered only if the FBI believed that they were about to carry out an imminent attack No one at the FBI or any other agency believed that at the time

approved by Department of Justice attorneys before submission to the court Therefore approval from the Minneapolis U S Attorney s Office was required before a criminal search warrant could be obtained DOJ Inspector General interview of Coleen Rowley July 16 2002 Another agent however said that he spoke to an Assistant U S Attorney in the Minneapolis office and received advice that the facts were almost sufficient to obtain a criminal warrant DOJ Inspector General interview of Greg J July 9 2002 The Assistant United States Attorney said that if the FBI had asked for a criminal warrant that first night he would have sought it He believed that there was sufficient probable cause for a criminal warrant at that time DOJ Inspector General interview of William K May 29 2003 Mary Jo White the former U S Attorney for the Southern District of New York told us that based on her review of the evidence known pre 9 11 she would have approved a criminal search warrant Mary Jo White interview May 17 2004 Because the agents never presented the information to the Minneapolis U S Attorney s Office before 9 11 we cannot know for sure what its judgment would have been or whether a judge would have signed the warrant In any event the Minneapolis agents were concerned that if they tried to first obtain a criminal warrant but the U S Attorney s Office or the judge refused the FISA Court might reject an application for a FISA warrant on the grounds that the agents were attempting to make an end run around the criminal process Therefore it was judged too risky to seek a criminal warrant unless it was certain that it would be approved DOJ Inspector General interview of Greg J July 9 2002 In addition FBI headquarters specifically instructed Minneapolis that it could not open a criminal investigation DOJ IG 9 11 Report July 2 2004 p 138 Finally the Minneapolis Field Office mistakenly believed that the 1995 Attorney General procedures required OIPR s approval before it could contact

May 10 2004 In early 2001 New York provided its firefighters with new digital radios The procurement process for these radios remains controversial and they proved unpopular with the rank and file who believed that adequate training in their use had not been provided The new radios were withdrawn shortly after they had been introduced into the field While the new radios briefly were in service the WTC repeater channel could be left on at all times because the new radios operated on entirely different frequencies and thus were not vulnerable to interference from the repeater system Thomas Von

consider in determining whether and to what extent stairwell A was actually a viable exit Knowing that the stairway was initially passable from at least the 91st floor down we can conclude that it was likely open from top to bottom on floors farther removed from the impact However in areas near the impact zone some doors leading to the stairwell may have jammed We know that access to stairway A was possible from at least the 81st and 84th floors and from several other floors between the 84th and 91st floor It is likely that access was possible from floors higher up as well It is not known however whether 911 callers had a clear path to the stairwell entrance from their locations Damage caused by the impact of the plane and the resulting smoke and heat may have prevented some from being able to reach the entrance to the staircase but the stated locations of at least some callers indicate that they were near stairwell A on their floor Based on conditions described by civilians who descended stairwell A from at or above the impact zone we conclude that stairwell A may have become effectively impassable as the morning progressed 89 Commission analysis of 911 PAPD calls 90 Brian

control and coordination during an emergency response ICS provides a means to coordinate the efforts of individual agencies as they work toward the three main priorities of most emergencies life safety incident stability and property environment conservation Within ICS incident command is organized into five major components the command function the planning section the operations section the logistics section and the finance administration section When multiple agencies or jurisdictions are involved in a response ICS provides for and can evolve into a unified command with a decisionmaker

possible that a person who worked above the impact zone had not yet reached his or her office and was killed below the impact zone either by falling debris by the fireballs that exploded into the lobby or by being trapped in an elevator Individuals below the impact zone may have been killed for the same reasons Individuals may also have been killed while in the process of evacuating 201 Ironically had the towers remained up longer scores more first responders would have died Twenty six additional FDNY companies more than 150 firefighters were en route at the time of the South Tower s collapse and scores more PAPD officers on Church and Vesey were preparing to enter the towers 202 The advisory announcement directed by protocol without the expanded instruction for occupants to return to their floors would have given greater leeway to those who judged based on a firsthand awareness of conditions on their floors e g some could feel heat from North Tower explosion that evacuation was warranted In retrospect occupants would only have had to reach a point below the 77th floor to be safe 203 Appended to the directive was a list of different types of emergencies with designated Incident Commanders Terrorist incidents were subdivided according to the types of attack Conventional weapons and bomb threats were assigned to the NYPD while chemical biological and nuclear attacks designated NYPD or FDNY as the Incident Commander The directive noted The handling of a threat of a chemical or biological release or the use of conventional weapons falls to the NYPD Dealing with the consequences of the explosion or release is the responsibility of the FDNY The investigation that follows once the consequences of the event have been mitigated is the responsibility of the NYPD Any conflicts regarding the issue of Command at these incidents will be resolved by OEM New York City memo Office of the Mayor Direction and Control of Emergencies in the City of New York

Tower where he was instrumental in saving many lives after the South Tower collapsed Some FDNY units dispatched to the South Tower where they would have perished instead were mistakenly sent to the North Tower and in many cases survived 207 For the FDNY addressing these issues see generally FDNY report McKinsey Company FDNY Report Aug 19 2002 Peter Hayden interview Jan 14 2004 For the PAPD not changing standard operating procedures or training see PAPD regulations Manual of Police Division Instructions undated in existence before and after 9 11 Barry Pickard interview Nov 24 2003 208 One instance in which the FDNY NYPD rivalry may have had an impact on the total fatalities was the alleged failure of ESU officers descending past at least two firefighters after 9 59 in the North Tower to share their evacuation instructions It should be noted however that at least one firefighter has conceded that he too descended past other stationary firefighters without telling them to evacuate In addition according to one of the ESU officers and one of the firefighters in the North Tower at least some FDNY personnel were unwilling to take evacuation orders from police that morning 209 Based on more than 100 interviews we conducted and our review of 500 internal FDNY interview transcripts we conclude that out of these 32 companies all on duty members of 19 companies are likely to have known to evacuate Engine Companies 1 4 7 9 15 16 21 24 28 33 39 and 65 Ladder Companies 1 5 6 8 9 110 and Rescue 1 We also conclude that at least some members of each of five companies knew to evacuate two firefighters from Ladder Company 10 the officer of Ladder Company 20 all but the officer of Engine Company 10 at least two firefighters from Squad 18 and at least three firefighters from Engine 6 We do not know whether members of the eight other companies knew to evacuate Engine Companies 55 207 and 226 Rescue 2 3 and 4 Hazmat 1 and Squad 1 because they all died and we have come across no on point eyewitness accounts related to their operations It is very possible that at least some of these firefighters did hear the evacuation order but nevertheless failed to evacuate in the only 29 minute period between the collapse of the two towers In addition it is possible that several of the eight companies for which we have no record of their receiving evacuation instructions were in the South Tower and thus died in its earlier collapse 210 Eric Lipton A New Weapon for Firefighters New York Times May 30 2004 p 27 10 Wartime 1 All times are Eastern Daylight Time Sometime around 10 30 after the decision had already been made not to return to Washington a reported threat to Angel the code word for Air Force One was widely disseminated in the Presidential Emergency Operations Center PEOC and aboard Air Force One Notes from the morning indicate that Vice President Cheney informed President Bush in a phone conversation shortly after 10 30 that an anonymous threat had been phoned into the White House that was viewed as credible At about the same time news of the threat was conveyed on the air threat conference call The Secret Service s Intelligence Division tracked down the origin of this threat and during the day determined that it had originated in a misunderstanding by a watch officer in the White House Situation Room The director of the White House Situation Room that day disputes this account But the Intelligence Division had the primary job of running down the story and we found their witnesses on this point to be credible During the afternoon of September 11 the leadership of the Secret Service was satisfied that the reported threat to Angel was unfounded At the White House press briefing on September 12 spokesperson Ari Fleischer described the threat to Air Force One as real and credible White House transcript Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer Sept 12 2001 online at www whitehouse gov news releases 2001 09 print 20010912 8 html Fleischer told us he cited the information in good faith Indeed Fleischer had conferred with Vice President Cheney and Karen Hughes before the briefing and they had decided to let people know about the threat all of them believing it was true According to Fleischer only weeks later did he learn from press reports that the threat was unfounded We have not found any evidence that contradicts his account Ari Fleischer

coated Lower Manhattan with a thick layer of dust from the debris and fire For days a plume of smoke rose from the site Between September 11 and September 21 2001 EPA issued five press releases regarding air quality in Lower Manhattan A release on September 16 quoted the claim of the assistant secretary for labor at OSHA that tests show it is safe for New Yorkers to go back to work in New York s financial district OSHA s responsibility extends only to indoor air quality for workers however The most controversial press release on September 18 quoted EPA Administrator Christine Whitman as saying that the air was safe to breathe This statement was issued the day after the financial markets reopened The EPA Office of Inspector General investigated the issuance of these press releases and concluded that the agency did not have enough data about the range of possible pollutants other than asbestos to make a judgment lacked public health benchmarks for appropriate levels of asbestos and other pollutants and had imprecise methods for sampling asbestos in the air it also noted that more than 25 percent of the bulk dust samples collected before September 18 showed the presence of asbestos above the agency s 1 percent benchmark EPA Inspector General report EPA s Response to the World Trade Center Collapse Challenges Successes and Areas for Improvement Aug 21 2003 We do not have the expertise to examine the scientific accuracy of the pronouncements in the press releases The issue is the subject of pending civil litigation We did examine whether the White House improperly influenced the content of the press releases so that they would intentionally mislead the public The EPA press releases were coordinated with Samuel Thernstrom associate director for communications at the White House Council on Environmental Quality Oral reports interviews with EPA officials and materials on the EPA s Web site were not coordinated through the White House Although the White House review process resulted in some editorial changes to the press releases these changes were consistent with what the EPA had already been saying without White House clearance See e g David France and Erika Check Asbestos Alert How much of the chemical does the World Trade Center wreckage contain Newsweek Web Exclusive Sept 14 2001 quoting EPA Administrator Whitman as saying the air quality is not

of concern Hugo Kugiya Terrorist Attacks Asbestos Targeted in Cleanup Effort EPA s Whitman No reason for concern Newsday Sept 16 2001 p W31 Whitman says there is no reason for concern given EPA tests for asbestos There were disputes between the EPA s communications person and the White House coordinator regarding the press releases The EPA communications person said she felt extreme pressure from the White House coordinator and felt that they were no longer her press releases EPA Inspector General interview of Tina Kreisher Aug 28 2002 The White House coordinator however told us that these disputes were solely concerned with process not the actual substance of the releases Samuel Thernstrom interview Mar 31 2004 Former EPA administrator Christine Whitman agreed with the White House coordinator Christine Whitman interview June 28 2004 The documentary evidence supports this claim Although Whitman told us she spoke with White House senior economic adviser Lawrence Lindsey regarding the need to get the financial markets open quickly she denied he pressured her to declare the air was safe due to economic expediency We found no evidence of pressure on EPA to say the air was safe in order to permit the markets to reopen Moreover the most controversial release that specifically declared the air safe to breathe was released after the markets had already reopened The EPA did not have the health based benchmarks needed to assess the extraordinary air quality conditions in Lower Manhattan after 9 11 The EPA and the White House therefore improvised and applied standards developed for other circumstances in order to make pronouncements regarding air safety advising workers at Ground Zero to use protective gear and advising the general population that the air was safe Whether those improvisations were appropriate is still a subject for medical and scientific debate See EPA Inspector General report EPA s Response to the World Trade Center Collapse Aug 21 2003 pp 9

implemented the FAA s new security requirements See FAA response to Commission questions for the record June 8 2004 25 After the airspace reopened nine chartered flights with 160 people mostly Saudi nationals departed from the United States between September 14 and 24 In addition one Saudi government flight containing the Saudi deputy defense minister and other members of an official Saudi delegation departed Newark Airport on September 14 Every airport involved in these Saudi flights was open when the flight departed and no inappropriate actions were taken to allow those flights to

Another particular allegation is that a flight carrying Saudi nationals from Tampa Florida to Lexington Kentucky was allowed to fly while airspace was closed with special approval by senior U S

hence contributing to the story of a phantom flight This is another misunderstanding The FBI was initially misinformed about how the Saudis got to Lexington by a local police officer in Lexington who did not have firsthand knowledge of the matter The Bureau subsequently learned about the flight James M interview June 18 2004 26 Richard Clarke interview Jan 12 2004 27 Andrew Card meeting Mar 31

Mar 24 2004 I would love to be able to tell you who did it who brought this proposal to me but I don t know Instead the matter was handled as follows Within days of September 11 fearing reprisals against Saudi nationals Rihab Massoud the deputy chief of mission at the Saudi embassy in Washington D C called Dale Watson the FBI s assistant director for counterterrorism and asked for help in getting some of its citizens out of the country Rihab Massoud interview May 11 2004 At about the same time Michael Rolince chief of the FBI s international terrorism operations section also heard from an FBI official in Newark about a proposed flight of Saudis out of the country Michael Rolince interview June 9 2004 We believe this was the Saudi deputy defense minister s flight Rolince says he told the Newark official that the Saudis should not be allowed to leave without having the names on their passports matched to their faces and their names run through FBI case records to see whether they had surfaced before Rolince and Watson briefed Robert Mueller the director of the FBI about the issue and how they were handling it The State Department played a role as well in flights involving government officials or members of the royal family State coordinated with the FBI and FAA to allow screening by the FBI of flights with Saudi nationals on board There is no evidence that State tried to limit the screening DOS record Log of USA 9 11 Terrorist Attack Task Force Sept 13 2001 Jack S interview June 14 2004 The FBI effectively approved the Saudi flights at the level of a section chief Having an opportunity to check the Saudis was useful to the FBI This was because the U S government did not and does not routinely run checks on foreigners who are leaving the United States This procedure was convenient to the FBI as the Saudis who wished to leave in this way would gather and present themselves for record checks and interviews an opportunity that would not be available if they simply left on regularly scheduled commercial flights 28 These flights were screened by law enforcement officials primarily the FBI For example one flight the so called Bin Ladin flight departed the United States on September 20 with 26 passengers most of them relatives of Usama Bin Ladin Screening of this flight was directed by an FBI agent in the Baltimore Field Office who was also a pilot This agent coordinating with FBI headquarters sent an electronic communication to each of the field offices through which the Bin Ladin flight was scheduled to pass including the proposed flight manifest and directing what screening should occur He also monitored the flight as it moved around the country from St Louis to Los Angeles to Orlando to Washington Dulles and to Boston Logan correcting for any changes in itinerary to make sure there was no lapse in FBI screening at these locations Again each of the airports through which the Bin Ladin flight passed was open and no special restrictions were lifted to accommodate its passage James C interview June 3 2004 The Bin Ladin flight and other flights we examined were screened in accordance with policies set by FBI headquarters and coordinated through working level interagency processes Michael Rolince interview June 9 2004 Although most of the passengers were not interviewed 22 of the 26 people on the Bin Ladin flight were interviewed by the FBI Many were asked detailed questions None of the passengers stated that they had any recent contact with Usama Bin Ladin or knew anything about terrorist activity See e g FBI report of investigation interview of Mohammed Saleh Bin Laden Sept 21 2001 As Richard Clarke noted long before 9 11 the FBI was following members of the Bin Ladin family in the United States closely Richard Clarke testimony Mar 24 2004 Two of the passengers on this flight had been the subjects of preliminary investigations by the FBI but both their cases had been closed in 1999 and March 2001 respectively because the FBI had uncovered no derogatory information on either person linking them to terrorist activity Their cases remained closed as of 9 11 were not reopened before they departed the country on this flight and have not been reopened since FBI electronic communication Summary of Information Regarding Flights taken by Saudi Citizens Out of the U S Shortly After September 11 2001 Oct 29 2003 pp 9 10 29 Michael Rolince interview June 9 2004 Massoud corroborates this account He said the FBI required the names and personal information of all departing passengers sponsored for departure by the Saudi Embassy Rihab Massoud interview May 11 2004 558 NOTES TO CHAPTER 10 30 Jack S interview June 14 2004 31 The FBI checked a variety of databases for information on the Bin Ladin flight passengers and searched the aircraft Because it was not clear to us whether the TIPOFF terrorist watchlist was checked by the FBI the Terrorist Screening Center checked the names of individuals on the flight manifests of six Saudi flights against the current TIPOFF watchlist at our request prior to our hearing in April 2004 There were no matches At our request based on additional information theTerrorist Screening Center in June and July 2004 rechecked the names of individuals believed to be on these six flights the names of individuals on three more charter flights the names of individuals on the flight containing the Saudi Deputy Defense Minister and the names of Saudi nationals on commercial flights that journalists have alleged are suspect There were no matches Tim D

found any real linkages Ibid 61 President Bush told us that Clarke had mischaracterized this exchange On the evening of September 12 the President was at the Pentagon and then went to the White House

The author suggested instead hitting terrorists outside the Middle East in the initial offensive perhaps deliberately selecting a non al Qaeda target like Iraq Since U S attacks were expected in

Opening the Islamic Conference of Muslim leaders from around the world on October 16 2003 then Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad said Today we the whole Muslim ummah community of believers are

are under pressure to conform to our oppressors wishes about how we should behave how we should govern our lands how we should think even He added There is a feeling of hopelessness among the Muslim countries and their people They feel that they can do nothing right They believe that things can only get worse The Muslims will forever be oppressed and dominated by the Europeans and Jews The prime minister s argument was that the Muslims should gather their assets not striking back blindly but instead planning a thoughtful long term strategy to defeat their worldwide enemies which he argued

names of at least three of the hijackers Nawaf al Hazmi Salem al Hazmi and Khalid al Mihdhar were in information systems of the intelligence community and thus potentially could have been watchlisted Had they been watchlisted the connections to terrorism could have been exposed at the time they applied for a visa or at the port of entry The names of at least three of the hijackers Nawaf al Hazmi Salem al Hazmi and Khalid al Mihdhar were in information systems of the intelligence community and thus potentially could have been watchlisted Had they been watchlisted their terrorist affiliations could have been exposed either at the time they applied for a visa or at the port of entry Two of the hijackers Satam al Suqami and Abdul Aziz al Omari presented passports manipulated in a fraudulent manner that has subsequently been associated with al Qaeda Based on our review of their visa and travel histories we believe it possible that as many as eleven additional hijackers Wail al Shehri Waleed al Shehri Mohand al Shehri Hani Hanjour Majed Moqed Nawaf al Hazmi Hamza al Ghamdi Ahmed al Ghamdi Saeed al Ghamdi Ahmed al Nami and Ahmad al Haznawi held passports containing these same fraudulent features but their passports have not been found so we cannot be sure Khalid al Mihdhar and Salem al Hazmi presented passports with a suspicious indicator of Islamic extremism There is reason to believe that the passports of three other hijackers Nawaf al Hazmi Ahmed al Nami and Ahmad al Haznawi issued in the same Saudi passport office may have contained this same indicator however their passports have not been found so we cannot be sure 33 Khallad Bin Attash Ramzi Binalshibh Zakariya Essabar Ali Abdul Aziz Ali and Saeed al Ghamdi not the individual by the same name who became a hijacker tried to get visas and failed Kahtani was unable to prove his admissibility and withdrew his application for admission after an immigration inspector remained unpersuaded that he was a tourist All the hijackers whose visa applications we reviewed arguably could have been denied visas because their applications were not filled out completely Had State visa officials routinely had a practice of acquiring more information in such cases they likely would have found more grounds for denial For example three hijackers made statements on their visa applications that could have been proved false by U S government records Hani Hanjour Saeed al Ghamdi and Khalid al Mihdhar and many lied about their employment or educational status Two hijackers could have been denied admission at the port of entry based on violations of immigration rules governing terms of admission Mohamed Atta overstayed his tourist visa and then failed to present a proper vocational school visa when he entered in January 2001 Ziad Jarrah attended school in June 2000 without properly adjusting his immigration status an action that violated his immigration status and rendered him inadmissible on each of his six subsequent reentries into the United States between June 2000 and August 5 2001 There were possible grounds to deny entry to a third hijacker Marwan al Shehhi One hijacker violated his immigration status by failing to enroll as a student after entry Hani Hanjour two hijackers overstayed their terms of admission by four and eight months respectively Satam al Suqami and Nawaf al Hazmi

Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act Congress directed that not later than October 26 2004 the attorney general and the secretary of state issue to all non U S citizens only machine

true Program planners have set a goal of collecting information confirming identity providing information about foreign nationals throughout the entire immigration system and ultimately enabling each

Office report Border Security Improvements Needed to Reduce Time Taken to Adjudicate Visas for Science Students and Scholars Feb 2004 We do not know all the reasons why visa applications have dropped

are among the vulnerabilities exploited by terrorists possibly including two of the 9 11 hijackers Three models exist for strengthened prescreening 1 better screening by airlines such as the use of improved document authentication technology 2 posting of border agents or inspectors in foreign airports to work cooperatively with foreign counterparts and 3 establishing a full preinspection regime such as now exists for travel to the United States from Canada and Ireland All three models should be pursued in addition to electronic prescreening 40 Among the more important problems to address is that of varying transliterations of the same name For example the current lack of a single convention for transliterating Arabic names enabled the 19 hijackers to vary the spelling of their names to defeat name based watchlist systems and confuse any potential efforts to locate them While the gradual introduction of biometric identifiers will help that process will take years and a name match will always be useful The ICAO should discuss the adoption of a standard requiring a digital code for all names that need to be translated into the Roman alphabet ensuring one common spelling for all countries 41 On achieving more reliable identification see Markle Foundation task force report Creating a Trusted Information Network for Homeland Security Markle Foundation 2003 p 72 online at www

to Do It A Different Way of Organizing the Government 1 The Bush administration clarified the respective missions of the different intelligence analysis centers in a letter sent by Secretary Ridge DCITenet FBI Director Mueller andTTIC Director Brennan to Senators Susan Collins and Carl Levin on April 13 2004 The letter did not mention any element of the Department of Defense It stated that the DCI would define what analytical resources he would transfer from the CTC to TTIC no later than June 1 2004 DCI Tenet subsequently told us that he decided that TTIC would have primary responsibility for terrorism analysis but that the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency would grow their own analysts TTIC will have tasking authority over terrorism analysts in other intelligence agencies although there will need to be a board to supervise deconfliction George Tenet interview July 2 2004 We have not received any details regarding this plan 2 TTIC has no operational authority However TTIC has the authority to task collection and analysis from Intelligence Community agencies the FBI and DHS through tasking mechanisms we will create The analytic work conducted at TTIC creates products that inform each of TTIC s partner elements as well as other Federal departments and agencies as appropriate Letter from Ridge and others to Collins and Levin Apr 13 2004 3 Donald Rumsfeld prepared statement Mar 23 2004 p 20 4 In this conception the NCTC should plan actions assigning responsibilities for operational direction and execution to other agencies It would be built on TTIC and would be supported by the intelligence community as TTIC is now Whichever route is chosen the scarce analytical resources now dispersed amongTTIC the Defense Intelligence Agency s Joint Interagency Task Force Combatting Terrorism JITF CT and the DCI s Counterterrorist Center CTC should be concentrated more effectively than they are now The DCI s Counterterrorist Center would become a CIA unit to handle the direction and execution of tasks assigned to the CIA It could have detailees from other agencies as it does now to perform this operational mission It would yield much of the broader strategic analytic duties and personnel to the NCTC The CTC would rely on the restructured CIA discussed in section 13 2 to organize train and equip its personnel Similarly the FBI s Counterterrorism Division would remain as now the operational arm of the Bureau to combat terrorism As it does now it would work with other agencies in carrying out these missions retaining the JTTF structure now in place The Counterterrorism Division would rely on the FBI s Office of Intelligence to train and equip its personnel helping to process and report the information gathered in the field The Defense Department s unified commands SOCOM NORTHCOM and CENTCOM would be the joint operational centers taking on DOD tasks Much of the excellent analytical talent that has been assembled in the Defense Intelligence Agency s JITF CT should merge into the planned NCTC The Department of Homeland Security s Directorate for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection should retain its core duties but the NCTC should have the ultimate responsibility for producing net assessments that utilize Homeland Security s analysis of domestic vulnerabilities and integrate all source analysis of foreign intelligence about the terrorist enemy The State Department s counterterrorism office would be a critical participant in the NCTC s work taking the lead in directing the execution of the counterterrorism foreign policy mission The proposed National Counterterrorism Center should offer one stop shopping to agencies with counterterrorism and homeland security responsibilities That is it should be an authoritative reference base on the transnational terrorist organizations their people goals strategies capabilities networks of contacts and support the context in which they operate and their characteristic habits across the life cycle of operations recruitment reconnaissance target selection logistics and travel For example this Center would offer an integrated depiction of groups like al Qaeda or Hezbollah worldwide overseas and in the United States The NCTC will not eliminate the need for the executive departments to have their own analytic units But it would enable agency based analytic units to become smaller and more efficient In particular it would make it possible for these agency based analytic units to concentrate on analysis that is tailored to their agency s specific responsibilities A useful analogy is in military intelligence There the Defense Intelligence Agency and the service production agencies like the Army s National Ground Intelligence Center are the institutional memory and reference source for enemy order of battle enemy organization and enemy equipment Yet the Joint Staff and all the theater commands still have their own J 2s They draw on the information they need tailoring and applying it to their operational needs As they learn more from their tactical operations they pass intelligence of enduring value back up to the Defense Intelligence Agency and the services so it can be evaluated form part of the institutional memory and help guide future collection In our proposal that reservoir of institutional memory about terrorist organizations would function for the government as a whole and would be in the NCTC 5 The head of the NCTC would thus help coordinate the operational side of these agencies like the FBI s Counterterrorism Division The intelligence side of these agencies such as the FBI s Office of Intelligence would be overseen by the National Intelligence Director we recommend later in this chapter 6 The quotation goes on It includes gaps in intelligence but also intelligence that like a string of pearls too precious to wear is too sensitive to give to those who need it It includes the alarm that fails to work but also the alarm that has gone off so often it has been disconnected It includes the unalert watchman but also the one who knows he ll be chewed out by his superior if he gets higher authority out of bed It includes the contingencies that occur to no one but also those that everyone assumes somebody else is taking care of It includes straightforward procrastination but also decisions protracted by internal disagreement It includes in addition the inability of individual human beings to rise to the occasion until they are sure it is the occasion which is usually too late

Ibid For the DCI and the attorney general see 50 U S C 403 6 b 3 11 The new program would replace the existing National Foreign Intelligence Program 12 Some smaller parts of the current intelligence community such as the State Department s intelligence bureau and the Energy Department s intelligence entity should not be funded out of the national intelligence program and should be the responsibility of their home departments 13 The head of the NCTC should have the rank of a deputy national intelligence director e g Executive Level II but would have a different title 14 If the organization of defense intelligence remains as it is now the appropriate official would be the under secretary of defense for intelligence If defense intelligence is reorganized to elevate the responsibilities of the director of the DIA then that person might be the appropriate official 15 For the information technology architecture see Ruth David interview June 10 2003 For the necessity of moving from need to know to need to share see James Steinberg testimony Oct 14 2003 The Director still has no strategy for removing information sharing barriers and more than two years since 9 11 has only appointed a working group on the subject George Tenet prepared statement Mar 24 2004 p 37 16 The intelligence community currently makes information shareable by creating tearline reports with the nonshareable information at the top and then below the tearline the portion that recipients are told they can share This proposal reverses that concept All reports are created as tearline data with the shareable information at the top and with added details accessible on a system that requires permissions or authentication 17 See Markle FoundationTask Force report Creating aTrusted Information
