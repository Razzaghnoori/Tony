 Background Rates of protein evolution vary greatly and may be influenced by a variety of factors Recently it has been demonstrated that the magnitude of the fitness effects associated with deleterious mutations in protein coding genes i e proteins dispensability correlates with rates of protein evolution 1 2 Essential proteins or those that are less dispensable to an organism tend to evolve slower than those that are more dispensable It has also been suggested that proteins evolutionary rates are determined by the proportion of amino acids that are critical to their function 3 According to this intuitively plausible notion proteins with a greater fraction of amino acid residues that play an essential role in the protein s function are predicted to evolve slower than those with a smaller fraction of such crucial residues Consistent with this prediction a negative correlation has been reported between protein evolutionary rates which were determined from evolutionary distances between orthologous proteins from yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the number of protein protein interactions i e physical interactions determined primarily using the yeast two hybrid system proteins are involved in 4 Yeast proteins that have a large number of interacting partners were found to have evolved slower on average than those with fewer interacting partners and this was presumed to be due to the fact that proteins with more interacting partners have a greater fraction of residues directly involved in function However these same data indicate that less than 6 of the variance in evolutionary rates is explained by the variance in the number of protein protein interactions suggesting that the influence of the number of interacting partners on protein evolutionary rates might not be substantial We sought to further investigate this phenomenon by examining the relationship between the number of protein protein interacting partners and protein evolutionary rates for the yeasts S cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe as well as for the proteobacteria Helicobacter pylori and Camplyobacter jejuni Results and Discussion Evolutionary rates and protein protein interactions yeast A total of 1 879 pairs of orthologous proteins one from S cerevisiae and one from S pombe were identified see Methods and for 1 004 of these there was data on protein protein interactions of the S cerevisiae member in the MIPS database 5 For these 1 004 orthologous pairs the number of protein protein interactions detected for the S cerevisiae protein was plotted against the calculated substitution rates between orthologs Figure 1a As with a previous survey that compared conserved S cerevisiae and C elegans orthologs 4 there is a negative correlation between the number of protein protein interactions and the evolutionary rates However although this correlation is statistically significant Table 1 the slope of the linear trend line y 0 012 fit to the data by least squares regression as well as the small r 2value r 2 0 0065 suggest that the influence of the number of interacting partners on rates of evolution is minor at best Specifically the r 2value indicates that less than 1 of the variation in substitution rates between orthologous proteins is explained by the variation in the number of protein protein interactions Furthermore when only the most conserved 40 sequence identity and thus most reliably identified pairs of orthologous proteins were considered the slope of the linear trend line as well as the r 2value decreased and the statistical significance disappeared Figure 1band Table 1 To account for the possibility that linear regression does not adequately reflect the structure of the data and the observed low correlation is due to a non linear relationship between the number of interactions and evolutionary rate of a protein we also calculated the rank correlation coefficients for these quantities Under this approach no statistically significant correlation was observed for either of the two analysed data sets Table 1 It is tempting to speculate that the difference between the results obtained here and those reported previously 4 can be attributed to the difference in the evolutionary relationships between the pairs of species compared in the two studies The species compared here S cerevisiae and S pombe are much more closely related than S cerevisiae and C elegans and orthologous proteins are likely to be more reliably inferred between the closely related genomes However we also performed comparisons for pairs of orthologous proteins identified between the more distantly related S cerevisiae and C elegans 6 and no significant relationship between evolutionary rates and protein protein interactions was observed data not shown Long term evolutionary conservation and protein protein interactions yeast To examine the relationship between protein protein interactions and evolutionary conservation of proteins over longer periods of time the numbers of interactions for S cerevisiae proteins were assessed against the taxonomic distribution of their homologs which were detected using BLAST searches of the Genbank non redundant protein database with expect value 10 3 Five distinct levels of taxonomic distribution categories each including taxa that are successively more distant from S cerevisiae were considered 1 hits only to ascomycetes 2 hits to non ascomycete fungi 3 hits to metazoa and plants 4 hits to non crown group eukaryotes 5 hits to archaea and or bacteria The broader the taxonomic distribution of homologs of a S cerevisiae protein the more evolutionarily conserved it is considered to be Each S cerevisiae protein was assigned a taxonomic distribution category and this value was compared to the number of protein protein interactions reported for the given protein Correlation between these two features of S cerevisiae proteins was not statistically significant r 2 0 007 p 0 39 Thus as with the comparison between evolutionary rates and the number of interactions no substantial relationship between long term evolutionary conservation of S cerevisiae proteins and the number of interactions was found Evolutionary rates and protein protein interactions bacteria High throughput analysis of protein protein interactions has also been conducted 7 on the proteobacterium H pylori the causative agent of gastric ulcers for which complete genome sequences of two strains are available 8 9 Thus it is possible to assess the effect of protein protein interactions on the rates of evolution over much shorter periods of time within species compared to the analysis of the yeast proteins described above Towards this end orthologs between the two completely sequenced H pylori strains were identified and the substitution rates between pairs of orthologous proteins were calculated see Methods The number of protein protein interactions was plotted against the amino acid substitution rates and no significant relationship between the two was detected Figure 2aand Table 1 The same conclusion was reached when the rank correlation coefficient was determined Table 1 In this case the lack of correlation between evolutionary rates and the number of interacting partners might simply be due to the small amount of evolutionary diversification that has occurred since the two H pylori strains separated from their common ancestor To evaluate this possibility orthologous protein pairs were identified between H pylori and a more distantly related bacterium C jejuni 10 These two species are close enough both belong to the epsilon subdivision of proteobacteria to ensure accurate identification of orthologs but distant enough for substantial sequence divergence to have accumulated between orthologs Nevertheless comparison between these two bacteria showed no discernable correlation between the number of protein protein interactions and the rates of substitution between orthologs measured either directly or using the rank correlation approach Figure 2band Table 1 Yeast proteins with the greatest number of interactions appear to evolve slowly The observations described above seem to indicate that the number of interaction partners a given protein has does not make an important contribution to the evolutionary rate One could speculate however that whatever minor correlation is seen Fig 1a 2a is not spread evenly as a miniscule difference in the evolutionary rates among all proteins but rather reflects a substantial slowdown of evolution among a small fraction of proteins that have the greatest number of interactions To test this hypothesis we grouped proteins from S cerevisiae and H pylori into separate bins with each bin containing proteins whose number of interactions fell within a given range Comparison of the evolutionary rates for proteins in different bins showed that yeast proteins in the bins with the greatest number of interactions on average evolved slower than the bulk of the proteins Fig 3a The difference was less than twofold even for the top bin but was statistically significant for each of the top three bins or their combination Table 2 The proteins with a large number of interactions placed in the top bins comprise only 6 5 of the yeast proteins In contrast for the bulk of the proteins which have a small to moderate number of interactions there did not seem to be any dependence at all between the number of interactions and the evolutionary rates Fig 3a H pylori proteins with the greatest number of interactions also appear to have evolved slower on average between strains than the majority of the proteins However the difference was not significant and this effect was not seen in the comparison of H pylori and C jejuni orthologs Table 2and Fig 3b 3c Discussion and conclusions The hypothesis that a protein s rate of evolution is determined by the fraction of residues that are critical to its function and this in turn is likely to be proportional to the number of interactions a protein is involved in seems to make perfectly good sense Indeed a recent report is consistent with this idea in suggesting that the number of protein protein interactions significantly affects rates of evolution 4 However upon investigation of this relationship at multiple levels of evolutionary relatedness we found that there was only a slight correlation at best between evolutionary rates and the number of protein protein interactions In fact examination of the actual data presented in support of the previous claim of a connection between the number of interactions and evolutionary rates 4 also shows a weak correlation albeit greater than the one observed in this study Thus differences in the number of interaction partners seem to explain at best only a small part of the great variation of the evolutionary rates of proteins encoded in each genome 11 Why does the number of interaction partners apparently have only a slight effect on the evolutionary rate The first and most obvious possibility to consider would be that the low quality of protein protein interaction data might obscure the signal Indeed a recent comparison of protein protein interaction data sets from high throughput studies suggested that more than half of all interactions determined by large scale experiments are likely to be false positives 12 However at least for the yeast data we relied on manually curated protein protein interaction data from the MIPS database which are expected to have a substantially lower error rate Second one could speculate that even if the majority of the analyzed interactions actually do occur they are selectively nearly neutral the number of such real but functionally irrelevant interactions would not affect the rate of evolution Third the possibility exists that even if many of the observed interactions are functionally important and by inference the respective binding sites are subject to purifying selection the binding sites for different partners tend to overlap such that the number of amino residues in these sites increases only slowly with the increase in the numbers of interactions The latter two possibilities are not incompatible with each other and with the other aspect of the observations reported here We found that the small fraction of yeast proteins that have the greatest number of interaction partners do on average evolve slower than the bulk of the proteins which are involved in a moderate or small number of interactions This effect was less pronounced if observed at all for H pylori but it has to be noticed that the top bins of the H pylori interaction data included proteins with fewer interactions than the respective bins in the yeast data compare Fig 3b 3cand 3a Protein protein interactions form scale free networks which show the characteristic power law distribution of the node degrees simply put there is a small number of highly connected proteins hubs whereas the majority have a small number of partners the most abundant class are proteins that are involved in just one interaction 13 14 Scale free networks are highly tolerant to error elimination of nodes at random but are vulnerable to attack i e elimination of the hubs 15 and indeed it has been found that the most highly connected proteins in yeast interaction networks tend to be essential 13 This might explain the present findings namely that a small number of yeast protein protein interaction hubs evolve slowly due to strong purifying selection whereas for the great majority of the proteins there is no discernible connection between the number of interactions and evolutionary rates Methods Comparison of evolutionary rates and protein protein interactions Sets of protein sequences encoded by the complete genome sequences of the yeasts S cerevisiae 16 and S pombe 17 the
