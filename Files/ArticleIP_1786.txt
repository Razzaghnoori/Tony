 So You Want to Immigrate to the United States The United States a nation of immigrants has a love hate relationship with newcomers Despite its reputation as an international melting pot only 7 9 percent of the country s population was born overseas compared with 22 7 percent of Australia s 18 5 percent of Switzerland s and 16 1 percent of Canada s Not surprisingly the immigration system is set up to benefit the United States only a small percentage of the people who would like to come here are allowed in and only a tiny fraction of the ones who make that cut are allowed to stay indefinitely In the 1996 fiscal year almost 23 million foreigners entered the United States on tourist visas 418 117 on student visas and 227 440 as temporary workers with extremely restricted temporary work visas most are seasonal workers only 65 000 people are allowed in annually as persons in a specialty occupation In FY 1996 915 900 people received an immigrant visa a green card it s actually pink which makes them eligible for permanent residence and most of the benefits of citizenship with the important exception of the right to vote Who Gets a Green Card In 1996 596 000 people 65 percent of all green card recipients were family sponsored immigrants About half were immediate relatives of U S citizens spouses 56 percent parents 22 percent and children 21 percent and the rest were family sponsored preference immigrants spouses and children of alien residents siblings and their families of naturalized citizens and their families and adult sons and daughters and their families of naturalized citizens Homosexuality ceased to be grounds for exclusion from the United States in 1991 but since gay and lesbian couples cannot legally marry in this country there is currently no legal way for them to benefit from family preference laws Employment based preferences account for an annual minimum of 140 000 entrants of whom a maximum of 10 000 may be unskilled workers There are basically five categories of work related preferences skilled workers priority workers including multinational executives or managers and outstanding professors or researchers professionals with advanced degrees investors or employment creators and unskilled workers Since 1991 there has been an annual lottery for diversity immigrants designed to allow citizens of countries with low levels of emigration to the United States to jump the queue Such countries are currently defined as those with fewer than 50 000 emigrants to the United States in the previous five years The 1999 lottery with 55 000 green cards up for grabs closed Nov 24 1997 This page provides more details The dates for next year s diversity visa lottery haven t yet been determined Within these complex categories there are national quotas to ensure that no country can take up more than 7 percent of the annual green card allocation though some family reunification categories are exempted from this limit What s the Difference Between a Resident Alien and a U S Citizen Until recently millions of green card holders were content to live in the United States as resident aliens But of late lawmakers have indicated a change of attitude toward legal immigrants and this has affected the number of applications for citizenship A 1996 federal welfare law separated rights from entitlements denying legal immigrants access to government housing and welfare while still requiring them to pay taxes This loss of benefits has almost certainly precipitated the jump from the long standing annual average of 300 000 citizenship applications to 1 6 million in 1996 Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates show that 5 8 million of the 10 5 million green card holders resident in the United States in 1996 were eligible to apply for U S citizenship I Won the Lottery How Do I Become a Citizen Candidates for citizenship must 1 be 18 or older 2 have resided in the United States continuously for five years or three years if married to a U S citizen short absences are OK 3 demonstrate the ability to speak English and a basic knowledge of American history and government click here to see if you pass the test and 4 be of good moral character Candidates must submit a set of fingerprints for review by the FBI The increase in citizenship applications has led to longer processing periods and according to critics to some immigrants being wrongly naturalized In May 1997 an INS audit of the 1 1 million people who were granted citizenship between September 1995 and September 1996 revealed 4 946 cases in which criminal arrest should have disqualified an applicant or in which an applicant lied about his or her criminal history A more recent press release from the INS suggests that the agency has made a dramatic turnaround as a result of new policies initiated last June Evading the System According to INS estimates 300 000 illegal immigrants come to the United States each year and there were 5 million illegal immigrants living in the country in 1996 About 2 1 million of this group are nonimmigrant overstays that is people who entered the country legally on a temporary basis and didn t go home Most illegal immigrants an estimated 2 7 million come from Mexico but only 16 percent of Mexican illegal immigrants are overstays compared with 26 percent of those from other parts of Central America and 91 percent from all other countries The INS deported 111 794 criminal and other illegal aliens in 1997 and recent changes in the law summarized here establish new grounds for denying admission to the United States For example nonimmigrant overstays can now be denied readmission for up to 10 years Access to jobs attracts illegal immigrants Although the INS negotiated its largest work site settlement last year when a Texas restaurant chain agreed to pay a 1 7 million fine for hiring and employing illegal immigrant workers critics claim that Congress doesn t do enough to punish employers who make extensive use of illegal labor Unscrupulous employers see these workers as more manageable and less likely to complain Despite regulations that punish employers who knowingly employ them pressure from business groups like the National Federation of Independent Business and the National Restaurant Association scuttled an attempt to include computer verification of employee eligibility in the 1996 immigration bill What About Refugees A fact sheet prepared by the State Department s Bureau of Population Refugees and Migration outlines the U S refugee policy Around 120 000 refugees are allowed into the country each year if they flee their country due to persecution or a well founded fear of persecution because of race religion nationality political opinion or membership in a particular social group Recent changes in the law prohibit asylum applications from persons who have been in the United States for more than a year Cuban pitchers are also offered refuge unless they can get a better deal in the Bahamas of course
