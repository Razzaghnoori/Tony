 Jeffrey Toobin Hypocrite Part III It s one of those gifts that keeps on giving New evidence of Jeffrey Toobin s hypocrisy in his book A Vast Conspiracy arrives almost daily Today s installment focuses on the aspersions Toobin casts on Michael Isikoff whose reporting of the Flytrap scandal won a National Magazine Award for Newsweek Toobin writes that greed in the form of a desire to write books about the president s sex life motivated Isikoff and other Clinton enemies to act as they did In a deceptively crafted passage on pages 130 131 Toobin quotes a September 1997 Linda Tripp tape in which Tripp says that Isikoff was working on a book deal He s doing an all the president s women kind of deal Toobin then flatly asserts Isikoff was using Tripp as a source for the book project he had started with Glenn Simpson of The Wall Street Journal who had by this point dropped out of the project Isikoff had apparently even shared the working title of his volume with Tripp as he had with others the title according to Toobin being All the President s Women Toobin then blasts Isikoff for trying to talk Tripp into cooperating with him According to Tripp Isikoff told her If I were to uh work with you and you know allow some of this to get out into the mainstream media then that would set you up for a book contract Toobin writes If events unfolded as Tripp said they did this was dubious ethical territory for the reporter If Isikoff and Tripp were both stoking the story so they could profit from it in the form of book deals and not disclosing that fact to Isikoff s readers as he had not in his August story that would have been inappropriate to say the least Likewise it would have been wrong for him to advise Tripp on how to position herself in the marketplace of Clinton sex books In the book that he did write on the case which was entitled Uncovering Clinton Isikoff claimed that Tripp invented this conversation with him If she did it is curious that Tripp knew the precise title of Isikoff s planned book moreover Tripp was obviously not lying about her own interest in writing a book There are many many things wrong with Toobin s argument First note the clever use of the word if in the second sentence If Isikoff had been writing a book he might be accused of mercenary motives But Isikoff says he wasn t writing a book He confirms in Uncovering Clinton and to me that he had talked about co writing a book with Simpson but says that they had dropped this idea over a month before the Tripp tape after Matt Drudge ran a screaming headline suggesting that Isikoff was holding back juicy Kathleen Willey details which even Toobin concedes he wasn t for a book Indeed Toobin himself 17 pages before the above passage writes that after the mid summer Drudge headline Isikoff and Glenn Simpson decided to put All the President s Women aside for a while What evidence does Toobin have that Isikoff isn t telling the truth and that the while had ended by September with Isikoff back to using Tripp as a source for a book as opposed to reporting a possible article for Newsweek Well Isikoff had told Tripp the precise title of his book Except that Toobin got the title wrong The title of Isikoff and Simpson s proposed book according to both Isikoff and Simpson was Secrets and Lies not All the President s Women The notion that Mike and I would be so lame as to use a clich like All The President s Women is perhaps the most insulting part of Toobin s mistake says Simpson Simpson also told me that after Drudge s report Isikoff was fairly petrified that he would be pulled into a conflicted situation and that their book project was most emphatically dropped Isn t it likely that Tripp had simply read the Drudge Report and erroneously believed that Isikoff was working on a book Given that what was so terrible about what Isikoff is alleged to have told Tripp He told her she shouldn t publish her story herself but that she should let him have it In other words he s trying to talk a source into giving a story to him and his employer That s what reporters do and what they re paid to do What s so terrible about writing a book anyway As Isikoff says Any big story can always turn into a book A reporter would have to be a moron not to have that thought somewhere in the back of his or her mind Maybe Toobin is right to think that such incentives did not even exist a generation ago although I suspect the incentives do more to bring out relevant truths than distort them and it s not at all clear that prior to Clinton the incentives even applied books about the president s sex life Bob Woodward got rich off Watergate But what journalist got rich writing about Nixon s sex life or Ford s or Carter s or Bush s or Gary Hart s for that matter It s easy to believe that Isikoff would have done exactly what he did even if his only possible publication outlet was Newsweek and his only remuneration his salary since all of his reporting was supervised and supported by his Newsweek editors Toobin is of course being massively hypocritical here given that he too is now profiting from enclosing his reporting in hard covers How dare Isikoff write a book says Toobin in his book Was Toobin s own judgment distorted by his presumably large Random House advance Has he donated the money to charity In fact kausfiles has learned after the Monica story broke in early 1998 Random House approached Isikoff who had no deal in the works to write a book about it but then backed off because Toobin a big name Random author was already interested in doing one himself It gets worse In May of 1998 according to Isikoff when both he and Toobin had publishing deals Toobin actually proposed over lunch that he and Isikoff join forces and co author their Clinton books At that point of course most of what Toobin now criticizes in Isikoff s reporting including the role of Clinton s enemies in advancing the scandal was well known If Isikoff was such a disreputable sleazemonger why would Toobin want to write a book with him A Newsday story on this incident reports that Toobin said through a Random House spokesman that Isikoff had approached him Isikoff insists it was the other way around he d invited Toobin to lunch but only to pump him for info on Dennis Kirkland one of Paula Jones detractors He remembers being surprised when Toobin suggested they write the book together I believe Isikoff on this Neither Toobin nor Random House returned my repeated calls Anyway whoever suggested the arrangement Toobin doesn t deny considering it for at least a day Why if Isikoff s so bad And shouldn t Toobin by his own standards have disclosed his book dealings with Isikoff to Vast Conspiracy readers There s more Let s not forget that Toobin the man who now decries the baleful influence of book deals first made his mark betraying Iran Contra special counsel Lawrence Walsh for whom he worked as a lawyer by quitting to publish a book about the case before it was even over There s not enough room on Slate s server to fully analyze Toobin s possible psychological motives for indulging in the ridiculous innuendoes of A Vast Conspiracy But one is obvious he s projecting P S Isikoff as I ve written earlier is a friend of mine In my experience he s honest and conscientious Am I motivated to criticize Toobin in part by a desire to defend Isikoff from the slime in Vast Conspiracy You bet But I wouldn t do it if I wasn t convinced Isikoff is right and Toobin wrong I m not that loyal a friend
