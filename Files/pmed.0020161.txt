 Introduction Embryonic stem ES cells are pluripotent cells derived from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst that can be maintained in culture for an extended period of time without losing differentiation potential The successful isolation of human ES cells hESCs has raised the hope that these cells may provide a universal tissue source to treat many human diseases However directed differentiation of hESCs into specific tissue types poses a formidable challenge Protocols are currently available for only a few cell types mostly of neural identity 1 3 and differentiation into many of the cell types derived from the paraxial mesoderm has not been reported with the exception of a recent study indicating osteoblastic differentiation 4 Mesenchymal stem cells MSCs have been isolated from the adult bone marrow 5 adipose tissue 6 and dermis and other connective tissues 7 Harvesting MSCs from any of these sources requires invasive procedures and the availability of a suitable donor The number of MSCs that can be obtained from a single donor is limited and the capacity of these cells for long term proliferation is rather poor In contrast hESCs could provide an unlimited number of specialized cells In this study we present techniques for the generation and purification of mesenchymal precursors from hESCs and their directed differentiation in vitro into various mesenchymal derivatives including skeletal myoblasts Our isolation method for mesenchymal precursors is the first example to our knowledge of efficiently deriving structures of the paraxial mesoderm from ES cells and further highlights the potential of hESCs for basic biology and regenerative medicine Methods Cell Culture and FACS Undifferentiated hESCs H1 WA 01 XY passages 40 65 and H9 WA 09 XX passages 35 45

Differentiation Confluent hESMPCs were maintained for 2 3 wk in alpha MEM medium with 20 heat inactivated FBS More rapid induction was observed in the presence of medium conditioned for 24 h by

1 hESMPC H1 2 and three samples of undifferentiated hESCs H1 passages 42 46 were processed by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Genomics Core Facility and hybridized on Affymetrix Santa Clara California United States U133A human oligonucleotide arrays Data were analyzed using MAS5 0 Affymetrix software Transcripts selectively expressed in each of the mesenchymal cell populations MSC hESMPC H9 1 and hESMPC H1 2 were defined as those called increased by the MAS5 0 algorithm in each of three comparisons with independent samples of undifferentiated hESCs A Venn diagram was generated to visualize overlap in gene expression Further statistical analyses were performed as described below Results Mesenchymal differentiation of hESCs lines H1 WA 01 and H9 WA 09 9 was induced by plating undifferentiated hESCs on a monolayer of murine OP9 stromal cells 10 in the presence of 20 heat inactivated FBS in alpha MEM medium OP9 cells have been previously shown to induce blood cell differentiation from mouse ES cells 11 After 40 d of coculture cells were harvested and sorted by FACS for CD73 a surface marker expressed in adult MSCs 5 Figure 1A An average of 5 CD73 cells was obtained from the mixed culture of OP9 and differentiated hESC progeny CD73 cells were replated in the absence of stromal feeders on tissue culture plates and expanded in alpha MEM medium with 20 FBS for 7 14 d We next established the membrane antigen profile of the resulting population of flat spindle like cells The H1 and H9 derived CD73 cells expressed a comprehensive set of markers that are considered to define adult MSCs including CD105 SH2 STRO 1 VCAM CD106 CD29 integrin 1 CD44 ICAM 1 CD54 ALCAM CD166 vimentin and alpha smooth muscle actin Figure 1B and 1C The cells were negative for hematopoietic markers such as CD34 CD45 and CD14 They were also negative for neuroectodermal epithelial and muscle cell markers including nestin pancytokeratin and desmin data not shown The human identity of these presumed mesenchymal cells termed hESMPC H1 1 H1 2 H1 3 H1 4 and H9 1 was confirmed for all experiments by immunocytochemistry for human nuclear antigen to rule out the possibility of contamination with OP9 cells Figure S1 To further characterize hESMPCs we performed genome wide expression analysis using oligonucleotide arrays Affymetrix U133A The expression profiles of hESMPC H1 2 and hESMPC H9 1 were compared with that of human primary adult MSCs Housekeeping genes for each of the mesenchymal cell populations were eliminated by subtracting those transcripts also expressed in at least one of three independent samples of undifferentiated hESCs Based on this analysis 1 280 transcripts were selectively expressed in hESMPC H1 2 932 transcripts in hESMPC H9 1 and 1 218 transcripts in primary adult MSCs A remarkable overlap of 579 transcripts shared among the three mesenchymal populations was observed Figure 1D Using the genes that were selected in the initial filter we performed a statistical analysis on the expression levels to determine whether the genes were expressed significantly differently in the two cell types We used a Bayesian extension to the standard t test 12 to assess this difference Of the 579 genes 412 of them were significantly different at a false discovery rate cutoff of 0 05 The relative fold changes were also extremely large in many of the cases We also looked at the variance of the expression levels within the cell types For the MSCs 94 had a coefficient of variation less than 20 for the expression log transformed for the ES derived cells 72 had a coefficient of variation less than 20 Numerous known MSC markers were included in the list of 412 genes such as the mesenchymal stem cell protein DSC54 13 9 fold increase p 0 001 neuropilin 1 30 4 fold increase p 0 001 hepatocyte growth factor 48 1 fold increase p 0 001 forkhead box D1 14 8 fold increase p 0 001 and notch homolog 2 2 9 fold increase p 0 001 Table S2 lists the p values from the test the mean and standard deviation of the expression levels and the relative fold change of all 412 genes between the two types Known markers of MSCs such as mesenchymal stem cell protein DSC54 were all included within the 579 shared transcripts These findings support the immunocytochemical data and suggest that hESMPCs and primary MSCs are highly related MSCs are characterized functionally by their ability to differentiate into mesenchymal tissues such as fat cartilage and bone Therefore we tested whether hESMPCs have the same potential Figure 2 Adipocytic differentiation of hESMPCs was induced under conditions described previously for primary adult MSCs 5 Appearance of cells harboring fat granules was observed after 10 14 d in culture After 3 wk of induction more than 70 of the cells displayed Oil Red O fat granules and PPAR a marker of adipocytic differentiation was detected by RT PCR Figure 2A Chondrocytic differentiation was achieved using the pellet culture system 5 After 28 d in culture more than 50 of all cells exhibited robust staining for Alcian Blue a marker specific for extracellular matrix proteoglycans Chondrocytic differentiation was confirmed by the gene expression of collagen II and aggrecan two components of extracellular matrix selectively expressed by chondrocytes using RT PCR Figure 2B Osteogenic differentiation was induced in the presence of glycerolphosphate 5 Osteogenesis was demonstrated by specific staining for calcium deposition in the matrix von Kossa Figure 2C or Alizarin Red Figure S2A and increased expression of bone specific alkaline phosphatase and bone sialoprotein at day 28 of treatment Figures 2C and S2B At day 28 Alizarin Red staining was detected in approximately 70 of all cells Throughout these studies human adult MSCs and foreskin fibroblasts were used as positive and negative controls respectively In addition to adipocytic chondrocytic and osteogenic differentiation reports suggested that adult MSCs can form skeletal muscle 13 Although generation of skeletal muscle cells from adult MSCs remains controversial we tested whether hESMPCs exhibit this potential Under the conditions previously described 13 hESMPC H1 1 and H9 1 did not yield significant numbers of MyoD cells after 15 20 d in culture However when confluent cells were maintained in culture in the presence or absence of 5 AzaC without passage for more than 21 d expression of specific skeletal muscle markers such as MyoD and fast switch myosin was observed Figure 3A More rapid myogenic differentiation was obtained in the presence of 24 h conditioned medium from the murine myoblastic cell line C2C12 previously induced to form myotubes 14 Direct coculture of hESMPCs with C2C12 cells led to the formation of hESMPC derived myotubes as visualized by expression of human nuclear antigen Figure 3B similar to those formed by host C2C12 cells After 1 wk of coculture myotubes composed of human nuclei accounted for more than 10 of the total number of human cells present and each human myotube was composed of up to ten human nuclei Human cell contribution to myotubes in coculture was confirmed by expression of human muscle specific transcripts such as MyoD myosin heavy chain IIa and myogenin data not shown These data demonstrate that hESMPCs can give rise to mesenchymal derivatives typically obtained from primary adult MSCs as well as to cells expressing markers of skeletal muscle One concern for the clinical application of hESC derived progeny in regenerative medicine is the risk of teratoma formation due to the presence of residual undifferentiated ES cells among the differentiated progeny We did not detect markers of undifferentiated hESCs such as Nanog 15 or Oct 4 16 in any of the hESMPCs by RT PCR see Figure 2D and immunocytochemistry data not shown suggesting the lack of any undifferentiated ES cells in hESMPC cultures However future in vivo studies are required to rule out the potential of these cells for teratoma formation Discussion Previous studies have demonstrated the derivation of neural cells 1 3 hematopoietic 17 and endothelial lineages 18 and cardiomyocytes 19 from hESCs This study presents the induction of paraxial mesoderm with the generation of multipotent mesenchymal precursors We calculate that under these conditions a single undifferentiated hESC yields an average of one CD73 cell at day 40 of differentiation suggesting a balance between cell proliferation and cell selection There were no obvious differences in marker and gene expression profile or in differentiation behavior among the five hESMPC lines generated However some of the lines e g hESMPC9 1 exhibited a tendency of spontaneous osteogenic differentiation after long term propagation Directed differentiation of hESCs into somatic stem cell like precursors represents a substantial advancement in harnessing the developmental potential of hESCs The high purity unlimited availability and multipotentiality of hESMPCs will provide the basis for future therapeutic efforts using these cells in preclinical animal models of disease Such in vivo studies will also be required to properly assess the safety profile of these cells Furthermore our system also offers a novel platform to study basic mechanisms of mesodermal
