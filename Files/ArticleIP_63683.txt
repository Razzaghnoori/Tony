 The Greene Mile Ralph Fiennes makes me think of a line from A Midsummer Night s Dream That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow His piercing blue eyes signal anger or torment while his manner stays glassy and querulous This aloof slightly inhuman mix of traits somehow suited both the insubstantial martyr of Quiz Show 1994 and the Nazi sadist of Schindler s List 1993 In the latter his deep voice sounded great with a German accent at once oily and metallic But Fiennes is truly in his odd element as a Graham Greene hero in Neil Jordan s fluid adaptation of The End of the Affair He plays Maurice Bendrix a self centered novelist who embarks on an opportunistic but increasingly incendiary romance with Sarah Julianne Moore the wife of a bland civil servant named Henry Miles Stephen Rea This happens during the London blitzkrieg and the German bombs both heighten the passion all rules are suspended and underscore the hopelessness As Maurice becomes more possessive Sarah begins the inexorable Graham Greene ian drift into self abnegating Catholicism Fiennes is superb at jealousy and even better when he has to fulminate at something so intangible and yet to Greene so irrefutable as the existence of God He looks enraged at having reached the limit of his spiritual resources and his haggard self doubt humanizes him The movie doesn t capture all aspects of the novel but that hardly matters It s middling Greene The author barely bothers to characterize England under siege he was more evocative when his settings were farther from home as they almost always were and the last third in which the atheistic Maurice has his face rubbed in the rightness of Sarah s faith feels like a denouement not a climax The glory of the book of most of Greene s books is in the dialogue in which all that vague spiritual yearning coalesces into candor so biting that it still has the power to shock Wounded lovers dismiss each other with compact fury while the fiercest insults are reserved for representatives of a God who has let despair run riot Greene s dialogue is already close to great screenwriting and Jordan edits and orchestrates it with masterful cunning More important he distills from the novel a mournfully wry fable on the all consuming convolutions of jealousy We meet Maurice two years after his entanglement with Sarah has abruptly ended but an encounter with her husband forlorn and hatless in a deluge convinced that his wife is holed up somewhere with a lover brings the green eyed monster as well as a host of memories back with a snap It s the ex paramour not the husband who hires a detective agency to dog the mysteriously wayward Sarah and in one of those ironies that feels delightfully postmodern it s Maurice himself who ends up being trailed by a Cockney gumshoe Parkis an amusingly earnest Ian Hart when Sarah reinitiates contact The story touches on sex farce but only briefly This is a tale in which every possessive human act ends up driving the heroine closer both spiritually and literally to God The movie is a religious conspiracy disguised as a romance Jordan s mysticism isn t on the surface the way it is in some of his other films but in the recesses He and his cinematographer Roger Pratt have loaded the screen with shadows not the hard edged ones of film noir but a sort of existential English smudginess The textures are muddied the palette damp It s as if the light has had to pass through layer upon layer of dust and fog so that only the faded yellows oranges and the occasional green of some wallpaper register amid the ashy grays You can t make this world seem too welcoming or the characters will lose the incentive to seek out a better one That means freezing rain cheerlessly crabbed interiors and lots of extras who visibly live lives of quiet desperation The effect of so much misery isn t narcotizing however Jordan like Greene is too sensitive to his characters vexations to their colorful spasms of pique His heroes don t go mutely their souls scratch and kick Julianne Moore is especially raw Her whitish faintly freckled complexion affords her no protection from the elements worldly or otherwise When Maurice questions Sarah s love while bombs drop nearby she responds by screwing him harder her bare breasts looming over him imperious yet vulnerable as the plaster dust rains down This is one of Moore s soft hair performances I tend to prefer the straight hair ones the razor s edge hysterics of The Big Lebowski 1998 The Myth of Fingerprints 1997 and the upcoming Magnolia although her soft haired repository of environmental poison in Safe 1995 is probably her most amazing work I love everything she does but I wish that Jordan hadn t left her so exposed He misdirects her in her big scene in which a bomb falls on Sarah and Maurice s love nest and her response to his apparent death spells the end of her earthly happiness Moore internalizes the emotion a shade too much and her lack of urgency amid the rubble borders on camp It s a mark of her stature that another potential camp moment doesn t bring the house down the line It s only a cough never a happy portent in a love story At first Rea s hangdog persona struck me as overly pitiable for Henry A more repressed formal Englishman would make his wife s open disregard seem less cruel But Greene intends an element of cruelty and Rea s blurry bewilderment is finally moving You can see why even a cold fish like Fiennes Maurice would feel compelled to take care of him In a late scene the husband invades the lovers seaside idyll which is an impulse that might seem out of character for Henry and that isn t in the book Jordan has lifted the idea from another Greene work Since Greene would juggle the same motifs for the rest of his life the triangles the bonds between cuckolds and lovers the self sacrificing renunciations the use of birthmarks to indicate spiritual blight the insistent pull of Catholicism Jordan s interpolation seems not an impertinence but the highest form of respect On their first date Maurice takes Sarah to the cinema to see an adaption of one of his novels and has to shield his eyes from the coarseness of it I think if Greene took a date to see The End of the Affair he d say The bloody cheek I didn t oh hmmm that s very good That s very good indeed By contrast Frank Darabont s three hour adaptation of Stephen King s serial novel The Green Mile is superficially respectful but ultimately cruel He exposes the work as hooey Actually not all of the movie is melodramatic pseudo mystical drivel only about two hours and 15 minutes That leaves a stately 45 minutes in which the texture of Depression era life in the death row wing of a Southern prison is richly evoked The rhythms are leisurely but fraught even the most casual exchanges carry an awareness of the electric chair nearby The day before an execution the condemned man is sent away and a surrogate Harry Dean Stanton does a dress rehearsal Walkin the mile repeats the old man as he and the guards troop down the corridor known as the Green Mile for the color of the floor to the chair in which he s elaborately strapped offered an opportunity to make a final statement Sorry for all the bad shit I done and mock dispatched When the surrogate makes a sick joke and the guards erupt in laughter the head guard Paul Edgecomb Tom Hanks silences them worriedly He says they shouldn t make jokes because the next day when a man will actually die they might remember the joke and not be able to stop from cracking up That rebuke is a wonderful piece of writing it establishes both Edgecomb s watchfulness and his decency The movie is full of details like that Its attention to rituals that other films don t have time for gives it surprising power And its episodic construction which mirrors King s novel is a relief from the beeline structure of most big budget thrillers T he Green Mile also features a giant mentally slow Negra under sentence of execution John Coffey Michael Clarke Duncan note the initials was found clutching two bloodied little girls and wailing that he tried to take it back but it was too late About an hour into the picture he grabs Edgecomb through the bars puts his hand against the man s crotch and generates a mystical white light he then exhales a swarm of evil looking black particles that dissipate into the ether Edgecomb s bladder infection vanishes Eventually these kindly white Southern death row guards sneak their pet J C on all kinds of useful errands including one to the home of a terminally ill bedridden white woman over whom the black giant hovers in a miraculous inversion of a Southern rape fantasy Other writers have influences King has nothing but influences The gentle giant plays with a tiny mouse Of Mice and Men The stricken executioner gets blessed by his beatific sacrifice Billy Budd You could add a score of prison movies along with E T 1982 Starman 1984 and even some vigilante pictures J C evidently isn t opposed to capital punishment as long as it s the evil people who get punished King isn t a cynical writer He recycles these elements as if he has true faith in the power of his fables to heal But I find his storytelling both morally easy and artistically promiscuous The Green Mile is a fat old whore who thinks appealing to an audience s most self congratulatory instincts stroking it until it goes blind is a public service
