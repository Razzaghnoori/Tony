 Drawing upon her rich experience of life Prudence Prudie to her friends responds to questions about manners personal relations politics and other subjects Please send your questions for publication to prudence slate com Queries should not exceed 200 words in length Please indicate how you wish your letter to be signed preferably including your location Dear Prudie I am heartsick about my sister Well actually about her boyfriend She s been seeing someone exclusively for more than a year It s exclusive on her part but everybody knows he is cheating on her That is not the only problem He belittles her in public and is quite a cheapskate I have gently tried to tell her she is too good for this lout but she will have none of it I feel helpless and I worry for her I am the older sister if you hadn t guessed Is there anything to be done Banging My Head Against a Wall in Portland Dear Bang Prudie is reminded of the delicious Dorothy Parker remark She has put all her eggs in one bastard How sad for you to be a bystander while your sister is having a romantic near death experience Alas the kind of bystander you are is helpless because people in these relationships have blinders on and defenses in place Prudie too abhors these transcendentally horny louses but outside observers don t get a vote Your sister alas does not regard Lover Boy as a problem Yet But have hope The day will come when your sib will see things clearly for herself and her loving sister will be there to help her pick up the pieces Since you have gone on record about what you think of this boulevardier say no more It would be the vocal equivalent of throwing good money after bad Prudie sympathetically Dear Prudence My company has sales teams and my problem has to do with my traveling partner We are in the air a lot and in hotels and restaurants I am mortified much of the time because Elaine is always dropping things into her purse On airplanes she helps herself to the little liquor bottles she doesn t drink and those plastic salt and pepper things In restaurants she cleans out the bread basket and transfers everything to her purse I know when she is seen doing this people think we are a pair of nuts and assume she s doing it for both of us and I also worry that this is stealing Can you help me come to terms with this situation Thank you No Sticky Fingers From Chicago Dear No Stick Prudie is sympathetic to your traveling partner because well Prudie herself is partial to those little brown sugar packets in restaurant sugar bowls While never having had the inclination to transfer an entire bread basket to her handbag Prudie has on occasion taken a particularly good tasting piece of bread for later provided there is a paper napkin for wrapping If one was to filch a cloth napkin that would be stealing Your friend s appropriation of food put on the table you should know is not dishonest The two of you have essentially paid for everything served to you Granted most twosomes would not polish off the entire contents of a bread basket but it is the diners The same is true for the airplane offerings If it will help you feel better about things encourage Elaine to ask the server for a take home container for whatever she wishes to transport out of the dining room Prudie finds most restaurants more than happy to oblige If however your associate thinks she is engaging in petty larceny and gets her jollies from purloined rolls indulge her knowing that it is a harmless habit Prudie portably Dear Prudence I m a happy go lucky 75 year old retiree who alas gets incredibly annoyed when strangers typically on the phone call me by my first name I m a liberal Democrat and am not old fashioned but such pseudo friendliness turns me off It also makes dealing with business people difficult Example Just the other day I called a salesman regarding refinancing the house and left my name and number When he called back he said Hi John this is Mr Blank I told him I d prefer to be called Mr Jones He got annoyed and told me he has close knit relationships with his clients He then continued to call me John throughout his explanation of what refinancing involved When he finished I told him again I did not wish to be called John He became flustered said goodbye and hung up I ve not heard from him since I ask you am I out of step with the world Is it OK for young secretaries to assume we re on a first name basis Quite frankly I consider such an approach an invasion of my privacy I also consider it a put down What sayest thou Wondering in Tucson Ariz Dear Mr Won Prudie is in your camp People who presume to use a first name in a business call seem thoughtless They register on the Prudometer right next to those who invite you to Have a nice day Using the first name of someone who is unknown to you is presumptuous disrespectful and improper Your Mr Blank who tried to make a case yet for why it was OK to call you John sounds like a horse s patootie That he didn t follow up on the financial transaction is no loss Surely you will find someone with equal skills who will call you Mr Prudie on occasion has asked service people on the other end of the line who launch into a first name address Do we know each other This is usually sufficient for them to swing into a Mrs mode Only a clod would persist What is behind this pseudo familiarity equality Prudie thinks is California casualness and a touchy feely cultural shift that have replaced formality and civility Rest assured that you are not out of step or if you are that Prudie is right there with you Prudie respectfully Dear Prudence I have moved back to my hometown and renewed acquaintances with old high school girlfriends As time goes on we are becoming closer and spending more time together The problem is this Most of them smoke and I do not When we go out to dinner we always sit in the smoking section When I visit their homes they smoke constantly When they come to my home they are forever going out to the balcony to smoke I know that breathing this smoke is harmful to me Normally I avoid smoke yet I pretend it doesn t bother me with these friends The question is should I consider my own health and the fact that when I am with them I am inhaling probably a pack of cigarettes Should I stop seeing them I don t really want this but what else to do Yes I could ask them not to smoke but since there are five of them who do smoke it seems like the majority rules L G St Petersburg Fla Dear L Your old high school girlfriends are causing you to regress to high school You are feeling that you ve got to go along with everybody else to fit in Prudie is mindful of the fact that a gem tlich bunch of girlfriends is wonderful but this crowd is hazardous to your health the deleterious effects of secondhand smoke having been accepted by most people It is interesting that this clique is composed entirely of smokers There is a slim possibility that your chums out of affection for you will not smoke in your presence and would give up the smoking section in restaurants Failing that bear in mind that the concept of majority rule applies to elections and community decisions not health risks Prudie is reminded of a Russian expression Once your head is cut off there is no use crying about your hair If you become ill or worse a group of girlfriends will be meaningless Please put your lungs before your social life otherwise Prudie will worry Prudie deep breathingly
