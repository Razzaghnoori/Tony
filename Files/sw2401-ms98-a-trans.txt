 okay the car if i buy a car it d probably be an American made car that s what s with me wrong because i feel of the economy i would probably buy an American made car even though sometimes the foreign cars are better but we re losing a lot of money buying foreign cars and people getting out of jobs as it is so i d probably buy i ve always own American car uh the kind of car is probably something i couldn t afford like a Lincoln i would love to have a Lincoln uh huh mark seven a Mark seven yes uh what do the Mark sevens usually run oh about thirty five to forty thirty five K uh huh well there s a tremendous amount of money alright it s a luxury car it s a it s a sports luxury car it s right below the Continental the Lincoln Continental i see you know it s it s along that line um hum i agree about that uh American cars should be the ones to be bought um i just wish their quality would to still improve further yeah they re getting even better i think oh yes it s a matter of time it s probably going to be another two to five years before they re really up to par where they should be and then i believe the majority of American people will yeah already have foreign cars yeah uh huh they will already have in fact i have one myself i m reluctant to admit i don t my mother has one she does yes she finally she wanted she had a she s got a a Honda um not a Honda a Toyota that what is it Accord no Honda Accord yeah Honda Accord yes that s one and she hasn t had any problems out of it see what year model is it oh think it s a eighty nine eighty nine uh huh well that s fairly new mine mine is an eighty four Sentra uh huh and the only problem i ve ever experienced major type problem i ve experienced is a a fuel pump had to be replaced and it s got eighty four thousand no it s got eighty nine thousand miles on it now see i have a i have a Lincoln Continental right now you do it s a yeah it s a seventy nine Lincoln it s got over a hundred thousand miles and there is no problem with the car see the i think no major malfunctions then huh uh huh uh my air conditioner went out but i mean ten years but uh i mean as far as major there s nothing major with the car i see well that s good to hear but it i think what it is the American public had made good cars at one time and then they started more or less trying to hurry stuff the first car i think now that they have that s uh that s made it on the what do you call it the mechanic s list or the the why they check the how they judge cars what is it list where they come out with the consumer list in Consumer Digest or a Consumer Reports yeah is a is a is a Taurus a Taurus yeah that s the first one that s made it and uh its a you know it s a four door it s a nice car now for me to buy a Taurus i would have to buy top of the line Taurus and that s Taurus Show uh huh it s it s it s it has a four speed i like that stick shift but see that s top of the line that costs twenty whereas a Taurus would cost about a regular Taurus i think is twelve or thirteen well that s not too bad in price listing huh uh the the yeah see the Taurus Show has the spoiler kit and the and the big engine and the and stuff like that it has an eight cylinder it has the well yeah i think it has the it has that engine like the Mustang oh yeah yeah and it s a four it s i think it s you know the speed uh uh manual transmission correct so but yes i would definitely buy one of those before if i had to between that and Lincoln i d probably buy the Show Lee Iacocca stressed on the mini van uh i mean the mini van has been one of the best top of the line vehicles for Chrysler isn t it yeah um i don t know their durability is a lot better i understand than most other vans i think it would it s not so much of the vans any more or the cars some of them are ugly right i m sorry they look like space mobiles there s a lot of uh duplicity in the vehicles the way the build them too uh huh insofar as their design um uh American even foreign but i m sure it s all for streamlining or for air streamlining yeah why you can t still go fast so what s the difference that s what i don t understand you know they re making it so that they re talking about the wind current and how how efficient it is but if you can t go fast you can t go fast i don t care how sleek they make it it just makes sense to me It s like they re making a a model of a speed car when you can t go fast right you know the in in Germany it would probably be alright if you put it on that autobahn but over here nobody should be going that fast to be worried about wind no uh yeah just a second going to pick them up excuse me for a moment right i m fixing to get them right now excuse me i had to uh talk to my boss i know how that go but i guess that s about it and i better let you go okay so i guess we have nothing to do on the other end there s no uh interruptions here to tell us that we re done or uh huh that s it just hang up all righty bye okay later come here
