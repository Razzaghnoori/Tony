 What Did George Know and When Did He Spin It ABC News analyst George Stephanopoulos is shocked shocked to think that Clinton s been screwing around Or rather in his recent Newsweek essay Feb 2 issue he is livid He feels betrayal He doesn t know whether to be angry or sad or both Stephanopoulos thus adopts the only defense he has a plea of ignorance to the obvious charge see for example Chatterbox for 1 25 that he himself helped mislead the voters in 1992 when defending Clinton against a variety of zipper related charges Poor trusting little George During the 1992 campaign however this naivete must have been rather hard to maintain First Stephanopoulos rounded up affidavits to squelch an article in Penthouse by groupie Connie Hamzy who said Clinton propositioned her in a Little Rock hotel in 1984 Then he helped squelch an early Star story on Clinton s womanizing Then he participated in the vilification of Gennifer Flowers Can it be true that Stephanopoulos entertained no serious doubts about Clinton Of course not Newsweek s own book on the 1992 campaign Quest for the Presidency reports the secret suspicion widely shared in the campaign that some of the rumors about the governor were true and that the Flowers story might just be one of them Indeed the core of Flowers account that there was an affair was confirmed during the campaign by one of her roommates Later according to the Newsweek book Stephanopoulos James Carville and Mandy Grunwald were so demoralized by Clinton s lack of candor that they crashed on a bed together too numb with fatigue and despair to speak Even now in his current Newsweek essay Stephanopoulos spinning his own crisis of credibility admits I assumed without asking that something had happened between Clinton and Flowers Well Doesn t that mean he knew Clinton was at best misleading and dissembling in his famous 60 Minutes interview If you persist in foisting a candidate on the nation in the face of such doubts it s a little much to cry betrayal later If Stephanopoulos didn t know all along his self enforced ignorance why did he go on without asking was the equivalent of the journalists reckless disregard of truth
