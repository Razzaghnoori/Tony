 Background There are over 450 telemedicine programs worldwide with over 360 of those in the United States 1 There are programs in virtually every medical specialty and the populations they most commonly serve include those who live in rural areas the elderly and veterans With the growing ability of modern computer and communications technology to capture and quickly transmit textual audio and video information many have advocated its use to improve the health care provided to individuals in rural areas in the home and in other places where medical personnel are not readily available Many believe that the growth of telemedicine is impeded by reimbursement policies of the federal government and private insurers 2 3 These authors claim this leads to a vicious cycle There is a growing call for telemedicine services to be covered as part of health insurance Health care payors whether governmental or private have been reluctant to do so This in turn has led telemedicine advocates to blame payors for impeding development of the technology One reason for the lack of coverage of telemedicine has been an uncertainty about its efficacy and cost There have been a number of previous systematic reviews assessing the efficacy of telemedicine and related technologies 4 5 6 7 8 9 All of these studies noted that although the technology showed promise in certain areas the overall methodologic quality of the evaluative studies was low and the plan for the most appropriate and cost effective use of telemedicine was unclear This systematic review had its origins in a report commissioned by the US Health Care Financing Agency HCFA and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality AHRQ to assess the efficacy of telemedicine in the adult non pregnant population 1 A subsequent supplemental report extended the analysis to the pediatric and obstetric population 10 The goal of this paper is to assess whether telemedicine interventions result in comparable health outcomes to in person care It merges results from the original two reports and updating them with studies published since the reports were submitted to the federal agencies We broadly divide telemedicine into two general areas In office hospital based telemedicine both the patient and clinician are in a professional health care setting such as a practitioner s office or in the hospital There is a subcategory of office hospital based telemedicine called store and forward telemedicine where clinical data is collected and forwarded for review later in a completely asynchronous manner but it was not assessed in this systematic review because our literature review failed to identify any studies of clinical outcomes utilizing it In home based telemedicine the patient is at his or her residence with direct communication between the clinician and the patient or their caregiver Methods The criteria for study inclusion in this systematic review were that the study be relevant to at least one of the areas of telemedicine and contain data on outcomes of clinical care that compared telemedicine with a control group of in person care We excluded services that would not normally require face to face encounters between the clinician and patient e g radiology and pathology diagnosis used only telephone care or electronic mail or provided medical advice directly to the public We developed a search strategy designed to find any publications about telemedicine and used it to search MEDLINE EMBASE CINAHL and HealthSTAR through February 2001 see Figure 1 We also searched through telemedicine reports and compilations such as the Conseil d Evaluation des Technologies de la Sante du Quebec 11 the Telemedicine Strategic Healthcare Group Report 12 the International Society for Telemedicine Conference Proceedings the Association of Telemedicine Service Providers database 13 and the Telemedicine Sourcebook 1998 14 We also assessed three systematic reviews different in scope from this study from the International Network of Agencies for Health Technology INHATA 5 the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 7 and the Agenda d Avaluacio de Technologia Medica 6 In addition we identified additional articles from the reference lists of included reports and articles and also contacted known telemedicine experts to find additional articles to identify and describe telemedicine programs Finally we also handsearched all issues of the two major telemedicine journals Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare and Telemedicine Journal recently renamed Telemedicine Journal and e Health through the end of 2000 Each title abstract retrieved was reviewed by two reviewers When the two reviewers disagreed a third reviewer made the final decision We retrieved the full text articles for citations selected for possible inclusion in the systematic review When an article met the criteria for inclusion the summary statistics were extracted To evaluate the quality of the studies assessed we adapted a scale developed by our evidence based practice center Table 1 15 We used a second scale to indicate the direction of the evidence Table 2 Results Home based telemedicine Diabetes Mellitus The studies that have assessed home monitoring of diabetes have focused on tracking insulin dosages and used Hemoglobin A 1C as an outcome measure Two of the studies identified focused on gestational diabetes one on children and the remainder on adults Only one diabetes study was adequately designed to rate as a class I randomized controlled trial RCT 16 This pediatric study showed no difference in glycemic control between groups HgbA1C for both groups actually rose emergency room visits psychological status and family functioning The two largest studies of adults showed that both the experimental and control groups improved with no statistically significant difference between them 17 18 Three other studies demonstrated a small but statistically significant benefit in HgbA1C 19 20 21 Both studies of home gestational diabetes monitoring found improvements in blood sugar values but not in HgbA1C although each had very small sample sizes and probable inadequate statistical power to detect a difference 22 23 General Chronic Disease Management Three studies addressed general chronic disease management The largest and best designed was an RCT where both the intervention and control groups were provided usual home health care but the intervention group also received a video system that allowed real time remote interaction with the health system 24 Both groups had comparable compliance with medication regimen knowledge about their disease ability to move toward self care and scores on the 12 item Short Form Health Survey SF 12 The other studies described the use of videophones for patient communication with health care providers In a study in Japan 16 elderly patients who were provided with videophones were compared to 16 matched patients who used regular home health services 25 After 3 months the videophone group significantly exceeded the control group in activities of daily living communications and social cognition as measured with the Functional Independence Measure The videophone intervention was a supplement to not a substitute for regular home health services The second study a qualitative report of 12 cases showed a reduction in the number of home care visits needed for seven of the patients 26 Hypertension Of the two studies of monitoring hypertension via home based telemedicine one looked at the elderly while the other looked at pregnant women The study of the elderly was an RCT that assessed the effect of a computer controlled automated telephone system versus usual office based care on adherence and blood pressure control in older hypertensive patients 27 Mean antihypertensive medication adherence improved 17 7 percent for telephone system users versus 11 7 percent for controls Mean diastolic blood pressure decreased 5 2 mm Hg in users compared to a 0 8 mm Hg drop in controls a statistically significant difference There was also a positive relationship between medication adherence and blood pressure reduction The study of hypertension in pregnant women found that an at home blood pressure monitoring system resulted in comparable levels of blood pressure anxiety and gestational age of delivery as hospital based monitoring 28 AIDS Two studies of persons with AIDS demonstrated the value of a home computer link to information others with the disease and a health care professional who could steer the patient to advice One of the studies showed the system reduced social isolation after controlling for depression as well as improved decision making confidence 29 The other demonstrated various quality of life improvements as well as fewer and shorter hospitalizations 30 Other areas The remaining studies provided evidence of benefit in a variety of areas An RCT of a home computer link for caregivers of patients with Alzheimer s Disease found improved decision making confidence 31 An RCT of patients in a home exercise program using transtelephonic exercise monitoring compared to a hospital based program improved cardiac function by a similar amount 32 One caveat of this study was that it had such low statistical power that it would not be likely to detect any difference between the two interventions in efficacy or in complications even if they existed An RCT of an Internet based telemedicine program for families of children in a neonatal intensive care unit found that among infants born with weight of 1 000 grams there was a trend towards shorter hospital stays 33 A study of videophones for pediatric home ventilator patients found that the number of unscheduled hospital visits and hospital admission days was reduced significantly compared with historical controls 34 Office hospital based telemedicine The six studies assessing clinical outcomes from interventions of office hospital based telemedicine were spread across five specialties We actually identified another study that appeared to be a preliminary report of another study in the group 35 Of the two RCTs identified one assessed outcomes in patients entering an emergency department who were randomized to in person or telemedicine care 36 There were no differences in the need for additional fellow up care or return to the emergency room ER showing that telemedicine was as effective as regular care in this setting Another RCT assessed clinical outcome which was defined as the need to have a follow up appointment with a hospital based specialist 37 Interactive teledermatology consultation 46 percent was found to have the same rate of need for follow up care as in person consultation 45 percent No statistical analysis of the differences was performed A time series cohort study demonstrated reduced mortality complications and length of stay in a community hospital surgical intensive care unit ICU with continuous intensivist oversight via telemedicine 38 A study in a neonatal ICU used a retrospective comparison to show reduced length of stay with the use of a telecardiology system 39 Two studies of neurosurgery patients demonstrated benefit of transmission of radio logic studies to avert complications in patient transfer 40 41 Discussion Despite the widespread use of telemedicine in virtually all areas of health care delivery there is only a small amount of evidence that interventions provided by telemedicine result in clinical outcomes are comparable to or better than face to face care The best evidence comes from home based telemedicine where modest benefits have been shown for patients with chronic disease AIDS and Alzheimer s Disease The most studied area in home based telemedicine is monitoring of blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus The benefits are not conclusive with studies showing no change or a slight drop in HgbA1C levels In office hospital based telemedicine there is good evidence that telemedicine interventions provide comparable care in the ER settings and benefit in the surgical and neonatal ICU settings There is also probable benefit in its use prior to transfer of neurosurgery patients Although there is good evidence for the diagnostic capability of teledermatology 1 the only assessment of its outcomes has focused on the need for specialty follow up Further studies must be done to demonstrate the efficacy of telemedicine for diagnostic and management decisions Large scale RCTs must be done to identify the health outcomes whose benefit appears most promising If the goal is to show comparability to usual care then studies must provide adequate statistical power to show that the lack of a difference truly exists Small studies with inadequate power are not good evidence The fact that telemedicine is an emerging technology is not a reason for failing to perform appropriate evaluation studies Rather new methodologies such as tracker trials should be used to assess it systematically 42 Tracker trials are designed to assess new and or rapidly changing interventions and compare efficacy not only of the general intervention but also specific instances of it such as a newly developed approach that has become available after the general trial started We would also advocate that journal editors exhibit restraint when considering publication of low quality evaluation studies As such studies often accompany otherwise appropriate descriptions of telemedicine systems they should consider refusing to publish the portion of the article containing the low quality evaluation study and publish the rest The growth of high speed telecommunications networks and their ability to transmit higher quality imaging and other clinical information indicates a bright future for telemedicine especially as the infrastructure is built out to reach to individuals who have historically been denied high quality health care due to their remote location As the cost of these services will challenge the health care budgets of even well to do nations it is imperative that decisions to use them be based on appropriate evidence that they lead to comparable patient outcomes in office hospital based telemedicine and improved patient outcomes in home based telemedicine
