 Sports Sections and the Minivan Revolution Johnette You re right The Warner story is terrific Why don t we hear more of these stories Is it because they are so rare Or because sportswriters don t spend much time searching for them I hate to say it but I think the answer might be the latter Don t get me wrong I m not saying there are dozens of Kurt Warners out there Not at all This is rare and heart warming and really quite nice I m just wondering out loud if some of our colleagues us even miss great stories in order to continue to pump out the continual steam of game stories and side bars and advances and follows that have inspired millions of readers to put down their newspapers and run to the Internet I continue to be amazed at the lack of creativity in our sports sections especially regarding women s sports and features that will attract women readers such as the Warner saga Newspapers need new readers desperately The sports section in many ways is the gateway to the paper especially for children It was for me Girls now love sports almost as much as boys These girls have parents who buy products And yet pick up the New York Times or the Washington Post or the Miami Herald or even USA Today which covers more women s sports than any paper I know and it s all men s sports Or almost all Blood and guts X s and O s My God some papers still use the headings basketball and women s basketball Can you imagine Like one s real and the other s fake Of course it should be men s basketball and women s basketball It s little stuff but it means a lot Because of all this a 12 year old girl unless she s a total sports nut like you or me slides the paper back across the breakfast table goes to the computer and clicks on Mia Hamm s Web site Good bye to her probably forever Here s my new favorite quote Buffalo quarterback Doug Flutie is watching last summer s wildly popular Women s World Cup soccer tournament with his 10 year old daughter Alexa A commercial comes on the Gatorade Anything You Can Do I Can Do Better ad featuring Mia Hamm and Michael Jordan When it ends Alexa looks at her dad and asks Who s the guy with Mia I m not making this up How many 8 to 12 year old girls know Mia but don t know Michael Apparently a few And how many of them are being lured into our sports sections Zero The Women s World Cup soccer tournament became the sports story of the year The U S team won every major end of the year award And yet the number of American sports editors who chose to cover the event is far less than the number who chose to not cover it Huge papers the Houston Chronicle for instance didn t send a staff writer Another major metropolitan daily in the South told its reporter that it would not pay her airfare or expenses She went to the World Cup final in L A anyway When the paper used this reporter s stories on A1 for five consecutive days she came home and submitted the expenses The paper reimbursed her Can you believe this The minivan revolution has hit America but most sports editors refuse to notice Don t these guys drive by soccer fields on their way to work Don t they have daughters Why didn t every sports editor in the country start devoting even a little more space to skating after Tonya Nancy which was a fiasco absolutely but also was the sixth highest rated TV program in history Not sports program All of television The top six The last M A S H Who shot J R an episode of Roots two Super Bowls and Tonya Nancy This is why skating is on TV all the time Any newspaper that covered it even a little would attract scores of new readers As you know I ve found skating to be a worthy news subject AIDS pushy parents eating disorders you name it You could tell me to shut up and go back to my little Olympic world if if newspaper circulation numbers weren t plummeting But they are I m on a roll here Don t stop me Another thing Why do 50 something male columnists criticize the Women s World Cup team as being overhyped when in fact that story was the complete opposite of hype fans packing stadiums and surprising everyone forcing sports editors to scramble to send reporters to cover a burgeoning story Some of these columnists have been supporting women s rights and liberal issues for years yet when something this refreshing and fun comes along in women s sports they invariably begin to attack it Why I don t sound like a Republican today do I Why aren t we thinking differently as an industry before we re not an industry anymore Send answers and fast Chris
