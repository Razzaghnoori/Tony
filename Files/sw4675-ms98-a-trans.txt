              all righty   okay do you have a budget that you go on   yeah i sure do um i have its pretty much a ledger sheet and i just write down all my bills how much im going to have to pay and i do it per paycheck for me which is every other week uh i mean i include everything from groceries to insurance to car payments to credit card payments you know everything   umhum umhum umhum   and it tends to work out pretty well that way i can anticipate you know a little better i usually try to guesstimate and then when the bill actually comes in i go ahead and fill in the actual amount   umhum umhum   that way i know how much pocket change im going to have left at the end of the month or at the end of the paycheck anyway   umhum umhum uhhuh   so that works okay for me   uhhuh well my bills i usually know approximately how much theyre going to be each month they  are more or less just about the same you know   right uhhuh same here   uh very seldom are they any different and then uh like for groceries and everything we try to put like two hundred and fifty dollars in a little can in the kitchen   uhhuh umhum   and then thats what we use to buy the groceries with   oh okay   and then we put our receipts in there you know and usually thats enough   umhum   and um but i dont have any you know small children to have anything extra come up you know like uh running to the doctor or something like that with them   right luckily i dont either i mean you know maybe my cat would get sick but i mean usually thats not so much that it would throw me off     yeah yeah right in fact i did have to take my dog to the vet the other day   but you so you know what im saying yeah     yeah that its its worse than having a kid huh   i sometimes it can be sometimes it can be i guess the worst thing ive ever had come out is like car maintenance kinds of things   yeah umhum   but i do try to build in a little extra money each month to to be able to do that type of thing so   yeah um im not working right now i worked for P I E and then uh they went bankrupt so i just went ahead and took my early pension   umhum oh uhhuh   but i only get that once a month   ooh thats tough   yeah   my roommate only gets paid once a month   yeah so   and that last weeks pretty lean generally speaking so   yeah so you know i really have to try to budget that i dont go over that amount you know each month   right i for for years got paid once a month and and in ways i liked it because i could go ahead and pay all my bills at once   umhum   theres always one or two stragglers that usually they were for me it worked out that they were the smaller ones   umhum umhum   but i would pay all of them at one sitting and i would know okay you can go spend this much on groceries now and you get this much a week and that is it   yeah right   and and that worked okay for me   umhum   i dont know right now i im in the mode of trying to dig out of debt i think as everybody is and so   and oh yeah right now its terrible isnt it   its yeah its really bad but um its going pretty well and ive got a real good plan mapped out here so   yeah uhhuh i also like belong to a Christmas club because you know i used to belong to a Christmas club last year i didnt   uhhuh   then so then naturally Christmas comes along and thats puts you behind too you know so this year now i have them taking out fifty dollars a month out of my checking account for my Christmas club   oh thats yeah   so i figure you know thats gonna help some   thatll cover your gifts come Christmas time thatll yeah   yeah right you know   thatd be good because yeah most people are spending three or four months digging you know at least digging out after Christmas so   yeah right right and im taking   yeah i i was pretty fortunate this Christmas i didnt get in debt so   oh thats good im taking like um sewing lessons to try to learn how to sew better than what i can   uhhuh   so i wont have to go out and buy the readymade clothes anymore   oh uhhuh its so rare you hear anybody doing that any longer   i know i even bought myself a Surger you know and i just love it i havent learned everything to do on it yet but       i figure that will help me save   yeah   you know   my um roommate does sew some and and um i she hasnt sewed anything in a long time but i im sure that she could pick it up again my mother always sewed she tried to teach me when i was young but   uhhuh   not interested   yeah well see some people are and some people arent because i have some sisters i have three sisters and none of those are really interested in sewing   yeah yeah but thats a real good way to save money though by doing that   yeah and then i can also you know do some crafts and sell those at garage sales   umhum umhum   so which ive been doing   well thats a good way to to make a little extra money   umhum   well this is another way that im making a little extra money so that was you know nice that i tripped over this opportunity and youre actually my first call   oh really oh   yeah i had not um done   well have you called   i i guess todays todays my first day that i could even do it     oh it is   yeah you beat me to the punch here   oh well thats nice thats nice you know     i was i was about to call to get to see if i could get on with somebody so so that was great   uhhuh yeah well i guess thats about all i can talk to about budgets when i was working i uh bought a bond a month out of my you know they automatically took it out of my out of my uh payroll     yeah yeah i take have some money taken out  and put in a K   uhhuh
