 December 12 1994 Name Address City ST Zip Dear Name A few months ago Carl Newton and I wrote a letter asking you to consider a financial contribution to graduate Endodontics at Indiana University I am pleased to tell you that we have had a positive response to the letter It is great to know that people like you who have graduated from our program are willing to support us in such a significant way We are using the funds to support graduate Endodontic students and faculty without the financial backing of our alumni their educational experience would be somewhat diminished I m sending this follow up letter to let you know that your support is greatly needed and appreciated by everyone involved with graduate Endodontics at IU With year end tax decisions on the horizon I hope that you ll include our program in your charitable contributions Your gift made through Indiana University Foundation is tax deductible Let me assure you that all contributions directed to graduate Endodontics will be used only within our program You can be certain that your support is very meaningful to us I ve enclosed a gift card and envelope for your convenience Thanks for your consideration Sincerely Cecil Brown Jr DDS MS Associate Professor and Director of Graduate Endodontics
