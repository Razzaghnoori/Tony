                            By next summer more than  of         Streptococcus pneumoniae strains in the United States will        resist both penicillin and erythromycin according to a recent prediction from the Harvard        School of Public Health The forecast based on mathematical modeling was published in the        spring of  Its too early to tell whether that prediction is precisely on track        according to the senior author on that paper Marc Lipsitch But no one doubts that        multidrug resistance in this common bugresponsible for diseases that range from sinus        trouble and ear infections to meningitis and pneumoniais speeding up        It is the certain fate of all antibacterials to be fought off eventually by the        pathogens they target The fact that the process is accelerating has been alarming public        health officials for some time especially in the United States We need new ways to defeat        disease and we will need them forever                    Tried and Trueand Tired        Antibiotics have traditionally been plucked from natures battleground For billions of        years tiny organisms have engaged in an arms race hurling toxic molecules at each other        in the struggle to prosper Nearly all of todays antibiotics are versions of weapons long        wielded by microbes and fungi Chemical synthesis of entirely humancreated antibiotics has        so far yielded only fluoroquinolones a group of broadspectrum antibiotics that includes        Cipro which became famously scarce during the  anthrax scare and linezolid        tradenamed Zyvox which is effective against some resistant strains of         Staphylococcus          Streptococcus  and         Enterococcus         The usual way to find a new antibiotic has been laborious screening of immense libraries        of compounds natural and otherwise Some argue that screening chemical libraries is        approaching a deadend There may be diminishing returns from screening but its not quite        dead yet in October researchers at the University of Wisconsin at Madison reported a new        class of bacterial RNA polymerase inhibitors with antibiotic potential They were found by        screening for molecules that prevent         Escherichia coli from transcribing RNA        Christopher T Walsh of Harvard Medical School says screenings problem may be simply        that libraries arent good enough Marine organisms have not been studied well he points        out and  of organisms in the biosphere cant be cultured in standard ways He says        Were missing  of them every time we go and look in nature        Walsh is doing his bit to create new libraries He and his colleagues have recently        employed combinatorial biosynthesis to learn how to use part of the machinery for        assembling cyclic peptide antibiotics to control their architecture The result was a small        library of natural product analogs some of which have improved antibiotic activity against        common bacterial pathogens There are dozens of such enzymatic domains that in principle        one could clone express and test with other substrates I view that as the kind of thing        we should do he says For example Walsh suggests it is a reasonable approach to        secondgeneration improvement of daptomycin the antibiotic most recently approved for sale        in the United States                    Improving on Nature        Walsh collaborates with Chaitan Khosla of Stanford University on finding ways to make        existing antibiotics better They are studying biosynthesis of rifamycin an antibiotic        that is increasingly less effective against its prime target tuberculosis TB see Figure         In the course of learning about that pathway weve learned a few interesting things        lately about how that molecule is initiated and were trying to apply it in other        contexts especially in the context of erythromycin biosynthesis Khosla says The idea        would be to make a molecule that might be more effective against bacteria that are becoming        resistant to rifamycinand are already naturally resistant to molecules like        erythromycin        Basically what we do is to try and figure out new ways to hijack the biosynthesis of        antibiotics in nature so as to modify their structures with the goal of improving them        Khosla explains He works with an important class of natural antibiotics called polyketides        that have generated dozens of drugs including erythromycin        Polyketides are secondary metabolites which give their producers a competitive        advantage in their environment produced mostly by bacteria and fungi and made by a complex        and structurally diverse family of enzymes called polyketide synthases see the primer by        David Hopwood in this issue of         PLoS Biology  Among them are the anthracyclines a group of anticancer        drugs and antibacterials that includes tetracycline In this issue of         PloS Biology  Khosla and his colleagues report that they can make        selective positional modifications in existing anthracycline antibiotics by starting in a        different way with a different starting molecule The molecule came from a natural        anthracycline antibiotic an estrogen receptor antagonist called R R is made via        two modules of enzymes that work sequentially the first module starts the process and the        second completes it This division of labor permitted the researchers to tack the first        R module onto two other enzyme systems thus engineering completely new anthracyclines        Some were more active in two types of assays than the natural parent molecule One setting        was an assay on an estrogensensitive cancer cell line Another setting was an assay to        probe activity of an enzyme thats of particular interest in Type  diabetes called        glucosephosphate translocase The work also revealed fundamental mechanistic features        of the polyketide synthases Khosla says        The researchers didnt study the new anthracyclines effects on bacteria but Khosla        notes that the general principle should apply to other classes of compounds although the        details of how its implemented will vary from system to system He says The upshot of        this paper is that it is now possible to modify a particular methyl group in just about any        anthracycline antibiotic                    Finding New Targets        Instead of searching for new antibiotics by modifying existing ones some researchers        are trying something completely differentfirst finding the most vulnerable targets in a        bacterium and then designing something that hits one or more of them hard You have to        understand a helluva lot more about how these little cells work In fact we think we        understand a lot but I think we can understand almost everything now that we have all the        genomes says Lucy Shapiro of Stanford University School of Medicine While having full        genome sequencesmore than  microbe sequences have been completedis essential Shapiro        believes that knocking outs genes galore to find out which ones are necessary and going        after them all is not a sensible strategy She observes People have been doing that for a        while with absolutely no success Thats really going after the problem with a Howitzer        instead of with an intelligent approach        So instead of screening libraries of existing compounds Shapiro prefers using        structural information about drug targets or their natural ligands to create new drugs an        approach known as rational drug design And instead of looking at all essential genes in a        bacterium and choosing one to target she and her colleagues look at genetic circuitry that        controls the cell cycle the pathway that coordinates cell growth and differentiation They        have identified key control points or nodes in the circuitry for their favorite study        subject         Caulobacter crescentus  Thus they have found critical genes        encoding proteins that control several critical functions in the cell Their first        candidate was an essential enzyme a methyltransferase called CcrM that prevents a        particular piece of DNA from being expressed in a cell by tagging it with a methyl        group        Antibiotic discovery is all chemistry Shapiro says which is why she joined with        biochemist Stephen J Benkovic of Pennsylvania State University They didnt know the        structure of CcrM Benkovic explains but the literature about other methyltransferases        suggested that the adenine molecule which is the substrate for CcrM within DNA binds to a        specific region of the enzyme        The researchers designed adeninelike molecules that would bind to CcrM and then        developed inhibitors Benkovic says We already knew what kind of structure we wanted and        we simply finetuned it They worked their way through  inhibitor candidates ending        up with a small subsetno more than about that not only inhibited CcrM but also killed         Caulobacter very quickly        And not only inoffensive         Caulobacter  The compounds knock out other gramnegative        bacteria such as the pathogens         Brucella abortus and         Francisella tularensis  Some even killed off anthrax a big        surprise because it is grampositive and so has much thicker cell walls than gramnegative        bacteria The researchers undertook an exhaustive series of experiments to identify which        grampositive bacteria would be affected by which compounds The list of sensitive        pathogens now includes multidrugresistant         Streptococcus          Staphylococcus  and         Mycobacterium tuberculosis         More recently Shapiro reports they have demonstrated efficacy against rats infected        with anthrax or multidrugresistant         Staph  although the compounds save only about  of the rats        at present She notes So we have a long way to go But this has proven that if you go        after something using some rational approach instead of hitandmiss youll probably have        more success than by the other method        Benkovic points out that theirs is an entirely new class of compounds small molecular        weight compounds that can be made in a few steps He says They dont look like the normal        antibiotic so thats why I think theyre fairly unique The basic research was done under        a grant from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA the United States        Department of Defenses DOD central research and development organization and once the        researchers realized they wanted to develop drugs against three agents that have been        considered bioterrorism threats          Brucella  tularensis and anthrax  they established a separate        operation Anacor Pharmaceuticals which is developing them with DOD funding and without        Shapiro In her Stanford lab she continues her fundamental research to define the complete        genetic circuitry of         Caulobacter  hoping to identify additional nodes in the        circuit She says I am not doing it to develop antibiotics thats what comes out of the        work My goal is to understand how the cell works I think a lot of studies in pathogenesis        should not be just to understand pathogenic organisms but to understand the complete        network of regulatory mechanisms that controls the bacterial cell                    Phage Therapy        The most radical approach to new antibiotics may be the resurrection of an old idea        bacteriophage therapy see Figure  Late in the th century a researcher noticed that        water from some of Indias sacred rivers combated cholera Some years later the active        agents were identified as viruses that infected bacteria Such viruses are called        bacteriophage or phage for short There were reports of phage success against dysentery        typhoid and plague and bacteriophage therapy had a brief heyday especially in the s        Results on other diseases were mixed and with the appearance of antibiotics phage therapy        became unfashionable in the United States although it has continued in Russia and Eastern        Europe        Phage were the model organisms of choice for genetics research in the s and s        but became less fashionable as research tools when investigators moved on to eukaryotes A        few held on like Ry Young of Texas AM University who has made phageinduced cell        lysis his lifes work The cell is basically genetically dead as soon as the phage goes in        there but it will keep living as sort of an infected zombie for as long as the phage wants        it to with virus particles accumulating inside the cell he explains Only when the        phage is ready and has decided that its the right time will it pull the trigger And the        cell blows up The freed phage then spew forth to infect new cells        Antibiotic resistance has led to new interest in phage therapy by several small biotech        companies Young continues basic research at Texas AM but has also joined one of        them GangaGen providing bacteriophage expertise to its labs        Phage do kill pathogenic bacteria effectively and they do it without penetrating human        cells which they cant even recognize So what is keeping phage therapy out of the clinic        Problems that some doubt can be overcome        Because bacteria develop resistance to phage rapidly phage therapy companies will need        to direct cocktails against a single pathogen according to Vincent Fischetti at The        Rockefeller University Phage are also antigenic and the antibodies they stimulate will        neutralize their effects during subsequent treatment he says But the chief problem        appears to be regulatoryregulatory in the political rather than the genetic sense When        bacteriophage package their DNA they occasionally include varying amounts of their hosts        DNA too This miscellany Fischetti points out is likely to make the Food and Drug        Administration unhappy Phage normally are very fragile their tails break so lottolot        homogeneity could be a problem too he adds So even though it will work I think theyll        have an uphill battle Phage may well enter agricultural or veterinary use he predicts        but are probably not going to be available to patients in the United States any time        soon        Fischetti chose a different approach to phage therapy It does not rely on phage        themselves but on enzymes that phage produce to smash their way out of their host bacteria        so they can infect new hosts He and his colleagues employ these enzymes externally to kill        bacteria He reports We now have enzymes that will kill         Strep pyogenes  pneumococci         Strep pneumoniae          Bacillus anthracis          Enterococcus faecalis  and group B         Strep  The beauty of these enzymes is that they are targeted        killing You only kill the organism you intend to kill without destroying or affecting the        surrounding organisms that are necessary for health        The enzymes can be loaded into a nasal spray that wipes out pathogens such as         Pneumococcus          Staphylococcus  and group A         Strep on contact with mucous membranes The strategy might        prevent bacterial infections from spreading in close quarters like hospitals nursing        homes and daycare centers Fischetti says Clinical trials would tell us how often we had        to treat but more important wed have a reagent that could treat people who walk out the        door of the hospital to eliminate or reduce the transmission of resistant organisms into        the community We dont have that capability right now        Fischetti and his colleagues have moved on to using the enzymes systemically to wipe out                Bacillus anthracis spores preventing them from germinating and        seething through the bloodstream producing deadly toxins An IV drip would be started        after exposure to the spores The method Fischetti reports is already successful in mice        clinical trials will determine how long treatment must be continued perhaps a week or so        They have also eliminated septicemia from pneumocci with the same intravenous method        Up to now the enzymes must make contact with bacteria to kill but Fischetti is hoping        that a new generation of engineered enzymes will be able to kill pathogens inside cells        too A second disadvantage is that they are effective only against grampositive bacteria        although that group includes many vicious pathogens        But phage enzymes seem to offer one very big advantage resistance to them has yet to        develop Fischetti says Weve tried very hard to identify resistant bacteria but so far        we havent found resistant organisms in all three of the enzymes were working with It        appears to be a very rare event much rarer than resistance to antibiotics Fischetti        cautions against expecting that gladsome state to last forever but he points out that even        if widespread resistance takes the same  or  years that antibiotics required to become        significantly resistant phage enzymes could buy researchers decades for inventing other        approaches                    Antibiotics in the st Century        There is no shortage of ideas for unearthing new antibiotic candidates Why are they so        slow to enter medical practice The bottleneck researchers agree lies in the development        process of turning them into effective therapies Several researchers blame the big        pharmaceutical companies that got so big by leading the way to new drugs for battling        infectious disease but in recent years have dropped out Fischetti complains These are        the big companies that have the money to develop antiinfectives but they leave it to small        biotech companies and its not going to happen as rapidly as it should I think its        really unconscionable for these big companies to drop the ball because its not going to be        a billiondollar market for them and thats what theyre looking for        Half a billion at least says Francis Tally a big pharmaceuticals veteran who is now        chief scientific officer at Cubist Pharmaceuticals a biotech company located in Lexington        Massachusetts According to Tally Cubist produced daptomycin approved in September         by licensing it from Eli Lilly which shelved the new compound after concluding its        potential market was only  million        But Tally argues the size of the market is not the only barrier to new antibiotics        Combinatorial chemistry and the genomics revolution have simply not delivered on their        early promise The pipeline is very dry he says Theres been a real lag at the basic        research level        Antibiotic discovery is hard Shapiro says Its a huge long process to get a decent        antibiotic Walsh agrees Its easier to find inhibitors of particular enzymes for        particular processesand a very long road to convert that into something for        development        In the meantime there is a rising clamor to slow down the rate at which bacteria        develop resistance Doctors are exhorted to cut back on prescribing antibiotics and decline        to prescribe for viral diseases which antibiotics cant combat even when their patients        badger them        But even if antibiotic consumption slowed we will still need new antibiotics I always        say its not a matter of if its only a matter of when says Walsh There will always be        a need for new antibiotics because the clock starts ticking on the useful lifetime of any        antibiotic once you start to use it That cannot be argued
