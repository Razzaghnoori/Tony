 STARTING MONDAY IN Slate Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter chew over the news in The Breakfast Table And save your Sunday Skip the talk shows and let Pundit Central brief you on them it s posted late Sunday evening Length Matters Several readers complained about the length of last week s Slate on Paper This is the document available by e mail or download around midday each Friday containing a week s worth of Slate goodies nicely formatted for printout on standard size paper Last week s was especially long 85 pages because it included our annual Slate 60 list of rich people ranked by their contributions to charity But even in a normal week Slate on Paper has been running around 55 60 pages Meanwhile some America Online readers have complained about not getting their Slate e mail at all This was an AOL screw up but we ve straightened it out We hope As for the length problem We used to limit Slate on Paper to 44 pages Readers complained that we were leaving out their favorite stuff So a few weeks ago we asked readers whether they would prefer a file containing everything in Slate each week The overwhelming answer was yes Even though it will take longer to download Yes Even though it will require more pages to print out Yes You re absolutely sure are you Oh yes Because Mommy and Daddy don t want to send you a great big file if you re not going to want it Oh yes we want it So for those who think Slate on Paper is too long you re apparently in the minority And like all minorities in our melting pot society you should try to blend in and not be so conspicuous Keep quiet and work hard Consider marrying an include it all and raising the children that way They ll grow up to play golf and download the long version of Slate on Paper and you ll feel like a real American Many readers did raise a good question Why doesn t the Slate on Paper file allow you to choose which articles you wish to print out instead of all or nothing at all The answer as to so much in life is We re working on that Or as Slate s crack software development team puts it in the strange argot of their tribe Yeah yeah yeah we re working on that Meanwhile the editor has wasted far too much time poking around the many byways and cul de sacs of Microsoft Word looking for some quick and dirty solution to this dilemma Although we say so as a sister division of the same company Word is an amazing and underappreciated piece of software Amazing for the things it can do and underappreciated because no one knows about them No one knows about them primarily because software instruction manuals get thinner and thinner Even Word s online Help in recent versions an annoying talking paper clip that many people quite rightly refuse to interact with doesn t seem to know about some things the program can do What other industry besides software goes to the trouble of improving its product and then keeps the improvements a secret Nevertheless if you use the Microsoft Word version of Slate on Paper we also offer an Adobe Acrobat version a couple of Word s features can help you to print out just the articles you want They re a bit clumsy for this purpose but they do the job Outline View With the slate doc file on your screen on the View menu click Outline Or in later versions of Word click the fourth tiny box in the lower left corner of the Word window just above the page number If you then click 1 on the Outline toolbar that will have appeared with any luck you should get a list of Slate s departments from Today s Papers through The Fray At the left of each item is a plus sign If you click once on the plus sign you have selected that department You can then print the selection an option on the Word Print menu Or you can select and delete all the articles you don t want and print the whole remaining document Or if you want to get fancy you can create a blank document in a new window and then drag and drop the articles you want into it You also can double click the plus sign for any one listing or hit one of the higher numbers on the Outline toolbar to affect the whole file and expose various sub levels of headline posted date etc For departments such as Today s Papers Moneybox etc that consist of multiple items you can hit the plus sign and do your stuff for just the items you want Master Document view This is a recherch variation on Outline view also available on the View menu It allows you to turn various subdivisions of a file into separate files which you can then move around or otherwise submit to your will Try this Select a department you want to print it can t be the first one Today s Papers for some damned reason and hit the Create Subdocument toolbar icon It s a tiny horizontal rectangle inside a vertical rectangle with a turned down upper right flap just as you would have guessed Your selected piece is now a separate file set in an attractive gray box You can drag n drop the other stuff you want into that box double click the little square icon in the upper left corner of the box to expand the file then hit Print It might work There has got to be a way using these and other Word features such as macros templates fields styles and so on to make a simple selective printout menu that either could be built into each week s Slate on Paper file or could be offered as a downloadable tool What about using hidden text Hidden from screen view but printed Or visible on screen but not printed Or the automatic table of contents generator Could the whole text be turned into a table of contents What on earth for Strictly as an amateur the editor has tried them all and admits defeat Is there another amateur among Slate s readers who would like to pick up the challenge If you beat the pros to a solution we will name it after you and you ll be immortalized in this little corner of cyberspace
