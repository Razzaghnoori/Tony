        hi im wondering what what camping means to you   hi when i think of camping i think of of bugs  and sleeping bags and and tents uh like along the Appalachian Trail   oh very good thats sort of the same thing that that i do i dont think of um trailers and campers and all this stuff   no   um do you do much camping   i have never been camping   oh youve never been camping oh gee   no do you do much   well um yes and no and the uh i havent done much recently but um up until gee maybe five or six years ago i did a lot of it  and you know ive sorry   really uh where you live now or uh did you camp up in Maryland or   no um i used to live abroad and so i i camped a lot in um the Middle East and i was able to camp right in ruins which was always very exciting   oh okay oh i bet   and a bit exotic  for those who love bugs but         um and then when i used to come back to the states in summer wed often go up um to the lake country in New York with my brothers family and and do camping there   uhhuh oh okay well my cousin uh husband and and his uncle especially uh grew up camping together and uh they they just love it       and theyre planning a trip uh into Canada this i guess in about a year and theyre going to spend about a week and a half camping up there   and youre not going   no this is this is a a mans trip so   oh thats too bad   so theyre really looking forward to that   oh gee   so   i guess it makes a difference i grew up camping being in Girl Scouts and things like that so   and see i was i was never exposed to it   uhhuh uhhuh   so its i i feel like im a little bit too uh much of a city city mouse to try doing it   oh thats too bad i think the you know theres certainly a lot of aspects you would like but maybe not the you you know the Canada mens trip but some other you know a nice tent on the the shore of a lake and   whats the best part about it to to you the the quiet the getting away   right the and the the no telephone the gee whiz you go to bed when it gets dark and you get up when it gets light     man   yeah and um i guess just just the change from the rat race     now do you usually like do you usually go and theres lots of other people around or is it pretty much much isolated   no its uh its pretty isolated um and to me i like that i guess too although there are people i mean you know its really hard to get away   yeah   and i guess when when we did sites in in the Middle East of course it was with a group in order to make it safe   yes   but i mean wed go in different parts of the ruins and and things like that but we didnt even have tents there  we just sort of put out the sleeping roll   oh good grief         that that does sound neat but i dont think i ive got a quite enough nerve to do that       i know my husbands gone uh for several days on the Appalachian Trail before and he said that you can a lot of times you can go for you know a good day before youll see or meet anybody else on the trail   right   so its not for the faint of heart i dont think   right actually i just joined um the Appalachian Trail Walking Club or whatever they call it what uh and im very eager to to start uh i love to walk   oh uhhuh   and um im going to start with day trips though because i dont know the territory and all and im not sure um my son is not eager to go and  you know i think that that that might be a little eerie at first going alone     i think it would be yeah  well that sounds really neat     oh but you know im gonna try  well gee whiz i hope you get into camping some day just slowly   well i dont know uh we talk about sometimes going up to Chincoteague   oh yeah   and uh i maybe like you said start out slow and and kind of get used to it and find out that it maybe its not as bad as i i fear it might be   right i think that you know  i guess one time recently we went up to Maine and had planned to camp and you know the only site left when we got there was in the middle of a field and i said gee whiz for twenty dollars we can go down the road and get a a motel which we did and so that you know if the setting was right and that its its great but if its just   yeah
