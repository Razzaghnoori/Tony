 Gimme Some Skin Cruella De Vil Cruella De Vil If she doesn t scare you No evil thing will If your multiplex is like my multiplex and whose multiplex isn t when you go to a screening of 101 Dalmatians you will see six previews Here is what Hollywood is preparing for America s children a cat movie another cat movie an ape movie another ape movie a dog movie and another dog movie In the second dog movie the dog shares top billing with a dolphin The coming plague of animal films is nothing new The last few years have witnessed Babe animatronic pigs dogs sheep several Homeward Bound s dog and cat a couple of Free Willy s whale and countless others I have mercifully been able to forget Everywhere you turn some movie is preaching interspecies comity and rhapsodizing about animals superhuman intelligence Any day now I expect my cat to strike up a conversation with me probably about his three picture deal with Castle Rock No movie embraces animal propaganda with as much enthusiasm as the new 101 Dalmatians Disney s live action version of its old animated feature It is the heartwarming animal movie distilled into its purest form The cuddliest animals Dalmatian puppies are threatened with the most horrible fate clubbing skinning being turned into fur coats at the hands of the most villainous villainess Cruella De Vil Strangely we are supposed to revile Cruella for designing fur coats yet root for the hero Roger who designs violent mind numbing soul destroying video games Naturally Cruella gets her comeuppance a variety of Home Alone style agonies inflicted by farm animals This teaches the requisite moral lesson It is far better to torture a human being than to allow a single puppy to come to harm In the end the Dalmatians and their human masters live happily ever after Children cheer Animal rights groups coo Parents drive to the Pet Pantry to buy Dalmatian pups for Christmas After watching 101 Dalmatians I too wanted to drive to Pet Pantry to buy Dalmatian pups and skin em After 103 hectoring minutes of the movie I wondered What s wrong with Cruella De Vil What s wrong with a Dalmatian fur coat And where can I buy one How much is that doggie in the window While the ASPCA and PETA chapters compose their indignant letters to the editor and heat their vats of oil to a rolling boil let me explain There s nothing wrong with Dalmatians that a good furrier couldn t fix The movie 101 Dalmatians promises dogs that are good natured healthy intelligent resourceful gorgeous Except for the last part this is a lie Dalmatians are high strung They re hyperactive They bark too much They re bad with children They shed constantly They re hard to train The Dalmatians don t even perform tricks in 101 Dalmatians An Airedale does the tough stunts the Dalmatians merely bark on cue They re ill suited to living indoors Many of them are deaf and all of them are dumb They are in short lousy pets This inspires an equation Beauty plus difficult temperament equals fur We do it to minks We do it to foxes Why not to Dalmatians Cruella has it right A fur coat preserves what is desirable about Dalmatians their beauty and eliminates what is undesirable everything else There are two main objections to Dalmatian fur coats The first is principled Fur is wrong It barbarically exploits animals it s unnecessary and so on To this I offer only the standard fur industry reply Fur farming doesn t have to be cruel Minks live longer on fur farms than they do in the wild Dalmatians one imagines could roam more freely on a large farm than in a cramped urban apartment And Dalmatian farmers would not simply kill Dalmatians for their fur Dog meat is prized in other parts of the world It used to be in the United States too on his Western expedition with Clark Meriwether Lewis raved about it Dalmatian farmers can set up shop in places where dog meat is eaten Maybe Dalmatian burger is an ecologically efficient substitute for beef though it might dampen enthusiasm for McDonald s current 101 Dalmatians promotional campaign The second objection to Dalmatian farming is visceral The mere thought of farming dogs for fur nauseates you With this objection I sympathize Dogs are charming People love their dogs even their Dalmatians They see something grotesque in the idea of making them into winter outerwear It offends common decency Yet we do cruel things to animals smart animals affectionate animals cute animals all the time People raised on farms understand this Pigs are sociable loving and a hell of a lot brighter than Dalmatians Have you seen what gets done to them Do farmers weep about it Calves are adorable But veal is delicious Of course it is argued the dog man s best friend the family pet is different So says modern bourgeois America which has turned the pet into a full fledged member of the nuclear family even more sacred than other human beings such as curmudgeonly aunts Disney by anthropomorphizing its critters exploits this American mushy mindedness and makes us forget that pets are in the end just animals But God gave man dominion over the beasts of the earth If an animal has economic utility we should farm it In 1991 when Disney re released the animated 101 Dalmatians demand for Dalmatians soared Here is a prediction This December it will happen again Tens of thousands of children will hound their parents into buying charming Dalmatian pups for Christmas As before many of those charming pups will in two years grow up into charmless dogs Hundreds of them perhaps thousands will be abandoned or dropped at the pound They will be shut up in cages Later they will be euthanized Now why is that better than becoming a fur coat
