 Does Crime Pay Criminals by and large must be risk lovers otherwise they d be car wash attendants instead of criminals Lottery players by and large must be risk lovers otherwise they d buy Treasury bonds instead of lottery tickets You might be tempted to conclude that criminals and lottery players are often the same people That s probably the wrong conclusion After all risk lovers enjoy having all their eggs in one basket which suggests they should pursue either crime or the lottery but not both Still if you want to understand what attracts people to crime it pays to understand what attracts people to risky activities more generally so it pays to understand what attracts people to the lottery Lotteries are attractive when they offer big prizes or relatively good odds If you re running a lottery and you re going to pay out 10 million you can offer a single 10 million jackpot or you can offer 10 prizes of 1 million each Which is more appealing to the players Usually the former For the most part lottery players prefer a small chance of a big payout to a bigger chance of a smaller payout That s because the people who prefer a bigger chance of a smaller payout are buying certificates of deposit not lottery tickets So if you want to make the lottery more attractive it s better to double the size of the jackpot than to double the number of winners More precisely doubling the number of winners makes the lottery more attractive to the sort of person who never buys lottery tickets anyway while doubling the jackpot makes it more attractive to the sort of person who might actually be tempted to play Now let s apply the same reasoning to criminal deterrence For the most part criminals prefer a small chance of a big punishment to a big chance of a small punishment That s because the people who prefer a big chance of a small punishment go into punishing careers like construction work or coal mining instead of crime So if you want to make crime less attractive to criminals it s better to double the odds of conviction than to double the severity of the punishment Add 10 percent to the length of the average jail sentence and crime will fall Add 10 percent to the conviction rate instead and crime will fall even further Like any risk lovers criminals are out to beat the odds so they get particularly demoralized when the odds turn against them So much for the theory now to the facts What s true of the lottery should be true at the racetrack And gambling consultant Maury Wolff confirms that if you re designing a complicated bet like a trifecta the way to generate the most action per dollar s worth of prize money and hence the most profit for the track is to offer very large prizes at very long odds Why then do the tracks continue to offer bets with much smaller payoffs According to Wolff it s because big prize winners take their money and go home while small prize winners plow their winnings back into the next race That sets up an interesting trade off for the track owner One big prize maximizes profit on the current race while several small prizes maximize the action on the next race Interesting as that trade off may be it s largely irrelevant to the main point which is that players like big prizes and long odds On another interesting tangent Wolff asked me whether there s something inherently corrupt about a system where the proceeds from state lotteries are used to fund school systems that then have an incentive to produce the kind of students who will go out and play the lottery With regard to crime let s consider the most spectacular of all crimes murder Here the expert is Professor Isaac Ehrlich who in the mid 70s pioneered the use of sophisticated statistical techniques to measure deterrent effects of conviction and punishment Together with Professor Zhiqiang Liu Ehrlich has recently revisited the subject refuting his most vocal critics and offering new evidence in support of his original conclusion Increase the number of convictions by 1 percent and to a very rough approximation the murder rate falls by about 1 percent Increase the number of executions by 1 percent which amounts to increasing the severity of the average punishment and again to a very rough approximation the murder rate falls by about half a percent These numbers are based on evidence from the 1940s and 1950s Capital punishment studies tend to focus on decades with more executions and hence more data As the theory predicts convictions matter more than punishments That s not to say that punishments don t matter Executions may be a less effective deterrent than convictions but they are nevertheless an extremely powerful deterrent according to Ehrlich s numbers one additional execution in 1950 could well have prevented over 20 murders I am grateful to Ehrlich for that amazingly strong result because I use it to illustrate three points that I m always eager to drive home to my students First incentives matter even to murderers Second economic theory predicts that some incentives matter more than others and the data confirm the theory Executions prevent murders but convictions prevent even more murders And finally if you want to give policy advice it s not enough to know your numbers You ve also got to know your values Isaac Ehrlich the man who proved to the satisfaction of the economics profession that capital punishment works is a passionate opponent of capital punishment
