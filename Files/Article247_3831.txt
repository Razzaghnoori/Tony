 The Quayling of Al Gore If to bork means to tar someone as a political extremist and to get a lewinsky means well you know then to quayle someone means to make some personal limitation seem so overwhelmingly ridiculous that the victim becomes a permanent national laughingstock The question of whether Dan Quayle was in fact significantly denser than a lot of other politicians I d argue he was only somewhat denser became irrelevant in the face of an entertaining clich Try as he might Quayle couldn t get anyone to take him seriously as a presidential candidate because all that the national press corps and the national joke writing corps wanted from him was material that confirmed his dumbbell stereotype The same thing appears to be happening to Quayle s successor as vice president In Al Gore s case the drubbing is for a slightly more vague constellation of qualities such as dullness starchiness aloofness pomposity condescension privilege and political klutziness There s an element of truth to these criticisms But by becoming a shtick the observation of these qualities threatens to obliterate not only Gore s corresponding virtues but also any hope of his becoming president Every minor misstep that Gore makes becomes grist for the Gore abuse mill And whatever Gore does to try to correct these flaws whether it s playing along by mocking himself or trying to demonstrate his authenticity and ordinary guy ness only digs the hole deeper When Gore hires a bunch of inside the Beltway political hacks and pretends there s no contest for the nomination he s a risible Washington stiff When he upends his campaign yanks off his necktie and engages his opponent he s a risible Washington stiff trying to be what he s not For an argument that Gore s makeover may be taking see William Saletan s Frame Game Here are a few examples of what Gore is up against culled from The Hotline over the last few days Jeff Greenfield of CNN There is that problem that Gore has always had as a candidate and so that when he doesn t wear a tie and this may be unfair but I don t think so you have the sense that somebody some clothing engineer consultant said Al you know use we need the softer tones and then they take a focus group You like the shirt buttoned or not Imus 10 14 Howard Fineman of Newsweek He s sort of turning himself into a combination of Walter Mondale and Dick Gephardt the lunch bucket street corner Democrat the guy who grew up on Wisconsin Avenue Hardball 10 13 R W Apple of the New York Times Now he says he is trying to let it all hang out The very phrase sounds unnatural coming from a man whose shoes are always polished whose hair is always combed whose shirts and suits are always crisply pressed All He doesn t even let his shirt tail hang out New York Times 10 11 Jay Leno of the Tonight Show The folks in Nashville are thrilled that Al Gore has moved his campaign headquarters back there Because with him there that automatically qualifies them for disaster relief funds Now did you see Gore yesterday He asked people to join his new this is what he called it his new rip tootin campaign If you believe he is going to win with that slogan you re either ripped or you ve been tootin 10 7 On the campaign trail this mockery translates into a damned if you do damned if you don t dynamic Take Gore s endorsement yesterday by the AFL CIO Had Gore failed to secure this prize the story would have been played as more woe for the troubled Gore campaign or possibly last straw for troubled Gore campaign Gaining the endorsement however merely made Gore into Walter Mondale II a Democratic establishmentarian whose ability to lock up the party s offiical interest groups won t translate into rank and file enthusiasm Here s how Peter Jennings played the AFL CIO endorsement on ABC last night In Los Angeles good news mostly for Vice President Gore depending on how the political media spin it in part Memo to Peter Jennings You are the political media But there s a silver lining for Gore If the public really demands candidates with a flair for schmoozing smooth talk and ersatz empathy then Clinton fatigue must be something of a myth
