 Ideas Optimism Compassion Jack Kemp is a man of ideas Jack Kemp is compassionate a self described bleeding heart conservative Jack Kemp is optimistic These are the three great strengths Kemp is said to bring to the Republican ticket And the downside Judging from the media coverage Kemp s only problem is that he may be too good for the job too reasonable for his extreme conservative party too idealistic to get along with the world weary Bob Dole too boyishly bumptious to sit quietly in second place Kemp is neither a phony nor a cynic He is sincere well meaning and impossible not to like But he has gotten an amazing free pass since Dole chose him last week on his three alleged strengths Take his so called ideas Kemp does indeed love ideas But he loves them the way a rare book collector loves his leather volumes He loves to acquire them own them fondle them display them everything but open them up and read them Similarly Kemp adds ideas to his collection supply side economics the gold standard enterprise zones school vouchers then immediately puts them behind glass A real man of ideas loves to play with ideas Kemp just loves to repeat them It s laughably easy to get a reputation as a thinker in Washington At least Kemp unlike the last man of ideas in American politics Gary Hart does not posture as the chin pulling philosopher Indeed his self deprecating I m just a dumb jock routine inoculates him against charges of intellectual pretension But Kemp will for example ostentatiously throw out the full name of a 19 th century French economist Jean Baptiste Say as a way of implying incorrectly that he has more than the vaguest notion of what Say s Law supply creates its own demand is about other than knowing that it includes the magic word supply Reporters are impressed And if they aren t completely buffaloed they still give Kemp points for effort and obvious sincerity Even an empty enthusiasm for ideas is appealing in a party whose other leaders Dole Speaker Newt Gingrich Chairman Haley Barbour claim not to have read their own platform Like the first names of dead economists the blizzard of statistics that blows through Kemp s oeuvre of op eds gives an impression of learning But Jack Kemp is a propagandist not a thinker One small example In the New York Times last February arguing surprise surprise that tax cuts will increase tax revenues Kemp wrote In the 1980s taxes were lowered from a top marginal rate of 70 percent to 28 percent By the end of the decade America s real gross domestic product surged by 32 percent A little math reveals that this surge implies average annual GDP growth of 2 8 percent not too different from the 2 5 percent growth of recent years that Kemp claims is woefully inadequate And the difference as Jodie Allen pointed out in Slate a while back can be fully accounted for by the ironic fact that government spending which is part of GDP grew in the Reaganite 80s and is shrinking in the Clintonite 90s Kemp s writings have no more inaccuracies misleading statistics and fallacious arguments than those of most other politicians But a glaring internal contradiction is especially telling for a would be man of ideas It suggests that you are not subjecting your own ideas to even the minimal test of logical consistency What s usually missing from Kemp s ideas is the intellectual discipline of acknowledging that more of this means less of that Regarding abortion Kemp says My premise is that both the mother the woman and the child the unborn should have constitutional protections for life and freedom It would be lovely if a woman s freedom to choose didn t conflict with a fetus claim on life But the notion that this can be arranged is a magic wish not an idea The same defect mars Kemp s compassion Journalists seem to regard bleeding heart conservative as a charming anomaly or a welcome melding of extremes into moderation rather than as a mathematical conundrum Kemp is in favor of expensive programs for the poor He also favors giant tax cuts for the rich And he opposes any cuts in middle class entitlements It is a remarkable coincidence that none of Kemp s ideas for helping the poor which get him so much credit for being compassionate involves any effort or sacrifice by the affluent and the middle class Quite the contrary They almost invariably involve tax breaks for these groups No doubt Kemp sincerely believes in the supply side alchemy And no doubt his personal compassion for society s downtrodden is real But as public policy cost free compassion is worth about what it costs Which brings us to optimism I too would be optimistic if I thought most of our social problems could be solved by lower taxes for everyone even lower taxes for rich people no taxes at all for residents of Washington D C yes Kemp has proposed a zero tax rate for K Street lawyers and Georgetown socialites and that the more you cut people s taxes the more money will flood into the federal treasury But believing that requires more than a leap of faith It requires a leap of reason It s easy to be optimistic if you believe in the tooth fairy Kemp seems to think that those who refuse to leap with him actually prefer pain sacrifice and root canal economics And it s probably true that psychological predisposition as much as reason and intellect leads dour characters like Paul Tsongas and until the other day Bob Dole to be preachers of sacrifice while sunny characters like Jack Kemp become apologists for alchemy But it s silly to prize optimism for its own sake in a public figure irrespective of whether that optimism is justified Indeed unjustified optimism is more dangerous than unjustified pessimism Unless that is just a dour predisposition talking The main reason the media have greeted Jack Kemp so rapturously isn t his ideas his optimism or his compassion It is simple dog like gratitude for a reason to declare the presidential race more interesting And credit for that compassionate optimistic idea goes to cruel brain dead sourpuss Bob Dole So credit given Now let s give Kemp the going over he deserves Michael Kinsley is editor of Slate
