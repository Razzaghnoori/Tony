                            The consequence of Parkinsons disease PD is well described a progressive movement        disorder that whilst responding to symptomatic therapy chronically disables its sufferers        and adds an enormous economic burden in an aging society We have some clues to the process        underlying the disease from the snapshot provided by postmortem studies of diseased brains        Groups of neurons in specific brain regions are lost notably those that produce dopamine        in a part of the midbrain called the substantia nigra Those neurons that do survive to the        end of the disease course contain accumulations of proteins and lipids within their        cytoplasm Named after their discoverer these Lewy bodies are one piece of evidence that        protein aggregation is related to the ongoing disease process        In contrast the causes of PD are poorly defined except in those rare variant forms that        are clearly genetic Several families have been described where PDlike syndromes are        inherited in either a dominant or recessive fashion and four of the underlying genes have        been identified The precise relationships between these different syndromes are complex        and are the subject of some controversy For example it is not clear whether all the        genetic diseases given PARK nomenclature have Lewy bodies and should be considered true        PDthe term parkinsonism is preferred for these syndromes Hardy and Langston  For        the purposes of this primer I will concentrate on the molecular biology of the genes        linked to PD rather than disease etiology However my assumption is that symptoms of the        disease are a reflection of neuronal dysfunction and that in the disease state the balance        between damage and survival tips in the direction of cell loss Whilst dominant mutations        overwhelm the ability of cells to survive recessive mutations result in the absence of        protective proteins and make the neuron grow weaker                    Aggregation of Synuclein in Neurodegeneration        On the detrimental side of the cell survival equation is the PD gene that was discovered        first         synuclein  The synaptic protein encoded by this gene synuclein is        prone to aggregation and as is the case for other aggregating proteins mutations in         synuclein are associated with dominantly inherited disease Related to        this synuclein is a major protein component of Lewy bodies The phenotype of patients        with         synuclein mutations varies from PD to a more diffuse Lewy body disease in        which pathology is detected in the cerebral cortex and other areas of the brain Mutations        in         synuclein include three point mutations AP EK and AT and        multiplication of the wildtype normal gene All of these mutations increase the tendency        of synuclein to aggregate suggesting that disease is a consequence of protein        aggregation An interesting example is the triplication of the wildtype gene toxicity and        aggregation can both be driven by increased expression and are thus qualitative not        quantitative effects Singleton et al  The fact that the wildtype protein can        aggregate suggests that the process is fundamentally similar for both inherited and        sporadic PD in which wildtype synuclein is also present in Lewy bodies Several        commentators have suggested that nongenetic risk factors may also promote damage via their        effects on wildtype synuclein conformation or aggregation eg Di Monte  This        reinforces the notion that synuclein is central to the pathogenesis of both sporadic and        familial PD        There is some controversy about the exact nature of the toxic species produced by        synuclein as one point mutation AP behaves differently from the others Instead of        forming fibrils which are insoluble highmolecularweight species AP forms relatively        soluble partially aggregated species Conway et al  These intermediatesized        protein aggregates are referred to as oligomers or protofibrils Some authors have argued        that since AP causes disease oligomersprotofibrils are the authentic toxic species It        is generally assumed that fibrils are the form of synuclein deposited into Lewy bodies        but whether Lewy bodies damage cells is controversial One possibility is that by        sequestering synuclein into this insoluble body and compartmentalizing the potentially        toxic species away from possible targets in the cytoplasm the Lewy body represents an        attempt of the cell to protect itself Olanow et al         Whether the Lewy body is damaging or neuroprotective there are clearly several possible        targets for toxic synuclein within the cell For example aggregated synuclein can        permeabilize cellular membranes and thus might damage organelles Volles and Lansbury         Mitochondrial function and synaptic transmission may be especially affected and        both of these can secondarily increase oxidative stress within the cytosol Greenamyre and        Hastings  When overexpressed mutant synuclein can inhibit the proteasome        Petrucelli et al  a multiprotein complex that degrades many unwanted or        inappropriate proteins in cells Mutant forms of synuclein also inhibit        chaperonemediated autophagy another important protein turnover pathway that involves        lysosomes Cuervo et al  Between these two effects it is likely that cells with        aggregated synuclein will become less able to handle damaged or misfolded proteins It is        also possible that other cellular processes that we have not yet identified are affected by        the presence of this protein that has such an innate tendency to aggregate        Presumably neurons require synuclein for their normal function and thus cannot simply        dispense with this protein that has toxic properties although mice in which the         synuclein gene is knocked out have no obvious deficits see Dauer and        Przedborski  for discussion                    Parkin DJ and PINK in Neuroprotection        Evolution has provided cells with many ways to protect themselves As we will see        mutations that cause recessive diseases result in the loss of these neuroprotective        functions The genes involved in recessive parkinsonism are in order of discovery         parkin DJ and         PINK  The three protein products of these genes all have different        functions thus implicating several different cellular functions in neuroprotection Parkin        is an E ubiquitinprotein ligase promoting the addition of ubiquitin to target proteins        prior to their degradation by the proteasome The identification of parkins function was        facilitated by the observation that the protein contains a RING finger Zhang et al         a common motif amongst this class of E enzymes Several parkin substrates have been        proposed and at least two are damaging to neurons if they are allowed to accumulate Dong        et al  Yang et al  Therefore our best evidence to date indicates that parkin        benefits neurons by removing proteins that might otherwise damage the cell In fact        expression of parkin is neuroprotective in a number of contexts and there is even evidence        for a beneficial effect of this E ligase on mitochondrial function Shen and Cookson                Data on PINK are limited but the protein contains two motifs that indicate its likely        cellular role At the aminoterminus of PINK is a mitochondrialtargeting sequence and        mitochondrial localization has been confirmed in the one study published to date Valente        et al  Most of the rest of PINK is a SerineThreonine protein kinase domain        followed by a short carboxyterminal region of unclear significance The substrates of        PINK have not yet been identified but presumably phosphorylation of these substrates        controls some critical function for neuronal survival In their paper Valente and        colleagues show that PINK decreases damage to mitochondria induced by proteasome        inhibition but a recessive mutant PINK is unable to protect cells        The discussion of protein functions gets more complicated in the case of DJ Unlike        parkin or PINK there are no motifs within DJ that hint strongly at a single function        Instead         DJ is a member of a large superfamily of genes with several different        functions across species Bandyopadhyay and Cookson  These include proteases in        thermophilic bacteria transcription factors and chaperones that promote protein        refolding Several research groups have published data in support of DJ having one or        more of these activities including the report published in this issue of         PLoS Biology  that DJ is a molecular chaperone that regulates        synuclein among other molecules Shendelman et al  It is not yet firmly        established which activity of DJ is most relevant to recessive parkinsonism The        important function of DJ might be unrelated to any of the above activities For example        there are several roles of this protein in modulation of transcriptional responses which        may be critical in maintaining neuronal viability Bonifati et al  and references        therein        DJ is also known to be responsive to oxidative conditions under which cysteine        residues are oxidized to form cysteinesulfinic acids There is some discussion about which        cysteine residue is oxidized the most likely is cysteine  which is present in a        nucleophile elbow in the protein We have suggested that modifying this residue precludes        DJ oxidation under mild conditions and also blocks the neuroprotective activity of DJ        against mitochondrial toxicity CanetAviles et al  Therefore whatever the function        of DJ it seems to be related to oxidation In support of this idea cells with         DJ knocked out show increased sensitivity to oxidative stress Yokota        et al  Another study published in this issue of         PLoS Biology shows that dopamine neurons differentiated from embryonic        stem cells lacking functional DJ are especially sensitive to oxidative stress Martinat        et al         This discussion indicates that the genes responsible for recessive parkinsonism all have        different functions but are all in a broad sense neuroprotective A very difficult        question to answer is whether this has anything to do with synuclein We have shown that        parkin can mitigate the toxicity of mutant synuclein Petrucelli et al  Although        there are reports that a proportion of synuclein is a parkin substrate Shimura et al         most of the protein is not degraded by the ubiquitinproteasome system Recent        evidence points instead to an important role of the lysosome the other major pathway        within cells for degrading unwanted proteins in clearing synuclein Cuervo et al         On balance therefore there is no direct evidence that parkin controls synuclein        toxicity by an effect on protein levels within the cell Furthermore parkin does not just        prevent synuclein toxicity it is beneficial against several other stresses discussed in        Shen and Cookson  leading to the possibility that this protein protects neurons        against more than just the processes implicated in PD        It has also been suggested that DJ can prevent the accumulation of aggregated        synuclein and that cysteine  is critical for this activity Shendelman et al         However DJ is not just a chaperone for synuclein it can also promote refolding of        citrate synthase glutathione transferase and neurofilament light Other research groups        have reported similar findings Olzmann et al  although there are differences        between these studies in which cysteine residues are thought to be required for DJ        function Given that there are some differences in these results further clarification of        the role for DJ in synucleinmediated toxicity is needed More generally we have to        bear in mind that whether recessive parkinsonism has anything to do with synuclein is        still an open question What is clear is that some neurons rely on         parkin DJ or         PINK to protect themselves against the many stresses that they face        However mutations in these genes do not cause generalized neurodegeneration in fact they        tend to be more restricted and less progressive than for example synuclein mutations        This suggests at least to my mind that recessive mutations indicate something about the        neurons that are damaged in these disorders Why is this of more than academic importance        Perhaps by identifying the proximal events that are sufficient to cause a specific set of        neurons to degenerate we might begin to design therapies that address the underlying        degeneration in PD and not just the consequences
