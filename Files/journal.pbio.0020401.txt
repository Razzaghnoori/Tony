 The consequence of Parkinson s disease PD is well described a progressive movement disorder that whilst responding to symptomatic therapy chronically disables its sufferers and adds an enormous economic burden in an aging society We have some clues to the process underlying the disease from the snapshot provided by postmortem studies of diseased brains Groups of neurons in specific brain regions are lost notably those that produce dopamine in a part of the midbrain called the substantia nigra Those neurons that do survive to the end of the disease course contain accumulations of proteins and lipids within their cytoplasm Named after their discoverer these Lewy bodies are one piece of evidence that protein aggregation is related to the ongoing disease process In contrast the causes of PD are poorly defined except in those rare variant forms that are clearly genetic Several families have been described where PD like syndromes are inherited in either a dominant or recessive fashion and four of the underlying genes have been identified The precise relationships between these different syndromes are complex and are the subject of some controversy For example it is not clear whether all the genetic diseases given PARK nomenclature have Lewy bodies and should be considered true PD the term parkinsonism is preferred for these syndromes Hardy and Langston 2004 For the purposes of this primer I will concentrate on the molecular biology of the genes linked to PD rather than disease etiology However my assumption is that symptoms of the disease are a reflection of neuronal dysfunction and that in the disease state the balance between damage and survival tips in the direction of cell loss Whilst dominant mutations overwhelm the ability of cells to survive recessive mutations result in the absence of protective proteins and make the neuron grow weaker Aggregation of Synuclein in Neurodegeneration On the detrimental side of the cell survival equation is the PD gene that was discovered first synuclein The synaptic protein encoded by this gene synuclein is prone to aggregation and as is the case for other aggregating proteins mutations in synuclein are associated with dominantly inherited disease Related to this synuclein is a major protein component of Lewy bodies The phenotype of patients with synuclein mutations varies from PD to a more diffuse Lewy body disease in which pathology is detected in the cerebral cortex and other areas of the brain Mutations in synuclein include three point mutations A30P E46K and A53T and multiplication of the wild type normal gene All of these mutations increase the tendency of synuclein to aggregate suggesting that disease is a consequence of protein aggregation An interesting example is the triplication of the wild type gene toxicity and aggregation can both be driven by increased expression and are thus qualitative not quantitative effects Singleton et al 2003 The fact that the wild type protein can aggregate suggests that the process is fundamentally similar for both inherited and sporadic PD in which wild type synuclein is also present in Lewy bodies Several commentators have suggested that non genetic risk factors may also promote damage via their effects on wild type synuclein conformation or aggregation e g Di Monte 2003 This reinforces the notion that synuclein is central to the pathogenesis of both sporadic and familial PD There is some controversy about the exact nature of the toxic species produced by synuclein as one point mutation A30P behaves differently from the others Instead of forming fibrils which are insoluble high molecular weight species A30P forms relatively soluble partially aggregated species Conway et al 2000 These intermediate sized protein aggregates are referred to as oligomers or protofibrils Some authors have argued that since A30P causes disease oligomers protofibrils are the authentic toxic species It is generally assumed that fibrils are the form of synuclein deposited into Lewy bodies but whether Lewy bodies damage cells is controversial One possibility is that by sequestering synuclein into this insoluble body and compartmentalizing the potentially toxic species away from possible targets in the cytoplasm the Lewy body represents an attempt of the cell to protect itself Olanow et al 2004 Whether the Lewy body is damaging or neuroprotective there are clearly several possible targets for toxic synuclein within the cell For example aggregated synuclein can permeabilize cellular membranes and thus might damage organelles Volles and Lansbury 2003 Mitochondrial function and synaptic transmission may be especially affected and both of these can secondarily increase oxidative stress within the cytosol Greenamyre and Hastings 2004 When overexpressed mutant synuclein can inhibit the proteasome Petrucelli et al 2002 a multiprotein complex that degrades many unwanted or inappropriate proteins in cells Mutant forms of synuclein also inhibit chaperone mediated autophagy another important protein turnover pathway that involves lysosomes Cuervo et al 2004 Between these two effects it is likely that cells with aggregated synuclein will become less able to handle damaged or misfolded proteins It is also possible that other cellular processes that we have not yet identified are affected by the presence of this protein that has such an innate tendency to aggregate Presumably neurons require synuclein for their normal function and thus cannot simply dispense with this protein that has toxic properties although mice in which the synuclein gene is knocked out have no obvious deficits see Dauer and Przedborski 2003 for discussion Parkin DJ 1 and PINK1 in Neuroprotection Evolution has provided cells with many ways to protect themselves As we will see mutations that cause recessive diseases result in the loss of these neuroprotective functions The genes involved in recessive parkinsonism are in order of discovery parkin DJ 1 and PINK1 The three protein products of these genes all have different functions thus implicating several different cellular functions in neuroprotection Parkin is an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase promoting the addition of ubiquitin to target proteins prior to their degradation by the proteasome The identification of parkin s function was facilitated by the observation that the protein contains a RING finger Zhang et al 2000 a common motif amongst this class of E3 enzymes Several parkin substrates have been proposed and at least two are damaging to neurons if they are allowed to accumulate Dong et al 2003 Yang et al 2003 Therefore our best evidence to date indicates that parkin benefits neurons by removing proteins that might otherwise damage the cell In fact expression of parkin is neuroprotective in a number of contexts and there is even evidence for a beneficial effect of this E3 ligase on mitochondrial function Shen and Cookson 2004 Data on PINK1 are limited but the protein contains two motifs that indicate its likely cellular role At the amino terminus of PINK1 is a mitochondrial targeting sequence and mitochondrial localization has been confirmed in the one study published to date Valente et al 2004 Most of the rest of PINK1 is a Serine Threonine protein kinase domain followed by a short carboxy terminal region of unclear significance The substrates of PINK1 have not yet been identified but presumably phosphorylation of these substrates controls some critical function for neuronal survival In their paper Valente and colleagues show that PINK1 decreases damage to mitochondria induced by proteasome inhibition but a recessive mutant PINK1 is unable to protect cells The discussion of protein functions gets more complicated in the case of DJ 1 Unlike parkin or PINK1 there are no motifs within DJ 1 that hint strongly at a single function Instead DJ 1 is a member of a large superfamily of genes with several different functions across species Bandyopadhyay and Cookson 2004 These include proteases in thermophilic bacteria transcription factors and chaperones that promote protein refolding Several research groups have published data in support of DJ 1 having one or more of these activities including the report published in this issue of PLoS Biology that DJ 1 is a molecular chaperone that regulates synuclein among other molecules Shendelman et al 2004 It is not yet firmly established which activity of DJ 1 is most relevant to recessive parkinsonism The important function of DJ 1 might be unrelated to any of the above activities For example there are several roles of this protein in modulation of transcriptional responses which may be critical in maintaining neuronal viability Bonifati et al 2003 and references therein DJ 1 is also known to be responsive to oxidative conditions under which cysteine residues are oxidized to form cysteine sulfinic acids There is some discussion about which cysteine residue is oxidized the most likely is cysteine 106 which is present in a nucleophile elbow in the protein We have suggested that modifying this residue precludes DJ 1 oxidation under mild conditions and also blocks the neuroprotective activity of DJ 1 against mitochondrial toxicity Canet Aviles et al 2004 Therefore whatever the function of DJ 1 it seems to be related to oxidation In support of this idea cells with DJ 1 knocked out show increased sensitivity to oxidative stress Yokota et al 2003 Another study published in this issue of PLoS Biology shows that dopamine neurons differentiated from embryonic stem cells lacking functional DJ 1 are especially sensitive to oxidative stress Martinat et al 2004 This discussion indicates that the genes responsible for recessive parkinsonism all have different functions but are all in a broad sense neuroprotective A very difficult question to answer is whether this has anything to do with synuclein We have shown that parkin can mitigate the toxicity of mutant synuclein Petrucelli et al 2002 Although there are reports that a proportion of synuclein is a parkin substrate Shimura et al 2001 most of the protein is not degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system Recent evidence points instead to an important role of the lysosome the other major pathway within cells for degrading unwanted proteins in clearing synuclein Cuervo et al 2004 On balance therefore there is no direct evidence that parkin controls synuclein toxicity by an effect on protein levels within the cell Furthermore parkin does not just prevent synuclein toxicity it is beneficial against several other stresses discussed in Shen and Cookson 2004 leading to the possibility that this protein protects neurons against more than just the processes implicated in PD It has also been suggested that DJ 1 can prevent the accumulation of aggregated synuclein and that cysteine 53 is critical for this activity Shendelman et al 2004 However DJ 1 is not just a chaperone for synuclein it can also promote refolding of citrate synthase glutathione transferase and neurofilament light Other research groups have reported similar findings Olzmann et al 2004 although there are differences between these studies in which cysteine residues are thought to be required for DJ 1 function Given that there are some differences in these results further clarification of the role for DJ 1 in synuclein mediated toxicity is needed More generally we have to bear in mind that whether recessive parkinsonism has anything to do with synuclein is still an open question What is clear is that some neurons rely on parkin DJ 1 or PINK1 to protect themselves against the many stresses that they face However mutations in these genes do not cause generalized neurodegeneration in fact they tend to be more restricted and less progressive than for example synuclein mutations This suggests at least to my mind that recessive mutations indicate something about the neurons that are damaged in these disorders Why is this of more than academic importance Perhaps by identifying the proximal events that are sufficient to cause a specific set of neurons to degenerate we might begin to design therapies that address the underlying degeneration in PD and not just the consequences
