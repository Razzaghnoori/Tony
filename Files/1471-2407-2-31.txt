 Background Regular use of aspirin and other non steroidal anti inflammatory dugs NSAIDs has been consistently associated with reduced risk of colorectal cancer and adenoma 1 2 3 4 possibly due to NSAID related inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis enhancement of cellular immune response or induction of apoptosis 5 6 7 8 A number of epidemiological studies have investigated the potential protective effect of NSAIDs with respect to other cancer sites There is some evidence that regular and prolonged NSAID use is associated with reduced risk of cancers of the esophagus 3 9 10 stomach 3 9 11 ovary 12 13 and female breast 14 15 16 Although there is a growing body of epidemiological evidence on the role of aspirin and other NSAIDs in the chemoprevention of lung cancer Table 1 14 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 about half of these studies published to date were not specifically designed to investigate this association 17 18 19 21 In a randomized trial aimed at examining the effect of aspirin in the prevention of cardiovascular disease in male physicians Peto et al 17 first noted lower lung cancer mortality rates in the aspirin intervention group compared to the placebo group Two subsequent cohort studies demonstrated associations with regular 18 or frequent aspirin use 19 among women but not men In contrast in a prospective analysis of the NHANES I follow up study Schreinemachers Everson 14 reported lower incidence of lung cancer only among men classified as recent aspirin users Rosenberg 20 observed no strong evidence for a chemopreventive role of aspirin in a hospital based case control study whereas Langman et al 21 in a record based case control study reported a borderline significant risk reduction associated with frequent prescriptions of NSAIDs Most recently results from a case control study nested within the NYU Women s Health Study 22 indicated that women classified as regular aspirin users were at a marked and statistically significant reduced risk of non small cell lung cancer NSCLC compared to women classified as non users however no significant associations were observed for all histological types combined Another recent case control study investigated the effect of aspirin on lung cancer risk in a sample of heavy smokers 23 Results indicated that daily aspirin use was strongly associated with reduced risk this effect was apparent for both men and women We conducted a hospital based case control study to further investigate the overall association between aspirin use and lung cancer risk and to add to the limited body of evidence on the potential effect modifying roles of tumor histology and cigarette smoking on the chemopreventive role of aspirin in lung tumorigenesis Methods Study population The study population included individuals who received medical services at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute RPCI between 1982 and 1998 and who agreed to complete a comprehensive epidemiological questionnaire Informed consent was obtained from all participants The case group consisted of 868 individuals with primary incident lung cancer identified from the RPCI tumor registry and Diagnostic Index Controls included 935 individuals randomly selected from a pool of 7957 eligible individuals who received medical services at RPCI for non neoplastic conditions These participants came to RPCI with a suspicion of neoplastic disease but were not diagnosed with either benign or malignant conditions The most frequently utilized services among the controls were carried out in the breast clinic 13 dermatology clinic 12 gastrointestinal clinic 15 and sarcoma melanoma clinic 15 The remaining controls were seen in a variety of clinics at our institute including gynecological oncology hematology head and neck radiotherapy and urology however the proportion of controls seen at these clinics was less than five percent of all control participants Controls were frequency matched to cases on sex and five year age intervals Questionnaire All participants completed the Patient Epidemiology Data System PEDS questionnaire which is offered to all new patients as part of the admission process and is returned by approximately 50 percent of new patients The 16 page instrument covers information on tobacco and alcohol consumption family history of cancer occupational and environmental exposures reproductive and medical histories and diet The instrument also assesses aspirin use relevant to the period prior to the onset of disease Specifically the instrument queried If you are currently ill indicate how often you took these medications before the illness Participants provided information on how many times a week and for how many years they took aspirin Participants who reported aspirin use at least once a week for one year were classified as regular aspirin users Dosage of use was assessed by comparing participants who were classified as non users to participants who reported that they had taken aspirin either one to six times per week or seven or more times per week Duration of use was evaluated by comparing non users to participants who took aspirin for six months to ten years or more than ten years We also evaluated a combined measure of dosage and duration by computing tablet years tablets per day years of use Reason for analgesic use was unavailable for these analyses Statistical analyses Descriptive analyses included Student t tests of means for cases and controls for continuous variables and chi square tests for categorical variables Unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios ORs and 95 confidence intervals CIs ORs were adjusted for potential confounders including age education and packyears of cigarettes smoked Covariates were only included in the final regression model if they were established risk factors in these data or changed the observed risk estimates by at least 15 percent Variables that were evaluated but not included in the multivariate model were occupational asbestos exposure dietary fruit and vegetable intake and family history of lung cancer Participants classified as non users i e those who did not report to have used aspirin at least once a week for at least one year served as the referent category throughout the logistic regression analyses Results Descriptive characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 2 Due to the matching procedures there were no differences between cases and controls with respect to age and sex Cases were significantly less likely than controls to have obtained a college education p 0 001 As expected cases were more likely than controls to be former and current smokers p 0 001 and to have had more packyears of cigarettes p 0 001 Table 3displays the association between aspirin use and lung cancer risk in the total sample as well as among females and males separately Compared to nonusers regular aspirin use was associated with a significant reduction in risk of lung cancer in the total study sample adjusted OR 0 57 95 CI 0 41 0 78 as well as among female adjusted OR 0 52 95 CI 0 29 0 95 and male adjusted OR 0 62 95 CI 0 43 0 90 participants Higher dosage of aspirin seven or more tablets per week was significantly associated with risk in the total sample adjusted OR 0 58 95 CI 0 41 0 82 and among male participants adjusted OR 0 56 95 CI 0 37 0 83 Prolonged duration of use 11 or more years was not associated with a significant reduction in risk in either the total sample nor among the subgroups defined by sex However self reported aspirin use of one to 10 years was associated with a significantly lower risk of lung cancer in all groups Among male participants there was evidence of a dose response relationship with lower risk as a function of longer duration of use p 0 01 Risk of lung cancer was significantly reduced in relation to increasing tablet years in the total sample p 0 001 and in males p 0 01 We further explored these associations by restricting the sample to current and former smokers who were divided into tertiles of packyears of cigarettes smoked As can be seen in Table 4 risk estimates for the exposure categories described above were generally below the null among all smoking groups However statistically significant risk reductions and dose response relationships were only observed for participants in the lower tertile of packyear distribution 1 34 packyears Table 5displays the association between regular aspirin use and risk of histology specific lung cancer Significant risk reductions were observed for both NSCLC adjusted OR 0 62 95 CI 0 45 0 86 and small cell lung cancer SCLC adjusted OR 0 32 95 CI 0 16 0 63 Conclusions Results from this hospital based case control study are largely consistent with the existing body of evidence on the association between regular aspirin use and lung cancer risk All previous studies reported some evidence of reduced risk of lung cancer in relation to use aspirin or other NSAIDs 14 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 We observed a significant risk reduction among participants defined as regular users in the total sample as well as among men and women separately Our data also demonstrated significant risk reductions associated with higher aspirin doses prolonged duration and greater tablet years of aspirin use although significant trends were largely restricted to male participants We further observed that after restricting the analyses to current and former smokers the chemoprotective effect of aspirin was most apparent among individuals in the lower tertile of the packyear distribution Finally when we explored this risk association among histological subtypes significant risk reductions were apparent in when controls were compared to patients with both NSCLC and SCLC Although our findings follow the general trend that has been demonstrated in previous investigations some differences exist Two cohort studies reported reduced risk among aspirin users among females but not males 18 19 while we observed strongest associations for male participants Another study did not demonstrate a risk reduction among females 20 whereas we consistently found non significant risk estimates below unity for female participants In a recent report based on the NYU Women s Health Study Akhmedkhanov et al 22 reported a significant risk reduction for NSCLC and a more modest non significant decease in risk for all histological types of lung cancer Our data are partly in contrast to these results in that we observed the most marked reduction for SCLC but also a significant decrease in risk for all NSCLC subtypes combined These discrepancies in results may be partly explained by differences in study designs across studies i e randomized trial 17 cohort study 14 18 19 22 case control study 20 23 or by the vast differences in exposure assessment ranging from assignment of participants to aspirin intervention group vs placebo group 17 over ever use of aspirin in the last 30 days 14 to having had an NSAID prescription in the past three years 21 One of the proposed mechanisms for the chemopreventive properties of aspirin and other NSAIDs points to the observation that NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin PG endoperoxide synthase cyclooxygenase enzymes 24 of which two forms of similar enzymatic activity exist COX 1 and COX 2 COX 1 is constitutively expressed and involved in homeostasis 24 COX 2 is induced and involved in inflammation 24 25 There is evidence from laboratory studies to suggest that the COX 2 pathway may be involved in lung tumorigenesis Bauer et al 26 reported significantly higher levels of COX 2 enzymes in mouse lung tumor tissue compared to normal tissue It has also been shown that aspirin inhibited nitrosamine induced lung carcinogenesis 27 and it reduced COX 2 enzyme levels in lung cancer cell lines 28 Further support for a potential role of the COX 2 pathway in lung cancer development comes from several investigations that demonstrated COX 2 overexpression in human lung tumors specifically NSCLC 29 30 31 32 and precursor lesions 33 While COX 2 expression was generally shown to be increased in NSCLC and to a much lesser extent in SCLC the role of COX 2 expression in latter tumor type is difficult to determine due to the fact that the numbers of SCLC tumors examined in these studies was very small Several methodological issues should be considered in interpreting these results As in all case control studies bias could have affected the validity of the current findings Selection bias is likely to have occurred in this investigation The lung cancer patient group was restricted to individuals who were treated at RPCI a large regional cancer treatment center and are not likely to represent the general population of lung cancer patients in the western New York region However it is unlikely that self reported aspirin use would be different for RPCI patients than from patients treated in different facilities The use of hospital controls might introduce bias due to the possibility that some controls were suffering from conditions that would make them more likely to use aspirin However greater likelihood of aspirin use in the control group would only have attenuated the true risk estimate rather than produced spurious associations In addition hospital controls were selected from a large pool of eligible participants with a wide variety of non cancer diagnostic groups minimizing bias arising from potential overrepresentation of patients with characteristics that may be associated with the exposures In fact no significant differences with respect to aspirin use were observed for the most common diagnostic categories among controls Selection bias may have also been introduced due to the low participation rate in this study Only about 50 percent of eligible cases and controls agreed to complete the PEDS questionnaire We have no way of ascertaining whether or not those individuals who refused to complete the instrument differed from participants with respect to aspirin use Nevertheless previous studies that utilized the PEDS data base and faced the same methodological issue consistently replicated established epidemiological associations for a variety of cancer sites including ovary 34 35 colon 36 breast 37 prostate 38 and lung 39 Recall bias is always a problem in case control studies of cancer However in this investigation it may have been less of an issue due to our use of hospital controls Further the questionnaire used in this investigation places no particular emphasis on any specific item Thus there is little reason to believe that cases were more motivated than controls to recall aspirin use Exposure misclassification may also have affected our results as we based our analyses on self reported analgesic use and were not able to independently verify this information Also the questionnaire did not assess the specific doses of analgesic preparations such as regular or extra strength tablets Further we did not have detailed information on other NSAIDs that participants may have taken and cannot rule out the possibility that cases may have been more likely to have taken preparations such as ibuprofen or prescription NSAIDs which would have resulted in an overestimated or entirely spurious results However we have no reason to believe that any of these potential sources of misclassification were differential in nature In summary in this hospital based case control study of lung cancer we observed consistent associations between aspirin use and risk particularly among men Although a number of epidemiological studies have produced fairly consistent results none of these investigations has been specifically designed to address this research question These suggestive findings need to be replicated by a well designed pharmacoepidemiological study that incorporates the newly introduced NSAID preparations Competing interests None declared Authors contributions AR and HS participated in the statistical analysis and drafting the manuscript RJM participated in study
