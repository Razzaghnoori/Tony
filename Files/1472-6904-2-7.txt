 Background The goal of physiologically based pharmacokinetic models PBPK is to describe the whole body drug distribution and metabolism in terms of an accurate physiological model of the animal The most difficult component to model is the description of the exchange between the blood and tissue This is a complicated process involving e g transport across the capillary and tissue cell membranes and diffusion in the extravascular and cellular space Because of this complexity some simplifying assumptions must be made in order to incorporate it into a PBPK PKQuest is a new general purpose PBPK software routine that has previously been used to model the human pharmacokinetics of propranolol 1 D 2 O and ethanol 2 and the volatile solutes and anesthetics 3 In PKQuest this blood tissue exchange for organ i is characterized by the parameter fclear i defined by see 1 for details 1 fclear i c A c V c A c T where c A c V and c T are the free water concentrations in the artery entering the tissue the vein leaving it and the assumed well mixed tissue space respectively Fclear is a measure of the fraction of solute that equilibrates with the tissue in one pass through the capillary In the limiting case where the capillary is impermeable c A c V and fclear 0 At the opposite extreme where exchange is very fast and the venous concentration equilibrates with the tissue c V c T and fclear 1 This latter case is referred to as flow limited because the blood tissue exchange becomes limited by the blood flow Flow limitation simplifies the PBPK because it eliminates the necessity of having to determine the value of fclear i Because of this simplicity the vast majority of PBPKs in the literature assume that the exchange is flow limited 4 The parameter fclear i eq 1 of organ i can be related to the capillary permeability surface area product PS i liters min Kg by the relation see 1 for derivation where fw B is the fraction free in the blood F i is the organ blood flow liters min Kg wfract B is the fraction of water in the blood liters Kg and B is the blood density As the permeability PS becomes large fclear approaches 1 the flow limited condition It can be seen from eq 2 that the value of fclear i depends on 3 different physiological PBPK parameters PS i F i and fw B The design of PKQuest implements a unique feature that makes it easy for the user to test whether the solute under study has some significant capillary permeability limitation PKQuest has preprogrammed the relative values of PS i for organ i relative to the value of PS muscle of the muscle capillaries based on previous experimental measurements reviewed in Crone and Levitt 5 Thus the capillary permeability for all the organs is determined by just one adjustable parameter the fclear for muscle PKQuest uses this value of fclear muscle to find PS muscle from eq 2 uses the stored ratios PS i PS muscle to find the value of PS i and then uses eq 2 to find the value of fclear i for all the other organs In addition to simplifying the implementation of the capillary permeability limitation this also has the major advantage that it ensures that the values of fclear i for the different organs are correctly adjusted for the organ blood flow F i and fraction free in blood fw B and have the appropriate PS value relative to muscle All previous PBPK analysis of antibiotics have assumed that the antibiotic was flow limited It can be seen from eq 2 that the value of fclear is determined by the product of the intrinsic capillary permeability PS and the fraction of drug that is free in the blood water fw B This implies that drugs that have a high degree of binding small fw B are especially likely to have some capillary permeability limitation i e not flow limited The two antibiotics that are investigated in this paper dicloxacillin and ceftriaxone were chosen as likely candidates for having some permeability limitation because they have a high degree of protein binding small fw B and they are both relatively lipid insoluble so that one would predict that they would not have high intrinsic PS values Ceftriaxone has the additional complication that the protein binding is non linear saturating at high concentrations Incorporating non linear binding greatly complicates the kinetic equations see 1 for details and for this reason is not included in most PBPKs A notable exception is the investigation by Tsuji et al 6 of the kinetics of cefazolin in the rat an antibiotic with non liner protein binding Although this PBPK analysis by Tsuji et al 6 is one the most complete and extensive in the literature it was assumed that cefazolin was flow limited and did not include a permeability limitation PKQuest is the first PBPK that allows for the combination of both non linear binding and a permeability limitation PKQuest has also reduced the number of parameters that must be entered to characterize the protein binding The extravascular extracellular albumin concentration in the different organs cProt i relative to the albumin concentration in plasma cProt vein has been preprogrammed these values are based primarily on the measurements of Tsuji et al 6 for the rat Assuming that the protein binding in the different organs is proportional to the albumin concentration the user needs to enter just the binding parameters for plasma and PKQuest will then automatically determine the corresponding binding parameters for all the organs The following sections will present a detailed description of the application of PKQuest to the human pharmacokinetics of dicloxacillin and ceftriaxone For this analysis it is useful to establish a reference PS value for a solute that is known to be permeability limited For this reason PKQuest will first be used to determine the capillary permeability of inulin a large water soluble molecule that is known to be capillary limited 5 Methods PBPK program and its assumptions PKQuest 1 was used for all the analysis in this paper The details of the implementation of the program and a complete derivation of the pharmacokinetic equations is described in 1 It is assumed that each organ can be modeled as a single well stirred compartment This is clearly an approximation and effects such a diffusion gradients countercurrent exchange and heterogeneous organ blood flows 7 8 9 will produce small deviations from this assumption The free water solute concentration c moles liter plays a central role in these calculations because the rate of exchange across the capillary depends on differences in the value of c between the capillary and tissue see eq 1 For the blood or any organ the free concentration can be related to the total measured concentration C tot moles Kg by the relation C tot c wfract fw where wfract liters Kg is the water fraction in the organ and fw is the fraction of the solute that is free in the water phase The parameter fw i the fraction free in organ i including vascular compartments characterizes the fraction free and bound and the corresponding tissue blood partition coefficients Solute binding is a ubiquitous aspect of pharmacokinetics and PKQuest has provided a number of different procedures for handling it For example the propranolol pharmacokinetics 1 were described in terms of ktiss tissue blood partition coefficients and freepl the fraction free in plasma In the application of PKQuest to the volatile solutes 3 fw was described in terms of Kfwat oil water partition coefficient and klip i the fraction of lipid in each organ For the protein bound antibiotics it will be assumed that the value of fw i for organ i can be described by the single site Scatchard type binding equation see 1 for details where c i is the free concentration in organ i k is the protein binding constant and Pb i is the concentration of protein binding sites in organ i For the special case of linear binding no saturation kc i 1 eq 3 reduces to As is the case for other beta lactam antibiotics 6 10 it will also be assumed that albumin is the binding protein so that the protein binding site concentration in organ i Pb i is proportional to the extravascular albumin concentration in organ i In PKQuest the default values for the tissue protein concentrations cProt i relative to plasma have been preprogrammed These values are based primarily on the measurements of Tsuji et al 6 for the rat The user can change these values by entering values for cProt i Only the experimental value of Pb of plasma needs to be entered in PKQuest and the value of Pb i for the different organs are then calculated using these stored default values For the general case eq 3 the PKQuest protein binding is characterized by 2 parameters kProt the binding constant k and cProt vein the concentration of binding sites in venous plasma Pb The special case of linear albumin binding is completely described by just the one parameter k Pb see eq 4 In PKQuest the linear case is turned on by entering fw vein the fraction free in the vein plasma which is independent of concentration and setting kProt 2 and the following procedure is used to find the default values of fw i for each organ i First eq 4 for i vein is solved for the value of kPb vein Then using the default values of albumin concentration in each organ cProt i the value of kPb i is found and from eq 4 the corresponding fw i determined Experimental pharmacokinetic data Three set of data from previous publications were used The data for inulin was based on the experimental measurements of Odeh et al 11 in which the venous plasma inulin was measured following a 5 minute constant intravenous infusion of 4 gm of inulin The data from subject 1 was used 42 year old normal female weight 87 3 Kg height 173 cm The data for dicloxacillin was obtained from the measurements of Lofgren et al 12 of the venous plasma time course following a 30 minute constant infusion of 2 gms dicloxacillin The averaged data from 6 young males average weight 75 Kg was used The data for ceftriaxone was obtained from the measurements of Stoeckel and colleaques 13 14 The data are for a single subject M Fl given 4 different IV doses of ceftriaxone 0 15 0 5 1 5 and 3 gms as a 5 minute constant infusion The experimental data points were obtained by using UN SCAN IT Silk Scientific Corporation to read the data from the published figures All the figures shown in this paper are direct copies in jpeg format of standard PKQuest output Standard human parameters The default standard values standardhuman are stored as a Maple

subject in fig 2of Odeh et al 11 this female had a weight and height of 87 3 Kg and 173 cm and a predicted 28 fat content There are 3 parameters that specifically characterize inulin mecf rclr and fclear muscle The parameter mecf determines the extravascular volume of distribution The default value is mecf 1 which indicates that the solute distributes in all the body water If mecf is 0 then the solute distributes in organ i in a water volume equal to mecf ecf i where ecf i is the default extracellular space for organ i The user has the option to either adjust each of the individual values of ecf i or scale all the values by the factor mecf The default ecf i values in standardhuman were initially set equal to the values directly determined in the rat by Tsuji et al 6 from steady state tissue inulin measurements Then the value of mecf that optimized the fit to this data of Odeh et al was determined and these new values were chosen for standardhuman The human values were 16 larger than the rat values Since the default data was chosen to fit this data setting mecf 1 simply selects this optimized data The parameter rclr is the free water concentration renal clearance It is equal to the volume of blood water cleared per min liters min It differs slightly from the standard renal clearance which is equal to plasma volume min rclr 0 94 plasma clearance The value of rclr of 0 1 liter min corresponds to the value directly measured by Odeh et al for this subject The user has two different options for entering the values of fclear i see eq 1 If as in this case just the value of fclear muscle is input then PKQuest will by default use the relation in eq 2 to determine the value of PS muscle use the default ratios of PS i PS muscle to determine the value of PS i for the other organs and then use eq 2 to find the corresponding flcear i for the other organs The default ratios PS i PS muscle assume for example that the liver and kidney have a high permeability and are flow limited while because of the blood brain barrier the brain capillary permeability is zero The user can also individually input the value of fclear i for any organ i If an organ s value for fclear is not set then PKQuest will use the value set from the above calculation based on the muscle value The parameter fclear muscle was adjusted to find the best fit to the inulin data using the Powell minimization feature of PKQuest 1 The optimal value of fclear muscle was 0 354 Figure 1shows the PKQuest output for this inulin data all the figures in this paper are copied directly from the standard output of PKQuest There is good agreement between the predicted venous plasma concentration solid line and the experimental values squares PKQuest also routinely outputs the experimental pharmacokinetic clearance and volume of distribution determined from the first and second moments of the plasma concentration extrapolated exponentially to infinite time 15 These experimentally derived values are in good agreement with the model values Plasma clearance 0 104 liters min experimental versus 0 1 model Volume of distribution 10 7 liters experimental versus 10 7 model PKQuest also outputs the values of fclear i and the corresponding value of PS i determined from eq 2 The fclear muscle of 0 354 corresponds to a PS of muscle of 0 6 ml min 100 gm Dicloxacillin Approximately 97 of human serum dicloxacillin is protein bound fw B 0 03 16 making it a likely candidate to show some permeability limitation Another advantage of dicloxacillin is that this binding is linear showing no evidence of saturation at concentrations up to 230 mg liter 6 16 simplifying the PBPK Since the binding does not saturate it can be described by eq 4 and the binding is characterized by the single parameter fw vein see Methods The complete Maple procedure for dicloxacillin is dicloxacillin proc defaultpar Wtot 75 0 standardhuman Wtot Fat 0 16 concunit vein 4 mecf 1 0 kProt 2 this turns

infusion of 2 gms dicloxacillin was used as input The average body weight for this group was 75 Kg and the standard fat content for young males 16 17 was assumed The parameter mecf is set 1 because dicloxacillin like inulin distributes only in the extracellular space as shown by its negligible distribution into red cells and its low blood tissue partition coefficient 6 This means that dicloxacillin has the same volume of distributions in the different organs as was used above for inulin Dicloxacillin is cleared primarily by the kidney in these subjects 12 and there is a large component of renal tubular secretion that is blocked by probenecid 18 determined by the parameter Tclr kidney Other studies have indicated that the liver can account for 40 or more of the total clearance 16 PKQuest calculations not shown based on the assumption that the clearance was divided equally between the kidney and liver yield almost identical results The value of renal filtration rclr was set to the normal value of 0 12 liters min The capillary permeability limitation is characterized by the single parameter fclear muscle from which the permeabililty of the other organs is calculated by PKQuest The above values of Tclr kidney 3 0 liters min and fclear muscle 0 26 dimensionless were obtained by simultaneously optimizing both values using the Powell minimization procedure in PKQuest 1 to find the values that provided the best fit to the experimental data The left hand panel in figure 2shows a comparison of the PKQuest model predictions solid line for this set of input parameters with the experimental data of Lofgren et al 12 Again the agreement is quite good This model fit used a permeability limitation fclear for muscle of 0 26 This means that the venous blood leaving the muscle is 26 equilibrated with the tissue Using eq 2 this corresponds to a PS muscle of 13 ml min 100 gm The right hand panel in figure 2shows the best fit that can be found for this same data assuming that dicloxacillin is flow limited fclear 1 The fit is clearly worse especially at the early time points where a permeability limitation should be important Part of the better fit may have resulted from adjusting 2 parameters fclear muscle and Tclr kidney for fig 2 left while in fig 2 right only one parameter was adjusted Tclr kidney However the fact that the fit in fig 2 right could not be significantly improved by trying to adjust other parameters such as muscle blood flow extracellular space and or plasma protein binding suggests that this permeability limitation is real Ceftriaxone In addition to having a high degree of protein binding Ceftriaxone has the additional complication that this binding is non linear and saturates at high concentrations Stoeckel and colleagues have carried out detailed investigations of the pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone in humans and the influence of this non linear binding 13 14 They showed that the non linear kinetics of ceftriaxone arise solely from this non linear binding by demonstrating that the kinetics became linear if the free drug concentrations are used in the pharmacokinetic calculations In this section PKQuest will be used to develop a PBPK model for this data The model includes both non linear binding and a permeability limitation the first time that both these factors have been included in a PBPK Because the protein binding saturates the general Scatchard binding equation eq 3 must be used This requires a value for the protein binding constant k and the concentration of binding sites in each organ Pb i As described above Methods these constants are determined by two PKQuest parameters kProt the association constant for protein binding and cProt vein the plasma concentration of binding sites PKQuest then uses the default information about the tissue albumin concentration in each organ relative to the plasma albumin to determine the concentration of binding sites in each organ Pb i The data of Stoeckel et al 13 14 are ideal for this analysis because they provide information about the venous blood levels for the same subject M Fl given 4 different IV doses of ceftriaxone 0 15 0 5 1 5 and 3 gms It is important to have these different inputs in order to test if the PBPK can accurately model the non linear kinetics Since all the doses were given to the same subject an identical

liver metabolism Tclr liver were adjusted to have a renal clearance of about 65 of the total clearance as was observed experimentally The liver metabolism and tubule secretion were assumed to be linear because the kinetics were linear if corrections were made for the plasma binding The value mecf has been set to 0 85 to slightly improve the fit to the data This makes the extracellular volume of distribution 85 of the default value It is not clear whether this has some physiological significance for this subject or if it is just a fudge factor that corrects for some other limitation in the PBPK The two parameters fclear muscle and Tclr liver were simultaneously adjusted using the Powell minimization procedure in PKQuest to obtain the best fit to the experimental data For this case where the binding is non linear the value of fclear muscle that is input is interpreted as the value of fclear in the limit of zero concentration As the concentration increases the value of the fraction free fw B will increase eq 3 and the corresponding value of fclear eq 2 will also increase i e become less permeability limited The optimized value of fclear muscle of 0 15 corresponds see eq 2 to a PS muscle of 6 ml min 100 gm Figure 3shows the agreement between the model predictions of PKQuest and the experimental data for inputs of 0 15 0 5 1 5 and 3 0 grams The same parameter set was used for each of these 4 fits Only the input function was varied Over the plasma concentration ranges seen at early times for each of the 4 doses the fraction free in the blood and the fclear muscle fraction of solute that equilibrates with the tissue in one pass through the muscle capillary varies as follows At 0 M fraction free 0 038 fclear 0 15 At 50 M fraction free 0 092 fclear 0 33 At 150 M fraction free 0 18 fclear 0 55 At 450 M fraction free 0 374 fclear 0 8 At 800 M fraction free 0 51 fclear 0 89 The non linearity in the kinetics is apparent both in the changes in the qualitative shape of the curve and in the absolute values of the plasma concentration The agreement between the model and experiment for this 20 fold dose range and roughly 10 fold range of fraction free is surprisingly good especially considering that there are so few adjustable parameters see below Figure 4show the corresponding fits for the case where ceftriaxone is assumed to be flow limited fclear 1 for the 0 15 and 3 0 gm dose Comparing figures 3and 4it can be seen that the permeability limitation significantly influences the pharmacokinetics only for the lower doses because of the saturation of the protein binding For the low dose 0 15 grams the plasma concentration at early times is about 50 M which will have a corresponding fclear of 0 33 This means that there will be only 33 equilibration during one pass through the capillary a significant permeability limitation However for the high dose 3 0 grams the early plasma concentration is about 800 M which corresponds to a fclear of 0 89 which differs only sightly from the flow limited condition fclear 1 assumed for figure 4 Discussion and Conclusions The definition that is introduced in this paper for capillary tissue clearance fclear eq 1 and its relation to the fraction free in tissue fw B eq 2 is not new These definitions are identical to the classical expressions used to describe pulmonary diffusion capacity of a gas where fw B corresponds to the inverse of the gas solubililty 19 The capillary permeability limitation produced by the protein binding of dicloxacillin and ceftriaxone described in this paper is directly analogous to the carbon monoxide pulmonary diffusion limitation that results from its high blood solubility This analogy has not been previously recognized for the protein bound antibiotics The value of PS muscle of inulin determined above is a measure of the capillary permeability averaged over all the muscles It represents the permeability for the muscle in the condition of these measurements the resting human with a relatively low muscle blood flow default value 0 0266 liters min Kg Surprisingly this may be the first report of this value in humans The value of PS muscle found here for inulin of 0 6 ml min 100 gm is slightly less than the reported value of 0 9 for lightly exercising in vivo human forearm muscle 20 and is in the range reported for animal measurements 0 6 to 1 2 5 The literature values are for muscles with 2 to 4 times the default blood flow assumed for these measurements Since the muscle capillary surface area S can vary by a factor of more than 4 as capillaries are recruited at higher flows 5 this low resting blood flow could easily account for the low PS inulin value obtained in this analysis The values of PS muscle for dicloxacillin and ceftriaxone estimated here are the first measurements of the capillary permeability for any antibiotic In fact as discussed above it had always been assumed previously that these drugs were flow limited which would mean that their permeability was so large that it could not be measured These drugs do in fact have a high intrinsic permeability For example the value of PS muscle found for dicloxacillin of 13 ml min 100 gm is a very high permeability and if it were not protein bound and fw B equaled 1 would correspond to an fclear muscle of 0 999 see eq 2 i e it would be flow limited The only reason that it is not flow limited and that its value can be measured is because of its high protein binding with a fw B of 0 03 The value of PS muscle found for ceftriaxone 6 ml min 100 gm is about half the dicloxacillin value The PS muscle values for the antibiotics are about 10 times larger than the PS value of inulin If these antibiotics were lipid impermeable and had to cross the capillary via the interendothelial cell slits their permeability should be determined simply by their molecular radius 5 and they should have a permeability similar to that of sucrose or EDTA molecules with similar molecular radii The antibiotic skeletal muscle capillary permeabilities found here are about 2 times larger than those reported for sucrose and EDTA 5 It has recently been shown that the Lactam antibiotics are transported across the intestinal epithelial cells via the peptide transport system 21 This relatively high capillary permeability for these antibiotics may indicate that this system is also present in the capillary endothelium Does this capillary permeability limitation have any practical significance in terms of therapeutics The anti infective activity of the antibiotic should be roughly equivalent to the free concentration in the tissue water 22 Figure 5contrasts the time course of the free ceftriaxone concentration in the extracellular muscle black and plasma red water for the permeability limited solid line and flow limited dashed line cases For the low dose 0 15 gram where the protein binding is high and the permeability limitation is at its maximum the muscle water antibiotic concentration for the permeability limited case black solid line is significantly less than for the flow limited case black dashed line for the first 30 minutes After 40 minutes the muscle tissue concentrations for the permeability limited and flow limited cases are not significantly different At the high dose 3 0 gram there is no significant difference even at early times Thus from a therapeutic viewpoint this permeability limitation is probably not important This inference of a capillary permeability limitation is indirect since it is based only on a theoretical analysis of the experimental plasma pharmacokinetics The analysis shown in fig 5suggests that it should be possible directly observe the effects of this permeability limitation from simultaneous measurements of the free water concentration in the plasma and muscle The low dose 0 15 gram panel in fig 5shows that the capillary permeability limitation creates a large difference between the plasma red line and muscle black line free water concentration during the first 30 minutes Kovar et al 22 measured the ceftriaxone free plasma and muscle water using microdialysis in the rat for doses of 50 and 100 mg Kg They compared their experimental measurements with theoretical pharmacokinetic curves based on the flow limited assumption For the low dose where binding and permeability limitation will be higher the experimental muscle water concentration at 50 minutes was significantly less about 40 than the flow limited prediction and this difference became insignificant by 100 minutes Similarly the muscle tissue measurements of Tsuji et al 6 of cefazolin another protein bound antibiotic were significantly less than the flow limited predictions for the first 100 minutes Although both of these results are consistent with a capillary permeability limitation they are probably not conclusive because of the large scatter in the measurements and the inherent uncertainties and limited time resolution of the tissue measurements The PBPK for ceftriaxone discussed in this paper would normally be thought of as very difficult or complicated The model requires information for each organ about the extravascular volumes of distribution protein binding constants capillary permeability weights and blood flows in addition to information about renal clearance tubular secretion and hepatic metabolism One would expect that with this many parameters it would be impossible to have any confidence in the PBPK parameters that are found However because of the basic design feature of PKQuest there are actually only 6 parameters that are specifically required to completely characterize ceftriaxone rclr Tclr liver Tclr kidney cProt vein and kProt see the ceftriaxone procedure above Two of these parameters were measured experimentally cProt vein and kProt and the value of rclr renal plasma clearance was set to the default human value Since the ratio of liver to renal clearance is known experimentally only one of the parameters Tclr liver and Tclr kidney is independent This leaves just two adjustable parameters fclear muscle and Tclr liver In addition it may be necessary to slightly adjust some of the default parameters e g mecf for the ceftriaxone case to optimize the fit These PBPK studies provide a good example of the major difference of philosophy between PKQuest and the usual PBPK For example in the rat PBPK developed by Tsuji et al 6 for cefazolin nearly every PBPK parameter required by the model was directly measured including steady state extravascular volumes of distribution in the different organs organ blood flows and weights renal and hepatic clearance time dependence of cefazolin concentration in the different organs etc This approach is for obvious reasons impossible for human studies The basic philosophy of PKQuest is that it is not necessary to make these measurements for each drug that is investigated if the PBPK has been previously tested and refined using a large variety of compounds combined with information available in the literature For example for these studies the extracellular volumes of distribution ecf determined in the inulin PBPK analysis have been used as the default values for the antibiotic studies As PKQuest is applied to other compounds these default value will be improved and modified The more that PKQuest is used the more reliable are its values and the more confidence one can place in its results The major design feature of PKQuest which is to minimize the number of input parameters required from the user and maximize the use of previously determined information supports this philosophy For example the user only needs to enter the value of fclear muscle and PKQuest uses the previously determined ratios of PS i PS muscle to set all the other organ permeabilities As another example the user need only enter the one parameter mecf to set all the extracellular volumes for each organ and the user knows that a mecf of 1 corresponds to the standard default human set of values If the user wanted e g to make the ecf of muscle 10 larger than the default it is only necessary to enter ecf muscle 1 1 ecf muscle and the user does not need to know the actual default value This not only makes PKQuest easier to use but it also improves the validity of the final PBPK because the user has confidence that the best estimates based on previous applications of PKQuest are being used The PKQuest program and all of the examples used in this paper are freely available on the Web at http www pkquest com
