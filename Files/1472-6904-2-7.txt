                    Background        The goal of physiologically based pharmacokinetic models        PBPK is to describe the whole body drug distribution and        metabolism in terms of an accurate physiological model of        the animal The most difficult component to model is the        description of the exchange between the blood and tissue        This is a complicated process involving eg transport        across the capillary and tissue cell membranes and        diffusion in the extravascular and cellular space Because        of this complexity some simplifying assumptions must be        made in order to incorporate it into a PBPK PKQuest is a        new general purpose PBPK software routine that has        previously been used to model the human pharmacokinetics of        propranolol     D          O and ethanol     and the volatile        solutes and anesthetics     In PKQuest this        bloodtissue exchange for organ i is characterized by the        parameter fclear i defined by see    for        details                  fclear          i            c                   A                   c                   V                   c                   A                   c                   T                  where c         A  c         V and c         T are the free water concentrations in        the artery entering the tissue the vein leaving it and        the assumed well mixed tissue space respectively Fclear        is a measure of the fraction of solute that equilibrates        with the tissue in one pass through the capillary In the        limiting case where the capillary is impermeable c         A  c         V and fclear   At the opposite        extreme where exchange is very fast and the venous        concentration equilibrates with the tissue c         V  c         T and fclear   This latter case is        referred to as flowlimited because the bloodtissue        exchange becomes limited by the blood flow Flow limitation        simplifies the PBPK because it eliminates the necessity of        having to determine the value of fclear i Because of        this simplicity the vast majority of PBPKs in the        literature assume that the exchange is flow limited                   The parameter fclear i eq  of organ i can be        related to the capillary permeabilitysurface area product        PS         i  litersminKg by the relation see           for derivation                where fw         B is the fraction free in the blood F         i is the organ blood flow        litersminKg wfract         B is the fraction of water in the blood        litersKg and          B is the blood density As the        permeability PS becomes large fclear approaches  the        flowlimited condition It can be seen from eq  that the        value of fclear i depends on  different physiological        PBPK parameters PS         i  F         i  and fw         B  The design of PKQuest implements a        unique feature that makes it easy for the user to test        whether the solute under study has some significant        capillary permeability limitation PKQuest has        preprogrammed the relative values of PS         i for organ i relative to the value of        PS         muscle of the muscle capillaries based        on previous experimental measurements reviewed in Crone        and Levitt     Thus the capillary permeability for        all the organs is determined by just one adjustable        parameter the fclear for muscle PKQuest uses this value        of fclear muscle to find PS         muscle from eq  uses the stored        ratios PS         i PS         muscle to find the value of PS         i  and then uses eq  to find the        value of fclear i for all the other organs In addition        to simplifying the implementation of the capillary        permeability limitation this also has the major advantage        that it ensures that the values of fclear i for the        different organs are correctly adjusted for the organ blood        flow F         i  and fraction free in blood fw         B  and have the appropriate PS value        relative to muscle        All previous PBPK analysis of antibiotics have assumed        that the antibiotic was flow limited It can be seen from        eq that the value of fclear is determined by the product        of the intrinsic capillary permeability PS and the        fraction of drug that is free in the blood water fw         B  This implies that drugs that have a        high degree of binding small fw         B  are especially likely to have some        capillary permeability limitation ie not flow limited        The two antibiotics that are investigated in this paper        dicloxacillin and ceftriaxone were chosen as likely        candidates for having some permeability limitation because        they have a high degree of protein binding small fw         B  and they are both relatively lipid        insoluble so that one would predict that they would not        have high intrinsic PS values        Ceftriaxone has the additional complication that the        protein binding is nonlinear saturating at high        concentrations Incorporating nonlinear binding greatly        complicates the kinetic equations see    for details        and for this reason is not included in most PBPKs A        notable exception is the investigation by Tsuji et al           of the kinetics of cefazolin in the rat an antibiotic        with nonliner protein binding Although this PBPK analysis        by Tsuji et al    is one the most complete and        extensive in the literature it was assumed that cefazolin        was flow limited and did not include a permeability        limitation PKQuest is the first PBPK that allows for the        combination of both nonlinear binding and a permeability        limitation PKQuest has also reduced the number of        parameters that must be entered to characterize the protein        binding The extravascular extracellular albumin        concentration in the different organs cProt i relative        to the albumin concentration in plasma cProt vein has        been preprogrammed these values are based primarily on the        measurements of Tsuji et al    for the rat Assuming        that the protein binding in the different organs is        proportional to the albumin concentration the user needs        to enter just the binding parameters for plasma and PKQuest        will then automatically determine the corresponding binding        parameters for all the organs        The following sections will present a detailed        description of the application of PKQuest to the human        pharmacokinetics of dicloxacillin and ceftriaxone For this        analysis it is useful to establish a reference PS value for        a solute that is known to be permeability limited For this        reason PKQuest will first be used to determine the        capillary permeability of inulin a large water soluble        molecule that is known to be capillary limited                        Methods                  PBPK program and its assumptions          PKQuest    was used for all the analysis in this          paper The details of the implementation of the program          and a complete derivation of the pharmacokinetic          equations is described in     It is assumed that each          organ can be modeled as a single wellstirred          compartment This is clearly an approximation and effects          such a diffusion gradients countercurrent exchange and          heterogeneous organ blood flows      will produce          small deviations from this assumption          The free water solute concentration c molesliter          plays a central role in these calculations because the          rate of exchange across the capillary depends on          differences in the value of c between the capillary and          tissue see eq  For the blood or any organ the free          concentration can be related to the total measured          concentration C           tot  molesKg by the relation C           tot  c wfractfw where wfract          litersKg is the water fraction in the organ and fw is          the fraction of the solute that is free in the water          phase The parameter fw           i  the fraction free in organ i          including vascular compartments characterizes the          fraction free and bound and the corresponding          tissueblood partition coefficients Solute binding is a          ubiquitous aspect of pharmacokinetics and PKQuest has          provided a number of different procedures for handling          it For example the propranolol pharmacokinetics             were described in terms of ktiss tissueblood          partition coefficients and freepl the fraction free          in plasma In the application of PKQuest to the volatile          solutes     fw was described in terms of Kfwat          oilwater partition coefficient and klip           i  the fraction of lipid in each          organ          For the protein bound antibiotics it will be assumed          that the value of fw           i for organ i can be described by the          single site Scatchard type binding equation see             for details                    where c           i is the free concentration in organ          i k is the protein binding constant and Pb           i is the concentration of protein          binding sites in organ i For the special case of linear          binding no saturation kc           i  eq  reduces to                    As is the case for other betalactam antibiotics               it will also be assumed that albumin is the          binding protein so that the protein binding site          concentration in organ i Pb           i  is proportional to the          extravascular albumin concentration in organ i In          PKQuest the default values for the tissue protein          concentrations cProt           i  relative to plasma have been          preprogrammed These values are based primarily on the          measurements of Tsuji et al    for the rat The          user can change these values by entering values for cProt                    i  Only the experimental value of Pb          of plasma needs to be entered in PKQuest and the value of          Pb           i for the different organs are then          calculated using these stored default values          For the general case eq  the PKQuest protein          binding is characterized by  parameters kProt the          binding constant k and cProt           vein the concentration of binding          sites in venous plasma Pb The special case of linear          albumin binding is completely described by just the one          parameter kPb see eq  In PKQuest the linear case          is turned on by entering fw vein the fraction free in          the vein plasma which is independent of concentration          and setting kProt   and the following procedure is          used to find the default values of fw           i for each organ i First eq  for          ivein is solved for the value of kPb           vein  Then using the default values          of albumin concentration in each organ cProt i the          value of kPb           i is found and from eq  the          corresponding fw           i determined                          Experimental pharmacokinetic data          Three set of data from previous publications were          used The data for inulin was based on the experimental          measurements of Odeh et al    in which the venous          plasma inulin was measured following a  minute constant          intravenous infusion of  gm of inulin The data from          subject  was

following a  minute          constant infusion of  gms dicloxacillin The averaged          data from  young males average weight  Kg was used          The data for ceftriaxone was obtained from the          measurements of Stoeckel and colleaques      The          data are for a single subject MFl given  different          IV doses of ceftriaxone     and  gms as a           minute constant infusion The experimental data points          were obtained by using UNSCANIT Silk Scientific          Corporation to read the data from the published figures          All the figures shown in this paper are

        There are  parameters that specifically characterize          inulin mecf rclr and fclear muscle          The parameter mecf determines the extravascular volume          of distribution The default value is mecf   which          indicates that the solute distributes in all the body          water If mecf is  then the solute distributes in          organ i in a water volume equal to mecfecf i where ecf          i is the default extracellular space for organ i The          user has the option to either adjust each of the          individual values of ecf i or scale all the values by          the factor mecf The default ecf i values in          standardhuman were initially set equal to the values          directly determined in the rat by Tsuji et al             from steady state tissue inulin measurements Then the          value of mecf that optimized the fit to this data of Odeh          et al was determined and these new values were chosen          for standardhuman The human values were  larger          than the rat values Since the default data was chosen          to fit this data setting mecf   simply selects this          optimized data          The parameter rclr is the free water concentration          renal clearance It is equal to the volume of blood water          cleared per min litersmin It differs slightly from          the standard renal clearance which is equal to plasma          volumemin rclr    plasma clearance The value of          rclr of  litermin corresponds to the value directly          measured by Odeh et al for this subject          The user has two different options for entering the          values of fclear i see eq  If as in this case          just the value of fclear muscle is input then PKQuest          will by default use the relation in eq  to determine          the value of PS           muscle  use the default ratios of PS           i PS           muscle to determine the value of PS           i for the other organs and then use          eq  to find the corresponding flcear i for the other          organs The default ratios PS           i PS           muscle assume for example that the          liver and kidney have a high permeability and are flow          limited while because of the blood brain barrier the          brain capillary permeability is zero The user can also          individually input the value of fclear i for any organ          i If an organs value for fclear is not set then          PKQuest will use the value set from the above calculation          based on the muscle value The parameter fclear muscle          was adjusted to find the best fit to the inulin data          using the Powell minimization feature of PKQuest              The optimal value of fclear           muscle was           Figure shows the PKQuest output for this inulin data          all the figures in this paper are copied directly from          the standard output of PKQuest There is good

candidate to show some permeability limitation Another          advantage of dicloxacillin is that this binding is          linear showing no evidence of saturation at          concentrations up to  mgliter      simplifying          the PBPK Since the binding does not saturate it can be          described by eq  and the binding is characterized by          the single parameter fw vein see Methods

males given a           minute constant infusion of  gms dicloxacillin was used          as input The average body weight for this group was           Kg and the standard fat content for young males               was assumed The parameter mecf is set   because          dicloxacillin like inulin distributes only in the          extracellular space as shown by its negligible          distribution into red cells and its low bloodtissue          partition coefficient     This means that          dicloxacillin has the same volume of distributions in the          different organs as was used above for inulin          Dicloxacillin is cleared primarily by the kidney in these          subjects    and there is a large component of renal          tubular secretion that is blocked by probenecid

normal value of  litersmin The          capillary permeability limitation is characterized by the          single parameter fclear muscle from which the          permeabililty of the other organs is calculated by          PKQuest The above values of Tclr kidney            litersmin and fclear muscle  dimensionless          were obtained by simultaneously optimizing both values          using the Powell minimization procedure in PKQuest             to find the values that provided the best fit to the          experimental data          The left hand panel in figure shows a comparison of          the PKQuest model predictions solid line for this set          of input parameters with the experimental data of Lofgren          et al     Again the agreement is quite good This          model fit used a permeability limitation fclear for          muscle of  This means that the venous blood leaving          the muscle is  equilibrated with the tissue Using eq           this corresponds to a PS           muscle of  mlmin gm          The right hand panel in figure shows the best fit          that can be found for this same data assuming that          dicloxacillin is flow limited fclear   The fit is          clearly worse especially at the early time points where          a permeability limitation should be important Part of          the better fit may have resulted from adjusting           parameters fclear muscle and Tclr kidney for fig          left while in fig right only one parameter was          adjusted Tclr kidney However the fact that the fit          in fig right could not be significantly improved by          trying to adjust other parameters such as muscle blood          flow extracellular space andor plasma protein binding          suggests that this permeability limitation is real                          Ceftriaxone          In addition to having a high degree of protein          binding Ceftriaxone has the additional complication that          this binding is nonlinear and saturates at high          concentrations Stoeckel and colleagues have carried out          detailed investigations of the pharmacokinetics of          ceftriaxone in humans and the influence of this          nonlinear binding      They showed that the          nonlinear kinetics of ceftriaxone arise solely from this          nonlinear binding by demonstrating that the kinetics          became linear if the free drug concentrations are used in          the pharmacokinetic calculations In this section          PKQuest will be used to develop a PBPK model for this          data The model includes both nonlinear binding and a          permeability limitation the first time that both these          factors have been included in a PBPK          Because the protein binding saturates the general          Scatchard binding equation eq  must be used This          requires a value for the protein binding constant k and          the concentration of binding sites in each organ Pb           i  As described above Methods          these constants are determined by two PKQuest parameters          kProt the association constant for protein binding and          cProt vein the plasma concentration of binding sites          PKQuest then uses the default information about the          tissue albumin concentration in each organ relative to          the plasma albumin to determine the concentration of          binding sites in each organ Pb           i  The data of Stoeckel et al              are ideal for this analysis because they provide          information about the venous blood levels for the same          subject MFl given  different IV doses of ceftriaxone              and  gms It is important to have these          different inputs in order to test if the PBPK can          accurately model the nonlinear kinetics Since all the          doses were given to the same subject an identical set of          PBPK parameters is used for all the doses

         litersmin was used for renal clearance and the tubule          secretion Tclr kidney and liver metabolism Tclr          liver were adjusted to have a renal clearance of about           of the total clearance as was observed          experimentally The liver metabolism and tubule secretion          were assumed to be linear because the kinetics were          linear if corrections were made for the plasma binding          The value mecf has been set to  to slightly improve          the fit to the data This makes the extracellular volume          of distribution  of the default value It is not clear          whether this has some physiological significance for this          subject or if it is just a fudge factor that corrects          for some other limitation in the PBPK The two parameters          fclear muscle and Tclr liver were simultaneously          adjusted using the Powell minimization procedure in          PKQuest to obtain the best fit to the experimental data          For this case where the binding is nonlinear the value          of fclear muscle that is input is interpreted as the          value of fclear in the limit of zero concentration As          the concentration increases the value of the fraction          free fw           B  will increase eq  and the          corresponding value of fclear eq  will also increase          ie become less permeability limited The optimized          value of fclear muscle of  corresponds see eq           to a PS           muscle of  mlmin gm          Figure shows the agreement between the model          predictions of PKQuest and the experimental data for          inputs of    and  grams The same          parameter set was used for each of these  fits Only the          input function was varied Over the plasma concentration          ranges seen at early times for each of the  doses the          fraction free in the blood and the fclear           muscle fraction of solute that          equilibrates with the tissue in one pass through the          muscle capillary varies as follows At  M fraction          free   fclear   At  M fraction free            fclear   At  M fraction free            fclear   At  M fraction free   fclear            At  M fraction free   fclear   The          nonlinearity in the kinetics is apparent both in the          changes in the qualitative shape of the curve and in the          absolute values of the plasma concentration The          agreement between the model and experiment for this           fold dose range and roughly  fold range of fraction          free is surprisingly good especially considering that          there are so few adjustable parameters see below          Figure show the corresponding fits for the case where          ceftriaxone is assumed to be flow limited fclear            for the  and  gm dose Comparing figures and it          can be seen that the permeability limitation          significantly influences the pharmacokinetics only for          the lower doses because of the saturation of the protein          binding For the low dose  grams the plasma          concentration at early times is about  M which will          have a corresponding fclear of  This means that          there will be only  equilibration during one pass          through the capillary  a significant permeability          limitation However for the high dose  grams the          early plasma concentration is about  M which          corresponds to a fclear of  which differs only          sightly from the flow limited condition fclear            assumed for figure                             Discussion and Conclusions        The definition that is introduced in this paper for        capillarytissue clearance fclear eq  and its relation        to the fraction free in tissue fw         B  eq  is not new These definitions        are identical to the classical expressions used to describe        pulmonary diffusion capacity of a gas where fw         B corresponds to the inverse of the gas        solubililty      The capillary permeability        limitation produced by the protein binding of dicloxacillin        and ceftriaxone described in this paper is directly        analogous to the carbon monoxide pulmonary diffusion        limitation that results from its high blood solubility        This analogy has not been previously recognized for the        protein bound antibiotics        The value of PS         muscle of inulin determined above is a        measure of the capillary permeability averaged over all the        muscles It represents the permeability for the muscle in        the condition of these measurements  the resting human        with a relatively low muscle blood flow default value          litersminKg Surprisingly this may be the first        report of this value in humans The value of PS         muscle found here for inulin of         mlmin gm is slightly less than the reported value of         for lightly exercising in vivo human forearm muscle           and is in the range reported for animal measurements         to      The literature values are for muscles        with  to  times the default blood flow assumed for these        measurements Since the muscle capillary surface area S        can vary by a factor of more than  as capillaries are        recruited at higher flows     this low resting blood        flow could easily account for the low PS inulin value        obtained in this analysis        The values of PS         muscle for dicloxacillin and ceftriaxone        estimated here are the first measurements of the capillary        permeability for any antibiotic In fact as discussed        above it had always been assumed previously that these        drugs were flow limited which would mean that their        permeability was so large that it could not be measured        These drugs do in fact have a high intrinsic        permeability For example the value of PS         muscle found for dicloxacillin of         mlmin gm is a very high permeability and if it were        not protein bound and fw         B equaled  would correspond to an        fclear muscle of  see eq   ie it would be        flow limited The only reason that it is not flow limited        and that its value can be measured is because of its high        protein binding with a fw         B of  The value of PS         muscle found for ceftriaxone         mlmin gm is about half the dicloxacillin value        The PS         muscle values for the antibiotics are        about  times larger than the PS value of inulin If these        antibiotics were lipid impermeable and had to cross the        capillary via the interendothelial cell slits their        permeability should be determined simply by their molecular        radius     and they should have a permeability similar        to that of sucrose or EDTA molecules with similar        molecular radii The antibiotic skeletal muscle capillary        permeabilities found here are about  times larger than        those reported for sucrose and EDTA     It has recently        been shown that the Lactam antibiotics are transported        across the intestinal epithelial cells via the peptide        transport system     This relatively high capillary        permeability for these antibiotics may indicate that this        system is also present in the capillary endothelium        Does this capillary permeability limitation have any        practical significance in terms of therapeutics The        antiinfective activity of the antibiotic should be roughly        equivalent to the free concentration in the tissue water            Figure contrasts the time course of the free        ceftriaxone concentration in the extracellular muscle        black and plasma red water for the permeability limited        solid line and flow limited dashed line cases For the        low dose  gram where the protein binding is high and        the permeability limitation is at its maximum the muscle        water antibiotic concentration for the permeability limited        case black solid line is significantly less than for the        flow limited case black dashed line for the first         minutes After  minutes the muscle tissue concentrations        for the permeability limited and flow limited cases are not        significantly different At the high dose  gram there        is no significant difference even at early times Thus        from a therapeutic viewpoint this permeability limitation        is probably not important        This inference of a capillary permeability limitation is        indirect since it is based only on a theoretical analysis        of the experimental plasma pharmacokinetics The analysis        shown in fig suggests that it should be possible directly        observe the effects of this permeability limitation from        simultaneous measurements of the free water concentration        in the plasma and muscle The low dose  gram panel in        fig shows that the capillary permeability limitation        creates a large difference between the plasma red line        and muscle black line free water concentration during the        first  minutes Kovar et al    measured the        ceftriaxone free plasma and muscle water using        microdialysis in the rat for doses of  and  mgKg        They compared their experimental measurements with        theoretical pharmacokinetic curves based on the flow        limited assumption For the low dose where binding and        permeability limitation will be higher the experimental        muscle water concentration at  minutes was significantly        less about  than the flow limited prediction and this        difference became insignificant by  minutes Similarly        the muscle tissue measurements of Tsuji et al    of        cefazolin another protein bound antibiotic were        significantly less than the flow limited predictions for        the first  minutes Although both of these results are        consistent with a capillary permeability limitation they        are probably not conclusive because of the large scatter in        the measurements and the inherent uncertainties and limited        time resolution of the tissue measurements        The PBPK for ceftriaxone discussed in this paper would        normally be thought of as very difficult or        complicated The model requires information for each        organ about the extravascular volumes of distribution        protein binding constants capillary permeability weights        and blood flows in addition to information about renal        clearance tubular secretion and hepatic metabolism One        would expect that with this many parameters it would be        impossible to have any confidence in the PBPK parameters        that are found However because of the basic design        feature of PKQuest there are actually only  parameters        that are specifically required to completely characterize        ceftriaxone rclr Tclr liver Tclr kidney cProt        vein and kProt see the ceftriaxone procedure above Two        of these parameters were measured experimentally cProt        vein and kProt and the value of rclr renal plasma        clearance was set to the default human value Since the        ratio of liver to renal clearance is known experimentally        only one of the parameters Tclr liver and Tclr kidney        is independent This leaves just two adjustable parameters        fclear muscle and Tclr liver In addition it may be        necessary to slightly adjust some of the default parameters        eg mecf for the ceftriaxone case to optimize the        fit        These PBPK studies provide a good example of the major        difference of philosophy between PKQuest and the usual        PBPK For example in the rat PBPK developed by Tsuji et        al    for cefazolin nearly every PBPK parameter        required by the model was directly measured including        steady state extravascular volumes of distribution in the        different organs organ blood flows and weights renal and        hepatic clearance time dependence of cefazolin        concentration in the different organs etc This approach        is for obvious reasons impossible for human studies The        basic philosophy of PKQuest is that it is not necessary to        make these measurements for each drug that is investigated        if the PBPK has been previously tested and refined using a        large variety of compounds combined with information        available in the literature For example for these        studies the extracellular volumes of distribution ecf        determined in the inulin PBPK analysis have been used as        the default values for the antibiotic studies As PKQuest        is applied to other compounds these default value will        be improved and modified The more that PKQuest is used        the more reliable are its values and the more confidence        one can place in its results        The major design feature of PKQuest which is to        minimize the number of input parameters required from the        user and maximize the use of previously determined        information supports this philosophy For example the        user only needs to enter the value of fclear muscle and        PKQuest uses the previously determined ratios of PS         i PS         muscle to set all the other organ        permeabilities As another example the user need only        enter the one parameter mecf to set all the extracellular        volumes for each organ and the user knows that a mecf of         corresponds to the standard default human set of values If        the user wanted eg to make the ecf of muscle  larger        than the default it is only necessary to enter ecf        muscle  ecf muscle and the user does not need to        know the actual default value This not only makes PKQuest        easier to use but it also improves the validity of the        final PBPK because the user has confidence that the best        estimates based on previous applications of PKQuest are        being used        The PKQuest program and all of the examples used in this        paper are freely available on the Web at        httpwwwpkquestcom
