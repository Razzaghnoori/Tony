 Hail to the King Henry VI was the Jimmy Carter of the 15 th century Ostentatiously pious surrounded by mediocrities and oblivious to England s crumbling international prestige he managed to cripple the military and bankrupt the government simultaneously Contemporary accounts repeatedly emphasize his gullibility Senior statesmen of Henry s own Lancastrian party judged him an unworthy successor to their previous standard bearer the legendary Henry V identified in the popular mind with the romance of chivalry and the tragedy of an early death All London cheered when Henry VI was driven from office by Edward IV an almost unbelievably charismatic and handsome man whose personal badge the Sun in Splendor evokes the image of a shining city on a hill The elegance of Edward s court contrasted sharply with Henry s drab and simple style and the implied promise of a brighter future proved spectacularly true After a rocky first few years in office Edward shored up the military restored England s presence abroad initiated serious economic reforms and presided over a decade of remarkable peace and prosperity He was however frequently distracted by attacks on his wife who was seen as an extravagant spendthrift and a sinister influence on the king Edward was followed in office by Richard III the man who had been closer to Edward than any other Though renowned for his great personal courage Richard was widely disdained as a man with no guiding principles other than an instinct for power Before long he had squandered his predecessor s magnificent legacy The general dissatisfaction with Richard spilled over onto the Yorkist party which had seemed so invincible with Edward at the helm and raised Lancastrian hopes of regaining the crown Determined not to miss this opportunity the Lancastrians swallowed their distrust of relative outsiders and turned to Henry Tudor Henry was from the remote country of Wales but he looked like a winner And so he was After ousting Richard and claiming the throne as Henry VII one of his first official acts was to raise taxes It was Henry s tax collector John Morton who invented the notorious policy known as Morton s Fork If you live extravagantly then you can obviously afford to pay more taxes On the other hand if you live frugally then you can obviously afford to pay more taxes If history repeats itself we ought to be able to figure out who s destined to succeed Bill Clinton in the White House Henry VII was followed by Henry VIII a man best remembered for his gargantuan appetites his dissipative lifestyle his troubled marriages and his rocky relationship with the Catholic Church The message is clear Ted Kennedy your time has come at last
