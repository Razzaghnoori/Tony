 Chocolate Syrup Designs and American Isolationism Coming up in the 2007 edition of the Oxford Book of Quotations A city probably needs a Fascist to run it Nora Ephron And a country definitely needs an anchorman from South Dakota to run it Kurt Andersen paraphrasing Ephron If Nick is right as he surely is that the cops are driven to bust more non criminals in order to keep their arrest numbers up isn t it just a non simple matter of tweaking the incentivization scheme What I mean is couldn t they build in some bad arrest penalty provision so that the apprehension of a person like your friend would make the policeperson lose credit for two or three good arrests I m sort of serious It would be like when you challenge somebody s word in Scrabble and you re wrong you lose points The memorized order phenomenon in restaurants is meant I think to suggest an extreme competence as well as some more subtextual kind of intimacy as if the waiter is really just a guy you know and you re telling him what you d like to eat as long as he s going to the kitchen anyway Also maybe it s another form of mid late 90s minimalism Less is more and nothing is everything Maybe I should become a Buddhist instead of a Scientologist And those horrible little designs made of chocolate syrup on the dessert plate by the way are also about show offy competence but so very very 1989 I didn t really want to talk about East Timor by the way I have no opinion no information nothing to say I feel the same way you do about it and wars like it To me they re not unlike those roving New York City malathion trucks by which I mean international crises these days also seem like something out of an earlier era Which is to say before the Cold War and World War II when this is how Americans registered nearly all foreign wars isolated two month news stories a sudden ghastly horror show in some obscure exotic place where America has no obvious national interest wars that fit into no grand struggle e g capitalism vs communism that interests or inflames us I think the American default mode is still isolationist intellectually as well as militarily if not economically So maybe we wince a little at the headlines and photographs from East Timor and then like our grandparents did when they read about Armenia turn the page to read about Doris Duke I mean Caleigh Duff Perelman On that happy note I m off to cook dinner and remain Yours truly Kurt
