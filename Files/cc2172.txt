 Introduction Positive end expiratory pressure PEEP is an important component of the ventilatory management of acute lung injury ALI and acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS PEEP improves oxygenation by redistributing the alveolar fluid and restores functional residual capacity by keeping the alveoli open However PEEP can be detrimental because it may particularly at high levels decrease cardiac output by decreasing the venous return as a result of diminished pressure gradient between the systemic veins and right atrium 1 and consequently it may lead to hypoperfusion of vital organs Ultimately despite improving arterial oxygen content PEEP may decrease oxygen delivery to various organs among which the splanchnic vascular bed appears to be particularly at risk because of its predisposing features and the influence of PEEP on regional blood flow distribution Maintenance of splanchnic blood flow is important because splanchnic hypoperfusion may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome 2 3 Mechanical ventilation has been suggested to potentiate the adverse effects of underlying critical illness on splanchnic vasculature and contribute to the development of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome particularly when injurious ventilatory strategies that produce high end inspiratory lung volumes are employed 3 Experimental studies suggested that mechanical ventilation with considerably high levels of PEEP can lead to splanchnic hypoperfusion and marked reduction in hepatic blood flow 4 5 6 Furthermore PEEP may decrease splanchnic blood flow in patients with no underlying lung disease 7 8 Most available evidence regarding the effects of PEEP from animal studies has been extrapolated to humans based on the assumption that the effects of mechanical ventilation on humans and animals are similar However a recent study conducted in humans explored the effect of PEEP in patients with ALI 9 and did not find a consistent effect on splanchnic blood flow Because of the difficulties associated with measurement of pressure volume curves incremental titration of PEEP in an attempt to find the best PEEP based on improvement in oxygenation is common practice in the management of hypoxaemic respiratory failure However it is unknown whether this strategy has an adverse effect on splanchnic perfusion The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of PEEP titration based on improvement in oxygenation on gastric mucosal perfusion in patients with ARDS as assessed by measurement of gastric mucosal pH pH i Method Patients The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Istanbul University Hospital Written informed consent was obtained from each patient or the patient s next of kin We consecutively enrolled 17 patients with ARDS admitted to the multidisciplinary intensive care unit at Istanbul University Hospital The criteria for eligibility were a diagnosis of ARDS based on a consensus report 10 age older than 18 years and mean arterial pressure MAP greater than 60 mmHg with no haemodynamic support All patients were enrolled within the first 24 hours following the diagnosis of ARDS Patients with known cardiac dysfunction or pre existing liver disease were not included in the trial Protocol All patients were ventilated using a Servo 300 Siemens ventilator Siemens Elema Uppsala Sweden using the pressure regulated volume control mode with a tidal volume of 8 10 ml kg based on ideal body weight frequency of 12 breaths min fraction of inspired oxygen of 1 0 and inspiratory expiratory ratio of 1 2 Patients were sedated with midazolam Dormicum Hoffmann LaRoche Basel Switzerland at 4 mg hour and paralyzed with 0 1 mg kg vecuronium Norcuron Organon Oss The Netherlands infusion during the study In addition to employing a radial arterial catheter for blood pressure measurement a pulmonary artery catheter Abbot labs North Chicago IL USA was placed in all patients for haemodynamic monitoring No patients received any therapeutic intervention to improve haemodynamics i e fluid resuscitation or catecholamine infusion throughout the study Baseline PEEP PEEP baseline was set at 5 cmH 2 O and titrated at 2 cmH 2 O increments until the partial arterial oxygen tension PaO 2 reached at least 300 mmHg peak airway pressure was 45 cmH 2 O or greater or MAP dropped by 20 or more from the baseline value Criteria for overinflation of lung and therefore for discontinuation of further titration of PEEP were reduction in PaO 2 of 10 or more and an increase in arterial carbon dioxide tension of 10 or more Optimal PEEP PEEP opt was defined as the PEEP that achieved the best oxygenation whereas maximum PEEP PEEP max was the greatest level of PEEP achieved during titration in each patient A nasogastric catheter TRIP Catheter Tonometrics Division Instrumentarium Corp Helsinki Finland was inserted into the stomach to measure pH i Correct placement of the TRIP catheter was confirmed by radiography Enteral nutrition was withheld throughout the study and all patients received ranitidine 50 mg intravenously In order to allow for equilibration pH i was measured 45 min after injection of 2 5 ml isotonic saline into the semipermeable balloon of the TRIP catheter Partial pressure of carbon dioxide in saline solution and bicarbonate level in arterial blood were measured simultaneously using a blood gas analyzer ABL 500 Radiometer Copenhagen Denmark immediately after sampling 11 and were corrected for the equilibration time 12 The pH i was calculated using the Henderson Hassel bach equation All measurements including respiratory haemodynamic parameters arterial and mixed venous blood gas analyses and gastric pH i were taken at baseline and following ventilation for 45 min at each level of PEEP Haemodynamic parameters were monitored continuously using an Horizon XL monitor Mennen Medical Inc New York NY USA Cardiac output was measured in triplicate by thermodilution technique using 10 ml saline solution at room temperature Cardiac index shunt fraction oxygen delivery DO 2 and oxygen consumption were calculated at baseline and at all PEEP levels Statistical analysis Paired analysis of variance tests were used to analyze the differences between measurements P 0 05 was considered statistically significant All values are presented as mean standard deviation Results A total of 17 patients were enrolled in the present study 11 male and 6 female The characteristics of the individual patients are shown in Table 1 The mean age of the study population was 47 2 19 8 the mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was 19 7 3 5 and the mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was 6 3 1 8 By titrating PEEP we were able to achieve a mean PEEP opt of 10 4 3 9 cmH 2 O and a PEEP max of 13 3 2 9 cmH 2 O P 0 0001 The highest PEEP value applied was 17 cmH 2 O Static compliance improved slightly at PEEP opt but this did not achieve statistical significance P 0 84 Table 2 Changes in peak airway and mean airway pressures at PEEP baseline PEEP opt and PEEP max were statistically significant P 0 001 Table 2 Reasons for stopping the titration of PEEP were reduction in PaO 2 from 20 to 40 n 6 reduction in MAP from 25 to 60 n 4 adequate oxygenation PaO 2 350 450 mmHg n 4 and excessive peak upper ariway pressure n 3 Although PEEP significantly improved shunt fraction and consequently PaO 2 its greater effect on cardiac output led to a reduction in DO 2 both at PEEP opt and PEEP max However none of the changes in haemodynamic parameters including those in central venous pressure pulmonary artery occlusion pressure cardiac output cardiac index and DO 2 achieved statistical significance Table 2and Fig 1 PaO 2 values remained stable at each level of PEEP The mean pH i was 7 31 0 13 at baseline and 7 32 0 12 at PEEP opt it decreased to 7 29 0 12 at PEEP max but this reduction was not statistically significant P 0 84 Similar to pH i alterations in the gap between partial tissue and arterial carbon dioxide tension P t a CO 2 were not significant P 0 353 Although the increase in PEEP had no impact on the group as a whole changes in pH i and P t a CO 2 during PEEP titration differed between individual patients Table 3 The pH i decreased in eight patients 47 it increased in five 29 4 and it was unchanged in four 23 5 at PEEP opt as compared with PEEP baseline The pH i at PEEP max was lower in 12 70 6 and higher in five 29 4 patients as compared with baseline values The P t a CO 2 values increased in nine 52 3 patients at PEEP opt and in 10 58 3 patients at PEEP max as compared with PEEP baseline Table 3 However there were no statistically significant differences in P t a CO 2 values between PEEP baseline PEEP opt and PEEP max P 0 353 Table 2 Interestingly DO 2 in those patients who exhibited a rise in pHi did not increase Rather DO 2 in these patients also decreased although this was not statistically significant at PEEP opt and PEEP max to a degree similar to that in patients who exhibited a drop in pH i Discussion The results of the present study indicate that incremental increases in PEEP do not impact on splanchnic perfusion as assessed by gastric tonometry when cardiac output and consequently DO 2 are maintained In animals PEEP decreases hepatosplanchnic perfusion in a dose dependent manner with a limited effect at PEEP levels of less than 10 cmH 2 O 2 4 5 Alterations in splanchnic blood flow attributed to PEEP occur in parallel to those in cardiac output and consequently can be reversed with restoration of blood pressure 4 13 Despite experimental evidence concerns regarding the effects of PEEP on splanchnic perfusion remain theoretical because large studies in humans are lacking Similarly in humans without ALI or ARDS PEEP reduces splanchnic oxygenation and this is accompanied by decreases in cardiac output albeit with no change in lactate levels 14 Recently Kiefer and colleagues 9 reported no change in splanchnic perfusion when PEEP was titrated on the linear portion of the pressure volume curve in patients with ALI 9 The results presented here which demonstrate a lack of impact on splanchnic blood flow when PEEP is not accompanied by decreased cardiac output corroborate those from animal studies 4 13 and from the recent human study conducted by Kiefer and coworkers 9 The lack of change in pH i at PEEP opt 11 cmH 2 O is in agreement with our current understanding that PEEP at 10 cmH 2 O has a limited effect on splanchnic blood flow Furthermore the presence of ARDS limited the relative impact of increased thoracic pressure on the cardiovascular system Perhaps more important these observations were valid for a wide range of PEEP levels from 5 cmH 2 O to as high as 17 cmH 2 O We ascribed the lack of significant changes in cardiac output and DO 2 in the patients to adequate volume status and preload Relative hypovolaemia appears to be the most likely explanation for the reductions in cardiac output and splanchnic blood flow observed in animal studies Gastric pH i and consequently splanchnic blood flow remained stable at PEEP opt and PEEP max when cardiac output and DO2 remained relatively unchanged Preservation of splanchnic blood flow at PEEP opt and PEEP max was attributed to an increase in oxygen extraction ratio that was sufficient to compensate for the small insignificant drop in cardiac output and DO 2 that occurred during PEEP titration 15 It is also noteworthy that there may be individual variations in pH i in response to PEEP Although differences in pH i response among individuals cannot explained on the basis of changes in DO 2 they may be attributed to differences in the relative impact of underlying critical illness on splanchnic perfusion and variations in splanchnic vascular response i e severity and or duration of vasoconstriction extraction ratio to small changes in DO 2 among individuals Because of concerns about the reliability of pH i for assessing mucosal perfusion we also calculated the P t a CO 2 because it has been proposed to be a better parameter than pH i 16 The pH i level can sometimes be misleading particularly in situations in which gastric tissue and arterial bicarbonate levels are not equal In addition unlike pH i which can change with the degree of alveolar ventilation P t a CO 2 remains a reliable parameter because both components i e partial arterial and tissue carbon dioxide tension are similarly influenced by changes in alveolar ventilation unless they are associated with alterations in cardiac output 17 In the present study changes in P t a CO 2 were not statistically significant and correlated with changes in pH i Consequently we used pHi values in our discussion because we believe that pH i reliably reflects the accurate tissue pH in patients Our results corroborate those from the only other study that evaluated the impact of PEEP on splanchnic perfusion in patients with ALI Similar to Kiefer and colleagues 9 we found no change either in pH i or P t a CO 2 during PEEP titration However there were several differences between two studies Whereas Kiefer and colleagues used pressure volume curves for PEEP titration we titrated PEEP on the basis of improvement in oxygenation which is a commonly used method in clinical practice because determination of pressure volume curves can sometimes be cumbersome Furthermore the present study was larger and we included patients with more severe disease ratio of fractional inspired oxygen to PaO 2 139 in the present study versus 168 in that conducted by Kiefer and coworkers However the present study has several limitations The first and perhaps most important limitation of the study is the liberal titration of PEEP in order to determine its impact on pH i as described under Method see above We acknowledge that in day to day clinical practice some of the patients would not have been managed with such aggressive titration of PEEP and therefore would not have received the levels of PEEP achieved in the study rendering the clinical implications of these observations quite limited Second we did not directly measure splanchnic perfusion but assessed it indirectly by monitoring pH i using gastric tonometry Although the diagnostic value of gastric tonometry has been questioned because some methodological problems we believe that we minimized most of these limitations and improved the reproducibility of our measurements by immediate analysis of samples use of H 2 blockers 18 and lack of enteral nutrition 19 rendering it possible to use gastric pH i to evaluate splanchnic perfusion Third PEEP opt in the study approximately 11 cmH 2 O was lower than levels reported in other ARDS studies 20 Higher tidal volume 10 ml kg leading to higher mean airway pressure the termination criteria used in our study and the differences in titration technique based on oxygenation versus pressure volume curve may account for this difference Finally pH i was measured after patients had been exposed to different levels of PEEP for a short duration Although short term application of high PEEP did not significantly change pH i it is conceivable that longer durations or higher numbers of patients would have led to more prominent reductions and statistically significant differences Collectively the present findings indicate that determination of PEEP opt by titration of PEEP based on improvement in oxygenation is a safe strategy with no impairment in gastric mucosal perfusion when cardiac output is preserved Maintenance of cardiac output during mechanical ventilation with high PEEP may be adequate to prevent its unwanted effects on organs in the splanchnic vasculature Nonetheless the possibility that PEEP can alter splanchnic perfusion when it is applied at high levels and for longer durations cannot be completely excluded Key message Incremental increase in PEEP to identify the optimal value does not affect splanchnic perfusion as assessed by gastric tonometry Competing interests None declared Abbreviations ALI acute lung
