 Edward W Said The game of biographical gotcha is a perennially popular form of ideological blood sport The goal is to find an incriminating datum that will leave a permanent stain on the target s reputation make his defenders look like craven apologists and give the general public a ready made judgment that can be wielded without too much reading or thought If the anti communism of George Orwell or Arthur Koestler bugs you you can point to recent allegations that the former was a snitch and the latter a rapist If you resent the fact that your college professors forced you to read I Rigoberta Mench you can rejoice in the discovery that she embellished some important details of her life story Didn t Karl Marx beat his wife And what about Freud s thing for his sister in law and his taste for cocaine To this list now add Columbia literature professor Edward W Said the subject of a fiercely debated article in the September issue of Commentary The article by American born Israeli legal scholar Justus Reid Weiner contends that Said who was born in Jerusalem to a Christian Arab family in 1935 has over the years deliberately obscured some facts about his early life and amplified others in order to create the impression that he was of all things Palestinian Not so fast says Weiner Said s childhood was not the parable of Palestinian identity marked by dispossession from a beloved homeland and the subsequent pain of exile Instead Said grew up not in Jerusalem but in Cairo where his father an American citizen had moved as an economic expatriate approximately nine years before Edward s birth and had become the owner of a thriving business and there until his own departure for the United States as a teenager in 1951 the young Edward Said resided in luxurious apartments attended private English schools and played tennis at the exclusive Gezira Sporting Club as the child of one of its few Arab members A similar account of Edward Said s youth can be found in a new book called Out of Place the author of which is Edward Said The book Said s 17 th is a wrenching intimate account of growing up in Cairo s wealthy Levantine expatriate community of summering in the dreary Lebanese resort town of Dhour el Shweir and of visiting the family home in Jerusalem sometimes for as long as several months Weiner claims that the memoir is an elaborate sleight of hand and speculates that Said decided to spin the story of his past by telling the truth about it when he heard about Weiner s inquiries In the weeks since his essay appeared Weiner s motives methods and assertions have been roundly attacked by Said and his friends and Weiner has made some attempt at clarification Click for a recap of the controversy and links to relevant articles or click here for my review of Out of Place Just who is Edward Said that his family s real estate holdings and his grammar school records rate 7 000 words in Commentary not to mention three years of research by a scholar in residence at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs Followers of Middle East politics as well as viewers of the NewsHour With Jim Lehrer where Said often appears know him as an eloquent spokesman for the Palestinian cause Readers of The Nation know him as a formidable reviewer of opera and classical music Several generations of graduate students in a number of disciplines know him as the author of Orientalism The 30 000 literary scholars who make up the membership of the Modern Language Association minus one who resigned in protest earlier this year over Said s election know him as Mr President Readers of Al Hayat a London based Arabic language newspaper and Al Ahram a Cairo weekly know him as a regular commentator on politics and culture Each of these identities political activist literary scholar university professor public intellectual are in Said s case inordinately complex in and of themselves The tensions between them between intellectual aesthetic and political impulses that are felt with enormous passion and expressed with great vehemence make Said an uncommonly interesting and endlessly controversial intellectual figure Most controversial and most misunderstood has been Said s involvement in Palestinian affairs He has published half a dozen books on the plight of the Palestinians including The Question of Palestine 1979 After the Last Sky 1986 and Peace and Its Discontents 1995 a scathing critique of the Oslo peace accords which Said calls the Palestinian Versailles These writings his relationship with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and his many years of service in the Palestine National Council the now defunct Palestinian parliament in exile from which he resigned in 1991 after being diagnosed with leukemia have invited smears and misrepresentations A decade ago Commentary branded him The Professor of Terror New York magazine once called him Arafat s man in New York And he showed up last spring unnamed in The New Yorker s special Money issue as a well dressed Columbia don rumored to be on the payroll of the PLO Until very recently Said has been an insistent voice for Palestinian statehood He helped to draft the PLO s Algiers Declaration of 1988 which linked this aspiration to the recognition of Israel s right to exist Over the years he has often said that his own place in such a state would be as its toughest critic Even as he has been unsparing in his indictments of Israeli and American policy he has not let Arab governments or the Palestinian leadership off the hook He has assailed the corrupt authoritarian regimes that rule most of the Arab world punctured the ideological phantasms of Pan Arabist nationalism and reactionary Islam alike and bemoaned the impoverished state of Arab cultural and intellectual life He has also within the Palestinian camp been a consistent advocate of reconciliation with Israel and an opponent of terrorism The Question of Palestine called for a two state solution at a time when the official PLO ambition was total control over British Mandatory Palestine The book published in Israel in 1981 had as of the mid 90s never been translated into Arabic or published in any Arab country In 1978 in the wake of the Camp David accords Said delivered a message from Secretary of State Cyrus Vance to one of Arafat s top aides indicating that the United States would recognize the PLO as a legitimate party to peace talks in exchange for recognition of Israel Arafat ignored the message Fifteen years later when Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin shook hands on the White House lawn Said who had been invited to the event by its patron Bill Clinton stayed home Since then as bien pensant American opinion has embraced the peace process Said has bemoaned Arafat s capitulation and grown increasingly disgusted with the chairman s dictatorial rule over a few scraps of occupied territory and with Israel s continued expropriation of Palestinian lands In the New York Times Magazine last spring he wrote that the Palestinian state toward which the peace process seemed however pokily to be tending could not provide democracy and justice for the Palestinians Instead he called for a single bi national state based on a constitution something neither Israel nor the areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority currently has with the idea and practice of citizenship not of ethnic or racial community as the main vehicle for coexistence But to treat Said solely or even primarily as a political figure is necessarily to produce a distorted view of his life He is first and foremost a literary critic who wrote his Ph D at Harvard on Joseph Conrad a lifelong obsession under Harry Levin one of the champions of a comparative approach to literary study Said s subsequent work has retained much of the expansive spirit and rigorous methodology of Levin s teachings Beginnings Intention and Method the book which made Said s academic reputation is a bulky study of how novels begin carried out through painstakingly close formal analysis and displaying crushing erudition But Said s fame outside the American academy rests on Orientalism his sweeping account of how Western art literature and scholarship have produced a deformed biased picture of Arab and Muslim culture in the service of colonial domination The impact of Orientalism far exceeded its subject vast though that was In addition to laying the groundwork for post colonial studies as an area of inquiry the book inspired a flurry of scholarship devoted to the other to groups of people who by virtue of race gender sexuality or geographical location are unable to represent themselves and so to echo the line from Karl Marx that serves as the book s epigraph must be represented by those more powerful And Orientalism with its harsh critiques of European philology and American social science contributed to an epistemological shift in the American academy Traditional disciplines were no longer to be taken for granted as the vehicles of objective knowledge but themselves became the objects of ideological analysis Both Said s methods and his substantive claims have come under attack Because his theoretical debt to Michel Foucault and his unabashedly political intentions marked him as an avatar of the emerging academic left a lot of the criticism came from traditional scholars In the New York Review of Books for example the Princeton historian Bernard Lewis one of the chief modern villains of Orientalism decried Said s inflammatory tone and questioned his knowledge of history philology and Arabic To read Lewis piece click here For Said s angry response click here But the most sustained assault on Orientalism s premises and on its prestige came from the left In a book called In Theory a wholesale slaughter of the sacred cows of the postmodern Western intelligentsia the Indian Marxist literary critic Aijaz Ahmad raised further questions about Said s mastery of his sources and accused him of self aggrandizement and insufficient political discipline Whereas Lewis attacks Said for trashing the norms and values of traditional scholarship Ahmad rebukes him for hewing too closely to them And while Lewis believes Said to be motivated by a crude anti Western leftist animus Ahmad finds him altogether too enamored of the canons of European literature and avers that Said possesses a very conservative mind essentially Tory in its structure Lewis and Ahmad are both right Orientalism and its even more ambitious sequel Culture and Imperialism are works of passionate almost agonized ambivalence To read them is to encounter a mind at war with itself and the world and ready to go to war with his critics as any number of exchanges over the past quarter century will show Said s evident love of the literature and music of the West continually collides with his righteous anger at what the West has done to the rest His desire to use literary criticism as a weapon on the side of the oppressed sits athwart the pleasure he takes in letting his mind play over the meaning in a novel or a poem The results are books at once exhausting in their detail and maddening in their omissions uneven in tone overreaching and underargued He is easily distracted the critic John Leonard remarked in an appreciative review of Culture and Imperialism answering too many fire alarms sometimes to pour on more petrol O rientalism and Culture and Imperialism are unquestionably incendiary but they are also permanent and exemplary works of late 20 th century criticism in no small part because they invite so much argument because for all the intellectual authority they project they remain open vulnerable provisional And they also fulfill the basic mandate of literary analysis which is to illuminate the works they discuss To return to Verdi s Aida Conrad s Heart of Darkness or Kipling s Kim after reading Said on them is to find them richer stranger and more complicated than you had ever imagined More than anyone else in his generation Edward Said has sought to embody an unfashionable perhaps obsolescent idea of the intellectual immersed in culture and committed to politics placing criticism over solidarity speaking truth to power and steering clear of gods that fail There was a time when this idea flourished more widely even in the pages of Commentary
