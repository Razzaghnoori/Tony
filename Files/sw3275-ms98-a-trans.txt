              so do you have an opinion on credit cards   um i do   you do   what do what do you think about them   i think they get a lot of people in trouble   yeah definitely i have one right now and um i just got it about eight six months ago and i find that it it makes it a lot easier to get things that you generally wouldnt get   uhhuh yeah and then you dont stop to realize that you know you charge this for twenty charge that for twenty charge this for twenty and pretty soon you owe a hundred dollars and you dont stop to think about it   yeah   i got in trouble when i was in the service quite a few years ago like ten to fifteen thousand dollars in trouble   oh my goodness   and then you know so i eventually got it all paid now i carry one i have a gas card and a Visa card and i never use them unless i need to   really   so   thats good yeah yeah id i made a rule with myself when i got one that if i couldnt pay it in full every month that id have to rip it up so   but they yeah       thats a good idea   thats   stops all them interest rates and interest rates arent none too shallow these days anyway   yeah that   but i know a lot of people that get in trouble with them especially you know we have im in Lubbock and we have a bunch of college kids around here going to Tech and they seem to get in trouble with them a lot   umhum i have i have a couple friends too that have about three of them maxed out  and they they cant do anything but work to try to pay them off and and and like one of my friends   yeah   she has hers is up to nine hundred dollars and she does she only earns like two hundred dollars a month because shes going to school   jeez   and and so i mean thats just enough to pay rent and buy like thirty five dollars worth of food a month so and and pay for her like like monthly fee like twenty yeah you have i guess you have to pay like twenty dollars each month is the so all shes paying is interest on hers every month   yeah something like that yeah   it just seems crazy to to me but   well my wife got in trouble one time with hers and she was making like i dont know what she was making forty five dollars a month i think and fifteen dollars of it was because she was over the limit and fifteen dollars of it was interest so she was only paying in it fifteen dollars a month   yeah   so and that was before we got married so       but its you know we sat down and talked about it and discussed it and its its come out pretty good now we have a eighteen year old thats fixing to get out of high school and go to college and   oh really   thats the first thing he wanted   was it Visa card   yeah   oh my goodness   so we kind of discussed that a little bit and shot that idea down right quick   i bet   you know so   yeah im i dont know im about sick of mine right now i dont   but i think theyre too readily accessible and theres too many companies out there that are willing to give them to you and get you draft get you trapped i mean you can always file bankruptcy to get out of it but thats a lot of pain and hassle when   umhum   you know in the olden days when my parents were growing up and uh we couldnt afford everything we didnt have such things as credit cards we just waited till time come around that we could afford it and you know we had all the necessities so   right   and i very seldom use a credit card on necessities i always use it for something i want not something i need   exactly yeah my parents are really good about   so   not using credit cards they are against it  i dont think they like the fact that i have one either   yeah i think if credit cards were as as stringent as say a a home mortgage loan or something like that where you have to you know be able to prove that you can afford this and the rest of your bills we probably wouldnt have the problems we have   umhum   course we wouldnt have the retail market we have either so i guess theyd trade one for the other   yeah   i disagree with it but they still trade one for the other     hm   well thats good im it sounds like you kind of got your head together in the credit department for you sound pretty young so   yeah im nineteen im twenty right now so just going to school and   are you yeah     and working so   all right   it does kind of get in when you want something that like last weekend was homecoming and i needed a pair of shoes so i just went out and bought them and  on my credit card i didnt didnt have the money to do it      yeah   yeah its pretty easy   yep it sure is so do you just have two kids or   uh we have a eighteen year old a seventeen year old and a seven year old   oh really   yeah   neat im from Plano Texas   oh are you   but right now im out in Provo Utah going to BYU so   are you a youre a Mormon then   yep   uhhuh all right   yep but this is a extra long one   whats that   hey theyre giving us a lot of time   oh yeah they may not they must not have too much traffic on Saturdays     yeah have you done a lot of this   uh fifteen or twenty i guess   oh really   oh yeah   do you do it every day   i try to every day i uh i get calls at work i get calls at home so   what
