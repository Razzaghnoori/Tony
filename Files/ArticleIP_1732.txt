front page story and sole editorial were devoted Sunday to the devastation caused by forest fires in the state of Roraima in northwestern Brazil Describing the loss of an area the size of Belgium as an ecological crime the Paris newspaper said 20 000 Yanomami Indians members of one of the last great indigenous tribes in the Americas to have preserved their ancestral way of life are now threatened with starvation because of the fires In its hard hitting editorial Le Monde acknowledged that El Ni o related drought had played a part in causing the fires But this ecological catastrophe for it is an immense one is above all the result of a misguided government policy in effect since the early 1970s when a military dictatorship was in power that sought to populate the Amazonian forest with poor peasants from northeastern Brazil The goal to prevent the region s annexation by foreigners Condemned to destroy the forest because a cleared area provides at best only two years of crops the settlers are the first victims of a perverse policy that unfortunately hasn t changed one jot since the re establishment of democracy the editorial said The Amazon continues to act as a safety valve for the social tensions generated by the unjust allocation of land in the rest of the country It added that Asian forestry companies meanwhile are illegally installing themselves en masse in Amazonia with the blessing of the authorities Afront page cartoon in Le Monde made an improbable link between the Brazilian forest fires and the 30 th anniversary of the murder of the Rev Martin Luther King Jr It showed Yanomami Indian children reading the words I have a dream from a book of King s speeches as one uniformed Brazilian official putting a match to the forest asks another Maybe we should burn books as well In a full page tribute to King the paper concluded The black American community has never again found a leader of his stature In another front page piece titled Clinton the African Le Monde put a positive spin on the president s African tour saying 1 the United States finally appreciates Africa s potential economic importance and 2 what remains to be done by President Clinton s administration is to persuade American investors too to dip their toes into Africa The conservative Jerusalem Post caused a furor Sunday by claiming in its lead story that Hamas bomber Mohiyedine Sharif was murdered not by the Israeli secret service as had been widely suggested but by Yasser Arafat s Palestinian Authority A report from Jerusalem Monday in La Repubblica of Rome said that the Jerusalem Post s source Hamas Gaza leader Abdel Aziz Rantisi denied making the statements attributed to him and that a furious Arafat threatened Rantisi with arrest and interrogation by the Palestinian police Israeli newspapers in the meantime were unanimous in accepting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s word that Israel had nothing to do with Sharif s murder The Palestinian papers focused by contrast on the plight of the peace process blaming the United States for the present impasse Al Quds said the United States hasn t come close to striking a middle ground between Israeli and Palestinian positions on Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank Al Ayyam accused it of imposing the Israeli position on us wrapped in shiny American wrapping paper The Israeli newspaper Ha aretz

improvement in mathematics teaching in Israeli schools citing poor student results Egypt s Al Ahram on the eve of the Islamic Festival of the Sacrifice for the deprived called for an end to the slaughter of rams in the streets Rather than turn our cities into slaughterhouses the paper said the authorities should set up ad hoc organizations to collect money butcher the rams in appropriate

bank governor Masaru Hayami in which he called on his government to cut income and corporate taxes in its promised emergency package to banish the dark prospects hanging over the country s economy The

millions of readers to hunt for a convicted pedophile and child killer as he was released from prison after an eight year internment If any do gooding liberals protest about prisoners rights we ll throw up it said in an editorial The fate of love letters written by Diana to her former lover James Hewitt and stolen from him by his Italian mistress who recently tried to sell them to the London Daily Mirror which instead handed them over to her executors has preoccupied all the London newspapers for several days The tabloid Daily Mail s Peter McKay said Monday the letters should be published immediately the broadsheet Daily Telegraph said in an editorial that they should be returned to Hewitt their lawful owner but that he should agree to keep them sealed in a bank for the next 100 years Amid some evidence of a press backlash against the princess top Sun columnist Richard Littlejohn last week called her a flawed privileged young woman who filled in time between exotic holidays and
