 A Brief History Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world s longest running civilization the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire Peking Man a forebear of Homo sapiens achieved a mastery of fire We might call it the first Chinese invention Not that he devised flint and steel matches or any other way of creating fire Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame perhaps from a forest fire and keep it alight He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries light and heat Technologically and sociologically it was a phenomenal breakthrough with fire communities could live year round in one cave in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued And so by 600 000 b c about 50 km 31 miles southwest of present day Beijing the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down Several hundred thousand years later when Marco Polo reached the capital of China he was astonished by a further development in fire technology The Chinese he announced used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel Europeans did not yet have a word for coal nor had they discovered a use for it The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4 000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia Hsia Dynasty This was still the Stone Age but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees And written language which evolved as early as 4 500 to 5 000 years ago was already in use originally by oracles and then by official scribes China s first scholars During the second of the quasi legendary dynasties the Shang from about the 16th to 11th centuries b c the Chinese developed an interest in art Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements And with the arrival of the Bronze Age the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that until modern times archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3 000 years ago The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government Among the advances of the era were the introduction of astronomical calculations chariots the use of cowrie shells as a unit of exchange the construction of palaces and temples and the refinement of table manners through the introduction of chopsticks The most durable dynasty in the long history of China followed the Shang the Zhou Chou which kept power from the 11th to fifth centuries b c Chinese boundaries were expanded land reform was instituted and towns were built But perhaps more significantly the declining years of the Zhou era produced two of China s most influential thinkers In the rest of the world China s supreme sage Kongfuzi K ung Fu tzu is better known by the romanized name Confucius He was born in 551 b c in what is now Shandong Province in eastern China So profound was his influence that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to the birthplace of the Great Teacher You too can pay your respects at the vast temple raised on the site of his home in the small town of Qufu Chufu and at his tomb in the woods just to the north The classics of Confucius while seldom addressing spiritual and metaphysical matters set standards for social and political conduct that still underlie many of the Chinese ways of doing and perceiving Confucius laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between ruler and subject parent and child teacher and student the individual and the state These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial If the order was disturbed dire consequences inevitably resulted The son who disobeyed the father would bring disaster upon himself and his family just as the emperor who defied the mandate of heaven or ignored the good of the empire brought ruin upon the nation Over the centuries Confucius has suffered more changes of fortune than probably any other philosopher Honored soon after his death as the greatest of scholars he was later revered as semi divine you can still visit temples to Confucius in many Chinese cities During the Cultural Revolution 1966 1976 however he was denounced as a counter revolutionary force It was only after the death of Chairman Mao 1976 and the opening of China to the outside world under more progressive reformers that Confucius too was rehabilitated Unlike Confucius about whose life many specific and even colorful details are known the philosopher Laozi Lao Tse or Lao Tzu is an enigma Estimates of his date of birth vary by well over a century One legend even says he taught the young Confucius Laozi is immortalized by his book of thoughts on man nature and the universe Daodejing The Way and Its Power which became the major text of China s greatest indigenous religion Daoism Taoism With its emphasis on nature intuition the individual paradox the knowledge which is not knowledge and the cosmic flow known as the Way Daoism became the religion of artists and philosophers After the death of Confucius the Zhou Dynasty entered a period of strife known as the Warring States period 475 221 b c Orthodox Communist histories make the advent of this era the dividing line between a slave society and a feudal society It would give birth to the first emperor to unify China The Chinese Empire The word China is a relatively recent innovation believed to be derived by foreigners from the name Qin Ch in the first dynasty to unify China after the Warring States period China of course is a non Chinese term Even today the Chinese still call their nation Zhongguo literally Central Kingdom referring to its position at the center of the universe in respect to both heaven and earth Under the First Emperor Qinshi Huangdi 221 206 b c the empire was organized along strict lines Land was divided into provinces and prefectures with power vested in a central government staffed by highly educated bureaucrats Disapproved books were burned and dissidents executed or exiled Canals roads and the Great Wall were built under the auspices of an extensive public works program staffed mostly by conscripts Official decrees standardized weights and measures and even the axle dimensions of all wagons the latter edict kept transport in the same ruts for countless years You can visit a site of the Qin Dynasty today at Xi an where the First Emperor s terra cotta army was unearthed in 1974 see page 185 The great Han Dynasty 206 b c a d 220 which followed the Qin consolidated the imperialistic order Civil servants were selected by competitive exams the centralized government standardized currency and the Silk Road across central Asia opened up trade with the rest of the world On the military front the Han triumphed over marauding Huns and the Central Asian nomads and Chinese sovereignty was extended almost to today s frontiers The development of a new crossbow which was a longer range and more accurate weapon than China s foes could deploy ensured Han supremacy A golden age began and a university was established in the capital city Chang an now Xi an Intellectuals who had been harried by the Qin were encouraged in their creative endeavors with the invention of paper the influence of their writings spread Sculpture ceramics and silk manufacture flourished And Buddhism a new religion came to China from India via Tibet it was to have an enduring effect on Chinese life and art Like many dynasties before and after the Han succession ended in a new struggle for power and anarchy As a result the nation was split into three competing kingdoms The era of the Three Kingdoms lasted only about half a century but it had as a legacy some thrilling tales of derring do that later inspired various plays and a classic Ming Dynasty novel And the first mention of tea drinking in China occurs in the third century a footnote of fascination for social historians Over the next several hundred years a series of dynasties some led by foreign rulers held power under almost constant threat from usurpers at home and abroad During this unsettled period many people moved to the south the Yangzi Yangtze valley developed into the leading center of Chinese culture As for foreign invaders they brought new ideas but as often happened in Chinese history were assimilated into the more advanced society of the Middle Kingdom National unity and strength were renewed under the Sui Dynasty a d 581 618 a brief prelude to the highest achievements of Chinese art The Sui built a stately new metropolis at Chang an near the site of the old Han capital present day Xi an in Shaanxi Province They also began work on the Grand Canal which was to link the rice growing areas of the Yangzi valley with Beijing an engineering achievement comparable to the construction of the Great Wall The Glory of the Tang In the realm of culture no era of Chinese history has surpassed the Tang T ang Dynasty 618 907 during which poetry and art reached a brilliant apex China s Imperial Academy of Letters was founded about 900 years before any such institution was established in Europe The first known printed book a Buddhist scripture was published in China in 868 The capital city Chang an had a population of more than a million which was far more people than contemporaneous European cities had In Chang an extravagant palaces and temples were interspersed with markets stocked with exotica from as far away as Byzantium Foreign traders journeyed here to purchase silk porcelain and spices and by so doing incidentally introduced the Chinese to foreign ideas Scholars poets and artists all achieved prominence Encyclopedias were compiled and poetry evolved a metric system and lines that rhymed As Buddhism gained strength and took on a Chinese character it inspired the construction of great temples and pagodas adorned with frescoes and statues Artists painted sensitive landscapes and perfected the subtle brushwork of calligraphy Sculptors excelled in portraying lifelike human animal and religious figures Yet by the beginning of the tenth century the Tang rulers had lost their grip on the country Revenues from tax collection dwindled ambitious palace eunuchs plotted reform schemes failed and rebellious forces threatened The emperors distributed their largess to too many warlords hoping to pacify them By 907 the people could see through all the turmoil and confusion that the dynasty had lost the mandate of heaven and so it was that the last of the Tang monarchs abdicated Chinese historians designate the next 50 years as the era of The Five Dynasties and the Ten Kingdoms This transitional period was marred by political and military infighting and by rivalry intrigue and cruelty Then an able general named Zhaokuangyin Chao K uang yin came onto the scene and founded the Song Sung Dynasty 960 1280 which ensured Chinese cultural supremacy for the next three centuries The number of cities in China increased dramatically under the Song mostly in the Yangzi valley and in the southeast Where there were cities there were scholars artists and artisans Movable type revolutionized printing books became more common and literacy increased Chinese scientists published works on botany astronomy mathematics and geography Emperors appointed court painters and glazed porcelain was received abroad with admiration and awe But while art and scholarship continued to thrive the political and military situation deteriorated under the Song Foreign invaders chipped away at the fringes of the empire Taxpayers groaned under the burden of the army and the tribute paid to foreign rivals and complained about the luxuries of palace life Disaster was inevitable invaders from Manchuria forced the Song to retreat to the south And the Mongol invaders headed by the redoubtable Genghis Khan swept across China bringing the whole country under foreign rule for the first time Under Mongol Rule A poignant drama signaled the Mongol conquest of China 1279 1368 After 20 years of resistance the Song armies were finally ready to capitulate The boy emperor was hidden aboard a ship But when it was surrounded by enemy craft the last of the loyal commanders seized the eight year old monarch in his arms and leaped with him to death in the sea The new era known as the Yuan Dynasty lasted less than a century Creativity declined but the new ruler of China Kublai Khan who was grandson of the great Genghis Khan had an open mind and a generally humane attitude towards his new subjects He appointed Chinese bureaucrats and scholars to help rule the country Foreign historians generally conclude that Kublai Khan became an almost authentic Chinese emperor that the conquerors changed more profoundly than the conquered The capital of the new empire was built on the site of present day Beijing and was called Dadu or in Mongolian Cambaluc spelled Kanbalu by that most renowned of medieval travelers Marco Polo His account of the vast new capital throbs with admiration for the palaces and bazaars and the profusion of shade trees He regards with wonder the Great Khan s religious tolerance all encompassing generosity and admirable taste in wives He reports all manner of innovations not least the invention of paper money Counterfeiting he reports had also been discovered Marco Polo s account of life in legendary Cathay was received with incredulity in Europe where it was suggested that his imagination had run wild What else could the citizens of Venice make of his report that the noble and magnificent city of Kin sai now Hangzhou had 12 000 bridges many so high that sailing ships could pass under them In England schoolboys came to call a whopping exaggeration a Marco Polo With the death of Kublai Khan in 1294 at age 80 the Mongols started to lose their grip on China The great emperor s successors lacked his vision and vigor Insurrection was in the air met by oppression and resulting in ever more sustained resistance Finally a full scale uprising led by a peasant general Zhuyuanzhang Chu Y an chang routed the Yuan rulers In 1368 Zhuyuanzhang assumed the throne of the Middle Kingdom founding yet another dynasty of brilliant promise the Ming The Elegance of Ming In Chinese the word Ming is written as a composite of the characters for sun and moon which are combined to mean brilliant or glorious In fact the dynasty 1368 1644 didn t quite live up to its name Beauty was achieved in architecture sculpture and the decorative arts But literature now serving an ever wider audience produced few masterworks and philosophy saw no new developments Science which had been far more advanced than in Europe was so gravely neglected that China became a technological backwater Perhaps to compensate for the Mongol interlude the Ming emperors opted for traditional Chinese values The keeper of the mandate of heaven played his role to the autocratic hilt while bureaucrats kept their jobs and heads by paying him lip service Conservatism and hostility to foreign ideas however couldn t be absolutely maintained During the Ming era China imported tobacco pineapples peanuts and syphilis Thanks to the emancipated Confucian tradition Christian missionaries were usually welcomed although they hardly achieved mass conversions From the Jesuits the Chinese learned mathematics and astronomy the old observatory still stands in downtown Beijing At first the Ming headquarters were moved south to the Yangzi River port of Nanjing Southern Capital but at the beginning of the 15th century the capital returned to what was now renamed Beijing Northern Capital Here Ming architects and artisans produced some of China s most elegant palaces temples and parks including the Forbidden City and Temple of Heaven masterpieces that survive today The move northward made the supervision of defense efforts on the ever sensitive borders of the empire easier The Ming rulers oversaw the construction and renovation of the Great Wall sections that millions of tourists visit today but this wall building eventually proved incapable of keeping out enemies By the 17th century after repeated forays infiltrations and invasions forces from Manchuria capitalized on domestic upheavals in China to take power in Beijing almost by default Consolidating control over the rest of the country though was a long and brutal business The Manchu invaders called their new dynasty the Qing Ch ing Fated to be the last of all the Chinese dynasties it held power until modern times 1644 1911 Pigtails and Prosperity The invading barbarians the Manchu adopted all the refinements of Chinese civilization installing a regime so conservative that it began to hold back progress But for all their Confucian outlook and traditionalism the Manchu imposed one singular feature of their own culture the wearing of pigtails Ironically this was one peculiarity the rest of the world came to consider typically Chinese One of the most dynamic emperors was Kangxi K ang hsi who reigned at almost the same time as Louis XIV of France He presided over a period of prosperity and positive achievement rebuilding Beijing encouraging scholarship and expanding the empire to its greatest area By the standards of his predecessors Kangxi lived modestly enough his concubines numbered no more than 300 Under the Emperor Qianlong Ch ien Lung Kangxi s grandson conflict arose between Europe s empires and the Middle Kingdom England s King George III sent an emissary to negotiate conventional diplomatic and trade relations The emperor flatly turned him down but thanked him for showing such submissive loyalty in sending this tribute mission No insult appears to have been intended even though the message referred to England as the lonely remoteness of your island cut off from the world by intervening wastes of sea China sincerely believed itself to be the center of the world it had nothing to learn or gain from so called foreign devils But such sublime self assurance was to be short lived The soaring demand in Europe for Chinese tea silk and porcelain brought increasing pressure for freer trade However the Chinese were stubborn Needing no commodities they would accept only silver bullion in exchange for goods thus undermining Britain s balance of payments Then at about the turn of the 19th century wily foreign traders thought of an alternative medium of payment opium Tons of the drug were brought into China In 1839 the Chinese government finally cracked down on this drain on the treasury which was also causing mass addiction among the Chinese Some 20 000 chests of opium were confiscated from British merchants in Guangzhou Canton Retaliation came a year later in the first of the Opium Wars which culminated in a series of unequal treaties forced on an increasingly weak Manchu regime China was obliged to open major ports to foreign political and economic penetration Hong Kong was ceded to Britain Infinitely more costly in human terms was the Taiping Rebellion which began in 1850 as a peasant revolt There was a struggle between the Qing Dynasty and rebels determined to overthrow such traditional values as respect for religion private property and male supremacy The revolt lasted 14 years and cost more lives than would World War I The Beijing government finally won but the regime and the nation would never be the same This became patently clear during the Sino Japanese War of 1894 1895 in which the inadequacy of the Chinese army was starkly displayed Japan and Western powers were dismantling the Chinese Empire Demands for reform won the support of the emperor but his notoriously scheming aunt the Empress Dowager Cixi Tz u Hsi edged him off the throne Soon after Cixi had the chance to exploit the Boxer Rebellion 1900 a revolt against foreign influence It was finally put down by the intervention of all the great powers which joined together in an unprecedented alliance China was saddled with payment of a humiliating indemnity and a further loss of respect The elderly empress died in 1908 one day after the mysterious death of her nephew the unseated emperor The heir apparent was a two year old prince Puyi hardly the leader the dynasty and the nation needed in the face of civil disorder and foreign threats Less than three years later an army uprising took place in Wuhan and quickly won widespread support The success of the revolution surprised many observers It came so suddenly that Dr Sun Yat sen the inveterate revolutionary who had led several earlier insurrections was still abroad at the time He returned in triumph to accept the presidency of the Chinese Republic With a stroke of the brush the Manchu Dynasty and its child emperor surrendered in 1911 The imperial tradition going back thousands of years was snapped like a twig Unity Eludes the Chinese But the path of the new republic was strewn with dangers A warlord seized power in Beijing hoping to restore the monarchy A harried Sun Yat sen then moved his new Kuomintang party south to Guangzhou Towards the end of hostilities China entered World War I on the side of the Allies But the Versailles Peace conference proved a bitter disappointment when Japan and not China won control over Germany s former holdings in Shandong Province Frustration inspired protest demonstrations The targets of increasing bitterness were the foreign powers and the regime in Beijing as agitation for drastic social reforms caught the imagination of students and factory workers In 1921 the Communist Party of China with a total membership of 53 held its first national congress in secret in Shanghai A cautious Communist alliance was arranged with the Nationalist Party Guomindang in 1924 Disappointed with the Western powers Dr Sun Yat sen turned for support to the leaders of the young Soviet regime The Kremlin obliged by sending political and military advisors to the Nationalists In turn Dr Sun dispatched his 37 year old follower Chiang Kai shek as head of a mission to Moscow Dr Sun who rallied the Chinese with his Three Principles Nationalism Democracy and the People s Livelihood died in 1925 His successor Chiang Kai shek took over the campaign moving the capital to Nanjing In 1927 Chiang turned on the Communists as well as on leftists within his own party unleashing a vehement bloody purge The Communists who had already organized the support of millions of peasants gathered strength in the south But facing increasing military pressure they set forth on the epic Long March to northwest China a distance of some 10 000 perilous kilometers over 6 200 miles During one of history s greatest strategic retreats one of the founders of the Chinese Communist Party Mao Zedong Mao Tse tung was chosen as party leader It was a mandate he was to retain for the rest of his life The Bitter Years of War In 1931 Japan seized Manchuria proclaiming it the independent state of Manchukuo This was to be a fatal prologue to World War II Over the next few years Japanese troops advanced into several other areas of northern China The government of Chiang Kai shek was so busy tracking down the Communists that the Japanese foe merited only casual attention At one point Chiang himself was kidnapped by some of his own officers a sensational interlude known as the Sian Xi an Incident Its aim was to convince him to form a united front with the Communists But by the time concerted action could be planned the invaders had moved onto a broad offensive The Japanese juggernaut crushed all the resistance in the big coastal cities as well as in Beijing and Nanjing The retreat ended in 1938 with the Nationalist government dug in behind the gorges of the Yangzi River in the last ditch capital of Chongqing Even before entering World War II the United States was supporting the armies of Chiang Kai shek with food fuel and transport However once in the field the Americans soon became disheartened with the confusion corruption and stalling Chiang they believed was hoarding everything from rice to airplanes in the struggle against the Chinese Communists and leaving the Allies to worry about the Japanese When Japan surrendered in 1945 Chiang Kai shek could share the victory toasts as one of the Allies But he was already losing the battle of his lifetime for China By V J Day 15 August when Japan officially surrendered the Chinese Communists controlled an area inhabited by nearly one quarter of the nation s population At first the Americans tried to mediate between the Communists and the Nationalists even while continuing to supply the Nationalists But any chances for postwar cooperation between right and left were wrecked in a matter of months China was sinking into civil war Despite some early setbacks the Communist armies became an overwhelming force They were greeted as liberators by the peasants and met only desultory resistance in most cities The Nationalists in despair fell back and finally fled the country moving the Nationalist government and countless national treasures to the island of Taiwan pledging to fight their way back one day In Tiananmen Square in Beijing on 1 October 1949 Chairman Mao Zedong proclaimed the People s Republic of China After thousands of years of empire and a few decades of violent transition the most populous country in the world was committed to communism Imposing the New Order Before any grandiose plans could be implemented China s fledgling rulers had to rebuild society and a crippled economy Agrarian reform was the first revolutionary innovation followed by the organization of the cities under Party control Hardly had the groundwork been laid when China entered the Korean War sending volunteers to fight against American led United Nations forces Relations between the US and China suffered but Beijing s ties with Moscow prospered in comradely harmony The world s first communist state the USSR shipped technical advisors and rubles to China which patterned many new institutions on Soviet models As in Russia the farms were collectivized and heavy industry took economic precedence Mao Zedong s Great Leap Forward 1959 was designed to mobilize the masses in a crash program of economic growth but it kept the country in turmoil and brought unconvincing results At about the time the Leap was suddenly reversed relations between China and the Soviet Union plunged from polite to frosty to hostile China cut off relations with the world and tested its own nuclear bomb From 1966 to 1976 China was convulsed by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution Millions of young Red Guards went on the rampage and the whole country set about memorizing the maxims in Mao s Little Red Book Thousands perished and much of China s cultural heritage was destroyed as a vestige of feudalism Changes came in quick succession in the 1970s The US president Richard Nixon visited China in 1972 thus normalizing relations between the two countries In early 1976 the widely admired prime minister Zhou Enlai died Eight months later in September death came to Chairman Mao himself Mao s widow the one time film actress Jiangqing and her close associates the so called Gang of Four were arrested tried and imprisoned for encouraging the excesses of the Cultural Revolution Thousands who had suffered during the fervid 1960s and 1970s including the forceful pragmatist Deng Xiaoping were rehabilitated At the same time as Mao Zedong s portraits and slogans were being removed from billboards and schoolrooms a new flexibility was coming to the fore Top priority was now assigned to the modernization of China s underdeveloped economy This opened the way for major scientific and commercial exchanges with the West And foreign tourists soon began flooding into the country to see the splendors that had been inaccessible for so long In 1992 Supreme Leader Deng Xiaoping set into motion a rapid Westernization of China s economy Deng s death and Hong Kong s return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 together marked another new era in the creation of a New China this time as an economic superpower designed to rival the US and Europe in the 21st century In one important respect however nothing has changed all that much since the time of Marco Polo China is still a unique experience a country like no other
