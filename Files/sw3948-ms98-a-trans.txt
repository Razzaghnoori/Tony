                well Liz what sort of things have you had to return lately because of poor quality   well i was just thinking about that i really havent uh i havent had to take anything back that there was poor quality i took something back that that wasnt quite what i thought it was uh you know some uh some it i had even called my brother this was a uh back when the winter uh you know when the winter was so bad and uh i wanted a vaporizer and uh   umhum   i had the right brand and it said a lot of the right things on it but then it wasnt exactly the right one i had to take that back but there was nothing wrong with it   yeah   have you had much trouble with products   well i had an interesting experience with a sweater at Christmas time my mother got me two turtleneck sweaters   uhhuh   one red one and one black one and i wore the red one and it was fine and i got i was in a hurry one morning to go to work i threw on the black sweater with this suit and i wasnt paying attention i was stuck in a meeting all day with a zipper zipper that was gouging me in the back and the sleeves were too short   oh yuck     and i was in this meeting all day long   oh how awful and uncomfortable   yes it was   and they were both the same make and everything   yes same make same size same style everything   oh that is frustrating did they take it back   yes as a matter of fact i took it back Saturday to Dillards my mother bought it at Dillards in Las Cruces New Mexico   uhhuh   and i took it to the local Dillards and said that you know theres something wrong with this sweater these sleeves are definitely two inches shorter       im very tall and have long arms so sleeve length is critical   yeah and and they were willing to take it back   yes   yeah oh well you know now that you mention that i was thinking of how of more of you know kitchen kind of products or or whatever and and i i uh bought the silk shirts that The Limited had and i just loved them and and i bought one out of town and you know at the time i just said could i return it someplace else you know at another Limited they said yes and the silk comes comes i mean i its i am finding it amazing that you can just put silk in the washing machine but nonetheless so i mean its so its sort of like a little miracle anyway but it pulled   yes   in you know in the facing in the uh for the where the buttons and the buttonholes are it just the silk just pulled out and im a little self conscious about being overweight so you know i kept thinking maybe its my fault im stretching it except the thing just hangs around my body you know   oh     so i i took it back and they just without question let me get another one and now this other ones doing it too and i think what theyre doing is not using enough material right there at that seam so that you know it just pulls apart   yeah   but im not sure that i think i dont know do you think things are worse quality now than they used to be or   oh i think some things are clothing definitely   uhhuh   it seems like you have to pay an awful lot to get decent clothing   yeah   and but then other things like oh blue jeans you know always seem to be pretty rugged and pretty tough and   yeah seem seem to  not just sort of be unchanging yeah yeah   yes yes but i think anytime you get into high style items things that change all the time that uh think it gets its tougher for them to maintain the quality   umhum umhum   course if you listen to the the Japanese politicians were  going in the ditch for quality and productivity and everything else     yeah well course uh stuff comes from all over too so uh and i was just thinking about that of of the things that ive that ive uh bought recently id im a little worried about those long items i just had to buy a new washing machine and uh the one i had was twenty one twenty two years old no   um   no no no no it was more like twenty four years old and just had just gone on beautifully the whole time till the end it finally gave up and i had to i think maybe repaired once in all those years you know so   wow so did you buy the same brand the next time   well i did so i mean obviously thats what you think about doing it was a it was a Kenmore and um i so i thought about that and then went and found out you well you know these this company and this companys bought and all the companies all the washing machines are made by the same company something like that with different names     yeah   and i said well no way  you what do you mean theyre all i mean the why would they make them why would they make different ones in different names its the same company making them       i i found that very upsetting and then it made me think about all the things that have been lasting my refrigerator the dryer the dryers still going
