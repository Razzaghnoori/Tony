 Books The Gospel According to the Son by Norman Mailer Random House Norman Mailer s latest act of literary chutzpah an autobiography of Jesus fails spectacularly The New York Times Michiko Kakutani calls it a silly self important and at times inadvertently comical book Criticisms The language is stilted and predictable with Mailer s only additions to the Christ story being the lust Jesus feels in his heart and the hard time he has with celebrity Only Frank Kermode defends Mailer in an erudite reading of the book in the New York Review of Books he attributes to Mailer the subtlety of a theologian whose powerful mind however works in a specialized way not by theological argument but by telling or retelling a story American Pastoral by Philip Roth Houghton Mifflin The best of the three novels published this spring by postwar Jewish American novelists Bellow Roth and Mailer Some say it is Roth s best ever Never before has Roth written fiction with such clear conviction Never before has Roth assembled so many fully formed characters or shuttled so authoritatively through time R Z Sheppard Time Narrated by Roth s fictional alter ego Nathan Zuckerman it is the story of an assimilated Jew whose life is shattered in the 60s by his daughter s Weathermen Underground style rebellion He has created a resonant parable of American innocence and disillusion Kakutani In the New York Times Book Review however Michael Wood calls the book a little slow lacking the manic energy of the other Zuckerman novels Roth s publisher plugs his book W B Yeats A Life 1 The Apprentice Mage 1865 1914 by R F Foster Oxford University Press Coming after a long line of mediocre biographies of the Irish poet the first volume of a two part biography by Oxford historian Roy Foster is greeted

Burroway calls him a chronicler of the middle class for the millennium Time s Sheppard says that the novel s characters are emotionally intricate and its tensions adroitly controlled Others think he
