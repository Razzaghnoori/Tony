 Wretched Excess Guess what Light Years is the one I meant Here s what I wonder about the Peter Unger thing you do mean Peter Unger don t you Is it true I mean is it true that if I buy a blouse I m not saving a child Isn t it possible that if we all stop buying things all sorts of people who currently aren t starving to death will suddenly be out of work and will soon be starving to death Just asking It s questions like that that help me deal with the guilt The Tierney piece this morning was a disappointment to me because although I can never read enough about the Duff Perelman divorce I didn t find Peter Unger particularly interesting on the subject It s a fascinating case though She s Undine Spragg all over again a true Wharton creation I ve been fascinated by her for years when she was married to Mike Medavoy in Hollywood she suffered greatly and neurasthenically having to make do on his pathetic 2 million a year salary no welfare mother had as hard a time I can assure you They built a grand house with a budget that mushroomed beyond their means and when it was finally finished alas there was no money to furnish it The stress from it all caused her to contract Epstein Barr a disease I had believed in up until that point This experience life in a furnitureless home which reminds me somehow of the famous Julie Christie alone on the balcony scene in Darling explains to me at least why Duff is asking for so much money to decorate the apartment she wants Perelman to buy her although I was interested to read an interview in the New York Post with several decorators who said her budget was if anything low Anyway I don t think there s the remotest chance that liberalism the liberalism I grew up with welfare state stuff etc is on the verge of a comeback and there s even less chance that anyone will stop spending money in the flamboyant and careless manner that s become commonplace One of the things that has always fascinated me is the example of Saul and Gayfryd Steinberg who spent their money so extravagantly and publicly in New York in the 80s and were practically stoned for it They d broken a kind of tacit agreement about behavior among rich people the people who would never drive anything but a station wagon and they had to be made to pay Now of course everyone breaks the agreement not just in Hollywood but even in Seattle viz Bill Gates When someone like Pat Duff comes along she provides everyone with a fabulous excuse to feel morally superior And everyone is right to feel that way because her arguments are genuinely disgusting but it s all part of an era of wretched excess that we re all part of and that I can t imagine is going to come to an end any time soon Your question about screenwriters reminds me of the first or second time I did a screenplay for a studio and had to sign the thing they send you called a Certificate of Authorship I took it to the bank to have it notarized and gaily signed it The notary at the bank looked at it Did you read this he said Not really I said This says he said that the studio is the author of your script I was astonished In any case these days if you write an original screenplay for a studio and they don t make a movie from it you get it back free after I think five years The Writers Guild won that one about 10 years ago But of course you don t get it back if it was someone else s idea or if they ve kept it active by ploughing more money into it etc Tomorrow can we talk about Hillary
