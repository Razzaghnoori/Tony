        um basically what do you do to get your news     well most of my reading tends to be professional reading so  uh scanning headlines in the paper or reading over my wifes shoulder tends to be about the only newspaper stuff i do uh and the newspaper is pretty much for local news anyway uh when it comes to national or statewide things uh i keep uh the National Public Radio station uh   umhum   thats available here uh on all day and uh thats pretty much where i get my uh both uh statewide and and national news coverage together with uh a little bit of TV news in the uh in the evenings   umhum   but primarily from from radio uh which is you know thats a dosage of about uh about two two and a half hours of news a day   depending on how long it takes you to get to work   well well i its on in my office and i can i can hear it as im working when im here  my commute is is about fifteen minutes uh so uh uh     oh okay umhum   you know thats not an issue but thats primarily you know where i end up getting it from and and that for for me is as much a a a choice because i find it to be a good way to do it as it is a response to limited time for doing reading and stuff   umhum   its probably more because i just enjoy the coverage than it is because i dont have time to read the paper you know   umhum well do you find that they uh tend to after a certain period of time broadcast the same thing over and over   well they do to some extent i i hear some some repeats between uh uh The Morning Edition and the All Things Considered in the afternoon uh i we do also have a repeated an intentionally repeated coverage they start at five thirty in the morning and uh uh they play the first you know hour again over at the tail end of the broadcast so that people who werent up that early still get to hear it so some of it is intentionally repeated and and so once in a while ill hear the same story twice   umhum   or in the afternoon ill hear the same report from the same correspondent in Yugoslavia uh that they played in the morning so there is to some extent some repetition uh like that   umhum   uh but uh for me its better than trying to read uh Time or Newsweek or or US News each week i tried that once and uh when if i have something to read i feel obligated to read it   umhum   and uh then i felt guilty because i never had time to read everything that was in them   and so you threw the magazines away and wasted your money and   yeah that was that was about it you know uh so now im saving trees and and uh by by not publishing subscribing to the magazines anymore but uh uh            well how do you do it   well basically i get i listen to ABC in the morning uh on the the Good Morning America and while im getting ready for work and other than that occasionally um ill catch some news when i come home my husbands a big news fan and hell always have the news on but sometimes ill get involved doing some other things and um newspapers maybe on the weekend but during the week i just really dont have the time in the morning to get it uh and ill listen to  news on the radio but just in the car radio going to and from work in between music   uh see  here were in in mountain standard time and uh well the few times when ive run into shows like Good Morning America uh theyve really been at the wrong time for me they seem to start very late for us and i got to be at work you know im leaving the house at like seven fifteen and so uh uh   umhum   the some of them  seem to be you know like they dont come on until seven or something and and so theres not enough time and uh to to watch it but they have so many other things that are thrown in that you know i really dont care about you know how to make baked potatoes or or whatever uh or or or weather men with funny hats uh wigs you know     thats another channel   you well yeah but they they all the morning ones have a tendency to do a little bit of that     well this is true they wanna put a little humor in there   and uh you know its mostly just the timing they seem to be on so late in the morning that i i started wondering to myself you know so who is it that watches these things but i think its because of our particular time zone uh it we dont go on daylight savings time and so everything gets shifted by an hour that may have been when i you know i looked in on it uh one time  its just uh you know for me a lot of what i look for in news is as much analysis kinds of things or uh   umhum   sometimes human interest kinds of things that are a reflection of the news rather than just heres the events that happened uh im a real history nut and so
