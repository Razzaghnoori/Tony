 all right well what kind of uh restaurants what type restaurants you like to go to um casual ones but with class you know not too fancy but uh i i won t go to a fast food place uh huh i really can t stand those uh yeah um do you like i mean what is it about uh the the kind of restaurants you go to that you like i mean what makes you like i said what makes you want come back um quality of the food is it well see uh qualities one thing but to me the uh not necessarily just the friendliness of the service but the service is real important yeah to me uh i will go back to a place where uh i smile during the meal you know and just not just because of the food but i mean because either the waiter or the waitresses yeah you had a good time there yeah exactly uh that s real important to me i i can t stand going to a stuffy place i mean it s just that s not me um in your you know like you said fast food restaurants aren t any good either yeah uh huh but uh you know i don t necessarily uh you know there s a place here uh it s um it s good it s a barbecue place and it s uh you know you go through a line and and get your stuff okay but they make it fun you know they they they the people behind the counter are are laughing and joking with you all the time and i you know that s one reason why i like to go back um yeah yeah you know the food is excellent obviously that that is like i said that is important yeah but um you know if i don t know that i would go back as often if it wasn t for the idea that i have fun there yeah that s true there s some places though that i go to they don t have the best service or they re not the friendliest but i ll i ll tolerate it just because i know that s the kind of food i want to eat uh huh and there s other places but like you said the the food doesn t matter it s you have such a good time there have you ever gone to like dinner theaters or or uh things like that yeah i have not in not in a good while but well see i m uh i ve been to dinner theaters but the every time i go it s you know on the nonmeal show type you know type thing so i ve it s been a while since i ve been to one uh just to see the show just to see the show right yeah yeah um normally its comedy i i enjoy comedy although there s one that i m i m really looking forward to going to in the next couple of weeks it s a i just found out that well i m sure they ve they ve had them for a along time but it s uh uh huh it s like a mystery uh theater uh that you you know you eat dinner and all through dinner they re they re doing this act and they they get supposedly get the audience involved in it and everything and that that sounds like that would be hilarious you know um um yeah that sounds pretty wild cause because i love watching mysteries on on TV anyway and i love figuring them out before they do you know yeah of course that s probably a lot easier on TV to figure it out than it is in other things because TV they have a tendency to do a lot of things uh that aren t you know what i mean um predictable exactly but i mean you know the the dinner a dinner theater like this ought to be just wild i don t know predictable yeah yeah that does sound like a pretty neat idea yeah so um i mean is there anything else about a restaurant that would make you go back though well there s this uh there s this type kind of restaurant called a brew pub are you familiar with those no hadn t heard of them where they they brew their own beer there oh yeah yeah and there s i used to live in Colorado and there was a lot of them there and there s actually there s two in the Raleigh area uh huh and uh i m a i m a home brewer myself so i just am envious of these people and you go there and a couple you have gone to you can order like a sampler uh huh and and while you re eating your meal and usually their food is good too they they bring out six different kinds of beer that they brewed on the premises and you just test it s like uh beer tasting thing while you re eating your meal and it s really neat um yeah that sounds kind of neat uh is location at all important to you like you know how far it is from your house or whatever um yeah i usually don t go somewhere that s too far away well yeah i i guess but uh yeah i i think my favorite restaurant is always been the one closest you know the closest as long as it s it meets the minimum criteria you know of good food yeah yeah well i guess for like lunch places that s really important because you usually that much time or or whatever um no kidding working for TI that s pretty important oh so that s why we re getting all these Dallas people that s what i figured but yeah yeah i didn t i don t want to assume that that s what i figured no i m a college i m a university student so uh so yeah that oh okay that also has a has a little bit of bearing on what restaurant choices you have when you re flat broke all the time oh yeah money does yeah i can see that so but uh i m going to be starting working full time this summer so maybe maybe my restaurants will change so you graduating are graduating or yeah well maybe i don t know i d uh i really haven t changed that much since i was in school in school um of course you know i m not sure you ever get out of school to tell you the truth and uh yeah depending on what industry you get into or whatever like uh you know TI being electronics uh you never get out of school so you know um hum no well actually i graduated with a BS in double E in in eighty eight and i ve been in school ever since then i took one semester off and and i ve been taking a class at least one class every semester yeah well like i said though my my change my taste in in food really hadn t changed all that much in in restaurants i mean a little bit yeah uh especially in you know i didn t have the money to go to these dinner theaters and stuff before uh huh yeah right whereas i you know i have gone to a couple of these things before you know lately and you know it s like i said i missed the dinner dinner part of it but i ve gone to the theater uh huh yeah uh but i you know like i said that s that s probably so price really i guess does have a lot to do with it i hadn t even really considered that before um i ve become a lot more health conscious and that s why i stopped eating fast food and places like that um yeah yeah well that s probably true to so i used to love hamburger joints and i don t go to them i don t eat hamburgers anymore but uh huh well unfortunately i m not as good about that as you are i still go every once one in awhile i used to just i i used be a connoisseur of hamburger places Mike s Grill that s the place to go for the best burger yeah well it s like i said you know the different there are different reasons for different things like that and you know hey you re right health is one thing that just yeah now i go for the best place to get uh tofu or whatever not quite that bad but uh i was wondering yeah well all right well i think that should just about do it yeah good talking to you we ll see you later bye bye yeah take care uh huh bye
