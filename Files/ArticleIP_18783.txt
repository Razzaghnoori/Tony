 Ah Youth Max Fischer Jason Schwartzman the 15 year old protagonist of Wes Anderson s well reviewed comedy Rushmore looks like Tom Cruise with his face pinched between a giant s thumb and forefinger so that his tiny eyes are squashed together and his big nose and teeth pop out With his thick black glasses he looks as if he s being photographed through a fishbowl an effect that the director intensifies by shooting much of the movie with a fishbowl lens A student at a prestigious prep school the Rushmore Academy Max travels amid d cor that has a cartoon flatness of perspective and is painted in near luminous primary colors with some added deep brown green crimson and gold leaf to convey the institution s toniness Intent on erecting a multimillion dollar aquarium to impress a prim first grade teacher with whom he s obsessed Max himself seems the king fish of a giant tank How we are intended to view Max is the overriding albeit unstated question raised by Rushmore which played the New York Film Festival last September opened for a week in New York and Los Angeles in December to qualify for the Academy Awards and begins a nationwide run this week My first impression was that Max is supposed to be vaguely repulsive but after spending some time with him and seeing the movie again I decided that there was nothing vague about it he s just repulsive My take I concede is not the only one Anderson and his co writer Owen Wilson who starred in the pair s last film the tediously quirky 1996 Bottle Rocket play a funny game with their indefatigable protagonist On one hand they let us know that Max is a screw up and a hustler on the other they collude with him in myriad ways to the point of warping their mise en sc ne to reflect his worldview and enhance his stature It s this tension that leads some people to regard Rushmore as having dramatic complexity but I think Anderson and Wilson are just trying to have it both ways Like their hero they spend a lot of time patting themselves on the back for being aggressively unconventional Max whose mother died when he was 7 and whose elderly father is a barber attends Rushmore on a scholarship but is one of the school s worst students The movie merrily relates the ways in which he compensates for poverty and academic disgrace He tells people that his father is a neurosurgeon He is shown leading the debate society the fencing club the French club the chess club and the Max Fischer Players who perform wildly inappropriate dramatizations of such films as Serpico to undiscriminating audiences He has we are told spent the previous year petitioning to have Latin expunged from the curriculum now to impress the teacher Olivia Williams he campaigns to have the course restored When a self made millionaire businessman Bill Murray delivers a cynical derisive speech to the privileged student body Max recognizes a kindred spirit and aggressively befriends the tycoon eventually enlisting him in his extravagant aquarium scheme How I repeat are we supposed to take Max Are we to cheer his ludicrous efforts to bed a woman twice his age Is it supposed to be cute when he sites the aquarium in the middle of the school s baseball diamond and brings in the bulldozers without informing anyone in the administration Anderson and Wilson are poker faced Max s obnoxiousness might be meant as a state of grace R ushmore does captures something of adolescence that few movies come near It often unfolds in a narcissistic trance That s not a negligible feat What I wanted however was a larger perspective something more insightful than the one thing after another existential whimsy that made Bottle Rocket such a trial In one scene ripped off from My Left Foot 1989 Max gets drunk in the course of a celebratory dinner and insults the teacher s date I have a hit play What did you ever do His churlishness isn t compelling it s just an embarrassment a callow cry for attention Notice me says the character and you say Why As the teacher Williams has the right combination of standoffishness and warmth but she s more colorless than this passive part requires Murray in a dry straight turn lowers the volume on his wiseacre act confining his trademark irony to an occasional glint in the eye and in the face of crisis an escalating air of gonzo dissolution He s fine but the raves and the awards for this performance are baffling Much more fun is Brian Cox as Rushmore s headmaster A truly weird actor who in Manhunter 1986 made for an eerier Hannibal Lecter than Anthony Hopkins Cox rules with the kind of settled irritability that suggests why prep schools are petri dishes for acts of adolescence defiance In the Arts Leisure section of last Sunday s New York Times director Anderson recounts how he traveled to the Berkshires to show Rushmore to the retired New Yorker critic Pauline Kael from whose writing he says he learned to watch movies Hoping for an ecstatic reaction from this most vital of critics he found instead an old woman hobbled by Parkinson s disease and one whose response to his film was gnomic and gently dismissive Bummer huh So Anderson turned around and wrote up the encounter in a way designed both to deflate his own persona and to make sport of Kael s infirmities and memory lapses I met Kael in the mid 1980s while I was writing criticism for the Village Voice but only got to know her after she retired from The New Yorker In general she s a lot more lucid than for instance me The memory lapses over the summer were caused by something else specifically Sinemet a powerful Parkinson s drug that has been the talk of various Web sites devoted to the disease The consensus is that the medication mitigates crippling tremors but that users need to have their levels monitored carefully because too much can leave you muddled It was in this phase of Kael s Sinemet trial that Anderson made his appearance with film cans in tow and poised to tell the world that she no longer remembered who Bill Murray was Given the state of her health at the time it was gracious of Kael to entertain this chucklehead for even a minute a mistake she probably won t make again Anderson meanwhile probably doesn t realize that he did anything unseemly What do you expect said a friend He s like the kid in Rushmore a callow narcissist At least the kid in Rushmore confines his aesthetic offenses to high school auditoriums
