 Introduction Rheumatoid arthritis RA is a significant chronic disease that afflicts 1 of the general population in most countries 1 Joint damage typically occurs before patients are diagnosed and most of the joint destruction occurs within the first 2 years of diagnosis 2 Therapeutic drugs such as sulfasalazine and methotrexate MTX only slow the progression of the disease suggesting that these drugs fail to adequately quell the underlying pathophysiology of RA 3 Tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF is elevated in sera and synovial fluid of patients with RA suggesting that it may play a role in the pathology of the disease 4 Soluble TNF receptor or neutralizing antibodies against TNF have been shown to prevent collagen induced arthritis in mice 5 6 Furthermore a human TNF hTNF transgenic mouse Tg197 develops a chronic progressive polyarthritis with histologic features in common with RA 7 Weight loss and joint swelling in these mice are correlated with expression of hTNF mRNA in the joints 7 and hTNF concentrations in the serum 8 9 Previously Keffer et al 7 showed that progression of disease in these mice could be prevented by treatment with anti TNF monoclonal antibody mAb In this study we utilized the Tg197 mouse model to further assess whether anti TNF treatment can ameliorate established disease in both young and aged mice Materials and methods Tg197 mice and anti TNF mAb treatment Heterozygous Tg197 transgenic mice obtained from Dr George Kollias Hellenic Pasteur Institute Athens Greece 7 were identified by PCR analysis using primers to the 3 modified hTNF gene Two experimental groups of 25 mice were used Young mice were enrolled into the study when they developed clinical signs of arthritis at 7 or 8 weeks of age A second group of mice was maintained disease free with 10 mg kg of anti TNF mAb weekly starting at 4 weeks of age when they reached 24 weeks of age the treatment was stopped and these aged mice were allowed to develop arthritis before they were enrolled into the study The enrollment criteria for both young and aged mice required them to have a clinical score of at least 2 on two limbs The experimental protocols were approved by Centocor s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee The murine anti TNF mAb used in this study binds with high affinity to hTNF and prevents binding to the TNF receptor 10 Anti TNF mAb was administered by intraperitoneal injection at 10 mg kg weekly and the animals in the control group received weekly injections of saline Clinical scores Clinical scores were based on a previously described scoring system 11 modified as follows 0 normal 1 edema or distortion of paw or ankle joints 2 distortion of paw and ankle joints or 3 ankylosis of wrist or ankle joints The sum of all four paws was scored weekly with a maximum possible score of 12 per mouse Histologic processing of joints Specimens were processed and scored as described previously 12 13 and in the supplementary material ELISA assay Serum samples were separated from whole blood which was collected by intracardiac puncture at baseline and at 3 6 and 16 weeks post treatment Serum levels of hTNF were determined by ELISA at a 1 2 dilution according to the manufacturer s instructions Biosource International Camarillo CA USA RNA isolation and RNase protection assay Samples were prepared as described in the Supplementary material and analyzed in an RNase protection assay according to the manufacturer s instructions PharMingen San Diego CA USA Statistical analysis All data are expressed as means standard deviation unless noted otherwise Statistical significance was tested using analysis of variance for multiple groups If significant differences were found pair wise testing was performed using Tukey s test The level of significance for all comparisons was set at P 0 05 Results Amelioration of established polyarthritis by treatment with anti TNF mAb Increased cartilage turnover and repair in response to insult has been observed in young mice whereas aged mice show decreased cartilage turnover after closure of the growth plate 14 Therefore anti TNF treatment was evaluated in both young 7 8 week old and aged 27 28 week old Tg197 mice with established arthritis The mean clinical arthritis score at baseline was 6 Fig 1 indicating arthritis was established at the commencement of treatment The clinical arthritis score increased progressively in the saline treated group and these mice were humanely killed at 6 weeks In contrast the clinical arthritic score was markedly decreased in the groups both young and aged treated with anti TNF indicating a marked suppression of their arthritic symptoms Fig 1a 1b Mice in the saline treated group progressively lost weight whereas mice in the anti TNF group showed a significant weight gain throughout the study see Supplementary Fig 1 The arthritic score weeks 1 to 16 post treatment Fig 1a 1b and weight gain weeks 5 to 16 post treatment Supplementary Fig 1 in the group treated with anti TNF were significantly improved in comparison with the saline treated group in both young and aged mice More importantly the arthritic scores for the group treated with anti TNF were significantly improved in comparison with the baseline score from weeks 4 through 16 in both young and aged mice Fig 1a 1b These results indicate that disease progression was not just prevented but was reversed following anti TNF treatment Effects of treatment with anti TNF mAb on joint histopathology All joints were scored in a blinded fashion for synovitis bone erosions and cartilage degradation using a predefined scoring system The mean histologic scores for each treatment group at various time points are shown in Fig 2 Saline treatment was followed by increased histologic scores for synovitis bone erosions and cartilage damage relative to that observed at baseline Anti TNF treatment for 6 weeks significantly reduced all three histologic scores relative to the baseline score in young mice Fig 2 and two of the three histologic scores in aged mice Supplementary Fig 2 After 16 weeks of anti TNF treatment synovial inflammation and bone erosions were almost completely resolved in both young and aged mice and a significant reduction in cartilage degradation in comparison with baseline was maintained in young mice Cartilage degradation in aged mice treated with anti TNF was similar to that at the baseline measurement and significantly lower than that in the saline treatment group Supplementary Fig 2 Representative tissue sections of the ankle joints from young mice are shown in Fig 3 Evidence of arthritic disease was readily observed at baseline Fig 3a 3b and the disease continued to progress in saline treated mice at 6 weeks with increased cell proliferation and inflammatory cell infiltration erosion of cartilage and bone and loss of proteoglycan from the cartilage Fig 3c 3d However after 6 weeks of anti TNF treatment improvements in all histopathological parameters were observed with both staining procedures Fig 3e 3f No visible evidence of bone or cartilage erosion was observed and all signs of cellular proliferation and infiltration disappeared The proteoglycan content of the cartilage was notably improved Extended treatment with anti TNF for 16 weeks maintained normal joint architecture data not shown These results demonstrate that blocking hTNF reverses joint inflammation and promotes joint healing in this model of polyarthritis Inhibition of TNF and other proinflammatory cytokines To define the underlying mechanisms by which anti TNF mAb ameliorated joint inflammation and structural damage the levels of various proinflammatory mediators were examined First circulating hTNF levels as detected by ELISA were more than halved as early as 3 weeks and the reduction was sustained for 16 weeks after treatment with anti TNF mAb in comparison with saline treated animals Fig 4a In addition murine IL 6 IL 1 and IFN mRNA which are expressed in the arthritic joint tissues were clearly diminished following anti TNF treatment when total joint RNA was examined by RNase protection assays see Supplementary Fig 3 When the levels of murine IL 6 IL 1 and IFN mRNA were standardized to glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase GAPDH Fig 4b 4c 4d a 2 3 fold reduction in murine IL 6 and IFN was observed in the aged animals treated with anti TNF in comparison with those treated with saline at 6 weeks post treatment Fig 4b 4c Interestingly local expression of murine TNF mRNA was not affected by treatment with anti TNF antibodies suggesting that hTNF plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of arthritis in this model Discussion Currently MTX is the most widely used disease modifying antirheumatic drug for the treatment of RA However MTX treatment rarely results in complete disease remission 15 and only slows the progression of joint erosion 16 In addition long term treatment with MTX is associated with pulmonary 17 and liver toxicities 18 and other side effects Therefore a treatment option that facilitates reversal of joint damage and has longer effectiveness and fewer side effects is desirable Experimental arthritis models have contributed to the basic understanding of joint disease and to the development of effective antiarthritic agents 19 Several models have been used to mimic human RA ranging from immunization with cartilage components to infection with joint trophic organisms 20 21 Blocking TNF 6 22 or IL 1 23 24 in these models has routinely shown benefit although some questions remain regarding the role of these cytokines in mitigating joint inflammation versus preventing cartilage degradation and bone erosion 25 Using the Tg197 mice we have shown that maintenance anti TNF therapy initiated after joint inflammation and erosions have occurred allows damaged joints to heal Specifically anti TNF mAb proved equally effective in reversing joint synovitis and erosions both in young mice where an active repair process to damage occurs and aged mice where the repair process has relatively slowed However the repair of cartilage damage was different between young and aged mice Cartilage in young mice treated with anti TNF was significantly improved relative to saline treated and baseline mice By comparison treatment of aged mice with anti TNF prevented further cartilage damage but did not improve histological scores relative to baseline values Mechanistically the therapeutic effect of anti TNF appears to be due to either neutralization of soluble hTNF or inhibition of hTNF production in the diseased joint Additionally other proinflammatory cytokine mRNAs were decreased in the local diseased tissues either through suppression of inflammatory cell infiltration or inhibition of cytokine production Moreover anti TNF treatment resulted in a modest inhibition of murine IL 1 production in the diseased joint which is consistent with previous findings that anti TNF antibody inhibits the generation of IL 1 in collagen induced arthritis and IL 1 IL 6 and IL 8 in rheumatoid synovial cultures 26 27 Our study provides preclinical evidence supporting the use of anti TNF mAb in ameliorating arthritic pathology The progressive arthritis observed in Tg197 mice is similar to the pathology in patients with RA Recent clinical data indicate that the blockade of TNF significantly reduces the signs and symptoms of RA 28 29 and inhibits the progression of structural damage 30 31 It remains to be seen whether extended anti TNF therapy might permit regeneration of articular cartilage and bone in established human disease where multiple etiological pathways may contribute to the RA disease syndrome 32 33 Nevertheless it is likely that much of the RA pathology involves TNF activation and the results from the Tg197 model provide a sound scientific rationale for the therapeutic benefits observed following anti TNF treatment in RA patients Conclusion Progression of established polyarthritis in the Tg197 hTNF transgenic mouse can be reversed by treatment with anti TNF mAb as shown by significant improvement in
