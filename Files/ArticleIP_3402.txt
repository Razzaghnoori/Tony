 The Turtle By William Carlos Williams 1883 1963 posted Wednesday Nov 26 To hear Robert Pinsky read The Turtle click In the genre of the commissioned poem there are not many as charming as this one When Williams addresses the child as his noble patron my Lord and alludes to the old myth of the tortoise that supports the universe he slyly introduces the underlying weight of civilization and history into the interchange between him and the child The matter of fact acceptance of the violence in the child s imagination is an interesting aspect of Williams own omnivorous imagination I don t think any other poet has succeeded in using the American word car as effectively as Williams does in this poem and others Robert Pinsky Not because of his eyes the eyes of a bird but because he is beaked birdlike to do an injury has the turtle attracted you He is your only pet When we are together you talk of nothing else ascribing all sortsof murderous motives to his least action You ask meto write a poem should I have a poem to write about a turtle The turtle lives in the mud but is not mud like you can tell it by his eyeswhich are clear When he shall escape his present confinementhe will stride about the world destroying all with his sharp beak Whatever opposes him in the streets of the city shall go down Cars will be overturned And upon his back shall ride to his conquests my Lord you You shall be master In the beginning there was a great tortoisewho supported the world Upon him All ultimatelyrests Without him nothing will stand He is all wise and can outrun the hare In the nighthis eyes carry him to unknown places He is your friend
