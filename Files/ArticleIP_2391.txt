 Patrick O Brien s I The Last Campaign I hard upon forging their unexpected alliance amid the quadrennial panoply of the Grand Old Party s nominating convention our protagonists acting in unavoidable response to the exigencies of a contest dominated by the incumbent s strategy and tactics set out for the heartland in a manner similar to his where beneath storm riven skies suggestive of incunabular Turners the desperate reality of their task began to reveal itself rising like a black basalt orogeny from the soft soils of internecine enthusiasm Chapter 5 the locomotive a diesel burning Class 2900 Santa Fe 4 8 4 that had been constructed in 1943 but had survived the decades most admirably and now gleamed like a Secret Service agent s lapel pin was gaining speed swiftly its one hundred and five tons departing another whistle stop in another anonymous town whose inhabitants clustered where the rails seemed to converge their fluttering hands and smiling faces congealed into a tuberous mirage that already was beginning to deliquesce its bipedal spores gamboling away from the station where only moments before the candidates had stood to receive the traditional accolade from the traditional close packed crowd The last car with its funereal platform and tufts of bunting gave off a flapping chorus that enveloped Dole and Kemp as they looked backward down the rails Around them edged subalterns each plucking away like a blue suited migrant worker the decorations that went up before each stop The crew had to work quickly lest momentum send the froufrou and gewgaws drifting onto the roadbed In a minute the removal had been accomplished and the two men on whose behalf this excursion had been undertaken again had the expanded steel protuberance to themselves Even Glassner for dog s years Dole s body man and coat carrier had retired to the common area where the staff would be attempting its usual stab at gaiety They believed in Bob Dole they had to believe in him even as his brooding presence infected the farthest corners of the campaign with an acidity specific to him His people would never admit what he was admitting that the prize he had chased almost all his adult life was bound to elude him in the most humiliating manner His capacity for gloom had ever equalled his capacity for work but he could never have foreseen his worst musings out galloped by the campaign of 1996 a broken backed stumble in which no error was too small to convert into an enormous problem He had in his wretched twenties dangling by a wrecked arm on a homemade exercise gibbet accepted no hugged to himself the knowledge that life was hard and then you died It was damnably unnatural this state to which he had most ironically ascended When things were in their proper order a buoyant spirit led not a mordant one and what was he if not the most mordant man in America It was a cruel fate to replay in parallax the role he had taken decades back with the affable Ford a man who like Kemp could be counted on to float above any malaise like an empty water cask It was as if he had been struck by a hail of red Kryptonite and instantly become the Bizarro candidate immensely strong yet unable to prevail against the backward beating current Dole who at the rally had projected a steely excitement the contained enthusiasm of a veteran politician in firm grip of his emotions but willing to share with his supporters what bits of them he must sank back into himself simmering in a glumness he wished he could contain but knew he could not Terrible things had always happened to him and always would this was only the latest of them but it was a terrible thing of a specifically galling nature He was the most prestigious passenger on a hell bound train a shining doomed conveyance hurtling down a narrow and fatal track Through all his trials darkness had always been his strength an obsidian girder holding him to the path now it stood to crush him and perhaps not coincidentally the entire Republican ticket which his opponent s ever clever propagandists had labeled as Dole Gingrich as if he and the pumpkin headed speaker had conspired like Jesuits to ruin the nation Kemp leaned closer speaking more loudly than was necessary perhaps to compensate for the rush of air around them and the clatter of steel wheels beneath and behind Something preoccupies you Bob Kemp said I thought that was really neat back there didn t you It was Kemp s habit to voice such banalities in an utterly unironical manner a gift of naivet withheld from Dole since birth and made even more distant by life Why could he not have been born a Kemp blessed by luck and genes with the smiling disposition of a boy who is shown a stable full of ordure and instantly concludes that there must be a pony in there somewhere Dole was sentenced to always know better than what he wanted to believe Yes most assuredly he replied struggling not to answer with a grunt I sense we might profit from a few minutes out of the weather Of course there was no weather to speak of but he had learned a thousand years ago that sometimes he had to say something Certainly his running mate said stepping aside so the older man could enter the rail car He did so with surety using the elbow of his bad arm to steady himself at the threshold then raising both fists in a stretch At the far door a steward stood Your pleasure gentlemen A Diet Coke if you will please Kemp chirped Caffeine free None for me right the moment thanks Dole pulled off his suit jacket and assumed his usual position in an overstuffed chair on the starboard side of the car He loosened his tie Kemp still wearing his jacket did likewise What troubles you my friend he asked again Is it the poll numbers The back bounce We have as yet seven weeks to do the things we must Do not despair As you know despair is not in my vocabulary Dole said leaning suddenly so that he was looking Kemp in the eye He wanted to bark out the syllable that had become his hated signature but did not Damn the myopic but all seeing eyes of that news ferret Cramer for having the cruel wit to reduce him to an onomatopoeia No longer could he essay an Aaargh in public or private without apprehending in his marrow that he had become what he was described as being No what is on my mind is the damnable situation into which we have been thrust by this contest Dole continued rising to his feet Clinton and his railroad trick have forced us into a like strategy I would vastly prefer to travel by aeroplane there is no substitute for the swiftness the ease the comfort but here we are bumping along the ground like a crippled millipede waging a campaign that could have been waged in the latter days of the last century But surely Bob you must acknowledge the romantic appeal of the tactic Kemp said At Nixon s grave remember it was you who invoked the whistle in the night the long rumbling procession of cars carrying someone else somewhere else Yes yes I recall my eloquence all too well Dole said exasperated at having been caught in the web of his own rhetoric But I was not running for president then Kemp grinned impishly Bob you have been running for president since 1976 he said What would you say to a little game something to take our minds away from the press of combat The suggestion relaxed Dole Excellent he said Let us commence with a session I will wait on the platform while you make ready Kemp velellidous mop shining like the crest of a blow dried raptor reached for their instruments Upon joining the ticket he had instantly made it his habit to maintain the equipment Amid the clotted air on the platform Dole let his eyes ease into the night Bob my friend Kemp called from the center of the railway car He was holding up a pair of grey rectangles linked by a black umbilicus and each winking a single garnet eye Excellent news I have found the Game Boys The batteries are as fresh as new flounder Lose not a minute Dole could never have predicted that in this his grimmest hour after all these years of morosely pursuing the presidency he would come to enjoy as his particular friend a chronically cheery former footballer who could broadcast an enthusiasm for gimcrack economic theory in such a way that one could not tell if he was embracing it or mocking it Now as he squinted at the red lights in Kemp s fists and felt his companion s boon personality radiating in his direction he also faced the knowledge that life was more durable than pain more difficult than you could have imagined and yet still you lived as he now lived seeing that his last campaign the battle to the candidacy would be his last success He stepped inside and closed the door on the wind
