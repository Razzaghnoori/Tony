 Brandi s Bra What s the Goal Normally I find William Saletan to be one of the more intelligent journalists on the mainstream beat However his analysis of the controversy surrounding Brandi Chastain s removal of her jersey after clinching the World Cup trophy is indulgent quixotic and utterly aggravating He dismisses the men do it explanation as superficial when it s the only one that makes any real sense Does anyone on either side of this absurd debate really believe that an athlete upon scoring the winning goal in an international championship game was actually trying to stage some kind of cultural coup With adrenaline pumping in the moment of realizing the dream of being a hero with memories of the soccer greats running through her head she did what soccer players do when they can t contain themselves Are the pundits of the world so conceited that they really believe that she was acting to supply them with more fodder I think it was the game against North Korea when in celebration of a goal one of the players did a running flip flop flip a common soccer player s celebration The announcer called it gymnastics Apparently to him the only sports against which women would be measured were gymnastics and figure skating Regardless of which side of the sports bra debate Saletan supports or anyone else who considers Chastain s behavior in light of its social commentary rather than its expression of athletic competition and pride it s the same kind of sexism Soccer in America for the moment is a woman s sport That means that the culture of soccer with all its grace and skill brutality and bravado will be exhibited by female American athletes It makes me wonder what people would be saying if women s baseball became popular and the commentariat was forced to watch women chewing tobacco and grabbing their crotches Chad Levinson New York Don t Devaluate Now Paul Krugman has been for a long time a very critical observer of Argentina s currency board he has suggested a devaluation many times in the past Almost at the end of his article he says that given that the Brazilian devaluation didn t bring hyperinflation it could be expected that an Argentinian devaluation wouldn t bring hyperinflation He concludes that from the fact that the two countries have dismal economic histories but dismal doesn t mean the same On the surface both countries might look quite alike but people s reaction to inflation and economic measures has proved to be very different so we shouldn t expect to see both countries reacting the same way I deeply admire Krugman but if he wants to write about Argentina or any Latin American country he should dedicate some time to trying to understand what each country is like They all might look the same but they are different people are very different and react in different ways Historically what has been good for Chile Argentina s neighbor has been a disaster for Argentina and this works the other way around If he had dedicated time to studying Argentina he would have found out that Eduardo Duhalde is desperately trying to gain votes relying on old clich s that he expects will still be appealing to Argentinians and trying to show how different he is from Carlos Menem in part because he is different and in part to avoid the opposition attack Krugman would also have found out that the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange is not representative of the way things are Bonds are important and what businessmen are doing is important I agree that we have a regular recession and that the currency board prevents us from applying the usual recipe but it s not clear that it would work and at this point breaking the peso commitment would be extremely onerous Right now we have a recession and an increasing fiscal deficit a comment on the virtues of keeping balanced accounts would be very appropriate if we devaluate chances are we would also have an inflation outburst a rush against the banking system and a capital flight When analyzing Argentina it s important to keep in mind that since we ve been cheated many times we have learned how to beat the system Mar a Laura Segura Buenos Aires Argentina Paul Krugman replies I was of course aware of the politics that led to Duhalde s remark And in case this wasn t clear the article did NOT claim that Argentina s currency board is necessarily a foolish idea only that its downside could not be ignored But I will say this One should always be suspicious of arguments that claim that one country is utterly different from others Yes every country is unique but not all that unique Anyway only a few months ago many people including Argentine economists were claiming that the contrast between Argentine success and Brazilian crisis meant that Brazil must emulate Argentina s currency board you can t take that position and then claim that the role reversal that has taken place since doesn t teach a contrary lesson Pilot Error I agree with James Fallows warning to inexperienced pilots who may know how to fly under good weather conditions but who haven t much under the belt on a hazy night We all mourn the death of John F Kennedy Jr but at the same time I will go beyond Fallows opinion and say that Kennedy s decision to fly on a hazy night in a new one engine plane over water is not risky it s down right reckless I have two daughters and if I knew that my two daughters were going up in a one engine plane with a husband who lacked sufficient experience on a hazy night over the sea I d do everything in my power to prevent it from happening If the pilot wants to take that chance alone fine but once he allows passengers he has to be responsible enough to make the right decision for not only himself but for those two girls as well My daughters safety is the primary concern Unfortunately John Kennedy wasted his own life and the lives of two young and beautiful girls without thinking This isn t worth the risk when he knew it could be dangerous under such conditions Sandy Shapiro Woodside Calif Governer Bush in Deed Regarding I have been in the title insurance business for 27 years and prior to that did my master s thesis on the field at Wharton It is not true that a person must include a prior set of restrictions in a deed when he sells his property He may simply refuse to include them It is up to the buyer and the buyer s title company to discover them in the chain of title and to determine if they have any legal force or effect Bush did not have to do anything except direct that the restrictions be omitted or stricken from the deed he granted to his buyer The only circumstance in which he would need to seek the consent of other landowners in the development would be if he wanted to petition to change the restrictions or permit an exception to them As a lawyer Bush should have been fully aware of the language in this instrument which both he and his wife had to sign and of his legal prerogatives As the governor of his state he should have had the decency fortitude and sensitivity to recognize the importance of refusing to include these restrictions in his deed Incidentally in Pennsylvania the presence of a racial restriction in a set of deed restrictions makes all the rest of that set of restrictions e g as to the maximum height of fences the prohibition of nonsingle family residences etc null and void This was a result of a case involving the will of Steven Girard and Girard College in Philadelphia that went to the U S Supreme Court in the 1960s and resulted in a landmark decision
