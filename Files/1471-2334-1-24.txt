 Background Resistance to acyclovir ACV or penciclovir PCV generally arises by a single base mutation in either the HSV thymidine kinase TK or DNA polymerase Pol gene for a review see reference 5 Unlike Pol TK is not essential for virus replication in cell culture 7 although in vivo analyses implicate it in HSV virulence pathogenicity and reactivation from latency 4 8 16 22 Since ACV and PCV are dependent upon HSV TK for monophosphorylation an event obligatory for the formation of the active triphosphate inhibitor 14 ACV risolates often exhibit high levels of cross resistance to PCV 2 3 Viral populations are naturally heterogeneous there are approximately 6 to 8 TK deficient variants per 10 4plaque forming units PFU of HSV 1 laboratory strains and clinical isolates that have never been exposed to antiviral selection 6 13 15 17 Resistance to nucleoside inhibitors of HSV arises readily in tissue culture probably by selection of pre existing mutants 10 13 18 Moreover Field et al 9 demonstrated sequential HSV inoculation from mouse to mouse receiving sub optimal ACV therapy led to the selection and amplification of resistant virus in vivo After four serial passages in the immunocompetent mice the infection became completely refractory to ACV treatment Acyclovir has been in part superceded by the oral prodrugs valaciclovir VCV and famciclovir FCV the latter being the oral version of PCV 20 24 No comparative studies of the emergence of resistance following sub optimal VCV or FCV have been reported and therefore set out to to select for HSV 1 and HSV 2 isolates resistant to ACV and PCV after using prodrug selection Materials and Methods Cell lines and virus strains MRC 5 pass 18 25 and Vero were grown in Dulbecco s modified Eagle s medium DMEM supplemented with 10 fetal calf serum FCS and incubated at 37 C 5 CO 2 Vero cells were utilized for virus plaque purification and protein lysate preparations and MRC 5 cells were used for PRA and PEA TK negative TK human osteosarcoma 143 cells were propagated in the medium described above and utilized for the 3H thymidine kinase enzymatic assay Virus stocks were prepared by inoculating cells at 0 01 plaque forming units per MRC 5 cell PFU cell Laboratory virus strains utilized were HSV 1 SC16 and HSV 2 SB5 SC16 was kindly provided by Dr Sharon Safrin Gilead Sciences CA SB5 ATCC VR 2546 was plaque purified from HSV 2 333 kindly provided by Dr Priscilla Schaffer University of Pennsylvania PA at passage 6 Antiviral agents PCV and FCV were synthesized at GlaxoSmithKline VCV was extracted from Valtrex tablets and purity was confirmed by HPLC Animal inoculation and treatment Female BALB c mice 18 20 g Charles River Raleigh NC were infected intradermally in both ear pinnae with 20 l of virus suspension containing 10 5PFU of HSV as previously described 1 The same viral challenge was used for each subsequent in vivo passage VCV or FCV were administered via drinking water at either 1 mg ml a dose previously shown to be a highly effective 23 and D Sutton unpublished observations or 0 2 mg ml suboptimal treatment from the time of infection until day 4 post infection No significant difference in daily consumption between either of the treated groups or the placebo group drug free water was observed Daily drug intake equated to 75 mg kg or 15 mg kg for the 1 mg ml and 0 2 mg ml doses respectively To facilitate processing of blinded samples a coding system using sample number passage number was applied Virus sample numbers 1 through 15 were HSV 1 and 16 through 30 were HSV 2 The ears from one mouse were pooled passage number 1 inoculation and used to inoculate the ear pinnae of one mouse passage number 2 There were five replicate mice per treatment group either suboptimally treated with 0 2 mg ml FCV VCV or placebo treated and isolates from seven serial in vivo passages examined Five individual plaques were purified three times to homogeneity from the single drug resistant virus mixture identified after in vivo passage 14 P4 sample 14 passage 4 The clonal purified isolates from this sample were designated 14 P4A E The in vivo pathogenicity of selected virus preparations was assessed in mice by monitoring lesion severity for 14 days following inoculation of the left ear pinna with 5 10 5PFU Cumulative lesion scores day 0 14 were then calculated from the individual daily scores Virus isolation and in vitro assays Virus stocks were prepared as described previously 17 titrated and characterized by PRA and PEA On day 4 post infection mice were euthanized and both ear pinnae removed and pooled in coded tubes one tube per mouse The code was not broken until all tissue culture assays had been completed The tissue was homogenized and virus stocks were prepared in MRC 5 cells from cell free supernatants Following virus adsorption onto the MRC 5 monolayer two washes with phosphate buffered saline were performed to remove any residual antiviral drug Cell free virus was harvested titrated and characterized by PRA and PEA prior to use in subsequent passage experiments Figure 1 All PRA PEA and in vivo studies were carried out using virus that had undergone a single in vitro passage PRAs were performed in MRC 5 cells as described previously 17 The plating efficiency of the virus preparations generated in vivo was determined according to the method developed by Hall et al with minor modifications 13 as reported previously 17 Briefly six serial 10 fold dilutions of virus were inoculated onto MRC 5 cells in the absence of antiviral drug or in the presence of either ACV or PCV at a concentration of antiviral 10 times higher than the average IC 50 for wild type parental HSV 1 and HSV 2 respectively The mutation frequency was calculated as follows mutation frequency virus titer in the presence of drug virus titer in the absence of drug The frequency is often expressed as a plating efficiency or percentage of viruses that are resistant which is calculated as percent resistant mutation frequency 100 Antibodies and biochemical assays Western blot analysis was performed as described previously 18 Viral TK activity was determined by a modification of the method utilized by Coen and Schaffer 4 as described in 17 Primers utilized for TK sequencing were described previously 18 Results Virus yield after antiviral treatment To evaluate efficacy of prodrug treatment in this model VCV and FCV were provided in the drinking water at 1 0 mg ml or at 0 2 mg ml sub optimal treatment for mice infected with either HSV 1 SC16 or HSV 2 SB5 Titers day 4 post infection of approximately 4 5 log 10 virus per ear were recovered from placebo treated mice regardless of virus type Table 1 As expected a significant reduction in virus yield greater than 3 5 log 10 decrease was noted for mice treated with either VCV or FCV at 1 0 mg ml following infection with either HSV 1 or HSV 2 In the same experiment virus yield from suboptimally treated mice was reduced approximately 1 6 2 6 log 10 compared to placebo treated mice and these data are consistent with a previous report in which ACV was administered at a concentration of 0 25 mg ml 10 At 0 2 mg ml viral replication albeit reduced was still ongoing a prerequisite for the in vivo selection of resistant HSV A reproducible difference in virus yield between the two antiviral treatment groups at the suboptimal concentration was evident regardless of virus type For HSV 1 the difference in titer between VCV treated mice 2 45 log 10 PFU ml and FCV treated 2 92 log 10 PFU ml was statistically significant p 0 049 Similarly for HSV 2 VCV at 0 2 mg ml was significantly more effective than FCV in this mouse model Titers from VCV or FCV treated mice were 2 06 log 10 PFU ml or 2 55 log 10 PFU ml respectively p 0 001 Similar trends were noted when the antivirals were compared at 1 0 mg ml for both HSV 1 and HSV 2 Table 1 These observations can not be accounted for by differences in exposure to ACV and PCV since oral administration of VCV and FCV results in almost identical blood concentration time curves for ACV and PCV 11 A more probable explanation is that ACV is approximately four fold more potent than PCV in murine cells 21 To select and amplify drug resistant HSV in mice a total of seven consecutive passages were performed and progeny virus from each passage was characterized in vitro by PRA and PEA PRA susceptibility Drug selected HSV 1 SC16 Mean PCV susceptiblities of the HSV 1 isolates n 105 from passages 1 through 7 are listed in Table 2 All isolates from mice treated with either placebo or FCV remained sensitive to PCV IC 50 s ranging from 0 28 1 50 g ml and to ACV results not shown according to the standard resistance breakpoint criteria whereas isolates from mice treated with VCV had PCV IC 50 s ranging from 0 31 8 3 g ml One isolate 4th passage 14 P4 in this treatment group was confirmed as resistant to both PCV IC 50 8 3 g ml and ACV IC 50 9 5 g ml Generally test sample IC 50 s varied within two fold of the non passaged control virus IC 50 within each particular assay data not shown however isolate 14 P4 was clearly different with an IC 50 greater than 11 fold over the control virus IC 50 for both PCV and ACV Interestingly although 14 P4 was resistant the third pass isolate for this sample was completely sensitive to both antiviral agents ACV IC 50 0 16 g ml PCV IC 50 0 53 g ml Therefore the PRA provided no early indication at pass 3 of potentially increasing resistant variants upon subsequent passage Furthermore the resulting virus preparation from subsequent passaging of 14 P4 reverted to a sensitive phenotype ACV IC 50 0 74 g ml PCV IC 50 0 74 g ml although suboptimal treatment was still utilized Drug selected HSV 2 SB5 Mean PCV susceptiblities of the HSV 2 isolates n 105 from passages 1 through 7 are listed in Table 3 No resistant HSV 2 emerged among the total of 105 HSV 2 isolates tested from the three treatment groups PCV IC 50 s ranged from 0 66 1 85 g ml across treatment groups These results were confirmed when the same isolates were tested for susceptibility to ACV results not shown and all the IC 50 s were sensitive over a similar range as PCV As with HSV 1 the HSV 2 test samples were generally within two fold of the control virus IC 50 data not shown PEA profiling Drug selected HSV 1 SC16 The HSV 1 control virus preparation contained between 0 002 0 02 ACV rvirus and 0 004 0 009 PCV r which equates to an average of 6 6 ACV rand 6 0 PCV rresistant viruses per 10 5PFU Generally the proportion of PCV rvirus varied only two fold between tests when compared to the control virus ranging from 0 004 to 0 009 data not shown however three serial samples in the VCV treatment group 14 P2 14 P3 and 14 P4 clearly showed a substantial increase in the proportion of resistant virus relative to the wild type control specifically an 11 300 and 8800 fold increase respectively 14 P2 0 002 14 P3 2 and 14 P4 44 PCV r Although passage 3 preparation contains a two log increase in resistant virus compared to passage 2 this level is insufficient to significantly increase the IC 50 Consistent with the failure to establish an infection refractory to treatment the proportion of resistant virus decreased to 0 08 PCV rand 0 05 ACV rby passage 5 Drug selected HSV 2 SB5 The HSV 2 control virus preparation contained between 0 24 0 40 ACV rand 0 13 0 40 PCV rvirus which equates to an average of 3 1 ACV rand PCV rviruses per 10 3PFU Generally the proportion of resistant virus varied only three fold between tests when compared to the control virus data not shown however a continual increase in the proportion of resistant virus was seen with the sample 30 passages VCV treatment group The proportion of PCV rvirus in sample 30 increased from 0 40 to 2 8 to 12 2 throughout serial passages 1 through 3 and declined to 0 2 by passage 4 All of these isolates were susceptible to PCV by the PRA IC 50 s for sample 30 passage 2 through 4 were 0 79 0 90 and 1 2 g ml respectively Analysis of drug resistant isolate Of 210 HSV isolates from mice treated sub optimally with FCV or VCV or with placebo only one HSV 1 isolate 14 P4 was identified in the PRA as an antiviral resistant isolate Five single plaques from 14 P4 were isolated after three rounds of plaque purification and characterized The clonal isolates were tested for susceptibility to using the PRA and were found to be highly resistant to ACV ACV IC 50 s 25 g ml and PCV Table 4 PCV IC 50 s 25 g ml although susceptible to foscarnet Western blot analysis showed that each clonal isolate produced a truncated TK polypeptide compared to the wild type TK protein product of approximately 43 kD Figure 2 Moreover all five clones were defective for TK activity compared with HSV 1 SC16 in a 3H thymidine kinase assay Table 4 Sequence analysis of the TK coding region from all five plaque isolates identified a G nucleotide insertion in the homopolymeric hot spot G7 tract at nucleotide 435 a common mutation present in other ACV rHSV isolates 18 19 This base insertion produced a frame shift in the coding sequence resulting in a loss of the ATP nucleoside binding site and the creation of a premature stop codon at amino acid 228 to encode a truncated 28 kD TK polypeptide Lastly the in vivo pathogenicities of 14 P4 and one of its clonal isolates 14 P4E were compared with the control virus HSV 1 SC16 Isolate 14 P4 containing 45 resistant virus caused significant clinical disease in mice only marginally less severe than that observed with HSV 1 SC16 In marked contrast mice inoculated with the plaque purified isolate 14 P4E developed a mild infection The cumulative disease scores for parental virus control HSV 1 SC16 14 P4 and 14 P4E were 136 96 and 15 respectively Discussion HSV 1 or HSV 2 isolates were passaged serially seven times in mice inoculated in the ear pinnae and treated with suboptimal 15 mg kg per day concentrations of FCV or VCV to select resistant virus Despite ongoing albeit reduced viral replication in the animals selection of resistant HSV with the prodrugs proved difficult Interestingly the single drug resistant isolate identified from this study reverted to a sensitive phenotype upon reinfection even with suboptimal antiviral treatment Although virus recovered at passage 4 from one of five mice treated with VCV 14 P4 was clearly resistant in the PRA IC 50 s 8 3 and 9 5 for PCV and ACV respectively the preceding and the subsequent isolates were sensitive according to the criteria for defining resistance The PEA identified a gradual increase in the proportion of resistant virus from 14 P2 0 002 to 14 P3 2 to 14 P4 44 However for the most part the PEA data did not correlate with the eventual appearance of drug resistant virus as defined by the PRA Consistent with this an earlier studied showed that the proportion of drug resistant virus in a preparation needs to be approximately 50 before resulting in a signficant change in IC 50 9 Biochemical characterization of the 14 P4 isolate confirmed that impaired TK activity was most likely responsible for the resistance phenotype Sequence analysis of one of these clonal isolates 14 P4E revealed insertion of an extra G within the G 7 homopolymeric region of the TK coding region This mutation has also been detected in clinical isolates from patients immunocompromised 12 or with AIDS 19 as well as resistant HSV selected in tissue culture 15 18 Interestingly this mutation was present in ACV rclinical isolates obtained during reactivation in the absence of drug pressure as well as in ACV rstrains which evolved during ACV therapy and were followed by ACV susceptible isolates at the next reactivation 19 It was surprising to find that the ACV resistant virus selected in vivo was not retained or amplified in subsequent passages despite continued suboptimal treatment with VCV This result appears to be in direct contrast to that of Field 9 who found that following selection of ACV resistant virus in vivo such viruses remained refractory to treatment upon subsequent passage using suboptimal treatment with ACV The reason for this difference is unclear However the failure to maintain the resistant virus on subsequent passage suggests that the pathogenicity of 14 P4 may have been only partially attenuated relative to the sensitive virus and indeed the pathogenicity of the clonal virus isolate 14 P4E was severely attenuated Further studies on the 14 P4 clonal isolates and the clinical significance of their attentuation should be explored Conclusions Sub optimal therapy of immunocompetent mice with either VCV or FCV did not readily select for HSV mutants resistant to either ACV or PCV suggesting that selection of resistance with either prodrug remains difficult using this system All the virus isolates from each serial passage were examined by both PRA and PEA The former is widely accepted as the gold standard for susceptibility testing of HSV and for ACV a correlation between PRA in vitro IC 50 and clinical outcome has been established In spite of this the PEA appears to have potential as an adjunct to the PRA by providing earlier detection of the emergence of resistant HSV However it is important to note that although an increase in the number resistant variants within isolates was readily detected by the PEA clinically resistant virus did not develop in the immunocompetent mice Therefore the presence of resistant virus within an isolate even at levels substantially above background does not in itself indicate that increased resistance will follow nor does it necessarily predict clinical resistance It would be of interest to apply the PEA to an extensive series of clinical isolates particularly isolates obtained from severely immunocompromised patients in order to evaluate the proportions of resistant virus that occur within different clinical isolates Competing Interests None declared
