 FRANCE AND THE FRENCH For many years France was a nation of internal contrasts between the more urban and industrial north and the rural south between the intellectual elite and the largely agricultural workforce between chic Paris and the less sophisticated provincial cities and a nation that saw itself as standing alone distinct from all others Much has changed in recent times Paris is no longer the ultimate mecca for ambitious young French from the prov inces cities around the country are attracting young professionals who want to escape the more frenetic life in the Ile de France the number of agricultural workers has shrunk dramatically industrial and high tech centers have sprung up around the country provincial cities are developing their own international reputations and immigration and increasing migration of populations within a border free Euro pean Union are blurring the edges of the French identity France remains however a splendid and individualist country that has much to offer to the foreign visitor The French people despite occasional rumors to the contrary welcome tourists and are eager to show off their country their way of life their traditions and their beliefs in short their essential joie de vivre They are proud of their nation and have a right to be Quality of life remains their paramount preoccupation It is no accident that the French are best known for their food and wine their clothes and perfumes their dashing art and monumental architecture Their love of perfection serves them well Give French cooks a couple of eggs and they won t just boil them fry them or make an omelette all of which they re quite prepared to do superlatively they feel obliged to produce a delicate souffl or a rich hollandaise sauce that makes an egg proud to be an egg Even a lowly croque monsieur is a world away from a ham and cheese sandwich You will still find the elegant spare plates of nouvelle cuisine but there is a new focus on heartier dishes and an acceptance of cuisines of other countries The French attention to detail is found in all walks of life from the way a scarf is tied to the planning of the summer flow er displays found in small villages national prizes for the prettiest village are hotly contested France is blessed with an astonishing variety of landscapes long high dunes on the Atlantic Coast craggy coves in Brittany vineyards in Burgundy steep gorges in the Tarn olive trees and vineyards umbrella pines and cypresses in Provence and lazy beaches in the C te d Azur All these are as typical of France as the more conventional images of rolling green meadows bounded by straggling hedgerows and arrow straight avenues lined with plane trees a village visible on the horizon clustered around its church The country is a veritable compendium of geography The plains and plateaus of Picardy in the north and Alsace to the east lend themselves to large scale agriculture before ending in the gentler rolling green fields of Normandy to the west and the vineyards of Burgundy that herald the beginnings of the south The Alps of Savoie and the Dauphin peter out in the rugged little Alpilles of Provence The formidable barrier of the Pyr n es forms the frontier with Spain With these mountain ranges protecting the eastern and southern frontiers the mild Atlantic winds penetrate deep inland bringing with them all the rain and sun needed for a highly productive agriculture while avoiding the extremes of a continental climate Inland from the Atlantic coast Aquitaine Dordogne P rigord the southwest is rich in farming and vineyards It s the land of good duck and goose of fine Bordeaux wines Pointing out into the Atlantic on the country s western edge Brittany s spectacular shoreline has earned the region a reputation for rough weather In fact it enjoys the mildest of climates even in winter and provides many a pleasant seaside resort in summer The kings and counts and feudal lords have gone from the Loire Valley and the forests and marshes of Sologne but the hunting and fishing country remains At the country s heart slightly north of the geographical center Paris nestles in a basin ideal for industrial and commercial enterprise comfortably surrounded by the forest and farmland of the Ile de France And the Champagne area lies conveniently to the east to help celebrate its successes If the land itself is the most obvious source of French pride the nation s cultural wealth is just as important Philosophy and the fine arts do not intimidate the French as something to be confined to a small lite For most people intellectual is not the dirty word it seems to be in so many other countries Museums are as popular as sports stadiums and crowds flock to theater and music festivals in spring summer and autumn all over the country Even popular arts such as advertising the cinema comic strips and fashion are elevated to the level of high culture with their own museums and festivals An active government cultural policy in recent years has preserved the architectural monuments of the national patrimony from the ravages of time weather war revolution and urban development Through out the 1990s partly in preparation for the 2000 Millennium celebrations fa ades were scrubbed and buildings generally refurbished Innovative use has been made of outdoor facilities for summer festivals especially Roman ruins and medieval monasteries In addition to recorded commentaries you will find bright young art historians who are enthusiastic about the places where they work and their areas of knowledge Their descriptions are fresh and informative and they re glad to answer questions that go beyond the brochure or guidebook Many important monuments are beautifully lit at night making city centers an evening treat While Paris is still a major destination for sightseers travelers should not ignore the charms of such provincial cities and towns as Lyon Montpellier Rouen and Strasbourg All feature a blend of ancient and modern of dignity and fun and strive to make the visitor feel welcome and treasured The country offers plenty of outdoor enjoyment too swimming and other water sports or just sunbathing on Alpine lakes on the beaches of Normandy and Brittany or at the famous resorts of the C te d Azur first class skiing in the Alps and Pyr n es canoeing down spectacular gorges and marvelous hiking around the country s national parks and nature reserves Evidence that France is far from being a country of hidebound highbrows is the fact that the Marne Valley east of Paris was selected for Europe s first Disneyland France is internationally acknowledged to be a leader in high technology and is happy to share its pride in these advances With its flagship G ode entertainment center the Cit des Sciences et de l Industrie in La Villette on the outskirts of Paris attracts science buffs young and old La Cit de l Espace in Toulouse is dominated by a replica of the Ariane rocket Even if you don t get on one of the high speed TGV trains you are almost certain to see one zoom past The people are as varied as their landscape but don t let anyone tell you the French national clich is a myth The red nosed mustachioed fellow with a beret on his head a crumpled cigarette drooping from his lip and a long baguette or two under his arm certainly does exist and can be seen in all regions of the country But there s all the difference in the world between the prudent close mouthed Norman and the vociferous easy going Proven al between the pious Breton and the pagan sophisticate of Paris For a people so fiercely proud of their identity the French are a rich mixture In Picardy the Flemish influence is unmistakable and although Alsace may celebrate Bastille Day at least as proudly as any other French province its cuisine wines and dialect all reveal a profoundly Germanic influence The C te d Azur and Corsica both have a distinctly Italian flavor and the people on the northern slopes of the Pyr n es are not so very different from their Spanish cousins to the south France has always been a haven for foreign artists Not by accident did Van Gogh come from the Netherlands Picasso from Spain Max Ernst from Germany and Chagall from Russia to make their home in France One of France s greatest poets of the 20th century Wilhelm Kostrowitsky better known as Guillaume Apollinaire was born in Rome of a Polish mother and an Italian father Irishman Samuel Beckett happily wrote plays in French And Kenzo Lagerfeld and Cerruti design in the international but inexorably Paris based language of haute couture Despite occasional tensions perhaps inevitable in times of economic uncertainty today French people increasingly recognize that the immigrants from France s d partements in the West Indies and from former colonies Algeria Tunisia and Morocco enrich the national culture and add spice to the country s cuisine And as the European Union matures Europeans are taking advantage of opportunities to live and work in different countries British families are buying second or first homes in France French young people are choosing to settle in London or Dublin for a time It all makes for a wonderful and exciting mix adding to that greatest of French assets a vibrant and varied street scene For the first time visitor France will seem at once delightfully different and comfortably familiar a country of exciting and infinitely attractive contrasts
