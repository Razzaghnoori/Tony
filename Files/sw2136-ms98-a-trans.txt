 did they say anything no i guess we got ten minutes or something like that i don t know oh okay so what do you think um i think they should do it yeah i i do because um with all all the sports you know and everything they re doing there and also because whenever you re dealing with drugs like if you if you are on drugs then that affects the way you work and everything um hum i agree but i think they re slow in testing you know i don t know yeah about yours but mines they so slow they tested some people twice three times and some people haven t been tested at all oh really um hum well see um and i worked for a steel mill the past two summers uh huh and i had to go through you know a physical and everything and before they even told you you were hired like they just called me in for an interview and i went in for my interview and then right there he said okay go down to the company hospital and you ll go through a physical so you know i mean it was really good that way because they they tested everyone right away um hum and you didn t you didn t have any notice you know so like if you were doing drugs then like you didn t have a way you know to stop i mean it was still in your body yeah yeah i like that i know when i i was in that like in the service and we didn t have we used to have to go every other month or whenever uh huh to uh just do do we called it the golden flow but and they did random drug testing just because you know Uncle Sam but i ve always thought that they were slow as far as outside of the government you know uh huh because i ve always i m i m use to it oh really it s no big deal yeah well see you know i well i guess if you re not doing anything it s no big deal people call it invasion of privacy not to me it s not because first of all if you re not doing anything they re not invading anything right you know and if you re taking medication from a doctor that s no big deal either yeah because like what because then they ll or you have a prescription yeah you know what too whenever they did that for me like you know we had to take they did it blood and urine and um they they gave you a paper right there and they said if you were out drinking or if you went out for a good time last night go ahead and write down that you did have beer or you did have alcohol or if you are on medicine go ahead and write down what medicine you are on uh huh okay but i you know so they allotted for you know things like that like you know people didn t know they were being tested well you might have had a drink last night you know and that would show up too yeah yeah well see they don t do a blood test to us they just do a urine test which i think they should do a a blood test because then that tells them that you know they testing for drugs but i think it s like i tell and then you know they have all this smoking stuff why don t they just test for alcohol because that s between drugs and alcohol that s it um hum that s the biggest killer there is i think they should do both of them um hum you know because then that that way they ll they ll get rid of they can help the alkies and then they can help the people that s on drugs yeah and then uh it got you know it got backfired on a lot of kids too because a lot of kids you know um like you know like somehow they missed the physical or something yeah you know and they wrote down that they uh weren t but then they went back and they checked them like maybe a week after they were working and if they had drugs in their body i mean they were fired on the spot there was no ifs ands or buts about it oh oh yeah uh huh um hum i that s all right yeah yeah i think this way too because in that steel mill i mean someone and see some people always talk about the kind of job you do um hum but it would that wouldn t be fair if they tested just people with strenuous jobs yeah because you know you you got your your your pilots and your your air traffic controllers your nurses your doctors uh huh yeah yes i would want all those people checked but then you got your bus drivers your truck drivers are checked because my husband drives a truck they he has to pass a physical uh huh you know but i think why don t they and and to me it s wrong to check just the people that you think are affecting the public yeah you know uh huh why not just check everybody so yeah yeah see they checked everyone in the mill too and then that was hard because you know someone would come in and they had a problem well then if i like some of the jobs i was doing was very dangerous you know we were working with that steel that s thousands of degrees hot and i would have to cover for him you know like i would have to do two jobs for someone just because they they think they re being smart or something um hum you know and i mean they even had um the the higher up management people would even come in periodically and have unexpected checks you know yep so it was really good you know they were checking you know visually and uh with the blood and the urine tests well that s all right yeah i thought it was really good because they check our bosses and everything and i think that s the way it should be if they going to check you know that way you can t stay well they didn t check my boss you know yeah they checked him too so everybody s getting checked it s not like it s just little peons it s everybody uh huh yeah yes right and that that s the way i think they should do it that way it is random you know it s random because some people is already gone two three times and some people ain t went at all uh huh and they just when your number comes up your number comes up yeah right and then uh they checked us like once during the middle of the summer also um hum you know like it s not like they just like well then the second time when i got hired i knew what was coming you know so then they checked us again in the middle of the summer yeah so i thought that was really good too i don t i well i think if you re doing something really bad it s going to show up uh huh yeah you know yeah i don t think you can hide certain drugs no i think it what is it like i know even even like steroids well how long does it take for marijuana to get out of your body that s thirty days see so there still they said it was thirty days but on one of my our our thing is they said that you d have to the way the test is you d have to really be smoking for it to show up and i don t think that s right oh really i thought it would show up with no matter what amount we that s what he told that s what they tell you but i think it is i think it d show up no matter what if you doing it then it s going to show up yeah and and steroids i mean that kind of drug that s a lot longer yeah that takes a lot longer to get out of your body i think they should check everybody everywhere that s working because see they got this and that s just like even all the football players yeah i think they ought to check them because you get kids looking up to them and here they are strung out on drugs what good is that you know that s not good that s right yeah and even and even uh i don t know sometimes i think they should even check the the music you know the entertainment oh yeah because the the with with uh the movie stars and and the singers and everything yeah because they get strung out too yeah they re no different um hum but i guess you know that s they contract they don t and they re out winning awards you know and then and then the younger kids think they re great and everything but yet and then they re strung out on drugs secretly exactly you know they go off because they have a drug problem uh huh huh uh that s not right yeah you know what i think s i bunch of bull too is whenever um they um really you know like nationwide or you know popular people they do have a problem and they come out and they say they re having the problem so then they get more publicity because they admitted they have a problem and they re trying to fix it yeah well what about the Joe Shmoe who s an alcoholic and he s trying to fix it you know but he s not getting any he they re not testing him because they only testing for drugs yeah right and i think they should test for alcohol uh huh because we have some alkies too boy you can smell it on they breath you know it s bad when you can smell alcohol on somebody but there s nothing you can do because they not drunk but you know they drink constantly to get that breath smell uh huh yeah you know but i said no they they getting on the smokers and stuff but i think i because like i told one guy i says smokers don t kill people in a wreck from being smoking that s right you know drunk people kill people from being drunk that s true i never thought of it that way but that s true so why are you know why don t they just to me they ought to just do the blood test for alcohol um hum and i said they ll have more people then yeah oh definitely i mean you know i can understand like on a Monday yeah but then you can look at it there too well alcohol s legal yeah but so is cigarettes yeah you know so why charge me more uh huh so you know drugs is not is is is not legal some of them are yeah um hum and some people are addicted to prescription drugs exactly yeah and so what s the difference um hum you know they still got a drug habit but they re legal that s true they got a drug problem but it s legal you know it s like huh uh huh uh no they need they need some help too uh huh um hum um hum because they check those and i know one girl she was on some kind of medication but see they didn t bother her because she had a prescription yeah but i mean what if she was hooked on them you know that s true how they going to know just because she has a prescription how are you going to tell if she s hooked on them you d have to take her off them you know some people i mean that s they they they go off them and they they re going to die um hum yeah so you need to to me if they going do a they need to keep checking like if somebody s got some drugs in they system um hum and it s all prescription it s fine but what kind of drug is it yeah you know and then how long are they supposed to take it uh huh if they people have prescriptions for Valium but they re not supposed to take Valium twenty four hours a days you know all the time that s for if they have a problem yeah and and then see that way you ll find out if they have a problem because if they keep taking it they have a problem yeah or they wouldn t keep taking them uh huh and then also after you know they can find out whenever their prescription ends and then find out you know how long it will take for that to be out of their system and then test them again and test them again and see if they have it again uh huh um hum because you know they don t give you a whole bunch of them pills yeah because they gave my husband some when his mother passed but that was for like to calm him down right you know but see now they re gone uh huh i think they gave him like four pills no and then that was it yeah yeah uh huh but see now they they would be out of his system but if he was to be tested
