            what would you do about this pressing problem   well i can relate to uh when i decided to choose a college uh it really had very little to do with academics       uh i i stayed at a i went to a local uh university that was close to home its about sixty miles away went to the University of Wisconsin   oh   and uh besides it being uh close and being a uh major university in the big ten a prestigious conference i joined the marching band       and uh that really was uh a good deal of the motivation for going to that uh college   so with the band   yeah something to do extracurricular activity   what do you play   i play the trumpet   my uh my husband played music he was involved in music all of his life and went to Notre Dame where he decided he was going to have a good time       and never  and then  never went into the scholastic bands he went into uh   okay   bands on campus and he played music but i i just cant believe that  he didnt can play in a Notre Dame band  when he was good enough to do it   uhhuh   he went the other route i think uh i think the advise id give to parents would be to start when theyre like four years old today   at least start saving   yeah at least start saving and and start routing them to where at least theyll have a chance to get ahead   well i think most people when they are in high school are very undecided about what course of study they want to take and they really dont have the foggiest idea of what kind of career they want to get into at least until at least until theyve been in college for a couple of years   yeah thats its um i wish i had known more when i was uh choosing a college i i kind of did or id i went off to i grew up in California and i went off to the University of Utah and didnt find the atmosphere there what i quite expected so i came back and went to Cal State and so i kind of do what you did only by route of another school and   uhhuh   i wish i had known more about what a school meant   yeah well i i started uh studying mathematics basically because i was really good at that in high school       and uh by the time i was a sophomore i decided that mathematics was really not the thing to be into to find a good job they werent hiring mathematicians at the time   oh   so i started taking computer science courses and uh that become my major course of study uh i finished a major in mathematics also i had a double major but uh computer science is what got me a job   right   and it was very uh very much in demand for a career   well it still is   uh still is thats true its uh very good choice   i was just looking at a job sheet thats about all thats in there   umhum       so but i know many people who have changed majors several times in uh college uh in fact very few people finish in four years now   do you think it do you think its well worth going to uh uh bigger school or more wellknown school   uh i really dont think it makes that much difference what size of the school college or university one chooses as long as they have a decent program and theyre uh uh well known throughout the country   right right the reputation that they have a good reputation   uhhuh   um some of these i didnt the college i went to was a big school but i was an English major and it the English major is very small so i had the benefit of being able to talk to my professors and hangout with them you know and i really appreciated that   yeah well that does make a difference uh Wisconsin had a very good reputation in uh computer science and engineering departments and im sure that helped uh helped me get job offers uh if you choose a school thats not well known or it does not have a very good curriculum in uh in the in those areas uh it could be difficult to uh make a career out of it   right i think thats what i would tell parents     kind of like uh going to SMU they have a reputation as being a party school and uh i just   i have to question how worthwhile it is to go to a school that uh really isnt uh that well known for their academics   hey im headed there   i took a couple of semesters of graduate school there myself     well they have the master of liberal arts there and so i thought i would go and do that   right okay   its the closest thing to a humanities degree that they let you do at night   uhhuh   its not the i im not into the Bohemian thing you know were i waitress during at night and go to school during the day   yeah  i was just making making a point that some schools develop certain reputations and     no i i agree  but but its like oh you offer this degree okay ill go   uhhuh     ive always wanted a masters degree but to get one in in English or anything other than an MBA its really difficult to do at night   yeah that thats true uh i i took uh like i said i took uh couple of semesters at SMU and it at SMU in uh engineering courses but uh it really did conflict too much with uh with my work its very difficult uh to maintain a fulltime job and try to take uh courses uh in off hours   yeah right its true   so i quit doing that several years ago   and and just lived the easy life   well yeah somewhat  i wouldnt mind going back to school again if i thought it i wasnt going to get in trouble again with the with the work it just takes too much time     thats true   going back fulltime i think is is the way to go   oh it it would be wonderful   yeah if one can afford to do that thats back to the reason why why i joined the band that was my entertainment while i was in school   i know the little dreams right   going to all the football games and hockey and basketball games uh because when youre a poor starving student you dont have the uh cash flow to uh entertain yourself  you have to find whatever means you can   right thats true yeah   those events were always free   i i uh i picked up sweats for the track team i was the track track team manager we got i got to ride the bus all over the state  i got to see everything     that sounds exciting   so it was fun it was little i did that for a long time it was a lot of fun so i understand that   uhhuh id recommend that if if someone was trying to choose a college that they they get uh as much information on the schools as they can as far as what curriculums they offer and uh how reputable they are and what kind of reputation they have in the country and uh go from there the rest of its just personal preference whether you like the mascot or not or whether its close by   yeah   yeah thats true   i mean uh Wisconsin was only up uh sixty mile bus ride away from my parents house so it only took an hour to get back on uh oh a couple weekends a semester it was very convenient not to mention being a public university it was the tuition was uh much less expensive   yeah that was a good thing to look out for   i looked into going to Marquette also and had a chance to get a scholarship there but it would have only covered uh about a quarter of the cost of the first uh year which uh wasnt enough of a motivation to uh to go there to commit to to four years   well were still writing checks for the loans for Notre Dame   umhum yeah im sure that thats uh its not uh cheap either     but hes really happy he went there   well thats good i i got uh by with the minimal amount of financial aid and was able to pay it all off within two years of graduation   wow   so i was very pleased with that of course i lived like a pauper too during that time   right   i know a lot of people that did most couldnt afford to to go to a movie   yeah   it was uh really living on a budget forced you to learn a few things thats true   yeah but we had fun   tried to have fun being in the band was about the only entertainment i had     uh i really i miss college i had a good time   that was fun uh lived on Tombstone pizzas and CocaCola   yeah it was fun well ill just wrap this up   okay   now that weve done our conversation for tonight   well wonder if if this advice was uh worth following for uh choosing a school     hopefully i i guess i dont know what theyre doing with the conversations   theyre being recorded and uh oh put in uh i guess in Washington DC somewhere for reference for speech projects   arent arent they like put taking the words and and listening to the dialect and yeah   yeah that is true based on where where you come from and all   thats funny   where youre educated in the first uh ten years i guess   that would be interesting well it was good talking to you   okay i appreciate it enjoyed it all right bye   okay thanks a lot byebye
