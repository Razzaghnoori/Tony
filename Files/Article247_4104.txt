 To the Great Unread Read i This i Evan Who died and made us the final arbiters of political virtue Great question one that I m asked frequently usually by people who write in crayon on the outside of the envelope The short answer is nobody Reporters get to travel around on expense account asking total strangers invasive questions and passing swift and nasty judgment on their responses because well just because they re reporters Pretty unfair isn t it Sure it is but I m not complaining For one thing I enjoy doing it For another somebody s got to ask the questions I won t give you the whole we re the guardians of the First Amendment speech here though I do recommend it for getting past the rope line at political events but I do think that without the purifying influence of the press the United States would devolve into a totalitarian police state within about 20 minutes Shut down MSNBC and internal passports will follow OK I admit I may be exaggerating a bit The sound you hear in the background is my emergency hyperbole alarm going off But if I tend to get overwrought on the subject it s only because there s so much noise coming from the other side I couldn t be sicker of hearing how Ordinary People Folks Outside the Beltway Average Working Americans insert your favorite euphemism for the Great Unread here have contempt for journalists My gut response seldom voiced is Good now we re even The problem is particularly acute in some conservative circles where belief in the liberal media conspiracy is part of the catechism Polls I keep reading about claim to indicate that most people consider journalists inaccurate and arrogant if not simply evil This bugs me and not just because it s me they re talking about I don t like the perception mainly because it isn t true Inaccurate Ever read a newspaper from another country England say How about Spain I have a copy of a relatively highbrow English language paper from South Africa that has a story about witchcraft played straight like witchcraft is real on the front page But the charge that irritates me most is arrogance It s almost always made by politicians and that s the really galling part It s true that the national press is a bit taken with itself On the other hand I don t know a single journalist who s as dictatorial and self involved as any one of the 50 governors Not even close actually How many reporters do you know who routinely refer to themselves in the third person Point made Wow I ve really worked myself into a frenzy here Just in time for the debate tonight Best Tucker
