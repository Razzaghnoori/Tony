 Background Normal spermatogenesis represents a precisely regulated balance between continuous cell proliferation and concomitant programmed cell death apoptosis 1 2 3 4 More than 50 of the germ cells die during their normal developmental process 5 6 Apoptosis in the testis of rodents is detected as early as the 14 thembryonic day 7 After birth an early apoptotic wave of germ cells during a critical pre pubertal period around 3 4 weeks 8 may be required for determining the subsequent normal pattern of spermatogenesis 3 Androgen binding protein ABP is produced by Sertoli cells of the testis secreted into the lumen of seminiferous tubules and transported with tubular fluid to the epididymis where it is internalized and degraded by the epithelial cells of the initial segment and the caput it binds testosterone T dihydrotestosterone and estradiol with high affinity 9 10 11 The functions of ABP have been the subject of many reviews e g 10 12 13 14 15 It is thought to regulate spermatogenesis and sperm maturation by maintaining high androgen levels in the testis and epididymis 16 17 and has been proposed as a biochemical marker for Sertoli cell function and formation of blood testis barrier 12 18 More recently cell surface receptors for ABP and its liver derived homolog sex hormone binding globulin SHBG were identified in several androgen target tissues suggesting that these extracellular steroid binding proteins may have a much broader hormone like function 19 20 21 In order to study ABP s functions in vivo Reventos et al 22 developed transgenic TG mice overexpressing rat ABP These TG mice showed progressive structural and functional abnormalities in their testes leading eventually to infertility 23 24 25 In our recent paper we described an altered pattern of germ cell proliferation throughout postnatal life in the ABP TG mice resulting in a progressive reduction in total germ cell numbers with increasing age 26 However it was not clear whether the reduction in germ cell numbers was the result of a reduced rate of proliferation an increased rate of apoptosis or a combination of the two The present study was performed to provide quantitative data on germ cell apoptosis in control and in ABP TG mice aged from 7 to 360 days Apoptotic cells were identified by the TdT mediated dUTP biotin nick end labeling TUNEL method and detected either by flow cytometry 27 or by light microscopy in histological sections 28 The results indicate that transgenic ABP alters the rate of testicular germ cell apoptosis throughout life but it is most likely to cause its germ cell depleting effect by promoting germ cell apoptosis during the critical pre pubertal period puberty in laboratory rodents occurs at 50 60 days of life and is defined as the first appearance of spermatozoa in the tail of the epididymis 29 30 Materials and Methods Animals Mice were housed in an animal facility under controlled conditions and given food and water ad libitum The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill approved the protocols used in this study Transgenic mice over expressing rat ABP in their testes were developed by Reventos et al 22 and were propagated as described previously 25 26 Control wild type WT and homozygous male mice of 7 10 14 21 30 60 90 120 180 240 and 360 days of age were used in the present study A minimum of 5 animals per group were analyzed Mice were sacrificed by overexposure to ether Chemicals TdT enzyme and TdT buffer were purchased from Promega Madison WI USA All other chemicals unless stated otherwise were purchased from Sigma Chemical Company St Louis MO USA Preparation of germ cell suspension The method described by O Brien 31 as modified by Jeyaraj et al 26 was used to isolate germ cells from the seminiferous tubules Briefly the decapsulated testes were incubated in PBS containing 0 5 mg ml collagenase type IV for 15 minutes at 32 C in a shaking water bath After washing twice with PBS containing 1 0 g ml DNase 1 0 g ml trypsin in PBS was added and incubated for 15 minutes at 32 C Equal amount of soybean trypsin inhibitor was added and the suspension was mixed by gentle pipetting with a plastic transfer pipette for 3 5 minutes and was filtered through 80 m nylon mesh 50 m for 7 30 days old The filtrate was washed twice with PBS fixed in 70 ice cold ethanol and stored at 4 C TUNEL labeling of germ cells for flow cytometry analysis The procedure followed in the present study for TUNEL labeling was described by Krishnamurthy et al 27 Approximately 1 2 million ml ethanol fixed testicular germ cells were washed twice in PBS treated with 300 l of 0 5 pepsin solution dissolved in 0 9 saline pH 2 0 for 5 minutes at 37 C After washing twice with 1 0 ml PBS the cells were resuspended in 50 l of TdT buffer containing 0 2 M potassium cacodylate 2 5 mM Tris HCL pH 6 6 2 5 mM CoCl 2 0 25 mg ml bovine serum albumin 5 0 units of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and 0 5 nM biotinylated deoxyuridine triphosphate b UTP and incubated at 37 C for 30 minutes After washing in PBS the cells were resuspended in 100 l of a reagent containing 4x concentrated saline sodium citrate buffer 2 5 g ml fluorosceinated avidin 0 1 Triton X 100 and 5 dry milk incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature in the dark and washed twice in 1 0 ml of PBS The cells were resuspended in 1 0 ml of PBS containing 5 g ml propidium iodide and 0 1 RNase Control cells were processed as described but without TdT The intensity of the green fluorescence of avidin FITC stained cells and the red fluorescence of PI stained cells was measured in the FACScan flow cytometer Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry San Jose CA USA A marker was set in the TUNEL dot plot at the cut off between background signals and positive staining as determined from the control samples Cells were considered TUNEL positive if their fluorescence intensity exceeded that set level The percentage of positive cells was quantified by using the Summit software Cytomation Inc Fort Collins CO USA In situ end labeling and peroxidase staining on testicular tissue sections In situ apoptosis detection kit Apoptag peroxidase kit was purchased from Intergen Company NY USA and their protocol was followed Testicular tissue was fixed in Bouin s fixative dehydrated in graded concentrations of ethanol and embedded in paraffin 8 m sections were de parafinized re hydrated and washed in PBS Twenty g ml proteinase K was placed on the section and kept at room temperature for 15 minutes After washing twice in distilled water the sections were covered with equilibration buffer for 10 15 seconds followed by the addition of TdT enzyme for 15 20 minutes The reaction was stopped by placing the sections in stop wash buffer The sections were washed thrice with PBS and anti digoxigenin peroxidase conjugate was added on the section and incubated in a humidified chamber for 30 minutes at room temperature After washing the sections 4 times in PBS diaminobenzidine tetra hydrochloride DAB was used to develop the color dark brown Control slides were processed in an identical manner except that TdT was omitted The sections were counterstained with toluidine blue dehydrated with ethanol and xylene coverslipped and images viewed and recorded using a Nikon Eclipse 600 microscope equipped with Spot digital camera Diagnostic Instruments Sterling Heights MI Induction of testicular germ cell apoptosis To confirm the reliability of the above methods apoptosis was induced by treatment with methoxy acetic acid MAA which is known to cause apoptosis in testicular germ cells 27 32 Two adult male control mice 90 days old were given a single intraperitoneal injection of 650 mg kg of MAA After 24 hours the mice were decapitated testes removed isolated germ cells processed for flow cytometric estimation and tissue sections for TUNEL as described above Statistical Analysis Changes were evaluated using unpaired t test and the software GraphPad Instat San Diego California USA P 0 05 or less was considered significant Quantitative results throughout this paper will be stated as the mean standard deviation Results Total number of germ cells undergoing apoptosis in control and ABP TG mice In control mice the total number of germ cells undergoing apoptosis was 0 47 0 07 million on day 7 Figure 4 Table 1 It gradually increased to 24 77 1 88 million on day 21 followed by a sharp increase on day 30 141 74 30 13 million and a plateau thereafter until Day 120 From Day 180 onwards a gradual increase was observed until Day 360 The general pattern of germ cells undergoing apoptosis in ABP TG mice was similar however the total number of germ cells undergoing apoptosis in ABP TG mice was consistently higher than in controls on Days 21 30 and 60 respectively the increase was statistically significant on Days 21 and 30 Starting from Day 90 the number of germ cells undergoing apoptosis in TG mice was consistently lower than in controls until Day 360 Figure 4 Table 1 Spermatogonia and secondary spermatocytes 2C The total number of spermatogonial cells undergoing apoptosis in control and ABP TG mice remained unchanged until Day 14 In ABP TG mice between Days 21 and 60 the number of spermatogonial cells undergoing apoptosis was significantly increased After 60 days even though a decrease was observed in the total number of spermatogonia undergoing apoptosis the decrease was statistically significant only on Days 90 and 240 Figure 5A Table 2 Spermatogonia synthesizing DNA S phase Between Days 21 and 60 the number of S phase cells undergoing apoptosis was significantly higher in ABP TG than in control mice Starting from 90 days a consistent reduction in the number of apoptotic S phase cells was seen in ABP TG mice the decrease was statistically significant on Days 90 240 and 360 Figure 5B Table 2 Primary spermatocytes 4C In the testes of ABP TG mice the total number of 4C cell population undergoing apoptosis was increased significantly as compared to controls on Days 21 and 30 The number of primary spermatocytes undergoing apoptosis in ABP TG mice relative to controls was decreased after 60 days the decrease was statistically significant on days 90 240 and 360 Figure 5C Table 2 Spermatids 1C Although a greater number of spermatids underwent apoptosis in ABP TG mice than in controls on Days 21 30 and 60 none of these changes were statistically significant After 60 days of age the number of spermatids undergoing apoptosis was significantly lower in ABP TG mice than controls in all age groups studied Figure 5D Table 2 Percentage of germ cells undergoing apoptosis On Days 21 30 and 60 the percentage of germ cells undergoing apoptosis was higher in ABP TG mice than controls see Table 1 TUNEL on testicular sections To further validate the results obtained in flow cytometric analysis TUNEL assay was done on testicular paraffin sections from mice of different age groups Figures 6 7 Microscopic observation of the sections revealed the presence of greater numbers TUNEL positive germ cells in the testicular sections of ABP TG mice at the ages of 21 Fig 6F and 30 Fig 6H days compared to their age matched controls than in any other age group Figures 7Eis the representative photomicrograph of a testicular section from an MAA treated 90 days old WT mouse processed for TUNEL Germ cells undergoing apoptosis are considerably more frequent in the testis of the MAA treated mouse Fig 7E than the untreated control Fig 7A The increase seen in the frequency of TUNEL positive germ cells in MAA treated mice corroborates the results obtained from flow cytometry analysis Figure 7Fis a negative control Discussion It is well established that TG mice overexpressing rat ABP 22 develop a testicular impairment 23 24 25 leading gradually to a reduced number of germ cells and infertility 26 Various theories were proposed to explain the possible mechanisms behind this testicular impairment seen in the ABP TG mice overexpressing rat ABP The first theory invokes the indirect involvement of ABP The increased concentration of ABP present in the testes of TG mice see Joseph et al 25 will chronically reduce the concentration of intra testicular free T available for interaction with androgen receptor AR and other molecular targets This is supported by the in vitro study of Roberts and Zirkin 34 demonstrating that ABP can actually inhibit T s action at the level of the AR Our earlier findings including a reduced number of elongated spermatids in the ABP TG mice 26 also support the notion that higher than physiological concentrations of ABP affect spermatogenesis indirectly through sequestration of androgens the transformation of round spermatids to elongated spermatids is known to be the main androgen dependent step in spermatogenesis 35 36 37 The second theory suggests the possible direct involvement of ABP in spermatogenesis Specific cell surface receptors for ABP have been detected in several cell types including germ cells 38 39 40 41 Gerard et al 41 reported that ABP was bound and internalized by germ cells and it also modified protein synthesis in germ cells in a manner dependent on the presence or absence of sex steroids The presence of increased numbers of ABP containing germ cells in the testes of ABP TG mice 26 and immunocytochemical observations of intense ABP immunoreactivity found in and around all types of germ cells in ABP TG mice 25 support a possible direct involvement of ABP in the testicular impairment seen in the ABP TG mice The late stages of spermatogenesis spermiogenesis were extensively studied for the possible direct effects of ABP 16 17 42 43 44 45 In these studies however ABP at least at physiological concentrations appeared to be supportive rather than detrimental to spermatogenesis Thus available evidence does not seem to indicate a direct inhibitory or damaging role of ABP in spermatogenesis Although optimal and highly regulated rates of spontaneous germ cell apoptosis are essential for normal spermatogenesis 1 2 46 47 48 there is evidence to link the increased or decreased apoptosis of germ cells with abnormal spermatogenesis and male infertility 3 49 50 In the ABP TG mice an overall reduction in the number of spermatids was reported 26 and suggested as one of the reasons for the reduced fertility seen in these animals Our finding of an increased rate of germ cell apoptosis in 21 and 30 days old ABP TG mice as compared to controls is consistent with the possibility that the reduced fertility reduced germ cell number seen in the ABP TG mice during adulthood may be due to increased apoptosis of germ cells during the first wave of spermatogenesis in the pubertal period In a recent paper Selva et al 51 described meiotic arrest and an increased occurrence of apoptosis of testicular germ cells primarily pachytene spermatocytes and cells in metaphase in 3 6 and 12 month old ABP TG mice and suggested that these events were the cause of the fertility impairment seen in these animals However in the study of Selva et al 51 apoptosis was not analyzed by flow cytometry but was detected by TUNEL reaction in histological sections only from a small number of homozygous animals 3 each of 3 and 6 month old and 1 of 12 month old and no statistical analysis of the results was provided The present study is the first to describe the detailed quantitative pattern of testicular germ cell apoptosis throughout life in normal as well as in ABP TG mice Flow cytometry detects TUNEL positive cells in four populations of germ cells in adult mice Figure 2 The greater numbers of TUNEL positive cells detected in the four populations of germ cells highest in 4C primary spermatocytes from MAA treated mice than controls confirm the reliability of the methods we used in this study Selective targeting of spermatocytes by MAA has been reported earlier 52 53 54 55 In 21 days old control mice 5 45 1 68 and in ABP TG mice 11 47 2 57 of all germ cells are apoptotic Analysis within each population reveals that in control mice 2 47 0 65 of 2C 0 32 0 23 of S phase 2 26 0 76 of 4C and 0 44 0 40 of 1C cells were apoptotic In ABP TG mice the percentage of 2C 4 45 0 70 and 4C 5 82 2 27 cells undergoing apoptosis was significantly higher than in controls Though the total number of germ cells undergoing apoptosis in control mice increased gradually from Day 7 to 360 the total number of germ cells also increased in general see Jeyaraj et al 26 the percentage of germ cells undergoing apoptosis was at its peak on Day 30 Table 1 These findings are consistent with the morphological analysis of Russel et al 8 reporting higher incidence of degenerative cells in the seminiferous tubules of 20 and 32 days old normal animals and lower levels found in adults In ABP TG mice the total number of germ cells undergoing apoptosis also increased from Day 7 and peaked on Days 21 and 30 After a decline by Day 60 the number of germ cells undergoing apoptosis leveled off in ABP TG mice From Day 90 onwards in terms of total number of germ cells undergoing apoptosis there is a clear and consistent reduction in ABP TG mice compared to controls However since the total number of germ cells in ABP TG mice of these age groups day 90 to day 360 is also reduced 26 the actual proportion or percentage of germ cells undergoing apoptosis remains similar in the two groups The presence of increased numbers of apoptotic germ cells in ABP TG mice compared to WT controls on Days 21 30 and 60 suggests that this age group is more vulnerable than adult animals to increased levels of intra testicular ABP This suggestion is supported by many of our observations 1 the percentage of germ cells undergoing apoptosis at these age groups days 21 30 and 60 was higher in ABP TG mice than in WT controls 2 The absolute numbers of germ cells undergoing apoptosis in 21 and 30 days old ABP TG mice were significantly higher than in WT controls albeit the total number of germ cells present in the testes of 21 and 30 days of ABP TG mice was similar to that in WT controls 26 3 On day 60 even though the total number of germ cells present in the ABP TG mice was significantly lower than in age matched WT controls 26 the number of germ cells undergoing apoptosis was nevertheless higher Thus at Days 21 30 and 60 the changes observed must be directly related to the increased levels of testicular ABP present in these TG animals Our data indicate that the presence of greater than physiological concentration of ABP in the mouse testis has a biphasic effect on the frequency of apoptosis in germ cells The initial increase seen in germ cell apoptosis especially at 21 and 30 days is likely to result from a direct or indirect action of ABP and may affect the subsequent life death balance of germ cell populations in TG mice The subsequent reduction is most likely due to maturation depletion reduced germ cell numbers Taken together the presence of increased levels of intra testicular ABP in the TG mice after 7 days of age 25 26 and a wave of germ cell apoptosis seen in normal mice at 21 and 30 days of age in this study and by Rodriguez et al 3 suggest that the heightened apoptotic wave found in our TG mice during the pre pubertal period may be regulated by ABP However at this point it is not clear whether ABP regulates this apoptotic wave by direct action on germ cells or indirectly by reducing the intra testicular concentrations of free bioavailable T The known biochemical properties and actions of ABP make the second mechanism more likely see Jeyaraj et al 26 This would also indicate that the pre pubertal wave of apoptosis is regulated at least in part by T Indeed it has been reported that experimental reduction in the levels of intra testicular T leads to the activation of caspase 3 56 and thereby to an increase in germ cell apoptosis 57 58 The roles of other apoptosis regulating proteins such as the Fas Fas ligand system 47 59 60 the Bcl 2 family of proteins 61 62 and several inhibitor of apoptosis proteins IAP are also likely to play a role in germ cell death and survival 63 64 65 Conclusions In conclusion our data suggest that the presence of high concentrations of ABP in the mouse seminiferous tubules results in a dramatically increased wave of germ cell apoptosis during the pre pubertal period Since the most likely mechanism of this effect of ABP is androgen sequestration androgens are likely to play an important role in regulating the wave of germ cell apoptosis in mice The altered rate of apoptosis at this time may in part be responsible for the subsequent progressive spermatogenetic defect seen in the ABP TG mice An analysis of androgen levels and ABP and androgen regulated gene expression within the seminiferous tubules may reveal the precise molecular mechanisms of these complex regulatory processes
