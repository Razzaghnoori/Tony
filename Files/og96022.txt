final rule revises Regulation X which implements the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 RESPA RESPA generally prohibits compensated referrals in connection with real estate settlements

DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT HUD ENTITLED AMENDMENTS TO REGULATION X THE REAL ESTATE SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES ACT WITHDRAWAL OF EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE AND COMPUTER LOAN ORIGINATION SYSTEMS EXEMPTIONS FR 3638 AND POLICY STATEMENTS 1996 1 REGARDING COMPUTER LOAN ORIGINATION SYSTEMS 1996 2 REGARDING SHAM CONTROLLED BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS AND 1996 3 RENTAL OF OFFICE SPACE LOCK OUTS AND RETALIATION RIN 2502 AG26 i Cost benefit analysis As discussed below the Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD submitted the proposed Amendments to Regulation X to the Office of Management and Budget OMB for review as a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 Since the rule was determined to be potentially economically significant 1 HUD prepared an Economic Analysis which was also reviewed by OMB According to HUD staff after the Economic Analysis was submitted to OMB HUD made changes in the Analysis to maintain its consistency with the rule to which minor changes had been made as described below These changes were also submitted to OMB for approval The Economic Analysis indicates that it is difficult to quantify the costs and benefits of the exemptions for certain employer employee payments The Analysis also states that HUD lacks essential information to estimate the economic consequences of its action with respect to computer loan origination systems CLOs However in both areas the Analysis includes a discussion of cost and benefit related issues and the possible effects of the changes to Regulation X With respect to HUD s Statement of Policy on CLOs the Analysis states that the guidance provided should enable CLOs to develop with much greater certainty about RESPA consequences and with few restrictions on reasonable pricing and compensation It also states that these actions should lead to faster development of 1In response to our inquiry OMB staff advised that the rule could be economically significant and major because it could adversely affect competition OMB also informed us that generally Regulation X matters had been designated major rules under Executive Order 12291 GAO OGC 96 22 CLOs which should ultimately lead to greater consumer and producer surplus The Analysis summarizes the two other Statements of Policy issued with the final rule In its submission HUD states that its Analysis reflects its assessment that 1 changes in the rule s treatment of employer employee payments are desirable to prevent any abuse of the relationship of trust between consumers and providers of settlement services and 2 the elimination of the exemption for payments by borrowers to CLOs enhance s the ability of firms to develop CLOs ii Actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 U S C 603 605 607 and 609 In the preambles to the proposed and final rules HUD states without elaboration2 that by approving the rule the Secretary certifies that it does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities other than those impacts specifically required to be applied universally by the RESPA statute 3 59 Fed Reg 37373 61 Fed Reg at 29251 Accordingly under 5 U S C 605 b HUD did not prepare initial or final regulatory flexibility analyses Sections 607 and 609 of title 5 were also inapplicable In the discussion of the Regulatory Flexibility Act the preamble to the final rule states that HUD s Economic Analysis considers the impact of the rule on small entities Id In connection with the employer employee payments exemption the Analysis indicates only that large firms are likely to find the practice of dedicating an individual to marketing affiliates products more attractive than small firms In connection with CLOs the Analysis identifies potential concerns of small real estate firms and lenders but also sets forth potential advantages of CLOs to those entities Section 605 b states that the certification and explanatory statement shall be provided to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration SBA In response to our inquiry HUD staff explained that its procedures do not include providing a separate copy of the certification to SBA and that it did not do so in this instance An SBA official has confirmed that some agencies follow this practice and that SBA has not objected to it 2Section 605 b provides that if the head of an agency makes a certification under that section the agency shall publish such certification in the Federal Register along with a succinct statement explaining the reasons for such certification 3HUD staff explained that the exemptions at issue here would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities to the extent that such an impact could be determined Page 2 GAO OGC 96 22 iii Agency actions relevant to sections 202 205 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 2 U S C 1532 1535 In its submission HUD explains that the final rule is not likely to result in annual expenditures of 100 million or more by State local or tribal governments in the aggregate or by the private sector Therefore sections 202 and 205 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1994 are inapplicable In addition the final rule does not affect small governments or contain a significant intergovernmental mandate Accordingly sections 203 and 204 of the act which require agencies to consult with small governments and solicit input from State local and tribal governments are also inapplicable iv Other relevant information or requirements under Acts and Executive orders Administrative Procedure Act 5 U S C 551 et seq HUD promulgated the Amendments to Regulation X under the notice and comment procedures of 5 U S C 553 In 1993 HUD determined that a review of certain policies embodied in the controversial 1992 rule would be useful prior to promulgation of a proposed rule 61 Fed Reg at 29239 Therefore on July 6 1993 HUD published a notice of written comment period and informal public hearing 58 Fed Reg 36176 On August 6 1993 HUD conducted a public hearing which produced testimony and documents from 36 interested parties in addition HUD received 1 526 comments on the matters at issue 61 Fed Reg at 29240 HUD published a proposed rule on July 21 1994 59 Fed Reg at 37360 In the preamble to the proposed rule HUD discussed the comments received in response to its July 6 1993 solicitation and invited further comments See 59 Fed Reg at 37360 37362 73 In addition following promulgation of the proposed rule HUD conducted an open house for operators of CLOs The open house was designed to allow operators to demonstrate their systems to HUD and to the public 61 Fed Reg at 29240 Further in August and September 1995 HUD convened two working group meetings of interested industry government and public officials to obtain their input and to further explore the status of CLOs Id According to the preamble to the final rule HUD received 354 comments on the proposed rule Id at 29241 Throughout the preamble to the final rule HUD discusses and responds to issues raised during the comment period as well as the information gathered during the open house and subsequent working group sessions See 61 Fed Reg at 29241 51 Page 3 GAO OGC 96 22 Paperwork Reduction Act 44 U S C 3501 3520 The final rule continues a requirement that in controlled business situations people making referrals of settlement services make certain disclosures to those being referred Under the Paperwork Reduction Act these disclosure requirements are to be submitted by HUD to OMB for approval HUD had believed that the controlled business disclosure requirements were included in a RESPA information collection submission last approved by OMB on May 6 1994 2502 0265 The final rule did not substantially modify the requirements for the controlled business disclosure and therefore HUD did not submit the disclosure requirements to OMB in connection with this rulemaking HUD has discovered that the controlled business disclosures which are mandated in section 8 c 4 A of RESPA 12 U S C 2607 c 4 A were omitted from the RESPA submission approved by OMB in 1994 HUD has begun to take the steps necessary to rectify this problem including preparation and publication of a correction to the final rule and proper submission of the controlled business disclosure requirements for OMB review and public comment Statutory authorization for the rule HUD promulgated these amendments to Regulation X and accompanying Statements of Policy under the authority in section 19 of RESPA 12 U S C 2617 Section 8 c 5 of RESPA 12 U S C 2607 c 5 permits HUD to exempt other payments or classes of payments from RESPA s prohibition on compensated referrals after consulting with specified Federal agencies Section 19 a 12 U S C 2617 a authorizes HUD to grant reasonable exemptions for classes of transactions as may be necessary to achieve the purposes of RESPA The preamble to the final rule states that HUD consulted with other Federal agencies as required by section 8 c 5 61 Fed Reg at 29245 National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 The preambles to both the proposed and final rules reflect HUD s finding that the rule will not have a significant impact on the environment 59 Fed Reg at 37373 61 Fed Reg at 29251 Accordingly HUD did not prepare an environmental impact statement in connection with this rule Executive Order 12866 OMB reviewed the Amendments to Regulation X and accompanying Statements of Policy under Executive Order 12866 as a significant regulatory action HUD staff advised that after submission to OMB HUD made technical editorial and clarifying changes to the rule which OMB also approved Page 4 GAO OGC 96 22 Other Executive Orders In response to our inquiry HUD staff advised that HUD reviewed the rule under Executive Order 12988 Civil Justice Reform We note that the final rule does clearly specify its affects on existing regulations In addition the preambles to the proposed and final rules address Executive Orders 12612 Federalism and 12606 the Family With respect to the Federalism Order they state that HUD has determined that the policies contained in the rule will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions or the relationship between the Federal government and the States or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government As a result the rule is not subject to review under that Order With respect to the Family Order the preambles similarly state HUD s determination that the rule does not have the potential for a significant impact on family formation maintenance and general well being and thus is not subject to review under the Order 59 Fed Reg at 37373 4 61 Fed Reg at 29251 Further the Executive Orders on property rights 12630 intergovernmental partnership 12875 and environmental justice 12948 are similarly inapplicable In its submission HUD did not identify any other statute or executive order imposing procedural requirements relevant to the rule Page 5 GAO OGC 96 22
