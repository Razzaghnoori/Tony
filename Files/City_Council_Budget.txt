 New York Law Journal Tuesday April 9 2002 City Council Budget Targets Legal Work By Daniel Wise The New York City Council yesterday offered a radically different set of priorities for the handling of the city s legal work in its response to Mayor Bloomberg s plan to close a projected 4 8 billion budget deficit The City Council plan would increase by nearly 50 percent to 80 4 million the amount of funding Mayor Bloomberg proposed for the Legal Aid Society by sharply curtailing compensation for court appointed lawyers under the 18 B program The City Council plan would also reduce to 2 percent the Bloomberg plan s 7 percent cut for District Attorney s Offices citywide The City Council s proposal for the 650 lawyer Corporation Counsel s Office would slash its budget by 10 percent or 10 2 million to 92 million In contrast Mayor Bloomberg s budget plan called for a modest 3 8 percent in the Corporation Counsel s budget leaving the office relatively untouched in comparison to most other mayoral agencies Council aides said yesterday that they did not have a head count for the cuts at the Law Department but that the City Council plan is tilted towards the elimination of legal positions which at 10 percent would require the layoff of more than 65 lawyers At the same time the City Council plan envisages dramatic cuts in the legal departments of many city agencies with a view to transferring the work to the Law Department The plan also calls for the elimination of the Mayor s Office of Contracts which would save 1 8 million and the transfer of the legal work done by that agency to the Corporation Counsel s Office Council aides did not have a total for the savings that would be realized in city agency legal departments through its plan But they said the proposal would save 10 million by eliminating more than 300 lawyers at the Administration for Children s Services many of whom prosecute neglect and abuse cases in Family Court Jack Deacy a spokesman for Administration for Children s Services was unavailable for comment Council aides also identified steep cuts in the legal departments of other agencies all 40 lawyers at the Department of Correction for a savings of 2 million 21 of 28 lawyers at the Department of Sanitation saving 945 000 and seven of 10 lawyers at the Department of Buildings 451 000 in savings Asked how the Corporation Counsel s Office could take on the expanded work while its own legal staff was being cut Thomas L McMahon the general counsel of the City Council said that in view of the city s terribly difficult fiscal circumstances the City Council plan provides a better way of managing the city s work force given the resources we have Kate Ahlers a spokeswoman for Corporation Counsel s Office said that her office had not yet received the City Council s plan and could not comment The administrative savings proposed by the City Council through the elimination of the Office of Contracts and many agency legal positions were part of 559 million the Council proposed to save through consolidation and efficiency in management In total the City Council proposed realizing 1 65 billion through savings and increased fees including restoration of the commuter tax to fund its own initiatives and offset some of the cuts proposed by Mayor Bloomberg in his preliminary budget on Feb 13 Legal Aid Would Gain One of the most dramatic changes in priorities proposed by the City Council would shift 25 6 million from funding for court appointed lawyers to the Legal Aid Society In a document released yesterday to justify its reordered priorities the Council contended that Legal Aid can achieve greater economies of scale than lawyers appointed pursuant to Article 18 B of the County Law The Council document also noted that inexplicably 18 B lawyers are handling 50 percent of the indigent criminal cases in New York City even though their mandate is to handle only multi defendant cases where the Legal Aid Society had a conflict In past years the City Council had consistently added 5 6 million to the 54 7 million proposed for the Legal Aid Society by former Mayor Giuliani bringing the total to just a shade over 60 million But this year for the first time the Council is proposing shifting more than 20 million in funds earmarked by the Mayor for 18 B lawyers to the Legal Aid Society which would increase its total funding to 80 4 million That would reflect a jump in its current finding of about one third Meantime the City Council proposed slashing the Mayor s allocation of 62 8 million for 18 B lawyers by 66 percent to 21 4 million Will Consider Proposal City Criminal Justice Coordinator John Feinblatt expressed a willingness to look at the Council s proposal In tough economic times he said we are willing to look at any proposal to reallocate scarce resources The Council would restore and slightly increase funding for two agencies that handle legal work for indigent criminal defendants that Mayor Bloomberg proposed to eliminate in his preliminary budget The Council would allocate 4 million to Neighborhood Legal Services which is based in Harlem and 1 8 million to the Office of the Appellate Defender which handles appeals for indigent criminal defendants in the First Department The Council proposal would tamp down the 7 percent cut that Mayor Bloomberg proposed for the city s five district attorneys to 2 percent The Mayor had estimated that a cut of 7 percent would reduce city spending for its district attorneys from 231 million to 215 million for a savings of 16 million The Council s documents did not itemize the savings projected at the 2 percent level but using the Mayor s figures a 2 percent cut would result in budget for prosecutors of 226 4 million and a savings of 4 6 million The Council budget would also restore 7 4 million in city funding for civil legal services work done by the Legal Aid Society and Legal Services for New York City which the Mayor had proposed cutting
