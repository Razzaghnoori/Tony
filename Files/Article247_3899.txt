 Gore and Bradley Debate HANOVER N H Al Gore performed this evening on a stage at Dartmouth College He told jokes blasted his rival s proposed health care reform proposal as too costly expressed disappointment and anger at President Clinton and kissed up shamelessly to members of the audience Bill Bradley was also present at the event Gore arrived on stage like some sort of feral animal who had been locked in a small cage and fed on nothing but focus groups for several days Upon release he began to scamper furiously in every direction at once Assuming his stool 20 minutes before showtime he volunteered to take extra questions from the audience At the end of the hour long non debate he promised to stay and answer even more As of this writing 10 30 p m he s still at it sitting on the edge of the stage with his wife talking about human rights in Africa and offshore oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico with a few dozen New Hampshirites Gore came across as a kind of manic political vaudevillian He oozed empathy from every pore getting all over every questioner like a cheap suit First he would ask the person about his circumstances his family or his job in a desperate effort to bond Then he would respond with an explosion of gesticulation sympathy and agreement At the very first question which referred to behavior by members of your administration Gore came out with a blast of empathy for emotions the questioner never expressed I understand the disappointment and anger you feel toward President Clinton he proclaimed I felt it myself In fact the questioner didn t even mention Clinton directly Not content with the six debates Bradley has already agreed to Gore challenged his opponent to debate every week At first you think Hey this new Al Gore s not such a stiff after all Then you think This new Gore is a bit over the top By the end of an hour the impression is of someone as desperate as he is unable to achieve Clintonian union with his audience Tell me about your family he asked a questioner who asked him what he was going to do about school violence I have one daughter 17 months old and a husband she answered Which one do you have the most trouble with Gore joked smarmily A clinical psychologist who asked about the problem of HMOs limiting coverage for mental health patients also got a full Gore bombing I guarantee you I m committed to it Gore said Give me a chance to roll up my sleeves and go to work on this This is one I want to fix for you He then told a strained joke about managed care An HMO employee who arrives at the pearly gates and is told by St Peter You can come in but you can only stay three days This elicited groans in the room where several hundred reporters watched the debate on video monitors as did Gore s fulsome expression of thanks to the people of New Hampshire for the wonderful lessons they had taught him Gore s problem I think is that he has watched Bill Clinton for seven years so he knows just how seamlessly a politician can bond with an audience But even as he copies the steps he lacks the music When he tries to emulate Clinton s audience meld technique he overdoes it grossly The problem isn t that Gore can t be personal and expressive It s that as a performer he has no emotional range When he pumps up to the volume he always turns it up to 10 This makes him seem insincere inauthentic and just generally fake in a way Clinton seldom does Television somehow heightens Gore s plasticity I saw him in person after the debate when he sat on the stage answering questions He was calmer and seemed much less phony Bill Bradley by contrast makes almost no personal impression Dowdily dressed and gravel voiced he is as close to affectlessness as anyone who I can remember running for high office Aside from one direct and passionate defense of gay rights which got the biggest applause of the night I ve already forgotten most of what he said Challenged repeatedly by Gore on the high cost of his health proposal he finally responded by uttering in his unmodulated low mumble I want to make one clarification We all have our own experts I dispute the cost figure that Al has used Other than that he didn t rise to Gore s bait But running against the world s most eager salesman refusing to market oneself may be a plausible stance Bill Bradley doesn t have to win you over with his charisma He just has to wait for you to get sick to death of Al Gore
