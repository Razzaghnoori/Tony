 A Brief History C rete s long history is bound with its strategic position at the crossroads between Western Europe the Middle East and North Africa In good times this brought trade ideas and prosperity in bad times invasion oppression and disease Many fascinating legacies around the island attest to the complicated web that time has spun here Each era has left its distinctive mark The earliest human remains found on Crete date back to the seventh millennium b c These first inhabitants were Neolithic cave dwellers who came from Asia Minor They developed into farmers with settlements and pastureland on the fertile Messar Plain It was an influx of new settlers with Bronze Age skills around 3000 b c that ushered in the Minoan era the first major civilization to arise on European soil The Minoans A great ancient Cretan civilization was for many years believed to be the stuff of mythology Yet with the discovery of marvelous artifacts and evidence of its cities Sir Arthur Evans its principal advocate made reality out of folklore and myth see page 33 We now know many facts about Minoan Crete including that at the height of its influence the population probably numbered more than 2 million about four times greater than today s figure with 100 000 people in the capital Knoss s These early European settlements were built without fortifications and comprised vast numbers of dwellings The cities developed ergonomically rather than to any grand design The first palatial structures at Knoss s and other great cities such as Phaist s and M lia were erected around 2000 b c but these were destroyed by an earthquake 300 years later The remains visible today are their replacements even bigger and more splendid than the originals The Golden Age for Minoan society known as the New Palace era lasted 300 years The Minoans were ruled by a priest king who presided over both religious and economic affairs It is unclear whether he reigned over the entire island or if each palace settlement had its own regional king His people worshipped the Mother Goddess and divine power symbolized by the bull for whom they performed ornate and elaborate rituals One sacred symbol which is at odds with their peaceful lifestyle is the labrys double headed sword Its image has been found on various artifacts throughout the island The Minoans developed an alphabet and printing method along with sophisticated plumbing and water delivery systems Women enjoyed high status playing an active part in palace life and the whole population enjoyed athletic contests games and a whole range of recreational activities Above all they excelled in the visual arts Wherever there was a blank canvas there was imagery decorative entrances walls floors and pottery Many breathtaking examples can be seen in the Archaeology Museum in Ir klion The smallest items such as combs were exquisitely worked Gold and precious stones were fashioned into beautiful jewelry all of which indicates a high quality of life for the people What fueled this great Empire was trade Cretans exhibited their skills with paint clay copper bronze and gold was highly prized and raw materials flowed in lapis lazuli from Afghanistan ivory from Syria and gold silver and black obsidian from Anatolia Copper and bronze were worked and re exported along with high quality foodstuffs such as olive oil honey and wine The Minoans developed into one of the great naval powers of the Mediterranean with the wood from the vast cypress forests providing material for boats But they concentrated their power more for commercial than military gain showing a taste for the good life rather than a hunger for an empire This great civilization came to a sudden catastrophic end around 1450 b c The exact cause remains unknown but all the palaces were destroyed at the same time The charred remains at Knoss s and ash at Z kros suggest a great conflagration A leading theory for many years was that natural disaster struck the island in the wake of the volcanic explosion on the island of Th ra Santorini due north of Crete bringing a maelstrom of tidal waves earthquakes and fire storms The most recent research has uncovered evidence supporting another hypothesis that an attack by invaders or rebel forces may have brought about the end of this fine culture Scholars will continue to debate the reason for many years to come Dorians and Romans After the disaster Mycenean Greeks from the Peloponnese moved in to control what remained of the Minoan settlements they may even have precipitated the destruction Around 1200 b c Dorian invaders from the Balkans drove south through the Greek mainland the Aegean islands and across to Crete Many coastal dwellers migrated to remote mountain villages in order to escape their enemies Others embarked on an overseas exodus that took them around the Mediterranean Sea The island did not get directly involved in Greece s Persian and Peloponnesian Wars however it became well known as a valuable source of brave and energetic mercenaries While mainland Greece was reaching its zenith during the Classical Age 480 338 b c the island remained a backwater of warring city states of which G rtis was the most powerful Nevertheless the enlightened Athenians acknowledged Crete as a source of much of their culture and its caves and shrines were major centers of pilgrimage The island s most important achievement and only significant remnant from this period is the law code of G rtis see page 36 It reveals a hierarchical society of free men serfs and slaves ruled by an aristocratic class It took the Romans three years of brutal fighting to conquer Crete in 67 b c and they did so only by playing the rival city states against one another Crete remained a province of the Roman Empire until a d 395 with G rtis as its capital The Romans managed to bring a certain order to the island putting an end to internal struggles building new roads ports and aqueducts and introducing systems of domestic plumbing and central heating not greatly inferior to those found today Christian Birthpains The apostle Paul arrived in a d 59 with his disciple Titus whom he left behind to convert the islanders to Christianity Titus had a hard time combating the Cretans pagan beliefs and was martyred for his overzealous efforts But Christianity eventually triumphed to achieve the strong Orthodoxy of today and Titus became Crete s patron saint When Roman power split in two the eastern Byzantine Empire inherited the island though its hold on islands in the south of its dominion were in reality nominal Attacks by pirates and Islamic forces brought terror to the people but Cretans remained loyal to the Orthodox Church throughout the Arab occupation of a d 824 961 The island was recaptured after a terrible siege of Ir klion by Byzantine commander Nikeph ros Phok s He catapulted the heads of dead Arabs into the city to dishearten those still defending the citadel Venetian Days After Byzantium fell to the Crusaders Crete was given to their leader Boniface of Montferrat who immediately sold it to Venice for 1 000 silver marks ushering in a new era Crete prospered greatly under the 465 years of Venetian occupation 1204 1669 although there were revolts by the native population which were brutally put down As a source of shipbuilding timber in a key location the island was a kingpin in the far flung commercial empire and became the Republic s first formally constituted overseas colony Proudly emblazoned with the Lion of St Mark the ports and fortifications of Ir klion called Candia under Venetian rule as was the whole of Crete Chani and R thymnon bear witness to the Venetians ambitious public building program Several handsome villas and loggias still attest to their gracious style of living Gradually Cretans settled down to intermarry with the occupiers and to participate in their style of government The arts flourished during the 16th and 17th centuries a period known as the Cretan Renaissance Numerous new monasteries and churches were built Icon painting was at its height with an influx of artists from around Byzantium who founded important schools of art The great literary figure of the time Vits nzos Korn ros wrote a romantic epic poem in the Cretan dialect Erot kritos Even if it has since lost its traditional hold in the mountain villages it is still acclaimed among the literati of R thymnon The Battle for Crete In the east Christian forces were in retreat as a new Moslem power began to rise The Ottoman Turks pushed Venetian and other forces from Asia Minor through the islands of the Aegean until they had left the Greek mainland Eventually it would be Crete s turn The Turks waged a titanic war to wrest the island from the Venetians It began with raids on Chani and Sit a in the 1530s by the notorious pirate Barbarossa Khair el Din Over the next century the Venetians greatly strengthened the fortifications but Chani and R thymnon fell in 1645 Two years later the Turks laid siege to the capital Candia It was an epic struggle which was to last 22 years Initially weakened by an outbreak of plague the 12 000 strong population rallied to the cause After 15 years the Turkish commander Hussein Pasha was summoned back to Constantinople and publicly strangled for his failure to take the city It is said that 30 000 defenders died but there were 118 000 fatalities among the besiegers Though Western Europe s leaders watched with baited breath they sent little support and inexorably Venetian resistance was worn away As the conquerors entered the city gates in 1699 the Venetians negotiated an orderly departure taking with them among other Christian artifacts the cherished head of Saint Titus This most symbolic of Crete s religious relics was not to return to the island until 1966 Turkish Rule Crete s years spent under the Turks 1669 1898 constituted a period of cultural and economic stagnation Ottoman leaders had no interest in developing or investing in their dominions and after the occasionally oppressive but often brilliant centuries of Venetian government Crete slid back into the dark ages Apart from repairing the islands fortifications the Ottomans left few lasting remnants of their rule They built no new mosques preferring to convert existing churches and left only a few houses Most numerous of their legacies are the ornate street fountains found in the corners of market squares and outside of chapels There were sporadic attempts at revolt often launched from remote mountain strongholds where rebels could survive in safety The more vulnerable communities on the lower plains paid a high price for these in the form of swift bloody reprisals The first major rebellion occurred in 1770 when the Russians hoping to distract the Turks while they waged their own attacks on the Ottoman Empire elsewhere promised support to Dhaskaloyi nnis a wealthy shipowner He raised a revolt in Sfaki but the support never arrived The rebellion was crushed Dhaskaloyi nnis was flayed alive and the event became the subject of a rousing epic poem There were notable uprisings in 1828 when its leaders were killed at Frangok stello and in 1866 when 2 000 people died in a suicide bombing at Ark di Monastery It is not surprising that at this time many town dwelling Cretans kept a low profile They publicly converted to Islam to escape heavy taxes continuing to practice their Orthodox faith in secret However once Greece had achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire after the War of 1821 the atmosphere changed Though Crete had to endure nearly a century more of subjection to Turkish domination it stirred the blood of many native sons who vowed to rid the island of its oppressors The ferocity of later Cretan resistance against the Turks had all the trademarks of their fiercely independent spirit Violent insurrections provoked equally violent massacres in retaliation and death came to form a monumental collective badge of honor The island s repeated suffering was duly celebrated in the popular heroic Songs of Dighenis adapted from their medieval origins for the modern struggle Pandelis Prevelakis grim novel The Cretan and the lofty writings of N kos Kazantz kis Union with Greece Finally in 1898 the European powers forced the Turks to grant Crete autonomy within the Ottoman Empire and accept Prince George second son of the Greek king as governor This did not satisfy the people and the prince was forced to resign only a few years later under threat of revolt and the demand for union with Greece It was only in 1913 under the leadership of Elefth rios Veniz los a native Cretan that the longed for nosis union was achieved Though unscathed by World War I Crete saw major changes in the mid 1920s The Atat rk revolution which announced a new Turkish Republic brought massive upheaval through the area with a forced population exchange between Greece and Turkey beginning in 1923 Thousands of Turks were evacuated and thousands of Greek refugees from Asia Minor arrived to take their place However agricultural resources and output were improved and the new arrivals soon began to settle The new science of archaeology was also developing and excavations of Minoan palaces brought a new prosperity as the 20th century phenomenon of tourism grew War and Peace Crete s pains were not yet over however During World War II the rapid advance of the German forces through mainland Greece in 1941 forced the Allies to retreat to Crete On 20 May German troops invaded the island and secured the airfield at Maleme to the west of Chani British Australian and New Zealand soldiers joined Cretan militia during a valiant defense in the ten day Battle of Crete but were ultimately forced to retreat across the island Many were evacuated to Egypt though several thousand were left stranded and fled to the mountains Casualties on both sides were terrible Allied losses numbered 2 000 killed and 12 000 taken prisoner while the German war cemetery contains almost 4 500 graves With their tradition of resistance to foreign invaders Cretans kept up constant guerrilla warfare against the occupying Axis force Efforts to shelter the Allies and smuggle them off the island in small groups from isolated south coast beaches were remarkably successful But the German army wreaked brutal reprisals on the civilians In 1944 the resistance pulled off an amazing coup by kidnapping the German commander General Kreipe and smuggling him off the island German troops later marched through the Am ri Valley burning villages to the ground and killing any men they could find The occupation of Crete did not end until May 1945 Much of the island was left in ruins from heavy bombing but Crete escaped the internal strife of the civil war that raged in mainland Greece 1947 1949 and felt fewer effects of the oppressive rule of the colonels 1967 1974 than other Greek communities Relative calm now reigns on the political front and Greece s economic prospects have strengthened since it joined the European Union in 1981 There have been profound changes on the island which was until the 1950s almost exclusively agricultural Crete has been a beneficiary of Greece s huge increase in tourism and has become one of the most prosperous regions of the country
