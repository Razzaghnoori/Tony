A Brief HistoryC retes long history is bound with its strategic position at the crossroads between Western Europe the Middle East and North Africa In good times this brought trade ideas and prosperity in bad timesinvasion oppression and disease Many fascinating legacies around the island attest to the complicated web that time has spun here Each era has left its distinctive markThe earliest human remains found on Crete date back to the seventh millennium bc These first inhabitants were Neolithic cave dwellers who came from Asia Minor They developed into farmers with settlements and pastureland on the fertile Messar Plain It was an influx of new settlers with Bronze Age skills around  bc that ushered in the Minoan era the first major civilization to arise on European soilThe MinoansA great ancient Cretan civilization was for many years believed to be the stuff of mythology Yet with the discovery of marvelous artifacts and evidence of its cities Sir Arthur Evans its principal advocate made reality out of folklore and myth see page  We now know many facts about Minoan Crete including that at the height of its influence the population probably numbered more than  million about four times greater than todays figure with  people in the capital KnosssThese early European settlements were built without fortifications and comprised vast numbers of dwellings The cities developed ergonomically rather than to any grand design The first palatial structures at Knosss and other great cities such as Phaists and Mlia were erected around  bc but these were destroyed by an earthquake  years later The remains visible today are their replacements even bigger and more splendid than the originals The Golden Age for Minoan societyknown as the New Palace eralasted  yearsThe Minoans were ruled by a priestking who presided over both religious and economic affairs It is unclear whether he reigned over the entire island or if each palace settlement had its own regional king His people worshipped the Mother Goddess and divine power symbolized by the bull for whom they performed ornate and elaborate rituals One sacred symbol which is at odds with their peaceful lifestyle is the labrys doubleheaded sword Its image has been found on various artifacts throughout the islandThe Minoans developed an alphabet and printing method along with sophisticated plumbing and water delivery systems Women enjoyed high status playing an active part in palace life and the whole population enjoyed athletic contests games and a whole range of recreational activities Above all they excelled in the visual arts Wherever there was a blank canvas there was imagery decorative entrances walls floors and pottery Many breathtaking examples can be seen in the Archaeology Museum in Irklion The smallest items such as combs were exquisitely worked Gold and precious stones were fashioned into beautiful jewelry all of which indicates a high quality of life for the people What fueled this great Empire was trade Cretans exhibited their skills with paint clay copper bronze and gold was highly prized and raw materials flowed inlapis lazuli from Afghanistan ivory from Syria and gold silver and black obsidian from Anatolia Copper and bronze were worked and reexported along with high quality foodstuffs such as olive oil honey and wineThe Minoans developed into one of the great naval powers of the Mediterranean with the wood from the vast cypress forests providing material for boats But they concentrated their power more for commercial than military gain showing a taste for the good life rather than a hunger for an empire This great civilization came to a sudden catastrophic end around  bc The exact cause remains unknown but all the palaces were destroyed at the same time The charred remains at Knosss and ash at Zkros suggest a great conflagration A leading theory for many years was that natural disaster struck the island in the wake of the volcanic explosion on the island of Thra Santorini due north of Crete bringing a maelstrom of tidal waves earthquakes and fire storms The most recent research has uncovered evidence supporting another hypothesisthat an attack by invaders or rebel forces may have brought about the end of this fine culture Scholars will continue to debate the reason for many years to comeDorians and RomansAfter the disaster Mycenean Greeks from the Peloponnese moved in to control what remained of the Minoan settlementsthey may even have precipitated the destruction Around  bc Dorian invaders from the Balkans drove south through the Greek mainland the Aegean islands and across to Crete Many coastal dwellers migrated to remote mountain villages in order to escape their enemies Others embarked on an overseas exodus that took them around the Mediterranean Sea The island did not get directly involved in Greeces Persian and Peloponnesian Wars however it became wellknown as a valuable source of brave and energetic mercenariesWhile mainland Greece was reaching its zenith during the Classical Age  bc the island remained a backwater of warring citystates of which Grtis was the most powerful Nevertheless the enlightened Athenians acknowledged Crete as a source of much of their culture and its caves and shrines were major centers of pilgrimage The islands most important achievementand only significant remnantfrom this period is the law code of Grtis see page  It reveals a hierarchical society of free men serfs and slaves ruled by an aristocratic class It took the Romans three years of brutal fighting to conquer Crete in  bc and they did so only by playing the rival citystates against one another Crete remained a province of the Roman Empire until ad  with Grtis as its capital The Romans managed to bring a certain order to the island putting an end to internal struggles building new roads ports and aqueducts and introducing systems of domestic plumbing and central heating not greatly inferior to those found todayChristian BirthpainsThe apostle Paul arrived in ad  with his disciple Titus whom he left behind to convert the islanders to Christianity Titus had a hard time combating the Cretans pagan beliefs and was martyred for his overzealous efforts But Christianity eventually triumphed to achieve the strong Orthodoxy of today and Titus became Cretes patron saintWhen Roman power split in two the eastern Byzantine Empire inherited the island though its hold on islands in the south of its dominion were in reality nominal Attacks by pirates and Islamic forces brought terror to the people but Cretans remained loyal to the Orthodox Church throughout the Arab occupation of ad  The island was recaptured after a terrible siege of Irklion by Byzantine commander Nikephros Phoks He catapulted the heads of dead Arabs into the city to dishearten those still defending the citadelVenetian DaysAfter Byzantium fell to the Crusaders Crete was given to their leader Boniface of Montferrat who immediately sold it to Venice for  silver marks ushering in a new era Crete prospered greatly under the  years of Venetian occupation  although there were revolts by the native population which were brutally put down As a source of shipbuilding timber in a key location the island was a kingpin in the far flung commercial empire and became the Republics first formally constituted overseas colony Proudly emblazoned with the Lion of St Mark the ports and fortifications of Irklion called Candia under Venetian rule as was the whole of Crete Chani and Rthymnon bear witness to the Venetians ambitious public building program Several handsome villas and loggias still attest to their gracious style of living Gradually Cretans settled down to intermarry with the occupiers and to participate in their style of governmentThe arts flourished during the th and th centuries a period known as the Cretan Renaissance Numerous new monasteries and churches were built Icon painting was at its height with an influx of artists from around Byzantium who founded important schools of art The great literary figure of the time Vitsnzos Kornros wrote a romantic epic poem in the Cretan dialect Erotkritos Even if it has since lost its traditional hold in the mountain villages it is still acclaimed among the literati of RthymnonThe Battle for CreteIn the east Christian forces were in retreat as a new Moslem power began to rise The Ottoman Turks pushed Venetian and other forces from Asia Minor through the islands of the Aegean until they had left the Greek mainland Eventually it would be Cretes turn The Turks waged a titanic war to wrest the island from the Venetians It began with raids on Chani and Sita in the s by the notorious pirate Barbarossa Khair elDin Over the next century the Venetians greatly strengthened the fortifications but Chani and Rthymnon fell in Two years later the Turks laid siege to the capital Candia It was an epic struggle which was to last  years Initially weakened by an outbreak of plague the  strong population rallied to the cause After  years the Turkish commander Hussein Pasha was summoned back to Constantinople and publicly strangled for his failure to take the city It is said that  defenders died but there were  fatalities among the besiegersThough Western Europes leaders watched with baited breath they sent little support and inexorably Venetian resistance was worn away As the conquerors entered the city gates in  the Venetians negotiated an orderly departure taking with them among other Christian artifacts the cherished head of Saint Titus This most symbolic of Cretes religious relics was not to return to the island until Turkish RuleCretes years spent under the Turks  constituted a period of cultural and economic stagnation Ottoman leaders had no interest in developing or investing in their dominions and after the occasionally oppressive but often brilliant centuries of Venetian government Crete slid back into the dark agesApart from repairing the islands fortifications the Ottomans left few lasting remnants of their rule They built no new mosques preferring to convert existing churches and left only a few houses Most numerous of their legacies are the ornate street fountains found in the corners of market squares and outside of chapels There were sporadic attempts at revolt often launched from remote mountain strongholds where rebels could survive in safety The more vulnerable communities on the lower plains paid a high price for these in the form of swift bloody reprisals The first major rebellion occurred in  when the Russians hoping to distract the Turks while they waged their own attacks on the Ottoman Empire elsewhere promised support to Dhaskaloyinnis a wealthy shipowner He raised a revolt in Sfaki but the support never arrived The rebellion was crushed Dhaskaloyinnis was flayed alive and the event became the subject of a rousing epic poem There were notable uprisings in  when its leaders were killed at Frangokstello and in  when  people died in a suicide bombing at Arkdi Monastery It is not surprising that at this time many towndwelling Cretans kept a low profile They publicly converted to Islam to escape heavy taxes continuing to practice their Orthodox faith in secretHowever once Greece had achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire after the War of  the atmosphere changed Though Crete had to endure nearly a century more of subjection to Turkish domination it stirred the blood of many native sons who vowed to rid the island of its oppressors The ferocity of later Cretan resistance against the Turks had all the trademarks of their fiercely independent spirit Violent insurrections provoked equally violent massacres in retaliation and death came to form a monumental collective badge of honorThe islands repeated suffering was duly celebrated in the popular heroic Songs of Dighenis adapted from their medieval origins for the modern struggle Pandelis Prevelakis grim novel The Cretan and the lofty writings of Nkos KazantzkisUnion with GreeceFinally in  the European powers forced the Turks to grant Crete autonomy within the Ottoman Empire and accept Prince George second son of the Greek king as governor This did not satisfy the people and the prince was forced to resign only a few years later under threat of revolt and the demand for union with Greece It was only in  under the leadership of Elefthrios Venizlos a native Cretan that the longedfor nosis union was achievedThough unscathed by World War I Crete saw major changes in the mid s The Atatrk revolution which announced a new Turkish Republic brought massive upheaval through the area with a forced population exchange between Greece and Turkey beginning in  Thousands of Turks were evacuated and thousands of Greek refugees from Asia Minor arrived to take their place However agricultural resources and output were improved and the new arrivals soon began to settle The new science of archaeology was also developing and excavations of Minoan palaces brought a new prosperity as the thcentury phenomenon of tourism grewWar and PeaceCretes pains were not yet over however During World War II the rapid advance of the German forces through mainland Greece in  forced the Allies to retreat to Crete On  May German troops invaded the island and secured the airfield at Maleme to the west of Chani British Australian and New Zealand soldiers joined Cretan militia during a valiant defense in the tenday Battle of Crete but were ultimately forced to retreat across the island Many were evacuated to Egypt though several thousand were left stranded and fled to the mountains Casualties on both sides were terrible Allied losses numbered  killed and  taken prisoner while the German war cemetery contains almost  graves With their tradition of resistance to foreign invaders Cretans kept up constant guerrilla warfare against the occupying Axis force Efforts to shelter the Allies and smuggle them off the island in small groups from isolated south coast beaches were remarkably successful But the German army wreaked brutal reprisals on the civilians In  the resistance pulled off an amazing coup by kidnapping the German commander General Kreipe and smuggling him off the island German troops later marched through the Amri Valley burning villages to the ground and killing any men they could find The occupation of Crete did not end until May Much of the island was left in ruins from heavy bombing but Crete escaped the internal strife of the civil war that raged in mainland Greece  and felt fewer effects of the oppressive rule of the colonels  than other Greek communities Relative calm now reigns on the political front and Greeces economic prospects have strengthened since it joined the European Union in  There have been profound changes on the island which was until the s almost exclusively agricultural Crete has been a beneficiary of Greeces huge increase in tourism and has become one of the most prosperous regions of the country
