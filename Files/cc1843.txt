 Introduction The term sepsis is used to define the systemic inflammatory response to an infectious agent i e bacterial viral fungal or parasitic Despite the use of new treatment modalities improvements in technology and increased experience mortality rates in sepsis remain high 1 2 Critical care physicians have at their disposal a variety of data to serve as a guide in discriminating infectious from noninfectious conditions in newly admitted patients In a number of newly admitted patients the diagnosis of sepsis becomes clear after taking the medical history and completing the physical examination 3 In other cases in which noninfectious insults are responsible for systemic inflammatory response syndrome SIRS e g trauma burns haemorrhages hypothermia pancreatitis and surgery or in comatose patients the diagnosis of sepsis remains difficult Prompt diagnosis and treatment with appropriate antimicrobial chemotherapy is of the utmost importance in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with sepsis The lack of specific early markers of infection may be responsible in part for withholding delaying or unnecessary antimicrobial treatment in critically ill patients 4 Thus there is an unmet need for clinical or laboratory tools that can distinguish between SIRS and sepsis Various markers of sepsis including C reactive protein CRP tumour necrosis factor TNF IL 1 IL 6 and IL 8 have all been studied for their ability to differentiate SIRS from sepsis 4 5 6 7 Several investigators have questioned the diagnostic accuracy of procalcitonin PCT measurement results with which have been inconsistent and variable 4 6 7 8 9 10 Thus it may not be easy to discriminate between SIRS and sepsis even with the use of PCT The present study was conducted to determine the procalcitonin level at early diagnosis and differentiation in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome SIRS and sepsis in comparison with C reactive protein IL 2 IL 6 IL 8 and tumour necrosis factor in an unselected population of patients suffering from a broad range of diseases in an intensive care unit ICU Methods Laboratory measurements CRP was measured using a routine turbidimetry assay ILAD 900 Instrumentation Laboratory Milan Italy a value greater than 10 mg l was considered to be abnormally elevated TNF and IL 2 IL 6 and IL 8 were measured using commercially available cheluminesan kits Immulite One DTC Los Angeles CA USA All cytokine samples were analyzed in duplicate PCT levels normal range 0 0 5 ng l were determined by means of a specific and ultrasensitive immunoluminometric assay LUMI test PCT Brahms Ag Hennigsdorf Berlin Germany Statistical analysis For multiple group comparisons of CRP ILs and PCT one way analysis of variance was applied with least squares difference for post hoc comparison The best cutoff value of parameters for the diagnosis of sepsis was determined according to the Youden s index method The ability of PCT to predict sepsis was evaluated by performing receiver operative characteristic analyses to compare SIRS versus sepsis patients 12 Furthermore the areas under the receiver operative characteristic curve AUCs were determined as well as the positive negative predictive values Positive predictive values and negative predictive values indicate the proportion of patients with a cytokine level greater than or below the chosen cutoff point Test effectiveness is the sum of the positive predictive values and negative predictive values Thus the maximum score is 2 which represents perfect prediction both positive and negative 13 The septic shock group was not included in this analysis because of insufficient data Statistical analyses were conducted using the Statistical Program for Social Science SPSS Chicago IL USA P 0 05 was considered statistically significant Data in the text are shown as mean standard error or as median and percentiles 10 25 75 90 Results A total of 33 patients 17 men and 16 women were included in the study The median age of the patients was 58 16 years The duration of stay of the patients in the ICU was 7 4 6 78 days The final retrospectively confirmed diagnoses of all patients are shown in Table 1 For each of the time points assessed in the present study patients were categorized into the three groups namely SIRS sepsis and septic shock No severely septic patients were identified Ten patients died on the second day following admission to the ICU and those patients underwent only two assessments Thus a total of 89 assessments of the patients clinical status were conducted referred to hereafter as conditions 48 of which indicated SIRS 53 of all patients 35 sepsis 39 of all patients and 6 septic shock 7 of all patients Of the 41 conditions of sepsis and septic shock 24 58 involved pneumonia 8 20 urogenital infection 2 5 intraperitoneal abscess and 5 12 wound infection In three patients no infectious focus could be found but blood cultures were positive Infections were microbiologically proven in 36 88 conditions with 51 being Gram negative 41 Gram positive and 8 mixed infections Of the five conditions with SIRS tracheal cultures were positive but did not exhibit any host response they were therefore considered colonization Eight patients did not receive antimicrobial treatment in any of the study periods Five of the patients who died 5 6 83 were in septic shock group and the other five patients who died 5 35 14 were in the sepsis group APACHE II scores did not differ between groups No correlation was found between PCT concentrations and APACHE II scores r 0 23 Serum concentrations of CRP TNF and IL 6 were not statistically different between SIRS sepsis and septic shock groups IL 2 IL 8 and PCT levels were different between groups Septic shock patients had the highest level of IL 2 IL 8 and PCT concentrations Median and percentiles 10 25 75 90 for all parameters and APACHE II scores in patients with SIRS sepsis and septic shock are presented in Table 2 Because we only six septic shock conditions were identified we employed only SIRS and sepsis conditions for statistical analysis of diagnostic reliability of serum PCT and cytokines Using Youden s Index the best cutoff value for PCT was 2 415 ng ml The best cut off value and AUC for all markers are shown in Table 3 The AUC was highest for PCT Table 4summarizes the predictive accuracy of the laboratory variables for the specific diagnoses of SIRS and sepsis With a cutoff point of 2 415 ng ml serum PCT concentration was found to be the most discriminatory laboratory variable the predictive accuracy of which exceeded those of CRP TNF IL 2 IL 6 and IL 8 With regard to positive and negative predictive values we found that PCT markedly exceeds the values calculated for other variables The test effectiveness was 1 84 for PCT in predicting sepsis whereas the other variables reached values between 0 96 and 1 22 Discussion We analyzed the plasma concentrations of various biochemical markers with respect to their potential use in differentiating between patients suffering from SIRS and from sepsis This assessment is of potential interest because systemic inflammation is a common problem in the ICU which often leads to shock and death The diagnostic repertoire for identifying SIRS is poor Verification of infection site and even the presence of infection remains problematic in sepsis In 20 30 of patients the infection site is never identified Neither imaging studies nor blood culture analysis can rule out the presence of infection 14 Moreover there are classes of patients with unconfirmed infection or for whom cultures are negative yet who develop similar symptoms rates of organ failure and survival outcomes as do those in patients in whom infection is confirmed The availability of laboratory tests for accurate and rapid identification of septic patients by isolation of micro organisms from body fluid specimens would be of considerable value Thus there is a clear need for a reliable diagnostic procedure that allows early discrimination between patients suffering from SIRS and those with sepsis A relatively new marker that has been associated with inflammation and sepsis is PCT a 116 amino acid protein that is the precursor to calcitonin The PCT plasma level in healthy individuals is low usually below 0 1 ng ml 15 That PCT concentration is significantly elevated in patients with organ dysfunction is undoubted However the difference in PCT between patients with SIRS and those with sepsis may be small Reports of the usefulness of PCT for discriminating between SIRS and sepsis are conflicting 4 6 7 8 9 10 Therefore we selected several cytokines as well as PCT for early diagnosis and differentiation of patients with SIRS and sepsis High serum PCT concentrations were first described by Assicot and coworkers 16 in children with severe bacterial infections and were suggested to be a specific marker for bacterial infection Al Nawas and coworkers 17 reported higher PCT levels in patients with clinically documented infection than in those fulfilling the criteria for SIRS Two studies compared PCT and CRP in ICU patients and found that PCT had poorer sensitivity specificity and AUC than did CRP as a marker of sepsis 8 10 In order to assess the diagnostic utility of PCT and CRP in a medical ICU prospective measurements were conducted in 101 consecutive patients with acute SIRS or sepsis PCT did not clearly discriminate SIRS from sepsis 8 Another group from Germany reported average PCT concentrations of 0 4 3 0 ng ml for SIRS 0 5 2 9 ng ml for sepsis and 6 9 3 9 ng ml for severe sepsis On the basis of their findings the investigators concluded that PCT CRP white blood cell and body temperature does not discriminate SIRS from sepsis and PCT was the only parameter to discriminate between sepsis and severe sepsis 9 Muller and colleagues 4 investigated 101 patients admitted to a medical ICU and suggested that PCT is a more reliable marker of sepsis than is CRP IL 6 and lactate levels To assess the diagnostic value of PCT IL 6 IL 8 and standard measures for identifying critically ill patients with SIRS and suspected sepsis prospective measurements were taken in 78 consecutive patients admitted with acute SIRS and suspected infection PCT yielded the highest discriminative value for differentiating patients with SIRS from those with sepsis followed by IL 6 and IL 8 6 Selberg and coworkers 7 studied discrimination of sepsis and SIRS by determination of circulating plasma concentrations of PCT IL 6 and C3a in a medical ICU Their data indicated that of PCT IL 6 and C3a concentrations are more reliable parameter for differentiating between septic and SIRS patients than are CRP and elastase Mechanical trauma causes elevated PCT levels the degree of which depends on the severity of the injury Levels peak on days 1 3 and fall thereafter High concentrations of circulating PCT during the first 3 days after injury discriminate between patients at risk for SIRS sepsis and multiple organ dysfunctions in the early and late post traumatic course 18 Previous studies compared CRP IL 2 IL 6 and TNF and PCT separately for differentiating SIRS from sepsis in the present study all of the available biochemical markers were measured at the same time 4 7 8 9 10 PCT had the highest sensitivity and specificity for differentiating SIRS from sepsis followed by IL 2 and IL 8 Thus in agreement with previous studies 6 7 PCT was a more reliable marker in the diagnosis of sepsis than other measures The present study included consecutive unselected patients who were representative of an ICU population with baseline characteristics similar those reported in the literature and strict objective criteria for the diagnosis of infection were employed 19 However several criticisms of the study should be addressed First PCT was not monitored every day and a shorter monitoring interval may improve its performance as an aid for diagnosis and follow up of sepsis Second with the use of clinical criteria and microbiological evidence it might have been difficult to ascertain the exact aetiology of SIRS in all patients This may have introduced some misclassification bias because investigators who were blinded to the cytokine results performed the case ascertainment however we do not believe this lack of an important standard compromised our study conclusions Third antimicrobial therapy may have an impact on PCT values Our study design does not allow us to explain the exact relationship between antimicrobial therapy and PCT values The temporal relationship between PCT and antibiotic treatment should be assessed in further studies Conclusion In the present study PCT appeared to be a more accurate diagnostic parameter for differentiating between patients suffering from SIRS and those with sepsis Routine determination of PCT may improve management of patients for example by preventing the use of unnecessary antibiotics that are known to select resistance strains Further studies of the early phases of sepsis are necessary to define the role of PCT in possible therapeutic strategies such as antimicrobial and immunological therapies and cost implcations Competing interests None declared Key message
