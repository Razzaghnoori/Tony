                okay um what does your does your community do anything about recycling   we have been working hard to get a program of recycling going   umhum   the best weve been able to do is an area that has uh storage bins uh for um bottles and uh plastic   um umhum   but people need to drive it there we dont we havent moved to having uh picked up with the garbage yet   right Plano um oh its probably been i guess i started in September um started where they gave every every household a bin that you could do newspapers aluminum uh bottles with code one and two on them and uh glass and uh it has been really really successful um they said that they figured like twenty five to thirty percent participation and its been like forty five percent and um they also do um they pick up on another day of the week for um lawn debris that could go in like a big compost   here uh they dont take uh lawn debris to the landfill any more we need to load it into cars and take it to a general site where it gets recycled uh but   umhum   i think theyre theyre not making it easy for the uh general public to do it here i mean they they you have to haul everything yourself which can be a mess when it comes to uh yard waste in particular   right right how big is your community   well weve got enough people weve got a community of about eighty five thousand   yeah   but theyre just very reluctant to to get moving the way in which i would like to see them moving   umhum the i yeah thats i i would like to see the manufacturers really uh you know the only thing that they recycle right now is is plastics one and two and i would like to see them recycle either more plastics um you know up to code seven or eight whatever it is or see the manufacturers using more of the um uh code one and two that i i mean i dont even know of a place to drop off the other the other ones   um did did did you tell me that youre recycling newspapers   but um were recycling newspapers aluminum um i mean like aluminum cans like soup cans and all that not just you know soda pop cans um glass and uh the plastics   boy youre youre further ahead here most people are recycling aluminum soda pop and beer cans uh for the money that they get out of them and that seems to be the only incentive on that side   right it sure does take a lot of lot of cans to do that that to make anything though at least down here it i i took like two garbage sacks full i mean just like paper sacks and got like a quarter and i thought this just really isnt worth my time   yeah it really is but there are a few people who who   so that that go through the dregs yeah   they will manage it what weve done at the church is to have uh people bring the stuff to our church   yeah umhum   and then therere couple of people who who crunch them down and then uh take them to a recycling center and then the money is used for uh the outreach program to provide food   umhum thats great   and so that has been an incentive uh within uh our our particular church   yeah   but newspapers the city doesnt want and none of the uh recycling places want them because they say that theyre it costs them more to recycle than than they get out of them so were stuck with newspapers   yeah really really we we i know uh even before this took place um in September the our like our boy scouts were doing paper you know paper drives and even when i was younger um i remember having paper drives at school and um so i know it it seems like for you know a long time the the Dallas area has been doing some kind of paper recycling i dont know what they did with the papers you know twenty thirty years ago im not sure but i know now i mean we have a lot of um stores  WalMart is down real big down here and and their their paper sacks that they do are all you know out of recycled paper and we have a lot of lot of companies
