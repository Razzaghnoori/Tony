 Alice in Watergate Washington like I suppose the rest of the country is alive with echoes of Watergate these days for obvious reasons How do President Clinton s offenses compare with President Nixon s What light does the Nixon case throw on the definition of high crimes and misdemeanors What precedent does Congress procedure in the Watergate case establish for the procedure in the Lewinsky case I do not propose to add to the volume of punditry on such questions But I can add a footnote on the question of what it was like being an innocent in the White House during the Watergate affair I use the word innocent of course to mean not just not guilty but also unaware or naive Iwas chairman of Nixon s Council of Economic Advisers during the whole business I was at the Homestead in Hot Springs Va Sunday morning June 18 1972 when I read in the Washington Post of the break in at the Watergate Office Building The previous evening I had given a speech to the Virginia Bankers Association about the wonders of the economic situation Only a little before that I had held a press conference announcing that the economic statistics of the first quarter were the best in recorded history or I cautiously added at least in the Christian era We seemed to be on our way to an orderly dismantling of price and wage controls Nixon s re election in November seemed assured the only question being which Democratic candidate would be defeated most decisively The Watergate break in did not look like a cloud on our or my horizon For the next two years up almost to the last days I could see the cloud getting darker and darker but did not believe the Nixon presidency would come to a premature end For one thing I had my own experience with the extent of bias and animosity in the press against anything having to do with Nixon During many years in Washington before I entered the Nixon administration I had had friendly relations with many reporters I was then associated with the Committee for Economic Development the least conservative of the business organizations and we were the good guys to the liberal press But these same reporters became my enemies and I felt misrepresented me as soon as it became apparent I was devoted to Nixon As it happened one of the president s chief pursuers in the press Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post had been my neighbor in Silver Spring Md and a friend of my children s He had been a likable boy but I put no great stock in his professionalism or objectivity So I did not believe the press was giving an accurate account of what had happened At 8 a m each day I participated in a meeting of the White House staff presided over by the chief of staff first Bob Haldeman and later Al Haig Almost every morning in 1973 and 1974 we were given a status report on the Watergate case the constant refrain of which was that everything was going to come out all right I don t believe anyone was lying to us But no one told us and perhaps didn t know how the legal and political process was going to unfold Still I don t underestimate the importance of my own unwillingness to believe Nixon had honored me by making me member and then chairman of his Council of Economic Advisers He had treated me with respect and offered me his friendship I was unwilling to believe that he had behaved in a way that a committee of Congress even one composed mainly of his political enemies would consider deserving of impeachment Ican think of only one economic policy decision that was probably influenced by the president s concern with Watergate By the beginning of 1973 after the election the wage price control system began to come unglued The world food supply had fallen because of bad weather in Russia and El Ni o in the Pacific food prices were rising beyond our control and with food prices rising it was hard to restrain wages When I spoke with Leonard Garment then the president s counsel he said the president was in trouble and asked whether we couldn t have some kind of economic spectacular to help bolster his public support Perhaps because I didn t have enough imagination I had no comfort to give him In March the president suggested to me that we might have another wage price freeze like the one we had imposed in August 1971 that had been so popular I replied smart alecky that you can t step in the same river twice He came back with the wittiest words I ever heard from him Yes you can if it s frozen That was not the end of the matter The economic situation continued to deteriorate and as I now see so did the political one Nixon brought back as counselor John Connally who in 1971 and 1972 as secretary of the Treasury had been his specialist in long ball economic policy The president wanted his economic team thus fortified to produce a dramatic economic policy that would improve the nation s economy and his political standing A new wage price freeze was one of the options to be considered But none of us not even Connally wanted that The president repeatedly asked us to reconsider After several uncomfortable weeks he decided without the benefit of his economists to impose the freeze anyway It was an immediate flop and did not last long Then we reverted to unspectacular even painful economics As I look back at those days I am impressed by the way in which President Nixon continued to perform his duties in what was surely a time of great stress for him Of course I was not an intimate and I did not see him in his private moments But still I had many meetings with him and he showed no signs of distraction or impatience He would take notes on his yellow pad and sum up the sense of our meetings in an orderly manner as he had always done Near the end in July 1974 I went out to San Clemente to draft what was to be although we didn t know it at the time Nixon s last address as president before his resignation message The speech was long and I can now see rather platitudinous But Nixon read all the drafts He discussed them with me and Roy Ash who was then the budget director and he delivered the final speech with vigor on July 25 in Los Angeles It was on the plane flying back to Washington that we got news of votes in the House committee that made impeachment extremely likely Two weeks later my wife my son and I were in the East Room of the White House tears streaming down our cheeks as Richard Nixon said farewell to his staff
