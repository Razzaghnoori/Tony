 Hollywood Babylon Dominick Dunne is a ridiculous man but in an interesting way He is not in the conventional sense a good writer His prose lacks even the hasty spasmodic felicities to which we are resigned in the age of word processing Here is a sentence from the second page of his O J Simpson novel Another City Not My Own That book Dunne s own Season in Purgatory the miniseries of which he was watching had brought Gus Bailey and the unsolved murder in Greenwich Connecticut which to avoid a libel suit he had renamed Scarborough Hill a great deal of notoriety at the time of its publication resulting in the reopening of the murder case by the police Have we lost you In this sentence its cries out for its parental noun like a little duckling left on the wrong side of the road That book is the referent but other nouns rush to and fro like big scary buses Miniseries murder Greenwich libel suit Scarborough Hill notoriety Almost magisterial almost artistic is the way this sentence begins to go haywire with the words the miniseries of which and yet not Dunne can be ridiculed not merely for his aimless dribbling style What he calls a novel is hardly deserving of the name Another City Not My Own reads like a conflation of the author s first person columns for Vanity Fair the sole difference being the substitution of Gus Bailey for I throughout as if by universal search and replace Gus Bailey goes to the courtroom and watches the trial everyone already knows by heart Then he goes to Hollywood parties and talks up each day s events with an air of tragic foreknowledge That s it The tone is uneven Dunne jerks from moralistic pronouncements on O J s guilt to smarmy name dropping with the ease of an evangelical hack The litany of show business and upper crust names in the book is staggering On Pages 218 through 221 we find the following Army Archerd Kate Capshaw Uma Thurman Carrie Fisher Roddy McDowall Elizabeth Taylor Matt Crowley Nazimova Natalie Wood James Clavell Sue Mengers Gore Vidal Jack Nicholson Johnny Mathis Nancy Reagan Marje Everett Merv Griffin Princess Diana Prince Charles John Travolta Suzanne Childs Ray Stark Betsy Bloomingdale and Alan Greisman who used to be married to Sally Field I ve omitted names of people directly connected with the case Marcia Clark Chris Darden Judge Ito although Dunne has a way of making their names sound dropped as well So why is one inclined to forgive this book s faults Dunne is nothing if not charming The flair for gossip that got him into thousands of dinner parties also wears down the resistance of the reader He is seductively forthright about the failures in his life about the fiasco of his career and marriage in the Hollywood of the 1960s and he is aware of the conditional codependent quality of his fame He knows that his A list aura at the time of the O J trial owed everything to O J himself He admits to being a terrible name dropper Rather like O J admitting that he had his problems with Nicole The act has more than a bit of camp about it America attends to the stern judgments of a male socialite One has to smile at the role played in this book by Andrew Cunanan whose scenes are the only ones here that seem to spring from Dunne s imagination Cunanan shows up at a Hollywood dinner party hosted by Ray Stark and populated by Kirk Douglas David Geffen and Marcia Clark Gus Bailey notices Cunanan right away and asks Stark s daughter Who s the Latino staring at your father s Monet At the end of the book Gus and Cunanan meet again and Gus dies It s a loopy little fantasy belonging in the same genre as Dunne s classically overworked meditations on the Menendez case in Vanity Fair For example If Jose did stick needles and tacks into his son s thighs and buttocks didn t Erik bleed Didn t Erik have scabs on his rear and thighs I tried sticking a thumbtack into my buttocks and I bled I got a kick out of Another City Not My Own I devoured it in the proverbial single sitting But the book is ultimately compromised and rendered stupid by the obliviousness of the author Dunne had the best seat at one of the great comic cultural cataclysms of recent years and he produced a weak chatty book rather than a good vicious one He relishes a few absurdities as they glide past the accidental meeting of Nancy Reagan and Heidi Fleiss in a hotel lobby or the sight of African American servants wincing in the background as beautiful white people call O J the scum of the earth He writes this nifty dialogue for Anne Douglas Kirk s wife and Barbara Sinatra I suppose everyone has said the N word at some time or other said Anne Douglas Frank said it this morning said Barbara Sinatra Dunne s own rage at the black man however goes unexamined Ultimately his frothing is indistinguishable from the others That Dunne s own daughter was killed by a man who later went free is not a sufficient distinction victimhood does not confer rectitude In his own life and in the larger spectacle Dunne flubs the bigger ironic notes Take this exemplary passage from a Vanity Fair piece Sometimes you have to separate yourself from the trial and go back to real life I left court 15 minutes early on July 11 so that I could get to Eva Gabor s funeral on time Does Dunne mean to make himself ridiculous or is his sense of real life so far gone You re never sure I m afraid that regular attendance at the funerals of Gabors is this man s idea of keeping it real So Another City is a borderline case It is a shoddy daffy piece of work but it provides four or five fine vignettes of Hollywood bedlam in the 1990s Fortunately there is another novel that renders Dunne s quite superfluous Gary Indiana s Resentment published earlier this year by Doubleday It is for the most part a novelization of the Menendez case but the O J nonsense shadows it and the whole incompetent O J prosecution team seems to have been flown in for a last ditch battle with the forces of billable evil Indiana has composed not just an autopsy of Los Angeles trial spectacles but also a satire before the fact of Dunne s novel possibly the first such pre emptive strike in literary history Resentment is narrated like Another City by a grumpy writer who lives at the Chateau Marmont hotel at the same time Dunne himself appears as a character as a columnist novelist named Fawbus Kennedy who is variously called the kind of nothing this culture has been moving toward for decades a third rate middlebrow Depends ad and a pompous mediocrity of a type unprecedented and decidedly unwelcome in this kind of grave proceeding The diatribe goes on and on and on and it s funny precisely because it won t let up As Dunne makes nice with the truly rich and famous compliments the likes of Elizabeth Taylor and Nancy Reagan and Steven Spielberg Indiana holds nothing back burns all bridges settles scores with those who have merely irritated him from afar Indiana an on and off novelist playwright and a longtime writer for the Village Voice has accomplished more than the obliteration of Dominick Dunne Resentment also sends up urban gay novels and unravels the tangle of reality and fantasy surrounding child abuse But it s the precision of his take on high minded gutter journalism that makes Resentment the one post O J book likely to survive the remainderer s abattoir Indiana manages simultaneously to reproduce and cut to pieces the bad faith and false consciousness surrounding these trials He serves up in full the swiftly rotting texture of the way every observer is drawn into the general inanity and loses face in the act of Click on the underlined phrases for samples of Indiana s vicious analysis Dominick Dunne in his book tries to find the meaning of events in relation to his own life and can end only with a scene of queasily erotic murder suicide Indiana finishes with a general shudder a random Los Angeles earthquake a shallow focus event unaccompanied by volcanic activity My God someone has finally summed up the whole shebang
