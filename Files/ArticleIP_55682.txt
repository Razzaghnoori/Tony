 Touched Angels In his raucous vaudevillian allegory Dogma Kevin Smith concocts a scenario in which the will of God comes apocalyptically into conflict with Catholic doctrine To wholly relate how that happens the plot involves a missionary New Jersey cardinal George Carlin the devil and two fallen somewhat insane angels Matt Damon and Ben Affleck would not only ruin the surprise it would ruin this review since there are nearly as many convolutions in the narrative as there are in Scripture I first wrote about Dogma and Smith s edgy press conference when the movie had its American premiere in October at the New York Film Festival amid demonstrations by the Catholic League and other groups Click to read that account Then I ll tell you a few things that I wish I d said regret saying and might have said better Some additional hosannas first The angels wings are cool They look like genuine flesh blood and cartilage especially when they re clipped and they literally add texture to effects that might have seemed well featherweight Dogma is the first time that Smith whose clunky direction in Chasing Amy 1997 did his skillful script no favors seems interested in moving the camera composing the frame editing etc The mixture of slacker small talk goofy slapstick and Grand Guignol horror works better than anyone could have imagined What holds it all together is the writer director s fervid conviction A hint of cynicism would have turned Dogma into camp but the movie in spite of its rubber poop monsters and splattery gore and smutty jokes has the resonance of belief On reflection however I think that Smith was being a tad disingenuous when he said at his press conference that he wasn t expecting an angry reaction Yes he s a good Catholic boy but he s also schooled in the works of that very bad Catholic boy John Waters Yes he wanted to affirm his reverence for God and Jesus but he also wanted to give a hot foot to the Catholic Church Like a lot of good comics he wanted to be outrageous but he didn t necessarily want to outrage He was truly shocked when homicidally anti Semitic letters poured into the offices of Harvey and Bob Weinstein of Miramax Its parent company Disney ultimately decided not to distribute the film And he s legitimately terrified of death threats who wouldn t be He wanted people to talk and laugh and argue about his movie but he had no intention of courting martyrdom Let s go further and admit that Smith is not merely kicking the tires of his faith he s slashing them He s saying that organized religion needs a better tread He s blaming the indifferent status of a lot of Catholics on the church itself His churchgoing heroine Bethany played by Linda Fiorentino has become so desensitized to Vatican teachings that she works in an abortion clinic Smith has written a character the 13 th apostle played by Chris Rock whose view of organized religion is akin to Gov Jesse Ventura s He believes it has lost touch with the fundamental religious impulse In the film there is no counterweight to Rock s apostle no substantial or sane character who speaks on the rightness of Catholic dogma There isn t even a Dostoevskian Grand Inquisitor to tell us why humans need so many rules and regulations to keep from following their animal natures into despair and anarchy The tone of Dogma might be searching but Smith already has his answers Unlike Martin Scorsese whose solemn 1988 adaptation of Nikos Kazantzakis The Last Temptation of Christ set off a similar firestorm Smith has earned the wrath He should just say I meant to piss you off just don t start any pogroms or shoot me There s another aspect of Dogma that rattles peoples cages Most millennial apocalypse fantasies have been promulgated by the religious right which wants to frighten people into repenting their liberal attitudes toward the Scripture Outside of weird fringe pictures such as Larry Cohen s God Told Me To 1977 Dogma is the first truly countercultural apocalypse fantasy Smith is fighting the end of the world mavens on their own turf appropriating their rhetoric and their symbols for his own decidedly less Moral Majoritarian ends You can imagine the doomsayers storming out of theaters and fuming Whose Armageddon is it anyway The camera is at eye level for Rosetta In the tumultuous opening it hurtles down a staircase behind the teen age title character Emilie Dequenne as she tries to elude the factory boss who has just fired her It swerves left then right as she pulls on locked doors in a vain attempt to evade the plant s security It s sickeningly in the thick of things as she claws at her pursuers and shrieks that it s unfair she s a good worker she doesn t deserve to be let go Throughout this terse entertaining parable it won the grand prize at this year s Cannes Film Festival the Belgian born writer directors Luc and Jean Pierre Dardenne La Promesse 1996 immerse you in the sensations of Rosetta s life her daily roundabout slog through the woods to reach the trailer park where she lives with her alcoholic mother she s too ashamed to go through the front entrance her frustrating treks to find employment however menial and most of all her countless rages at a society that refuses to grant her a normal her word existence By confining the movie s perspective to Rosetta and her rituals the Dardennes suggest the ways in which people lose the big picture and so have no insight into their own corruption All they know is what they need and what will happen if someone else beats them out In Dequenne the filmmakers have found a somewhat lumpen girl with just a trace of prettiness especially when she opens her eyes and lets the world see in She mostly doesn t though which is the point She tromps around dull eyed in a gray skirt and thick mustard colored stockings a sullen bottom feeder When a generous friend Riquet Fabrizio Rongione the only one she has ever had the film implies falls into quicksand and screams for help you can see Rosetta s thought processes If he dies his job will open up she ll get it and she ll be normal As in the La Promesse the point is to show how capitalism is fundamentally at odds with human decency People are good but they re driven to victimize others by the fear that what they have will be taken away At best they turn into machines at worst most of the bosses they become casual exploiters You can t land a job without being raked by the angry gaze of the person you ve unfairly replaced and once you have it there are no guarantees that tomorrow you won t be raking someone else with your own angry gaze Change the way things work and you will change mankind is the implicit message although it s crucial to add that there are no explicit messages no Brechtian Marxist exhortations Both Rosetta and La Promesse end at the point when their protagonist s consciousness begins The next step is anyone s guess I fear I ve made Rosetta sound programmatic Well it is but the thing you come away with isn t the program but the rhythm and texture of a young working class woman s life The Dardennes are peerless at staging and shooting rituals such as Rosetta s day selling waffles and beer from a truck taking an order plucking a waffle from the iron grabbing a beer from the shelf counting money making change saying thank you taking another order It s easy to dismiss films that make grandiose statements about how people ought to live but never convincingly portray how they do The utterly believable capitalist ecosystems of the Dardennes are harder to shake off Most of the good stuff in William Trevor s novel Felicia s Journey takes place behind the eyes of its central characters a young Irish girl Felicia who crosses the sea to England in a hopeful quest to find the father of her unborn child and the fat middle aged catering manager Hiditch who takes a paternal interest in the lass when it becomes clear that her young man has caddishly given her the slip The girl is a naive but her mixture of optimism and spooky prescience gives her perceptions weight and Hiditch has a subterranean existence that s constantly at odds with his pleasantries He might well be a psychopath who has preyed on and dispatched other young women Atom Egoyan the Canadian director Exotica 1994 The Sweet Hereafter 1997 who adapted and directed the book does tender morbidly evocative work As Felicia the coltish Elaine Cassidy manages to look both luminous and unformed and Bob Hoskins gives Hiditch s bland homilies so much subtext he made me think of the Paris Opera House in the Phantom of the Opera basement under basement under basement down to the dungeons Handing Felicia a cup of tea he says The goodness is in the warmth they say and I half expected maggots to swarm out of his mouth The movie doesn t come to much though Egoyan s best films have tricky textures They double and triple back on themselves in ways that play against the characters bland visages and the often sterile settings Here apart from a few choice flashbacks the action is crawlingly linear and opaque Egoyan has invented a delicious character Hiditch s celebrity French chef mom for his wife the marvelous Arsin e Khanjian and she gives the movie a jolt of energy whenever she pops up on TV screens or in Hiditch s memory But the rest is just a cat and mouse game for a rather slow witted cat and an even slower witted mouse On Quaaludes Under water
