 Background The Carbon Catabolite Repressor 4 factor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae yCCR4 regulates the expression of a number of genes involved in nonfermentative growth 1 in cell wall integrity 2 in UV sensitivity 3 and in methionine biosynthesis 4 yCCR4 is an essential component of several complexes involved in transcription A first one is the CCR4 NOT multi subunit group of proteins which comprises at least two complexes of 1 0 and 1 9 MDa The 1 0 MDa complex contains yCCR4 yPOP2 also referred to as yCAF1 and at least five yNOT1 5 proteins 5 6 7 In this complex yPOP2 independently binds to yCCR4 and yNOT1 and is absolutely required for yCCR4 to associate with the 1 0 MDa complex 6 7 In the 1 9 MDa complex yCCR4 binds to proteins such as yDBF2 a cell cycle regulated protein kinase 2 yCAF4 and yCAF16 and is essential for the interaction of both yCAF4 and yCAF16 with ySRB9 a component of the RNA polII holoenzyme 8 yCCR4 was also reported to be associated with Paf1 Cdc73 and Hpr1 in a RNA polII complex distinct from the SRBP containing holoenzyme 9 Accordingly yCCR4 contains in its central region a leucine rich repeat LRR domain 10 which was demonstrated to be necessary for yCCR4 binding to the yPOP2 5 11 yDBF2 2 yCAF4 and yCAF16 8 components of the CCR4 NOT complex Moreover its N terminus discloses two activation domains which are required for transcriptional activation 10 Hypotheses concerning yCCR4 function in yeast have been documented recently First Dlakic 12 and Hofmann et al 13 showed that the yCCR4 C terminus contains a fold related to the Mg 2 dependent endonuclease core suggesting that it may function as a nuclease Second yCCR4 was shown to be a component in association with yPOP2 of the major yeast cytoplasmic mRNA deadenylase complex and to be required for efficient poly A specific mRNA degradation 14 15 yCCR4 might be a catalytic subunit of this complex because of its nuclease like domain Hence yCCR4 associated complexes are likely to fulfill fundamental functions in gene regulation and it is therefore of general interest to determine if similar complexes exist in mammals Several components of the yCCR4 associated complexes have already been identified in humans two homologs of yPOP2 named hCAF1 and hPOP2 hCALIF 16 17 18 19 and homologs of NOT proteins named hNOT1 hNOT2 hNOT3 hNOT4 19 Moreover interactions between these proteins were demonstrated 19 20 Yet at the present time there has been no report of a human protein that would be structurally and functionally close to yCCR4 We 21 and others 22 previously characterized genes for highly related proteins in X laevis M musculus and H sapiens named nocturnin mCCR4 and hCCR4 disclosing circadian expression 22 and with C terminus displaying significant similarity with the C terminus of yCCR4 close to 30 Yet these proteins lack the N terminal region of yCCR4 i e aa 1 to 505 which contains the two activation domains and the leucine rich repeat region necessary for protein protein interactions To identify orthologs of yCCR4 in higher eukaryotes and unravel the phylogenetical relationships between yCCR4 and the previously identified genes we made a systematic search for other proteins related to yCCR4 Here we report the identification of nineteen yCCR4 like proteins in eukaryotes and show by phylogenetic and genomic analyses that they are grouped into four distinct families one of which contains the yCCR4 orthologs these orthologs in animals have conserved the yCCR4 leucine rich repeat and we show using two hybrid assays and far Western experiments that the human protein binds to the human yPOP2 homologs i e hCAF1 and hPOP2 in a LRR dependent manner Amino acid alignments show that the endonuclease like catalytic motifs of the yCCR4 C terminal domain are strictly conserved among all yCCR4 related proteins and identify CCR4 specific residues in this domain The results therefore strongly suggest the existence of a conserved CCR4 NOT complex in human cells and of a new family of potential deadenylases in mammals Results Characterization and phylogeny of yCCR4 related proteins Sorting out of yCCR4 related proteins was performed by i searches in databases using the yCCR4 C terminal domain aa 505 837 conserved in the three previously identified yCCR4 like proteins 21 22 and ii PCR amplification of cDNA libraries or reverse transcribed RNAs using appropriate primers followed by sequencing when required Table 1 The majority of matching hits obtained through BLAST search in eukaryotic databases belongs to Arabidopsis thaliana plants Saccharomyces cerevisiae fungi and Caenorhabditis elegans Drosophila melanogaster Mus musculus and Homo sapiens animals metazoa as expected from the abundance of these sequences in present day databases Sequences obtained from bacteria databases were not included in the phylogenetic analysis because of their poor lod score but were considered in subsequent analyses After compilation of the positive hits and for several of them PCR amplification of the corresponding cDNAs and sequencing the open reading frame of each of the 19 matching proteins was determined Fig 1B Table 1 A comparative analysis of the full length sequence of all yCCR4 related proteins indicates that they all share as expected from the search strategy a highly conserved yCCR4 related C terminus hatched box in Fig 1B but conversely their N terminal regions are highly divergent except for the LRR containing group of proteins see below A multiple sequence alignment performed with the C terminal regions see Fig 2 allowed the establishment of phylogenetic relationships among all proteins see Material and Methods As illustrated in Fig 1A the tree constructed using the neighbor joining method similar results were obtained using the parsimony method not shown indeed shows that the proteins can be classified into four major groups with significant bootstrap values which can therefore be considered as distinct protein families The formerly identified mCCR4 hCCR4 21 and nocturnin 22 proteins are grouped within the same family called hereafter the nocturnin family with the mCCR4 and hCCR4 proteins re named m nocturnin and h nocturnin and the xenopus nocturnin protein xe nocturnin BLAST searches identified a putative drosophila ortholog from genomic scaffold AE003635 PCR amplification of cDNA drosophila libraries using primers indicated in Fig 1C designed from the predicted open reading frame allowed us to provide the entire coding sequence of this gene named d nocturnin assigned GenBank accession number AY043266 Table 1 Human murine drosophila and xenopus nocturnin proteins display significant levels of similarity in their C terminal region 50 95 among themselves and 24 27 with the yCCR4 C terminus Fig 1B but not in their N terminal part No ortholog of the nocturnin genes could be found in the C elegans genome although completely sequenced thus strongly suggesting that there is no such gene in this species Besides proteins from animals two yeast predicted proteins yml118 and ymr285 Table 1 with significant similarity with the yCCR4 C terminus 23 and 24 respectively also falled within the nocturnin family Finally two arabidopsis predicted proteins Atlg31500 and Atlg31530 were found to be close to the nocturnin family members not shown but lacked the most 5 part of the C terminal region and were therefore excluded The second family hereafter named the 3635 family contains as yet unknown proteins from C elegans D melanogaster and H sapiens Table 1 The caenorhabditis protein ce3635 corresponds to the CAB07271 predicted protein The drosophila protein d3635 corresponds to a putative protein that we predicted from genomic scaffold AE003635 nt 118477 to 120285 see Additional File 1 The human protein h3635 was predicted from the human genomic sequence AC016923 the human ESTs AI369813 AW967801 AW968624 AW965496 H06019 and by comparison with the murine EST BE634658 for determination of the putative initiation codon see Additional File 2 It should be noted that although some mouse ESTs do match in BLAST searches suggesting the existence of a murine 3635 protein its C terminal region could not be predicted in its entirety because of the lack of corresponding overlapping ESTs or genomic sequences Again 3635 proteins display a conserved C terminal region 32 41 similarity among themselves and 25 29 similarity with the yCCR4 C terminus but differ in their N terminal region The third family of yCCR4 related proteins called hereafter the angel family contains the formerly identified angel drosophila gene product with as yet no identified function 26 accession number X85743 as well as M musculus H sapiens C elegans and A thaliana proteins Table 1 The murine protein m angel was determined from the assembly of several murine overlapping matching ESTs AI151868 BF318959 AB041602 AA647420 see Additional File 3 The human protein h angel was predicted from a human full length cDNA accession number AL079275 and the corresponding genomic sequence accession number AC025707 see Additional File 4 The caenorhabditis protein ce angel derives from the AAC17686 putative protein predicted from cosmid AF067946 with a modification for a misassignment of a 3 exon see Additional File 5 The arabidopsis protein ara3g18500 corresponds to the At3g18500 predicted protein Once more the human murine drosophila caenorhabditis and arabidopsis angel proteins have a highly conserved C terminal region 33 88 similarity among themselves and 25 33 similarity with the yCCR4 C terminus but differ in their N terminus The fourth family hereafter named the CCR4 family contains the formerly identified yeast CCR4 protein and as yet undefined human murine drosophila caenorhabditis and arabidopsis proteins The human protein named hCCR4 is putatively encoded by the KIAA1194 full length cDNA 27 accession number AB033020 The cDNA encoding the murine protein named mCCR4 was isolated by us using RT PCR and primers derived from matching EST clones and its open reading frame was entirely sequenced assigned GenBank accession number AY043269 Table 1 Aside their C terminal regions which display the highest similarity with the yCCR4 C terminus 35 41 the N terminus of the human and murine proteins display a leucine rich repeat LRR region very similar to that of the yeast CCR4 Fig 3and see below The drosophila and caenorhabditis proteins were characterized from matching genomic clones accession number AE003746 and Z68753 respectively in which we identified a similar LRR domain 20 kb and 4 kb respectively upstream of the exons for the yCCR4 like C terminus PCR and sequencing using cDNA libraries and primers that mapped upstream of the LRRs and in the C terminal region primers indicated in Fig 1C demonstrated that the caenorhabditis and drosophila putative proteins hereafter named ceCCR4 and dCCR4 with assigned GenBank accession numbers AY043268 and AY043267 respectively Table 1 also possess in their N terminal region a LRR motif related to that of the yCCR4 protein Fig 1Band 3 Alignment of the leucine rich repeats Fig 3 of the human murine drosophila caenorhabditis and yeast proteins disclosed high conservation of the residues previously shown to define the 23 amino acid long LRRs including those of yCCR4 and of the adenylyl cyclase PxxaxxaxxLxxLxLsxNxaxxa 28 thus suggesting that the function of this motif has been conserved from yeast to mammals Besides proteins from animals two arabidopsis predicted proteins ara3g58580 and ara3g58560 Table 1 also branch with significative bootstrap values with the CCR4 family proteins Interestingly although their C terminal regions display significant similarity with the yCCR4 C terminus 37 none of these two proteins possesses a LRR domain see Fig 1Band Discussion Finally it should be noted that the proteins of the CCR4 family are all significantly smaller than the yeast member all of them lacking the two activation domains aa 1 to 350 located in the yCCR4 N terminal region see Discussion Finally BLAST searches identified a S cerevisiae putative protein yo1042 accession number NP_014600 and an A thaliana predicted protein ara1g02270 accession number At1g02270 which disclose similarity with the C terminal part of the yCCR4 protein 29 and 25 respectively but which do not cluster in an unambiguous manner with any protein from the four families Fig 1A It should be noted that all the A thaliana S cerevisiae D melanogaster C elegans and H sapiens genes disclosing similarities with yCCR4 have most probably been identified since the genomes of these five species have now been entirely sequenced and since a BLAST search using the N terminal instead of the C terminal sequence of yCCR4 aa 1 350 did not reveal any significant similarity with any other protein from the databases Genomic organization of the yCCR4 related gene families Phylogenetic relationships between the yCCR4 related proteins was also analysed through the characterization of the genomic organization of the corresponding genes Fig 1C The intron exon boundaries were determined upon alignment of the coding regions of cDNA sequences with the corresponding genomic sequences available in genomic databases Table 1 For all families the genomic organization of several members of the family could be compared In all cases the human locus was significantly longer than the drosophila and or caenorhabditis locus as a result of an increase in intron number and or size The four families do not behave similarly when considering the evolution of the number of exons at least for the animal genes In the CCR4 angel and 3635 families the drosophila genes contain 5 1 and 1 exons respectively whereas the human genes contain 11 8 and 3 exons consistent with a gain of introns in evolution Conversely a loss of intron can be suspected for the nocturnin family for which the drosophila and mammalian genes disclose 6 and 3 exons respectively In all families yeast genes are devoid of intron and arabidopsis genes display the most exons Although the number of exons is clearly not constant within a given family intron positions are in several cases conserved except for the 3635 family and for arabidopsis genes which do not share any intron position with their family members see Fig 1C In the CCR4 family 4 4 introns of the drosophila gene and 3 7 introns of the caenorhabditis gene have positions homologous to those of the human gene In the nocturnin and angel family the drosophila and human genes share one intron position Conversely paralogous genes in a given species i e genes belonging to different families do not have any intron position in common These features suggest at least for the nocturnin CCR4 and angel families that proteins which cluster in the same family indeed share a common ancestor in agreement with the phylogenetic data They also strongly suggest that introns were independently acquired in the four families This could be easily accounted for assuming that the four families were derived by gene duplication from an ancestral gene or genes devoid of intron at the time of duplication Conservation among the yCCR4 related proteins of a Mg 2 dependent endonuclease like domain with CCR4 specific residues Dlakic 12 and Hofmann et al 13 recently reported that the xe nocturnin and yCCR4 proteins contain a domain with similarities with the enzymatic core of Mg 2 dependent endonucleases Therefore we investigated whether such sequence similarities also exist for the other yCCR4 related proteins with possibly conserved features specific for these proteins The multiple sequence alignment of all yCCR4 related C terminal regions Fig 2 allowed the identification of several blocks of local homology with more than 60 similarity among yCCR4 related proteins as well as residues strictly conserved among these proteins see below This alignment could be extended to the enzymatic core of three characteristic Mg 2 dependent endonucleases the bovine DNAseI 29 and two apurinic apyrimidinic AP DNA repair endonucleases i e the E coli Exonuclease III 30 and the human HAP1 protein 31 These nucleases share the same catalytic residues and form a similar four layered sandwich motif Interestingly the blocks of homology defined for the yCCR4 related proteins all correspond to secondary structure elements strand or helix which form the core of AP endonucleases Fig 2 In addition the putative active residues shared by both AP endonucleases and DNAseI 29 30 31 32 are strictly conserved in all the yCCR4 related proteins these are residues involved in catalysis indicated by triangles in Fig 2 Mg 2 binding indicated by black circles orientation or stabilization of catalytic residues indicated by squares or interaction with the phosphate group indicated by empty circles Hence all the yCCR4 related proteins possess as observed for yCCR4 a C terminal Mg 2 dependent endonuclease like domain Alignment of the yCCR4 related proteins with the Mg 2 dependent endonucleases discloses another important feature several residues Leu 151 Arg 174 and Glu 300 indicated with an asterisk in Fig 2 can be identified which are strictly invariant among all the yCCR4 related proteins but have no equivalent in the presently aligned AP endonucleases and DNAseI or in other Mg 2 dependent endonuclease fold containing proteins previously described not shown 12 13 These CCR4 specific amino acids are most probably relevant to functions common to and specific for all yCCR4 related proteins see Discussion Interaction of the human homolog of yCCR4 with hCAF1 and hPOP2 CALIF The search for yCCR4 related proteins identifies possible orthologs of yCCR4 according to the sequence analyses reported above To confirm these data and gain some hints for the existence of a CCR4 NOT complex in mammals we investigated whether the interaction between yCCR4 and yPOP2 in the CCR4 NOT complex is conserved for the human ortholog hCCR4 Two homologs of yPOP2 have been identified in mammals the mouse human CAF1 11 16 17 33 and more recently the human homolog named hPOP2 or hCALIF 18 19 Both mCAF1 11 and hPOP2 19 interact with yCCR4 and the yCCR4 LRR is essential for these interactions To determine whether yCCR4 yPOP2 interactions are evolutionarily conserved we examined whether hCCR4 can bind hCAF1 and hPOP2 in a two hybrid assay in mammalian cells The complete hCCR4 cDNA was obtained KIAA1194 cDNA Kazusa DNA Research Institute and vectors were constructed to express hCCR4 fused to the DNA binding domain of the yeast GAL4 transcription factor pGal4 hCCR4 Fig 4A A vector expressing hCAF1 pVP16 hCAFl or hPOP2 pVP16 hPOP2 fused to the VP16 activation domain was also produced Fig 4A Two hybrid protein protein interaction assays were performed in Hela cells with a reporter plasmid pG4 TK Luc containing six GAL4 binding elements upstream of the thymidine kinase TK promoter region fused to the luciferase reporter gene Fig 4A In Hela cells transfected with the fusion constructs and the reporter plasmid an interaction between GAL4 and VP16 fusion proteins should result in an increase in luciferase expression Fig 4A As observed in Fig 4B co expression of pGal4 hCCR4 with either pVP16 hCAF1 or pVP16 hPOP2 elicited a significant increase 35 fold in pG4 TK Luc expression thus demonstrating association between hCCR4 and either hCAF1 or hPOP2 This increase is dependent on the presence of the leucine rich repeats within hCCR4 since deletion of four out of the five leucine rich repeats within pGal4 hCCR4 LRR see Materials and Methods completely abolished the effect Fig 4 Finally a GAL4 fusion vector expressing a murine paralog of hCCR4 i e m nocturnin had no effect when co expressed with either pVP16 hCAF1 or pVP16 hPOP2 Fig 4 thus indicating that m nocturnin does not interact with hCAF1 or hPOP2 as expected from the absence of an LRR domain in this protein As a control pGal4 hCCR4 alone or in association with the pVP16 none plasmid had no effect To verify that hCCR4 can bind directly to hCAF1 we performed a far Western blot analysis Fig 5 Bacterially produced purified GST CAF1 and control GST proteins were subjected to SDS PAGE transferred onto a membrane and probed with a 35S methionine labeled hCCR4 protein synthesized in vitro As shown in Fig 5 specific hybridization was observed only with GST CAF1 and not with GST As a control incubation with a 35S methionine labeled luciferase protein failed to show any interaction Discussion Identification of LRR containing orthologs of yCCR4 In the course of our search for genes encoding proteins displaying significant similarity with the yeast yCCR4 factor the best hits were found for cDNAs encoding a family of proteins from C elegans D melanogaster M musculus and H sapiens that we further characterized by both in silico and in vivo approaches By several criteria these proteins appear to be yCCR4 orthologs First they cluster together with yCCR4 in a phylogenetic tree constructed for the yCCR4 related proteins Likewise analysis of their genomic organization revealed that the caenorhabditis drosophila and human CCR4 genes had several introns in common located at homologous positions suggesting that they arose from a common ancestor Second their N terminus contain a five leucine rich repeat domain disclosing a high level of similarity with that of yCCR4 and with strictly conserved amino acids at consensus positions Third the ability of yCCR4 to bind mCAF1 and hPOP2 is conserved for the mammalian protein since we could demonstrate using two hybrid assays and far Western blot analyses an in vivo and in vitro interaction between hCCR4 and hCAF1 or hPOP2 CALIF Moreover we could show using a deletion within the leucine rich repeat domain that this motif is essential for the interaction a key feature of the previously characterized yCCR4 factor Interestingly the putative hCCR4 mCCR4 dCCR4 and ceCCR4 proteins are much smaller than yCCR4 In fact they contain the central LRR plus C terminal region of yCCR4 but they lack its N terminus residues 1 350 It is noteworthy that in yCCR4 these two parts of the protein 1 350 and 350 837 have well defined and distinct functions which can be uncoupled The N terminal region contains two transactivation domains one of which is glucose repressed residues 1 160 This region can by itself activate transcription when targeted to the DNA via a heterologous DNA binding domain 5 On the other hand the LRR plus C terminal region of yCCR4 cannot mediate transcription activation but is involved in protein protein interactions 5 The yCCR4 LRR is necessary for the binding of several components of the CCR4 NOT complex including yPOP2 and mCAF1 11 yDBF2 2 yCAF4 and yCAF16 8 and deletion of the yCCR4 N terminus does not impair these associations Consistently the region encompassing the LRR and part of the C terminus residues 302 668 has been defined as the smallest region necessary and sufficient for the association of yCCR4 with yPOP2 11 Conservation of the yCCR4 LRR plus C terminus together with the absence of its N terminus in the CCR4 proteins of animals could be interpreted along two lines First the N terminal domain might mediate yeast specific functions e g glucose regulated growth not conserved in animals because they were unnecessary or redundant in these species Second the N and C terminal domains observed in the yCCR4 multifunctional protein might have been split into two or more independent proteins in animals If neither interpretation can as yet be favoured it is noteworthy that yCCR4 evolution parallels that of its partner in the CCR4 NOT complex namely yPOP2 Indeed both human homologs of yPOP2 hCAF1 and hPOP2 lack the 148 N terminal amino acids which are in yPOP2 required for transcriptional activation whereas the yPOP2 C terminus which is involved in the interaction with yCCR4 is conserved in hCAF1 11 and hPOP2 19 Similarly hNOT2 the human homolog of the yNOT2 component of the CCR4 NOT complex harbors a N terminal domain divergent from that of yNOT2 required for transcriptional activation and interaction with the yeast ADA2 factor but has conserved the C terminal domain which is absolutely required for the yCCR4 associated function of yNOT2 19 20 Therefore it looks as if genes of the CCR4 NOT complex have undergone a concerted phylogenetic evolution with the yeast genes encoding multifunctional proteins and the animal genes only encoding specialized proteins specific for the CCR4 NOT complex It is tempting to speculate that partition of the CCR4 or POP2 functions in the course of evolution has been positively selected as resulting in a gain of efficacy Along this line Draper et al 5 observed that the two transactivation domains present in the yCCR4 N terminus residues 1 to 350 are alone more potent activators than within the full length yCCR4 protein Likewise mCAF1 which has lost the N terminal transactivation domain of yPOP2 binds to yCCR4 with a higher affinity than yPOP2 11 In yeast yCCR4 is one of the components of the 1 0 MDa CCR4 NOT complex which also includes yPOP2 and at least five yNOT proteins In this complex yPOP2 independently binds to yCCR4 and to yNOT1 A previous report 19 identified the human orthologs of yPOP2 hPOP2 CALIF and yNOT1 hNOT1 and showed that they have conserved their ability to bind to each other Hence the present identification of the human ortholog of yCCR4 and the demonstration that it binds to hPOP2 now provide an additionnal piece of the puzzle strongly suggesting the existence of a CCR4 NOT complex in humans Additionally yCCR4 interacts via its LRR domain with three other proteins i e yDBF2 yCAF4 and yCAF16 of the 1 9 MDa CCR4 NOT complex Conservation of the LRR domain in hCCR4 suggests that the interaction with these proteins might be conserved as well in humans Interestingly we found that hCCR4 also binds to the second human yPOP2 paralog hCAF1 However at variance with hPOP2 hCAF1 is not able to interact with hNOT1 nor with hNOT3 19 This suggests that human cells may contain at least two complexes involving a CCR4 POP2 association a CCR4 NOT POP2 complex analogous to the CCR4 NOT yeast complex and a still unknown CCR4 CAF1 containing complex Interestingly in yeast only one CCR4 POP2 complex has been described until now whereas CCR4 POP2 interactions have been found associated with both transcription regulation and mRNA deadenylase activity This may suggest a physical partition of these two CCR4 POP2 associated functions in the course of evolution Four families of yCCR4 related genes function and origin Recently Dlakic 12 and Hofmann et al 13 showed that the yCCR4 C terminus contains a fold related to the Mg 2 dependent endonuclease core yCCR4 was also shown to be a component of the major yeast cytoplasmic mRNA deadenylase complex and to be required for efficient poly A specific mRNA degradation 14 15 Interestingly this yCCR4 dependent activity copurifies with yPOP2 Since the presently characterized mammalian yCCR4 ortholog has conserved the ability to bind yPOP2 homologs and displays high sequence similarities with yCCR4 in the nuclease core domain it suggests that the mammalian yCCR4 orthologs might also be associated with a deadenylase function The three other characterized families of yCCR4 related proteins have also conserved catalytic residues and structural elements of the Mg 2 dependent nuclease core In addition their nuclease regions possess residues which are strictly invariant among all the yCCR4 related proteins from plants to humans and which are not conserved in any other Mg 2 dependent endonuclease containing protein thus strenghtening the notion of a common and specific function for the yCCR4 related proteins Hence according to the present data proteins of the angel 3635 or nocturnin families may deserve the same putative function as yCCR4 i e deadenylation or at least share common substrate binding and or catalytic specificities for instance preference for RNA and or poly A tail Along this line CCR4 specific conserved residues may be important for the setting of such a specificity whereas the presence or not of a LRR domain may determine different associations for these proteins possibly responsible for differences in cellular localization or in enzymatic activity Until now the only known deadenylase in vertebrates is a poly A specific exoribonuclease PARN a member of the RNaseD family of exonucleases 34 The present results therefore propose a series of new putative mammalian deadenylases and predict a set of residues that should be functionally important for all yCCR4 related proteins Finally the high level of similarity among the C terminal regions of all paralogous yCCR4 related proteins along with the divergence of their N terminal domains is intriguing in terms of phylogenetic evolution The C terminus strong conservation leads to the assumption that all the related genes derive by duplication events from a common ancestor but the identity of this ancestral gene and the date of expansion can only be hypothesized Occurrence within the CCR4 family of LRR containing genes both in yeast and animals suggests that a LRR containing gene existed before the divergence of yeast and animals Whether such a LRR containing gene could be the common ancestor for all the yCCR4 related genes with deletion of the LRR and several duplication events for the angel 3635 and nocturnin families is not known However the fact that the two arabidopsis proteins which cluster with the LRR containing proteins in the CCR4 branch Fig 1A do not possess a LRR domain is not in favour of the existence of a LRR containing ancestor in that case at least two independent LRR deletion events versus one LRR acquisition event see below would be required to generate the angel 3635 and nocturnin families on the one hand and the CCR4 arabidopsis proteins on the other hand Along this line BLAST searches in bacteria databases disclosed in one incompletely sequenced bacterial genome Paenibacillus azotofixans an open reading frame nt 3822 to 4583 in the AJ299453 genomic clone which contains almost all and displays significant similarity with the yCCR4 C terminal region but does not contain a LRR nor a N terminal domain It is therefore plausible that a C terminal core domain existed first which was subsequently duplicated several times giving rise to the four identified protein families and which has been well conserved because it deserved a common enzymatic function at the opposite of the N terminal divergent regions A LRR domain would have been acquired in one of the duplicates prior to the divergence of animals and fungi Conclusions The present characterization in higher eukaryotes of proteins related to the yeast yCCR4 factor leads to two main conclusions Firstly we identified yCCR4 mammalian orthologs and demonstrated that the human member can interact with the human yPOP2 homologs This result along with the identification by others of human homologs of NOT proteins now provides strong evidence for the existence of a human CCR4 NOT complex with conserved protein protein interactions Secondly we showed that all members of the four yCCR4 related protein families that we have characterized contain the canonical catalytic residues and motifs of the Mg 2 dependent endonuclease core as well as strictly conserved yCCR4 specific residues These proteins might constitute a new family of deadenylases in mammals for which critical residues can be predicted Materials and Methods Sequence analyses DNA and amino acid sequences were examined for homology with the non redundant nucleotide protein and dbEST databases at the NCBI using the BLAST 2 program Multiple alignments of amino acid sequences were carried out using CLUSTALW computer algorithms 23 The aligned sequences were further analysed either by the distances method Neighbor Joining program or by the parsimony method Protpars program not shown In the former case trees were constructed using different parameters i e correction or not for multiple substitutions and exclusion or not of the positions with gaps The trees obtained under these various conditions were closely related disclosing only limited variations in the branching pattern of the identified phylogenetic families Characterization of yCCR4 related cDNAs Characterization of d nocturnin and dCCR4 cDNAs was achieved by PCR using two drosophila cDNA libraries an oligo dT primed cDNA library constructed from 0 24 hour old embryos gift from C S Thummel and a 3 12 hour old embryo cDNA library gift from T Maniatis Characterization of ceCCR4 cDNA was achieved by PCR using a C elegans cDNA library gift from S Holbert The cDNA encompassing the entire mCCR4 open reading frame was cloned by reverse transcription RT PCR reaction using total RNAs extracted from CBA mouse brain For RT reactions one microgram of total RNAs was

Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase Applied Biosystem Reactions were carried out for 45 min at 42 C PCR reactions were performed using r T th DNA Polymerase Perkin Elmer with a 95 C

codon was excised from pGEX 3X upon Sma I and Dra I digestion and was inserted into the pGaL4PolyII vector opened by Bam Hl after Klenow treatment of both vector and insert Expression of the recombinant proteins was checked by in vitro transcription translation assays Promega The pVP16 hCAF1 and pVP16 hPOP2 constructs were obtained upon insertion of the hCAF1 and hPOP2 coding regions into the pSG5FNV vector in frame with the VP16 transactivation domain coding sequence as previously described 17 25 Transfections and luciferase assays The plasmids used for transfection were prepared by the alkaline PEG LiCl method HeLa cells were grown in DMEM Gibco BRL supplemented with 10 fetal calf serum seeded at 10 cells well in 96 well microtiter plates and transfected 8 hours later using Exgen 500 Euromedex Souffelweyersheim France The DNA for transfection included 100 ng of pG4 TK Luc reporter plasmid together with 50 ng of GAL4 and or VP16 fusion vectors and 10 ng of pCMV RL vector cytomegalovirus promoter fused to the renilla luciferase reporter gene Promega as an internal control for transfection efficiency The amount of SV40 promoter DNA was kept constant upon addition when necessary of pSG5 vector to the transfection mixture The cells were washed and collected 48 h after transfection Luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates using the Dual Luciferase Kit Promega following the manufacturer s instructions In all experiments luciferase activities were normalized with the renilla luciferase activity expressed from the pCMV RL vector Each set of experiments was performed in quadruplicate and was repeated at least three times Far Western analyses For in vitro protein protein interaction assays 5 g of either GST CAF1 or GST purified proteins prepared as described in 25 were subjected to 10 SDS PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane Millipore by electroblotting After denaturation in 6 M and renaturation in 0 187 M guanidine HCl
