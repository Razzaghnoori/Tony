 Post Scoops Times Droops Dear Katharine One of the uglier things I ve learned over years of close newspaper reading is how deeply competitive jealousy affects news judgment even on stories where the importance is overwhelming It s happening this week with the revelations about the workers in the federally owned bomb factory in Paducah Kentucky who were unknowingly exposed to plutonium for decades The Washington Post which I know you don t read broke this story in a front page story on Sunday forcing the secretary of energy to launch an investigation and all but admit that the government lied about this contamination for years As you might expect the plant s work force has been struck with all kinds of cancer There s a follow up Page One story in today s Post profiling a worker who died after a futile decade of trying to get the plant to acknowledge his illness Belatedly and to my mind revoltingly the United States now calls him a hero of the Cold War If I were a national news editor I would use this horror story as a chance to do a round up of everything we now know about the federal government s involvement in nuclear contamination Remind readers of the experiments done on children get a reading on the other bomb plants etc Instead most of the big national papers are giving this story a big ho hum As best I can tell the Wall Street Journal hasn t run an article at all the Los Angeles Times couldn t spare more than 200 words and the New York Times did one story yesterday with virtually no reporting in it I guarantee you that the Post will put its series by Joby Warrick up for a Pulitzer and I wouldn t be surprised if it wins The judges of course will be executives from the very papers who are now ignoring the story On an arguably brighter note there is a milestone obituary in today s New York Times for Jennifer Paterson one of the Two Fat Ladies of cooking show fame If you ve ever seen the program which debuted on the BBC in 1996 you know how bizarre it is two enormous motorcycle riding eccentrics offering some of the unhealthiest meals imaginable I m sort of a conceptual fan The show itself I find unwatchable Anyway the Times obit is written by Enid Nemy who does not normally grace the death announcement page and she notes that no less a fan than Prince Charles sent a gift of homemade organic tomato soup and vanilla ice cream to Ms Paterson after she disclosed her illness last month The story also discloses that the Food Network is planning a two hour tribute to Ms Paterson who is survived by an uncle and two brothers on Sunday night at 9 This may be the first time a specific television broadcast has been plugged in a Times obituary Sorry to be so grim this morning I lost a sizable sum of money in a poker game last night and it may be affecting my mood
