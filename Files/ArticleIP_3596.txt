 Why History Is on Clinton s Side in the Impeachment Fight After weeks of televised palaver the legal division of the Flytrap commentariat has given up In determining grounds for impeachment the Constitution just isn t much help Article II Section 4 allows for the president s removal if the Senate convicts him of treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors But how high is high Clearly high crimes was referring to serious serious crimes like treason and bribery which are examples said one legal pundit on PBS NewsHour With Jim Lehrer In other words no one really knows This leaves history as our only guide Unfortunately for scholars if fortunately for presidents Congress has undertaken impeachment proceedings against only two chief executives Andrew Johnson 1868 acquitted and Richard Nixon 1974 resigned That doesn t yield much in the way of precedent Then again the rarity of impeachment proceedings may itself be a sort of precedent If so President Clinton should relax because given what we know so far he s on pretty firm ground The first and only presidential impeachment trial Johnson s has generally been viewed as a partisan vendetta by the Radical Republicans in Congress The Radicals who favored the abolition of slavery and supported black suffrage despised Johnson for his timid plans for readmitting the South to the Union after the Civil War Johnson a Tennessee populist who thought blacks inferior to whites wanted to give Southern states wide latitude in shaping their own laws and governments regardless of the consequences for the freed slaves He vetoed key pieces of Reconstruction legislation including an 1866 bill that would have granted basic civil rights to blacks and he opposed the 14 th Amendment Political warfare ensued Although the Republicans once drew the scorn of historians they were seen as intemperate ideologues since the 1960s they ve mostly been cast as the good guys in the Reconstruction fight Changing attitudes toward race in the last generation have helped overhaul the old interpretation of Reconstruction as a bad idea gone wrong Except that is on the impeachment episode Here even the acknowledged wisdom of the Republicans Reconstruction plans hasn t changed the consensus that they acted from partisan motives The impeachment fight began when the Republicans in their tug of war with Johnson passed some dubious laws that shifted power from the president to Congress One the 1867 Tenure of Office Act prohibited presidents from firing their own Cabinet members another required that Johnson deliver all his military orders via Gen Ulysses S Grant When Johnson removed his secretary of war Edwin M Stanton on Feb 21 1868 the Radicals struck They passed 11 articles of impeachment nine relating to these two laws Two other articles accused Johnson of ignoring or disgracing Congress The Senate trial focused on Stanton s removal the most substantive charge Johnson offered a somewhat contradictory defense On the one hand his lawyers said Lincoln not Johnson had appointed Stanton and so the Tenure of Office Act didn t apply on the other hand they claimed Johnson had deliberately flouted the law to test it in the Supreme Court Still the case against Johnson was weak It was hard to construe the act of a president firing his own subordinate as a high crime Johnson was in the last year of his term anyway and when he passed word that he d stop obstructing the Republicans Reconstruction plans his survival seemed assured In the end the Radicals voted to convict while the Democrats and seven moderate Republicans voted to acquit Impeachment fell one vote short of the required two thirds of the Senate though other Republicans would have supported Johnson if necessary In resting their case on an alleged violation of the law and not on policy differences the Republicans conceded that impeachment had to amount to more than a parliamentary style vote of no confidence Before Johnson this had been an open question after him it wasn t Further the Radicals defeat suggested that successful impeachment charges against the president would have to allege substantial crimes on his part Allegations of criminal wrongdoing that essentially served to cover for political differences wouldn t be likely to topple a president even if they were technically accurate Johnson s survival combined with the passage of 100 years made impeachment by the time of Watergate seem like an altogether unlikely scenario the equivalent as historian Stanley Kutler has written of a nuclear first strike In retrospect of course Watergate has come to mean the vast tapestry of that began to unravel with the June 1972 break in of the Democratic National Committee headquarters But as late as the spring of 1973 the scope of these misdeeds including critical details about Nixon s involvement remained unclear So improbable did impeachment seem that April that Nixon s Attorney General Richard Kleindienst defied Congress to try it confident it would relent As Nixon s troubles worsened however his critics grew bold After the July 1973 disclosure that Nixon had taped his Oval Office conversations Democrat Robert Drinan of Massachusetts introduced the first impeachment resolution in the House October brought the Saturday Night Massacre in which Nixon had to fire his attorney general and deputy attorney general in order to get rid of Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox and four more impeachment bills including one introduced by a Republican After months of new disclosures including the release of transcripts of damning White House conversations the House Judiciary Committee began impeachment deliberations in earnest on May 9 1974 By July nine fence sitting members of Congress two Southern Democrats and seven Republicans were ready to endorse some form of impeachment articles The committee held its final deliberations from July 24 through July 30 July 27 it voted 27 11 to pass the first article of impeachment which focused on obstruction of justice paying hush money to the Watergate burglars using the CIA to block the FBI s Watergate investigation lying to Congress and to investigators and otherwise covering up crimes Two days later it passed a second equally devastating article by a 28 10 vote This abuse of power article charged Nixon with having the Internal Revenue Service audit his enemies spying on private citizens setting up the Plumbers unit that broke into the Watergate office building and anti war activist and Pentagon Papers author Daniel Ellsberg s psychiatrist s office and otherwise using federal agencies for personal and political advantage Finally on July 30 the committee passed a third slightly weaker article 21 17 which charged the president with having willfully disobeyed subpoenas Two other articles urging Nixon s impeachment for concealing the bombing of Cambodia and for tax evasion went down to defeat moderate Democrats wanted to play only their strongest cards That didn t matter much though Nixon knowing he was licked resigned 10 days later While Johnson s survival deterred members of Congress from considering impeachment in Watergate Nixon s ouster has had the opposite effect emboldening Clinton s foes Watergate remains for many an unhealed wound and Clinton s critics delight in needling him with Watergate comparisons whether to Whitewater or Flytrap Impeachment once taboo now seems like a legitimate weapon a way to settle the score The principle of Mutually Assured Destruction after all dictated that once nukes are launched retaliation becomes much easier Still if the relative freshness of Watergate works against Clinton the enormity of it works in his favor In effect Nixon s misdeeds so dwarf Clinton s even the most severe charges of suborning perjury that Republicans could wind up bollixed They are left either arguing preposterously that Clinton s crimes are just as bad as Nixon s or claiming that Nixon s crimes far exceeded the threshold for impeachable offenses and shouldn t be the standard for judging Clinton s In this situation Johnson s impeachment looms as the operative precedent a case of men who despised and battled their president perhaps with good reason but whose zeal in pursuing flimsy impeachment charges turned the judgment of history against them If you
