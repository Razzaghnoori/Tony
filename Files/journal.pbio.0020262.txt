                            My graduate adviser Sydney Brenner used to exclaim Revenons  nos mutants as he sat        down at the bench to search for yet more genetic variants of         C elegans  Those mutants won him a Nobel Prize some thirty        years later Armand Leroi is another aficionado of         C elegans mutants but he decided to write a bookand then to        make a television serieson mutants of humanity not of worms He says at the beginning and        end of the series We are all mutants but some of us are more mutant than others This        is a good slogan and very proper for embracing humanity as a whole He backs it up with an        aphorism from Etienne Geoffroy SaintHilaire pioneer of teratology who proclaimed There        are no monsters and Nature is one What Geoffroy meant was that abnormalities provide        clues to normal processes and hence are invaluable to science if they can be properly        understood But monsters and mutants are undeniably fascinating in their own right                Mutants  the book is excellent impressively researched and illustrated        and extremely well written The resulting television series on Channel  in the United        Kingdom has a distinctly different impact The series covers only a few of the subjects        dealt with in the book and handles the material in a different way Inevitably television        cant include much science or scholarly detail but it compensates with human images that        are wholly grippingboth the preserved specimens and the living subjects who talk about the        strange conditions that they live with Its a freak show but a freak show with thoughtful        scientific commentary        Each of the three programmes in the series has a particular theme The first The        Mystery of Growth is devoted mainly to skeletal disorders We meet Carole Ozel who copes        with extraordinary courage with a terrible disease called fibrodysplasia ossificans        progressiva FOP in which bony tissue forms throughout the body gradually immobilizing        the body in a second skeleton Later we encounter a crew of charming and articulate dwarfs        taking time out from a disco at the Reno convention of the Little People of America They        are happy to be called dwarfs or little people but midget is no longer an acceptable term        Being a dwarf in fact is sometimes a ticket to fame and fortune as in the case of Joseph        Boruwlawski last of the court dwarfs who enchanted European royalty married a beautiful        woman and lived happily to the age of         The second part The Dangerous Womb is about birth defects conjoined twins and        basic embryology The makers of the piece went to the trouble of getting the developmental        biologist Eddie de Robertis to reconstruct the classic experiment of Mangold and Spemann        that revealed the underlying basis of some of these defects The programme goes into some        detail about what is now known about the molecular basis of normal and abnormal        development and how we can begin to explain such extraordinary forms as that of the Parodi        twins who had distinct heads and shoulders but merged into a single torso and a single        pair of legs        The third programme The Meaning of Beauty deals with lesser but still striking        abnormalities such as albinism and hypertrichosis excess hair It also moves into        contentious areas in a frank discussion of race genetics Leroi makes the essential point        loudly and clearly there is much more genetic variation within any village on earth than        there is between different human populations We are extraordinarily unified from a        genetic standpoint But as he notes the idea of race persists and about  of global        genetic variation in human DNA includes AIMs ancestry informative markers Some of these        distinguish for example Africans and Europeans and provide objective information about        the ancestry of different human populations        This being television the series closes with a discussion of beauty which Leroi        proposes to be simply the absence of visible mutant defects using Saira Mohan         Newsweek s idea of human facial perfection as an exemplar Yes she        looks nice but nice can be boring Beauty above all other human attributes is profoundly        influenced by culture and it is hard to take this interpretation of beauty as an adequate        explanation rather than just a pretty way to finish the series        For the most part Leroi makes an agreeable and humane commentator though he is not        immune to the slight selfsatisfaction that seems to overcome all scientists on television        The camera also spends an excessive amount of time dwelling on him to a point where it        becomes irritating to see him walkingfrequently in slow motion into yet another museum or        laboratory Sometimes the focus on the presenter pays off as when we see the sixfoot        scientist looking like a small child beside Chris Greener the tallest man in Britain or        witness Lerois faint chagrin at discovering that his DNA is mostly European despite his        cosmopolitan family history More questionable are the bits where he paddles casually        through a tub of preserved viscera from some longgone sufferer from situs inversus        mirrorreversed organs and succumbs to laughter at the sight of Ditto the amazing        twofaced pig This may be an honest attempt at portraying the conflicted reactions we all        have to abnormality but it seems bound to cause trouble        Arty camerawork is a running feature of the programmes and there is a great deal of        smoke and mirrors about the whole production Perhaps this is deliberate reminding us that        it is hard to look directly at extreme deformity but there is an air of I wants to make        your flesh creep about the many sidelong shots of mutant babies in bottles in the Vrolik        Museum to which we return again and again throughout the series Viewing the already        distorted fetuses through further distorting camera angles and under green lighting doesnt        really achieve anything The treatment begins to resemble the first         Alien movie in which the audience was never allowed to see the monster        directly        In the end what is most memorable about these programmes is the living people        themselves and how they have coped with their various genetic disorders It is very        touching to see the home movies of Tiffany York born with mermaid syndrome or sirenomelia        in which the legs are fused together taking her first tottery steps after corrective        surgery and to listen to her talking philosophically about her life as she floats in a        Florida swimming pool It is similarly cheering to hear from the dwarfs and albinos or        from Chuy Aceves who has hypertrichosis and looks like the original Hollywood wolfman but        suffers no ill effects and is proud of his rare condition For these sections alone let        alone the serious and wellexplained scientific background the series is well worth        seeing It makes one feel surprisingly good about the human race and the human spirit
