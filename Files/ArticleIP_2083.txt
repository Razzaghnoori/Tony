 Child Abuse Threat or Menace With a new government funded study in hand Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala diagnosed a rising epidemic of child abuse last month She reported that child abuse and neglect nearly doubled in the United States between 1986 and 1993 and that was only the beginning of the ugly news The number of serious cases had quadrupled and the percentage of cases being investigated by the authorities had actually declined by 36 percent trends that she called shameful and startling Is Shalala right Is an unheeded child abuse epidemic raging in America Or as I think is more likely is the methodology behind the study and the interpretation of its numbers flawed And if Shalala overstated the child abuse peril is she undermining public interest in the problem by making it appear too big and difficult to fix at a reasonable cost A Look at the Numbers The secretary drew her statistics from the National Incidence Study of Child Abuse and Neglect which was conducted by Westat Inc a consulting firm that conducted similar studies in 1980 and 1986 In the new study about 5 600 professionals a representative sample were asked by Westat whether the children they had served appeared to have suffered specified harms or to be living under specified conditions Westat then determined if the reported harms and conditions met the study s definitions of abuse and neglect and generated estimates of incidence The odd thing about Shalala s claim that the number of children abused and neglected doubled from 1 4 million in 1986 to 2 8 million in 1993 is that no other signs point to such a dramatic increase in child abuse and neglect Fatalities arising from child abuse have held roughly steady ranging from 1 014 in 1986 to 1 216 in 1993 according to the National Committee to Prevent Child Abuse Of the 1 4 million additional cases reported almost 80 percent fall into three suspect categories Anywhere from 13 percent to 34 percent of the 2 8 million children suffered more than one type of abuse or neglect Unfortunately the study did not unduplicate these reports Nevertheless the proportions I describe below provide a general picture of what is happening Endangered children account for 55 percent of the increase These are cases where the child was not actually harmed by parental abuse or neglect but was in danger of being harmed according to the views of community professionals or child protective service agencies emphasis added See Figure 1 Emotional abuse and neglect account for another 15 percent of the increase The great majority of emotional abuse cases according to the 1986 Westat study involved verbal assaults and more than half of the emotional neglect cases involved the refusal or delay of psychological care Educational neglect the chronic failure to send a child to school added another 8 percent to the total of new cases Definitional Creep All these cases warrant attention but the explosion of numbers may be caused by the growing reportorial sensitivity of professionals that is definitional creep Professionals who become more sensitive to possible abuse or more adept at noticing it would make more reports to Westat even if the actual incidence had not risen In endangerment cases at least the study seems to accept this explanation According to Shalala the number of serious cases increased between 1986 and 1993 from about 143 000 to nearly 570 000 Her comments left the impression that the cases involved life threatening assaults but the study defines serious cases as any in which the child suffered long term impairment of physical mental or emotional capacities or required professional treatment aimed at preventing such long term impairment Emotional maltreatment accounted for fully half of the increase in serious cases See Figure 2 I n cases labeled as serious physical abuse the reported injury could be mental or emotional Even in these serious cases the study seems affected by definitional creep For example in three categories sexual abuse physical neglect and emotional neglect the number of cases described as moderate declined even as the number of serious ones increased strongly suggesting that cases once viewed as only moderately threatening have now been upgraded to the most dire category Uninvestigated Cases Shalala s assertion that investigations of child abuse and neglect cases have dropped by 36 percent deserves closer scrutiny In producing the number of uninvestigated cases the study compared the number of cases identified by professionals with those known to local agencies Of the cases not investigated 33 percent involved educational neglect See Figure 3 The main flaw here is that most educational neglect cases are handled by the schools reports are made to protective agencies only when all else fails Another 30 percent of uninvestigated cases involved emotional abuse and neglect But child protective agencies usually avoid these cases because they tend to involve subjective judgments and there is little that a quasi law enforcement agency can do about them Definitional creep is clearly at play here too Professionals who are increasingly willing to identify situations as harmful aren t necessarily ready to equate them with the sort of abuse and neglect they are legally obliged to report And even if they did report these instances child protective agencies would still be expected to screen them out Does Shalala Believe Her Own Hype Probably not Radical action would be required if Shalala s figures were even roughly correct But instead of proposing radical action when she released the report she outlined modest steps that had long been planned and budgeted Having worked in the field for 30 years I can testify firsthand that the problem of child abuse and neglect is real But however well meant exaggerating the severity of abuse endangers children In the late 80s for example the nation was told that 375 000 drug exposed babies were born each year Washington policy makers were immobilized by estimates that tens of billions of dollars were needed to protect these children In fact the true number was closer to 35 000 and a decade later the government has yet to mount a meaningful program for the children of addicts Overstatement may also obscure genuinely worrisome findings Some of the increases in sexual abuse physical abuse and physical neglect uncovered by Westat may well reflect a true deterioration of conditions in disorganized poverty stricken households But Shalala paid scant attention to this possibility And to claim recklessly that too few cases are investigated is to play with fire Child protective agencies are already overwhelmed investigating about 2 million reports a year two thirds of which are dismissed as unfounded or inappropriate For many in the field the most pressing need is to discourage inappropriate reporting not to blithely call for more Figures for specific types of maltreatment exclude endangerment cases Percentages total more than 100 because some children counted under more than one type of abuse Percentages total more than 100 because some children counted under more than one type of abuse These exclude cases of endangerment
