 The Jungle To go to Malaysia without setting foot in the jungle would be to miss an essential beauty of the country A walk in the jungle can be a rare sensual pleasure Sounds flood in from all sides the buzz and whine of crickets the chatter of squirrels the poop poop poop of hornbills the cries of gibbon apes You are likely to see everything from the deep gloom of the densest forest to the sudden brilliant burst of sun in a clearing playing endless variations on the textures and myriad shades of green in the surrounding vegetation Five Kinds of Jungle Variations in soil slope and altitude give rise to five different types of forest Mangrove forest Mangrove trees and shrubs grow on coastal marshland in the brackish zone between the sea and fresh water The dense undergrowth of their aerial prop roots perform natural land reclamation The fruit and leaves feed crabs whose waste products in turn feed fish prawns and mollusks The mangrove s distinctive companion is the low trunkless nipa palm whose curtain of fronds has traditionally provided roofing material for coastal huts Freshwater swamp Abundant fruit trees in the fertile alluvium of river plains attract prolific wildlife Peat swamp found in the southern half of the peninsula and in Sarawak on Borneo is less fertile but rich in hardwood timber Where swamp gives way to dry land you will see the fascinating monstrous strangler figs Dipterocarp forest The botanical term refers to the two winged fruit similar to the key of the common sycamore borne by a large number of the forest s tallest trees This dry land rainforest is what you will see most frequently from just above sea level up to an altitude of 900 m 3 000 ft Its wealth of trees is remarkable including the tualang found both in the northern half of the peninsula and in Sabah and Sarawak The Borneo ironwood or belian produces the world s densest hardest timber after the South African ironwood But Sabah boasts the fastest growing tree in the world an acacia like Albizzia falcataria which was clocked from germinated seed to almost 11 m over 35 ft in just 13 months Heath forest Poor soil on the flat terrain leading to foothills or on sandy mountain ridges produces only low stunted trees with thick leaves The heath forest is remarkable for its profound silence compared with the jungle s incessant din Montane forest At 1 200 m 4 000 ft and above in large mountain ranges or as low as 600 m 2 000 ft on small isolated mountains the large trees and liana creepers give way to myrtle laurel and oak trees Wild raspberries appear along with magnolias rhododendrons orchids and other epiphytes plants that grow on other plants but are not parasites since they procure their own food supply One of the most intriguing specimens of montane flora also found in the heath forest is the pitcher plant see page 125 Animal Life Unlike the wildlife of the African plain most of the animals of the Malaysian jungle are not very conspicuous Tigers and leopards remain rare Plus the elephants rhinos tigers and bears of Malaysia are the smallest of their kind Elephant There are about 1 000 elephants on the peninsula and twice that number in eastern Sabah A few have been domesticated for plantation work They are daintier beasts than their African cousins Rhinoceros Scarcely a hundred Sumatran Rhino remain the best place to see them is at the Sepilok sanctuary where controlled breeding may combat the ravages of poaching To see it in its wild or semi wild state try the Sungai Dusun Wildlife Reserve northwest of KL or in the Tabin reserve in eastern Sabah Tapir This animal is remarkable for two features its short overlapping snout that resembles the sawed off trunk of an elephant and its unique body coloring black up front white in the middle and back black rear legs It is found only on the peninsula Your best chance to see it is at the Ampang reserve near Kuala Lumpur or at Taman Negara Deer Most common are the tiny mouse deer These timid nocturnal beasts sport a brown coat speckled with white The largest Malaysian deer is the brown antlered sambar Another shy creature you might spot it at the edge of the forest or on river banks The barking deer so called because it bays like a dog when threatened by predators wears a shiny reddish brown coat Tiger The few Malaysian tigers left roaming the peninsula are the smallest of the breed weighing only 200 kg 440 lb 100 kg 220 lb less than the Indian or Chinese tiger Leopard The classic spotted yellow or black coat of the leopard may be seen not only in the jungle but also around plantations and farms The smaller clouded leopard hunts up in the trees enjoying a varied diet of monkeys baby orang utans birds and squirrels The leopard cat is not a lot bigger than a domestic cat and may nip in and out of villages Proboscis monkey Unique to Borneo the male sports the splendid pendulous nose that gives this species its name It is also the male who emits a formidable honk through its nose at times of great excitement or alarm The female s nose is an unremarkable little snub but zoologists say that she appreciates and is even aroused by the male s proboscis They can best be seen on the lower Kinabatangan river in eastern Sabah and the Bako and Samunsan nature reserves in Sarawak Orang utan In Malay orang utan means forest person an appropriate mark of respect for the mammal biologically closest to man These highly intelligent russet colored apes live in the swamp forests of Sabah and Sarawak and are best seen in eastern Sabah s Sepilok wildlife reserve They are very individualistic nomads meeting occasionally to share a fruit supper before going their own way Some visitors to Sepilok confuse them with the similarly colored red leaf monkeys but unlike monkeys orang utans have no tails
