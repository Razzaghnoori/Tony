 The United Nations Under Fire The role of the United Nations was increasingly called into question yesterday as blood continued to flow in East Timor The Sydney Morning Herald accused the United Nations Thursday of total mismanagement of the East Timor crisis The lesson of the conflicts in Somalia Rwanda and Kosovo is that problems need to be anticipated and prepared for it said in an editorial But again inertia is the name of the game and again tragedy is the outcome The paper also attacked the Australian government for failing to bring sufficient pressure on Indonesia and the Age of Melbourne published an article regretting that decades of quiet diplomacy aimed at building ties with our huge neighbor has been dissipated in just a few days In Hong Kong the South China Morning Post said that the atrocities being committed in East Timor showed the limits of the so called new international order It said Thursday in an editorial The pending evacuation of the United Nations compound in Dili only highlights the impotence of the world body in resolving this conflict Despite French support for military intervention most countries continue to oppose sending in a peacekeeping force without Indonesian approval Economic pressure is therefore the only option for the international community to pursue but even this is opposed by several countries including Australia and Britain it said Fortunately the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund seem to be made of sterner stuff In New Zealand where the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit attended by Madeleine Albright but boycotted by Indonesian President B J Habibie is going on the Press of Christchurch stressed the urgency of bringing peace to East Timor mainly because to allow the bloodshed to continue into next week would inflame public opinion against Apec It said Thursday in an editorial One of the region s smallest entities a crypto State with a tiny population and minimal resources is grabbing the headlines and the sympathies of the world sidelining the great issues of trade and commerce on Apec s agenda The Jakarta Post welcomed a resurgence of nationalism in Indonesia in response to international criticism of its ineffectual handling of the East Timor crisis But without expressing any sympathy for the plight of the East Timorese it also warned that Indonesians must realise that in this era of globalization self isolation and disregard of the accepted universal norms of international conduct can lead to political and economic devastation for the nation In Europe Le Monde of Paris agreed with the Sydney Morning Herald that the disaster in East Timor should have been foreseen and it also strongly criticized the United Nations The paper said By taking on the organization of the referendum the U N implicitly guaranteed not only the security of the voting operation but also that of the voters in the aftermath of the poll It has betrayed their trust it has abandoned them without defence The U N comes out of this affair humiliated and discredited It asked Can the U N continue for long with this impossible contradiction being the promoter of the rights of man and in East Timor of the right to self determination without giving itself the means to make them respected The answer will determine the future of the organization Among reports from East Timor the Sydney Morning Herald led its front page Friday with the murder of at least 14 Roman Catholic priests and nuns and the stabbing of the bishop of Baucau by pro Jakarta militia gangs The savage attacks are the first deliberate violations of the sanctity of the church under Indonesian rule and have robbed the East Timorese of their last refuge the paper said In London the Times ran a front page eyewitness piece by Marie Colvin from inside the U N compound in Dili about the desperation of the East Timorese who know they are about to be abandoned Last night no one slept she wrote Women walked around aimlessly crying carrying their babies on their hip Men huddled I was stopped every step women grabbing my arm men pulling me aside to say Can this be true It was a hard question to answer To say yes to admit the UN was leaving and I was probably going with them would be to start a panic To say no would be to deny them time to plan an escape The British press was dominated however by the confession of Michael Portillo a former defense secretary and one of the country s most prominent Conservatives that he had some homosexual experiences as a young person Portillo who is seeking re election to Parliament and is widely seen as an eventual contender for the party leadership said he wanted to put an end to untrue rumors about his sex life one being that he had a homosexual affair with another former Conservative minister by instead volunteering the truth He said he has had no homosexual experiences since he was at university and has been faithful to his wife for all their 17 years of marriage The press widely commended him for his honesty and the Times said in a leading article that h is frankness in discussing youthful homosexual experiences does him only credit Meanwhile the Mail on Sunday announced earlier this week that it has decided not to go ahead with the serialization of the memoirs of James Hewitt a lover of Princess Diana although it has already paid him about 500 000 and has promised him another 500 000 He is suing the paper and vice versa The paper gave no reason for ditching him except that it didn t like the manuscript which has already been leaked in other papers The true reasons for the change of heart seem to be an appeal by Diana s brother Earl Spencer and a ferocious campaign against Hewitt by the other tabloids From what we hear the book contains more about his exploits as a tank commander in the Gulf War than about his affair with the princess and it says that the most satisfying experience of his life had nothing to do with Diana but was the defeat of Saddam Hussein
