house And one of them was that one time I wanted something on top of the bed that couldn t reach and so you said my mom said to get to find a way to get it and so I don t remember what I grabbed but I grabbed something and I climbed on top of the bed and I grabbed the thing that I wanted and I think they were like surprised because they didn t think that I would actually do it Another one was when I think I was younger than that I was trying to climb up on a couch and my grandfather was like watching me behind me and he kept saying to everybody she s going to fall she s going to fall she s going to fall she fell because I did fall and everybody laughed and I think they took a picture of me when I was like climbing up the couch or whenever I was on that couch But they sort of told me
