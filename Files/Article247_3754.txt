                                 Erudition vs Sense                        Dear Alan            Oh no we agree Weve really got to stop this collaboration across thepolitical spectrum At this rate well be singing We Shall Overcome beforethis exchange is over And what happens to the culture wars when people onboth sides start laying down their arms This is terrible In addition to hisother offenses Edmund Morris is apparently the one we can blame for thisalarming development            Before I resume my trashing of Morris let me admit that Dutchcontains many passages that are beautifully written As we saw in Morrisprevious book he can be quite a sculptor with words And there are occasionalflashes of insight For instance Morris almost casually notes that Reagan wasalways happier in the Here and Now His tendency to reminisce  was not alooking back so much as an eager application of history to today and tomorrowThis is exactly right and an apt response to many of Reagans critics who haveover the years accused him of incurable nostalgia and trying to take thecountry back to the past that never was Actually Reagan could care less aboutturning back the clock He employed the imagery of the past eg pioneersproceeding West in covered wagons to construct a kind of imaginative portraitof America then he worked relentlessly to bend the future eg spaceexploration and entrepreneurship as the modern equivalent of the earlysettlers to his vision and his will            Morris admires Reagans imagination and will its Reagans intellect andcultural taste he cannot help but disdain Sample passage Like Charles Ryderin Brideshead Revisited  Reagan found himself homeless middleaged andloveless as his thirtyninth year waned Or to quote a book he was more likelyto have read there was this passage in Kings Row  Morriss bookis full of this kind of snobbery            But once again let me raise the question of who is the real sophisticateand who is the ignoramus I dont deny that Morris is a better connoisseur ofwine and literature than Reagan But when statesmanship requires that the chasmbetween ideas and action be bridged Reagans genius becomes evident and Morrisreveals himself to be well a complete idiot            For instance here is Morris criticism of Reagans famous Mr GorbachevTear Down This Wall speech drafted by speechwriter Peter Robinson and stagedbefore an enthusiastic crowd at the Brandenburg Gate After a sneering accountof Reagans remarks that entirely misses their political significance Morriswrites                           What a rhetorical opportunity missed He could have read Robert Frosts poemon the subject Something there is that doesnt love a wall to simple andshattering effect Or even Edna St Vincent Millays lines  Only now forthe first time I see This wall is actually a wall a thing Come up betweenus shutting me away From you  I do not know you any more                        Is Morris kidding us here Or has erudition drowned out all good sense Isuppose Edna Millay would be fitting in this context if Reagan were trying tostrike up a romantic relationship with Gorbachev The Frost example is evenworse Morris seems to have totally missed the point of Frosts poem whichconcludes with the observation that good fences make good neighbors WouldReagan have been better off saying Mr Gorbachev good fences make goodneighbors Thank you speechwriter Edmund Morris And now off to the insaneasylum            Alan perhaps you and some readers will consider me unduly harsh but Ithink I am being duly harsh Morris may be a wordsmith and an aesthete but heis politically incompetent to evaluate his subject a thoroughly political manAnd he has missed an opportunity that cannot be recovered Morris had a levelof continuous access to Reagan that no other writer will ever have He hasabrogated his moral responsibility to history in a manner that is close tounforgivable Which leaves the big question Who picked this guy And why            BestDinesh
