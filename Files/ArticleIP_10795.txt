headquarters and four barracks at weapons sites The international debate is over whether the attack was justified Russia and China called U N weapons inspection chief Richard Butler an American pawn and demanded his resignation but nobody seems angry enough about the attack to make a serious effort to stop it The prevailing view is that force may not achieve success in disarming Iraq but diplomacy had definitely achieved failure 12 18 98 The House began debating impeachment The chief controversy is whether the impeachment vote and the Iraq bombing should be going on simultaneously Republicans blame Clinton for bombing Iraq just when the GOP was about to begin the impeachment debate Democrats blame Republicans for beginning the impeachment debate just after Clinton began the bombing Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott is taking the brunt of editorial criticism for questioning the bombing and Clinton s motives Each party impugns the other s integrity and patriotism while calling the other party shamelessly cynical for impugning its own integrity and patriotism For a roundup of the spins see Slate s on the latest wag the dog charges 12 18 98 Israeli implementation of the Wye peace agreement is collapsing First Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu halted Israel s promised troop withdrawals from the West Bank because of Palestinian violence Then President Clinton went to Israel and the Gaza Strip supervised the Palestinians annulment of their charter language calling for Israel s destruction and urged Netanyahu to resume troop withdrawals Netanyahu refused arguing that Palestinian leaders must take further steps against terrorism and renounce their aspirations to statehood Now Netanyahu says that if Israel s parliament fails to endorse his policies by next week he will call new elections The opposition Labor Party which accuses Netanyahu of trying to kill the peace process welcomed the opportunity to get rid of him The idealistic spin Netanyahu wants the Palestinians to accept his conditions so peace can go forward The cynical spin He wants the Palestinians to reject his conditions so he can posture against them in the election 12 16 98 Gov Lawton

Pundits debated the fallout from the Clinton administration s latest lobbying and testimony before Congress The spins 1 Clinton s lies are offensive 2 The Republicans charges are excessive 3 Clinton s lawyers refuse to admit anything that could put him in legal jeopardy 4 Duh 5 The pro impeachment closing argument The rule of law is at stake 6 The anti impeachment closing argument The Constitution is at stake 7 Impeachment is excessive so vote instead for censure 8 Impeachment without conviction is censure 9 Impeachment is too serious to treat as censure 10 Impeachment is only a vote for a trial 11 A trial would be too awful because it would paralyze the government and force the Senate to delve into sexual details 12 The impeachment juggernaut is good because it has scared the White House into embracing heavy censure 13 Impeachment is good for the Democrats because it would hurt the GOP more than it would hurt Clinton 14 Clinton will persuade the GOP not to impeach him because they both care more about their own skins than about the Democrats For more on a possible escape route for Clinton see in Slate 12 14 98
