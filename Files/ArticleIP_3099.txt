 Belle Lettrism The current show at the Metropolitan Museum s Costume Institute concentrates on 20 th century garments bearing words letters and numbers in various ways There are a few word bearing accessories from earlier days garters stockings fans and gloves most with political or erotic reference but the clothes date mostly from the middle to the end of this century Nevertheless the show s punning title Wordrobe appears on the wall with the displaced a in flashing red neon above the first o Right away we re meant to think of Hester Prynne s big scarlet A imposed by the godly community which she defiantly embellished with gold thread In so doing Hester was transgressing a second time because in the 17 th century in which the novel was set and in the 19 th in which it was written wearing letters for decoration on everyday clothing was entirely unacceptable It is still disturbing or was until very recently Why is that Words letters and numbers on garments seem riskier than kittens clouds and flowers on garments just as those seem less natural than stripes plaids or checks But what exactly is profaned by putting words on clothes Is it the garment the person or the words I believe it is the writing The written word was accumulating its own sacred aura even before Homer and the Bible Ever since priests scholars and poets used writing to record Scripture prayer law and history both exalted and prosaic reverence for canonical writings has lent an august power to written words themselves And with all the weight of such a past a certain dread can still attach to the sight of them being frivolously used In the middle of this century turning words into fashion seemed like just such a use Some of the designs shown at the Met reflect a serious daring they are examples not just of amusing invention but also of rule breaking Turning the cutout letters of Emily Post s Advice to Debutantes into a debutante s dress designed by Evans and Wong 1996 or knitting the preamble to the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence into a cashmere sweater designed by Joseph Golden 1997 or even just making a dress out of random alphabet lace French late 1920s all these are ways of flaunting modern fashion s basic iconoclasm After the show I looked around the museum to see if I could find any paintings representing people with writing on their clothes I found only Christ and the Virgin and the occasional saint clad in ceremonial garments edged with golden or pearl sewn words from liturgy or Scripture but these were worn only in heaven Earthly mortals didn t seem to have the privilege Words or letters or numbers on your clothes set you apart as some sort of human object sacred like St Anthony or shameful like Hester Prynne or maybe useful like a team member There is in fact an old football jersey in this show with a big number on it But it s mainly there as a foil to an evening dress by Geoffrey Beene 1968 with a football number in glittering beading Beene has another beautiful sleek black one with a sequined traffic sign emblazoned across the chest a big shiny yellow triangle with yield in black capitals 1967 Wonderful to look at with the meaning not lost just transmuted by the sequins More stirring is a sheer bodysuit designed by Jean Paul Gaultier in 1994 that transforms the wearer into a living banknote all gray green engraved swirls and crosshatching with an occasional 100 at salient corners This stretches the theme a little since there are no words and it isn t the reproduction of a real bill But it works like so much else in the exhibition to show how practical signs can become erotic adornments on the human surface depending on texture and placement This skintight transparent garment turns its pattern into a tattoo a practice alluded to by several other items here including some skin colored Gaultier swim trunks that seem to cover the genitals with a tattoo saying Safe Sex Forever 1997 Monograms have a natural place in the wordrobe but they were not invented for clothing The rich and the noble used to put them on personal effects to imitate the ancient royal habit of stamping or embroidering or incising the king s property with his personal cipher Artisans would discreetly stamp precious creations with their own monograms in minidesigner label mode while giving elaborate prominence to the client s There are plenty of surviving cigar cases purses boxes lockets brooches penknives and all kinds of tableware with small maker monograms and large owner monograms and there are mountains of antique household linen with embroidered domestic monograms But none of these is clothing Putting monograms on display on garments is very recent I know my mother thought monogrammed blouses and bathrobes vulgar but not monogrammed bracelets or guest towels from which I gather that vivid personal monograms on clothes were new in the 30s Once everybody got used to them in the next generation it was very easy to replace them with YSL and CK and the double Gs in the following one And those have acquired a lot more prestige than our own ever had Sultan S ladin the great 12 th century Muslim opponent of the Crusaders had an ornate monogram that Mary McFadden borrowed to adorn a dignified 1993 ensemble that is on view in this show Of course it can t be read by those familiar with only Greek and Roman letters nor can all the beautiful Chinese and Japanese characters in this exhibition similarly reduced to abstract motifs by our inability to recognize what they say It does seem unfair to love them only for their looks as if we despised their minds Unlike Judaism and Christianity Islam has used script for sumptuous decoration of all kinds But the Islamic artists like those in China and Japan didn t forget that the immortal soul of the word is its sense nor that clothing since prehistory has made sense without words Arabic words appear on beautiful textiles but not on those worn as clothing Similarly Japanese calligraphy has a great artistic tradition no less great than that of Japanese watercolor painting or Japanese costume and beautifully brushed poems may appear next to watercolor images similar to those that often appear on clothes But the words do not go on the garments It has taken modern Western fashion to make that happen Brocade or chiffon dresses covered in who knows what utterances in beautiful Chinese and Arabic script or dresses wittily made of paper printed with the New York Yellow Pages all express a joyful relish in the decay of the written word a forthright pleasure in the way its meaning has been draining away Indeed you could view this show as a carnivalesque celebration of our growing tolerance for illiteracy At the end of the show is a cluster of popular sportswear with Tommy Hilfiger Donna Karan Nautica the Gap and such names applied to it These prove that Hester Prynne s proud display of her A was prophetic For with the proliferation of shifting public signage slogans logos and the lava flow of printout the words on your clothes are now what certify your physical existence They put you in harmony with the rest of the material world as well as with the electronically written universe on the Internet Words are now rarely carved in stone printed books are quickly pulped but endless messages flicker momentarily on screens or on this month s T shirt The exhibition tells us that as a vessel of lasting sense or sacred truth the written word may be losing ground but that as a source of inarticulate comfort it has gained much
