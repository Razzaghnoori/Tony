 Is That All There Is Dear Harry I feel a strange mix of emotions in this new millennium Like a lot of people I suspect I have a guilty secret I wish something bad had happened Not the Rapture Not even a Deadly Act of Terrorism But a little glitch would have been nice kind of like a snow day when you were a kid I m assuming you haven t been in L A your whole life something to put a little dent in the manic optimism of the moment A few hours without the power or having the ATM jam would have been a useful cautionary note at a time when everyone feels like they deserve an IPO of their own I see from the papers that the Y2K consultants are already extremely defensive insisting that the problem wasn t hyped and that their 100 billion price tag was worth it I have my doubts On New Year s Day my wife raised a question that s already become clich 48 hours later If Y2K wasn t a problem in countries that spent a lot e g us and in those that spent little but still have a lot of computers Italy I gather then didn t we get ripped off I still haven t heard a good answer For all my wishing for a mini disaster I also felt much more moved by the celebration than I thought I would Watching the rolling party across the globe on ABC and CNN was strangely riveting not least of all because Peter Jennings felt compelled to pull a Jerry Lewis telethon and anchor the whole thing himself By the end he was babbling so much I expected him to point to the tote board and ask Ed McMahon how much we d raised Still the effect of seeing the Y2K date roll across the globe brought out the Kumbaya spirit in me I feel the same way sometimes I m not kidding watching the Weather Channel seeing a storm form over the West Coast of Africa and then roll east into a hurricaine The same cloud pattern some Malawi tribesman gazed at eventually dumped water on a shriner at a casino in Biloxi Miss We are the world You think Clinton had a good time or what Standing at the Lincoln Memorial reading Lincoln s words with an audience of about a gazillion and a Steven Spielberg production behind him Raised in a liberal home it infuriated me as a kid that Nixon got to leave his signature on the Apollo 11 plaque left on the moon It was Kennedy and Johnson that got us there and here was Mr House Un American Activities getting to leave his name on the moon after just six months in office I imagine there are gazillions of conservatives for whom it s incredibly painful that Monica s boyfriend got to be the one to usher in the Third Millennium Did you see the Larry King column in USA Today He says that Clinton told him he owns the original Harry Truman letter to the music critic the one where he threatens to punch out the guy for criticizing his daughter s piano recital Steve Forbes gave Clinton the letter according to King Weird I see in the papers today that Clinton s proposing a modest but still sizable tax cut for next year Can there be any doubt how this Kabuki ritual will play out yet again The Repubs will push for bigger cuts Clinton and the Dems will accuse them of endangering Medicare and Social Security The public will back the Dems The Republicans will bluster losing popular support but then they ll finally cave to Clinton and infuriate their base They re like Wile E Coyote going off the cliff every time Speaking of Republicans I m emceeing that Congressional Dinner that you hosted last year 1 200 Washington bigshots in a hotel ball room done up in black tie You re a comedy God Is Spinal Tap on DVD yet I do occasional stand up Got any tips I ve got 30 days to come up with a bevy of Denny Hastert jokes and I m getting edgy As millennial anxiety goes it s pretty small stuff but I could still use a few tips Talk to you later Matt
