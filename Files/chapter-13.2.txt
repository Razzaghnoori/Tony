example an interview conducted by the Department of Justice Office of Inspector General is cited as DOJ Inspector General interview of Mary Jones July 9 2002 1 We Have Some Planes 1 No physical documentary or analytical evidence provides a convincing explanation of why Atta and Omari drove to Portland Maine from Boston on the morning of September 10 only to return to Logan on Flight 5930 on the morning of September 11 However Atta reacted negatively when informed in Portland that he would have to check in again in Boston Michael Touhey interview May 27 2004 Whatever their reason the Portland Jetport was the nearest airport to Boston with a 9 11 flight that would have arrived at Logan in time for the passengers to transfer to American Airlines Flight 11 which had a scheduled departure time of 7 45 A M See Tom Kinton interview Nov 6 2003 Portland International Jetport site visit Aug 18 2003 Like the other two airports used by the 9 11 hijackers Newark Liberty International Airport and Washington Dulles International Airport Boston s Logan International Airport was a Category X airport i e among the largest facilities liable to highest threat and generally subject to greater security requirements See FAA report Civil Aviation Security Reference Handbook May 1999 pp 117 118 Though Logan was selected for two of the hijackings as were both American and United Airlines we found no evidence that the terrorists targeted particular airports or airlines Nothing stands out about any of them with respect to the only security layer that was relevant to the actual hijackings checkpoint screening See FAA briefing materials Assessment and Testing Data for BOS EWR and IAD Oct 24 2001 Despite security problems at Logan see e g two local Fox 25 television investigative reports in February and April 2001 and an email in August 2001 from a former FAA special agent to the agency s leadership regarding his concerns about lax security at the airport no evidence suggests that such issues entered into the terrorists targeting they simply booked heavily fueled east to west transcontinental flights of the large Boeing aircraft they trained to fly that were scheduled to take off at nearly the same time See Matt Carroll Fighting Terror Sense of Alarm Airlines Foiled Police Logan Probe Boston Globe Oct 17 2001 p B1 2 CAPPS was an FAA approved automated system run by the airlines that scored each passenger s profile to identify those who might pose a threat to civil aviation The system also chose passengers at random to receive additional security scrutiny Ten out of the 19 hijackers including 9 out of 10 on the two American Airlines flights were identified via the CAPPS system According to the procedures in place on 9 11 in addition to those flagged by the CAPPS algorithm American s ticket agents were to mark as selectees those passengers who did not provide correct responses to the required security questions failed to show proper identification or met other criteria See FAA report Air Carrier Standard Security Program May 2001 pp 75 76 FAA record of interview Donna Thompson Sept 23 2001 Chuck Severance interview Apr 15

UAL letter Flight 175 11Sep01 Passenger ACI Check in History July 11 2002 Customer service representative Gail Jawahir recalled that her encounter with the Ghamdis occurred at shortly before 7 A M and when shown photos of the hijackers she indicated that Mohand al Shehri resembled one of the two she checked in suggesting they were Banihammad and Shehri However she also recalled that the men had the same last name and had assigned seats on row 9 i e the Ghamdis and that account has been adopted here In either case she almost certainly was dealing with one set of the Flight 175 hijackers See FBI reports of investigation interviews of Gail Jawahir Sept 21 2001 Sept 28 2001 Even had the hijackers been unable to understand and answer the two standard security questions the only consequence would have been the screening of their carry on and checked bags for explosives See FAA report Air Carrier Standard Security Program May 2001 p 76 6 For Flight 11 two checkpoints provided access to the gate The second was opened at 7 15 A M The FAA conducted many screener evaluations between September 11 1999 and September 11 2001 At the primary checkpoints in aggregate screeners met or exceeded the average for overall physical search and X ray detection while falling below the norm for metal detection No FAA Special Assessments by red teams were done at Logan security checkpoints during the two

the cockpit crew of American 11 had been acknowledging all previous instructions from air traffic control that morning within a matter of seconds and that when the first reporting of the hijacking was received a short time later the 8 19 call from Betty Ong a number of actions had already been taken by the hijackers it is most likely that the hijacking occurred at 8 14 A M 25 An early draft of an executive summary prepared by FAA security staff for the agency s leadership referred to an alleged report of a shooting aboard Flight 11 We believe this report was erroneous for a number of reasons there is no evidence that the hijackers purchased firearms use of a gun would be inconsistent with the otherwise common tactics employed by the hijackers the alleged shooting victim was seated where witness accounts place the stabbing victim 9B and most important neither Betty Ong nor Amy Sweeney the only two people who communicated to the ground from aboard the aircraft reported the presence of

great deal of fuel in flying first to military airspace and then to New York the battle commanders were concerned about refueling As NEADS personnel looked for refueling tankers in the vicinity of New York the mission crew commander considered scrambling the Langley fighters to New York to provide backup for the Otis fighters until the NEADS Battle Cab the command area that overlooks the operations floor ordered battle stations only at Langley The alert fighters at Langley Air Force Base were ordered to battle stations at 9 09 Colonel Marr the battle commander at NEADS and General Arnold the CONR commander both recall that the planes were held on battle stations as opposed to scrambling because they might be called on to relieve the Otis fighters over New York City if a refueling tanker was not located and also because of the general uncertainty of the situation in the sky According to William Scott at the Commission s May 23 2003 hearing At 9 09 Langley F 16s are directed to battle

Terrorist Attack spring 2002 report to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources But the seismic data on which they based this estimate are far too weak in signal tonoise ratio and far too speculative in terms of signal source to be used as a means of contradicting the impact time established by the very accurate combination of FDR CVR ATC radar and impact site data sets These data sets constrain United 93 s impact time to within 1 second are airplane and crash site specific and are based on time codes automatically recorded in the ATC audiotapes for the FAA centers and correlated with each data set in a process internationally accepted within the aviation accident investigation community Furthermore one of the study s principal authors now concedes that seismic data is not

how the airplane would be operated en route to the Washington D C area The shortest time frame assumes maximum speed without regard to overspeed warnings a straight line path and no time allowed for maneuvering or slowing to aim and crash the airplane into its target The probable time frame allows for speeds consistent with the observed operation of the airplane prior to its final maneuvers and crash as well as for maneuvers and slowing in the D C area to take aim According to radar data the fighters from Langley Air Force Base arrived over Washington at about 10 00 A M Two of the three
