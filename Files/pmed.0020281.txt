                            Whistleblowers serve no function if they cannot tell their stories The present story of        whistleblowingas discussed in part in         PLoS Medicine that involves the pharmaceutical industry pharmaceutical        benefit management corporations the managed care industry and the political and lobbying        forces that zealously guard their secrets could not have been told without the help of        courageous men and women   For that reason those of us who congregated in Washington        DC on May th  at the invitation and support of the Public Library of Science and        the Government Accountability Project feel particularly humbled and grateful to these two        sponsors Our convictions could not have been aired were it not for the essential First        Amendment work of responsible journalists who exemplify the best in investigatory        research        For me whistleblowing is not a theoretical exercise It has a human face and tangible        features It is the face of children and adults who have been injured or killed by        misrepresented pharmaceuticals clinical research trial results that have been sequestered        from the scientific community and whose incomplete findings cause injury and        pharmaceuticals that are detailed to physicians not to save lives or necessarily improve        the health or welfare of the recipients but to make money        In the lonely and at times discouraging world of whistleblowing we whistleblowers are        passionate and often successful because our efforts have a different goal than the        corporations and political interests whose operations we occasionally challenge Our goal        is to tell the truth That honest effort is the source of any ethical difference we can or        might make Truth is the basis for the power of a whistleblower one that can withstand the        assault of unprecedented odds against being heard put forth by that sum of political power        expediency and money        A whistleblowers success depends upon competent and articulate media The debate to        improve the status quobe it in pharmaceutical marketing or managedcare decision        makingcannot proceed or flourish without it        Ralph Waldo Emerson American essayist and philosopher  commented about        success I have adapted his comments for all of us who gathered in Washington in midMay         To leave the world a bit better whether by a healthy child a garden patch or a        redeemed social condition to know even one life breathed easier because you have lived        this is to have succeeded as a whistleblower
