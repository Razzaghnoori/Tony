 Picasso Rules At some point during John Richardson s superb biography of Picasso you begin to feel grateful to Art not for the pleasure it affords the consumer but for the outlet it offers the psychopath Picasso once explained that in art one must kill one s father and his life as told by Richardson plays out as a series of these little metaphorical murders Artists whose work Picasso is unable to dismiss not many he once described the Sistine ceiling as a vast sketch by Daumier he cannibalizes He sketches one of Gauguin s Tahitian women and signs the portrait Paul Picasso He copies the signatures of Steinlen and Forain over and again like some angry shaman A friend describing Picasso racing back and forth between the Greek and Roman rooms in the Louvre says he paces around and around like a hound in search of game In the current exhibit of Picasso s early work on display in the National Gallery in Washington which is pegged to Richardson s first volume the walls wreak havoc with art history Picasso consuming Symbolism Picasso eating Impressionism Picasso devouring Fauvism One of the myths of the modern artist is that he could never have been anything other than what he was But if you take Picasso s character and transport it to late 20 th century America it is easier to imagine it doing almost anything except painting pictures People with the predatory instincts that led Picasso to become an artist in late 19 th century Spain become takeover specialists or basketball players or filmmakers in our culture The life and the work are bound together by this single character trait not so much the instinct to create as the compulsion to erase Richardson s Picasso is unable to abide even his own tradition As soon as he settles into a new style of painting or a new home or a new mistress he is contriving to destroy it or her Richardson s account does not so much excuse the bad behavior of the artist as use it to explain the career The art was great at least in part because the artist was flawed This makes all the more puzzling a strain in the critical response not only to Richardson but also to Picasso a tendency to dismiss his art because of his life So far as I can tell the trend was set in motion a decade or so ago when Arianna Stassinopoulos Huffington published her sexual history of Picasso You can see it gathering steam in Surviving Picasso the 1996 Merchant Ivory film that views Picasso pathetically through the unsympathetic eyes of his lover Fran oise Gilot But it reached a new level of respectability last December when The New Yorker s art critic Adam Gopnik reviewed the second volume of Richardson s life of Picasso Gopnik turns Richardson on his head If Picasso s art is bad he argues it is so at least in part because Picasso was a bad man This is not exactly a new line of art criticism but it s rare to find it taking root at such altitudes The piece recently won a National Magazine Award And given the violently mixed reaction to the National Gallery exhibition Michael Kimmelman writing in the New York Times I think from the show that if he had died in 1906 before Les Demoiselles d Avignon he would be remembered as a second tier Symbolist you can t help but wonder if Gopnik has finally figured out the way to dull the enthusiasm Americans feel for Picasso by playing to their self righteousness After a long passage detailing the artist s crimes against women Gopnik rolls up his sleeves So Picasso was a creep with women and Richardson gives him out of a rather touching and in this day uncommon biographer s loyalty too large a benefit of the doubt on the question Who cares Does it affect Picasso s art or the way we see it Here the reviewer needs to drop all pretense of magisterial loft jump down from the bench and start testifying Last spring I went for a walk in William Rubin s vast show at the Museum of Modern Art devoted to Picasso s portraits A single visit to an exhibition All becomes suddenly clear Picasso s misogyny was in evidence on every wall Gopnik writes And along with misogyny there was its Siamese twin an oversweetened vision of family life in which the children s implied vacancy is really Dad s It was only a matter of time before family values entered art criticism But who would have thought it would be imported by The New Yorker It s hard to think of a clearer sign that old fashioned Comstockian attitudes are once again in vogue this time with a new twist The modern moralist lacks the courage of his convictions He is reluctant to attack the artist s morality directly Instead he attacks his morality in the guise of attacking his art The critic is using the life as a weapon against the work One sign of what Gopnik is up to is his tendency when he is on the subject of Picasso s character to err on the side of the prosecution In making the case against Picasso you might think there would be no need to exaggerate the artist s crimes against his fellow man But Gopnik does describing Picasso as a coward who sat out two world wars while his friends were suffering and dying adding that he may have been right to do this in the First War but he did it again in the same way in the second Picasso was born in 1881 notes James Fenton in the New York Review of Books To accuse a man of cowardice for not having joined up in 1939 when he was in his late fifties strikes me as a complete novelty and it would have been a novelty to those Allied soldiers who on the liberation of Paris flocked to Picasso s studio as a place of pilgrimage Gopnik s bad faith extends to Richardson s biography which he faults unbelievably for treating Picasso too kindly Early in his article which he has called Escaping Picasso The Great Master That Never Was the author reminds us that there was a time when he devoted himself to Picasso studies how the most trivial academic revelation once caused him to run off to a nearby bar to drink my very first vodka on the rocks I passed out and had to be carried home But he is older now He has put his academic past behind him He is able to see the world as it is He is able to see that scholars have been covering up the crimes of the artist to protect him from justice Richardson s need to make Picasso into a serious artist and an honorable man instead of the inspired poetic rascal he actually was deforms above all his account of Picasso s relations with women he writes What is peculiar about this is that much of what Gopnik knows about Picasso he knows from Richardson It would be more true to say that Gopnik s need to see Picasso as a rascal deforms his view of Picasso s art Both men are working with the same set of facts and accusations The difference is that Richardson pleads for understanding while Gopnik brays for outrage Gopnik dismisses the cult of Picasso as just another kind of celebrity worship His piece proves this point nicely His is exactly the approach of every celebrity journalist to his subject Why bother with the art on its terms when you can have it on your own
