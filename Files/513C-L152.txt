 November 22 1993 Name Address City ST Zip Dear Dr Name These are challenging times for public institutions of higher education with legislative appropriations unable to fund schools to the level they have in the past The IU School of Dentistry is limited in these times because it is impractical to raise tuition and fees sufficiently to offset lost state appropriations I hope you have read in the school s Alumni Bulletin how our dental school has taken aggressive steps to streamline operations and enhance academic opportunities while becoming more financially efficient To continue to excel in its educational mission the IU School of Dentistry turns to us alumni and friends to provide financial support for priority programs at the school Under the leadership of Dean H William Gilmore the school has identified student support and technological infrastructure as the greatest needs in this year s annual fund appeal Dental students are incurring more and more debt as they progress through school The School of Dentistry has limited ability to provide scholarship money to deserving students who otherwise might choose another career option because of educational expense Private support is needed to offset this problem Additionally there is a tremendous need to upgrade the technological infrastructure of the school Our faculty and students need support to be able to keep up with rapid advancements in oral health care and the use of technology for many procedures We can help the school achieve this goal with donations to the 1993 Annual Fund Your support as a member of the Century Club has been very meaningful I hope that you will take this opportunity to renew your gift or even consider joining the Century II Fellows which recognizes donors of 500 annually to the IU School of Dentistry Information is enclosed highlighting the various giving levels Thank you for your ongoing support of our great school Sincerely
