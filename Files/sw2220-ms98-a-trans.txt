 i was trying to think about some of my favorite people that i liked in music and they re none of them are recent right um hum so i like Gordon Lightfoot do you know who he is and the Moody Blues and i like to listen to piano music a whole lot and Willie Nelson yeah uh huh so you like a a variety sort of easy listening because you you like country but then yeah but not all country i don t like that when they start i don t know i just like Willie Nelson i guess because he s such a character um oh uh huh yeah i i like some of his songs though they re they re not so they re not so sad country all the time they re just kind of sweet sometimes you know i mean they re not the the typical country where they re just you know my wife left me my dog left me you know yeah my truck is broken down yeah my truck s broken down and my house just burned down you know but yeah and there there s a guy have you ever heard of George Winston he plays piano i think he s dead now but he plays wonderfully no uh huh i like that are do you do you play the piano is or you just like it very badly i ve got a piano my mother got a piano and uh vowed that someone in the family was going to learn so we all had to take lessons yeah and i was the one that did the least poorly so she gave it to me and it s sitting here mostly taking up space but sometimes it makes you feel good to sit down and play it it is real relaxing yeah it must be fun to be able to play it and you know if you can play tunes that people can sing along to it d be that d be kind of fun i think yeah because i mean i play the flute and not many things you can play that ll you know people will sit there and sing along to and you can t sing along either so but um i like a lot uh i like classical music just because of the when when i i don t play i like jazz music but oh so do i forgot about that i said so do i i forgot about jazz what s that what s that yeah i like a lot like i like uh the the New Age music like with um uh the um um i don t know if you ve heard Neurotic Collection yes we ve got about five of those i love them yeah i love those too they re just so relaxing uh huh i d never heard them before until i went in a music store and you know how you put the headphones on and listen to it and i just i heard a piece and it was just so wonderful and then even my eleven year old boy loves to listen to it yeah yeah isn t that nice i mean it s nice when you have a piece that that is so so peaceful that everybody likes you know and uh yeah it it it it you know it has pieces that are uplifting but it uh it s mostly relaxing and you don t uh because it doesn t have words you know you don t feel like there s anything you have to remember you know as far as singing a song or something like that or interpreting what they mean or but uh i mean you can just sit you know those little booklets that come along with it and you can just see the things that they re trying to show with music my my little boy has gotten so into it that he s identified the the people that have written certain songs and he buys the yeah yeah the pieces that have that person yeah oh okay i see what you re saying yeah you know on it huh i mean i don t even know who did which ones but he does i i can t identify them either i just like them i couldn t i know which ones come next but i don t even know their names most of them i don t know their names of the song but i i can identify them but i like that and i like um course i i like classical music and uh yeah were you in the band i was in the band yeah so and i was in like chamber music groups and stuff so so was i i m used to pieces i and and i played classical flute i didn t play play jazz flute or anything like that so i can i can relate to it i suppose but uh and i like i m like you i like the older stuff too because i like Chicago and i like i like um uh yeah let me think who um i like Hebert um oh you don t know Hebert Laws but Hebert Laws is a flute player he s a jazz flute player and i like um uh Chuck Mangione do you know who Chuck Mangione is yeah i like Chuck Mangione i m trying to think of all um yeah uh what s his name plays the trumpet um i like the Moody Blues yeah yeah i like Moody Blues i i like mostly the older groups i think did you like them oh but we do have i like Simply Red we got Simply Red i thinking of all our CD s that we have what i really like and uh i like Breeze i like the group i think just because they all sort of sound they sound like a lot like red uh Simply Red if i m going to listen to that kind of music nowadays that s it s easy in listening so what type Simply Red i ve never heard of that um is it just instrumental no it s it s got people singing but it s it is instrumental but it s it s got people singing but it s got a like a whole bunch of people singing you know um how many people are in yeah on he can t hear me i i don t remember how many people but it s it s got men men and women and it s not it s it s nice i mean it s pleasant you know music it s not what s it hurts your ears to hear it but it s not as it s not like uh Chicago where it s got that much instrument to it you know it doesn t have like all the brass and everything yeah yeah well my husband is telling me we have to hit the road we re going to go to Commerce and see a friend and then i m going to go to Sulphur Springs yeah where are you oh you must live in this area we re in Sherman okay so we re in Garland oh okay you re going to Commerce for East Texas or something oh okay yeah yeah yeah just because there s a friend up there not because there s much else oh okay well they re having a lot of recruiting this week in all the different areas that s why i was just wondering yeah East Texas is recruiting for you know their fall semester and they re they ve been doing a lot of that in the area for colleges well they re not colleges they re not going to recruit me anymore i m through no more for me what what do you do no more huh well right now i m just a homemaker but i m going to school uh for legal assistant and that s why i know so and uh just nothing basically are you going to go to East Texas for that no no it uh no i don t go to East Texas uh i got a degree from TWU but i m really interested in legal you know in the legal environment but i don t want to be a lawyer so i said well i think i ll go back to school and see about being a legal assistant so that d probably be pretty interesting i was summoned down to the courthouse last week they had summoned eight hundred people about four hundred showed up and it was for a murder trial oh uh huh this guy had supposedly uh strangled this woman and stuffed cotton toweling down her throat and up her nose anyway this is happened in nineteen eighty three yeah and they had us fill out a long questionnaire we stayed till about one thirty and they re going to call the ones that they re interested in from the questionnaire two to three at a time and the trial won t take place until June yeah that s how it works and they say it s going to last about two to three weeks and this guy in front of me said i can t believe i was summoned i was an investigator and i was tailing the woman that was killed well then i have a friend at school that has a boyfriend that s a lawyer and he said that this woman this socialite in Plano had hired four guys to kill her husband and the one that s accused was the one that actually did it and she has since taken off with another lawyer who had been uh getting cocaine from his client and then selling it and he had skipped bail and they finally extradited him and he s going to testify for the state against her so he ll have his sentence reduced and this is the man that was in front of you oh well they ll weed him out yeah the the investigator yeah he he got off right away and i wrote that down on my questionnaire that he d told me that so i figure that that will make me biased and i won t be chosen yeah uh huh hopefully well not necessarily but there s probably something else that might make you because you could know about you could know about the crime but not necessarily be taken off the jury you know not be accepted for jury the jury yeah you i mean pretty much a lot of people would know about it you know and and know some of the different things about it but um they they might weed you out some other way you know if you if you don t believe like if this was a capital crime and and you don t believe in if you don t believe in death penalty you re not going to be picked at all so but the death penalty no i said that i could i could believe in it in certain instances but i would be i d find it hard to levy that against somebody yeah so see there there they would have a doubt about you that you know because if that s what if that s what the punishment is in that in that instance then you re always going to say you know uh huh you know not guilty you re you re not going to want to have them have that crime uh that punishment so yeah but then when you re uh when you re picked see i was picked for another murder trial before oh gosh and it s so hard because you know uh huh everybody is wanting to go on and and get the sentence done and if you re trying to hold out you know there s so much pressure on you and you ve got to come up with a decision well especially with something where you have to find you have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt you have to find whether they re guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and it s like do you really feel that sure about
