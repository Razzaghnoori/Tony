 okay so what kind of movies have you seen lately i guess um a lot well the last movie i saw but it wasn t my choice was the Ninja Turtle movie obviously you have kids that s right yeah but my preference is the one we saw before that was Silence of the Lambs i haven t seen that one yet that s an excellent movie um the last movie i saw was uh Sleeping With The Enemy and i uh see i m not a big Julie Roberts fan but i was a lot oh was that good i heard oh okay i was i was a lot more impressed with her than i though i would be it turned out to be a better thriller than i was expecting it to be so yeah it was a pretty good movie well that s good yeah Silence of the Lambs kept me on the edge of my seat i i m ready to go it just it s you know hasn t worked out that way yet you know it s uh it looks good you know right yeah it is right and i do if you like thrillers anyway in fact people i ve talked to said that they hadn t slept real good for a while afterwards so so oh really oh i love them like that i m not i mean i i like all ranges of movies but yeah uh huh i like that where they run tense i really enjoy they keep me guessing the whole time it s really it was really interesting uh huh uh huh well what other movies have you seen then lately oh other than the i assume you were talking about the new Ninja Turtles movie yes the new one of course is that any good i mean i m sure i m going to be seeing it because in a week to Amarillo where my sister lives and she s got two boys that i took to see the first one so i m sure i m going to see the next one here real soon oh it really was i didn t see it the first one my husband said it was um about the same lines oh well then it won t be too bad you know it wasn t impressive necessarily but it was better than it could have been so yes right right and um i was impressed with the fact that um it wasn t that childish you know what i mean it wasn t my daughter s five i mean she understood everything she goes to almost all movies with us except you know R rated and uh yeah she really enjoyed it but it was on a higher level you know where there were some things that kids didn t understand that adults did and i liked that right right yeah i think that s important if you re going you know if you re going uh kids are going to uh parents are going to have to go you ought to make it at least semi you know right that s right that s right it s pretty good but we take her to just about semi for them too so yeah every movie and she uh she does really good we ve taken her from real young and she does real good like i said we don t take her to R s so if and when we ever get a babysitter like we did with Silence of the Lambs we go see it uh huh uh huh i was about to say you re not going to take her to that one i m sure do you take her or do you go to a lot of comedy movies or to oh no no yeah yeah um what was the last comedy you saw oh gosh what was the last comedy we saw huh huh huh good question good question we don t get to go that often but i m something on the tip of my tongue and i can t think of which one it was um noise gosh i can t remember i the last uh in fact i guess this was the last movie i saw i said that wrong the last movie i saw was The Hard Way with Michael J Fox well that really wasn t too bad it uh huh but that that sounds good there were you know he s supposed you know he s this actor right and he s he s playing a a cop well he s he s he s hanging around with a cop trying to pick up the the stuff i think he did an excellent job in not being too much of a cop uh huh right oh okay you know i mean there there were times when he was like he d be running with a gun or whatever he didn t look like a cop when he did it and i was so impressed with that because uh huh that s neat cause that the part was hard to do that you know you oh yeah because i mean everybody grows up looking at these cop movies and trying to you know to imitate them or whatever and uh i thought he did such an excellent job of not right yeah going that far now by the end he was looking more like a cop but at the beginning of the movie and all through the middle part you know he was trying to trying to get it but he wasn t there yet but you could tell right yeah right like i said i thought was a real good acting and writing job both you know because i think or directing job i think they did a real good job of that and um James Woods i think is who it was did an excellent job as the cop i mean you know he just yeah uh huh yeah i like him yeah and there were there were some definite um should i say tense moments with him in there so probably the last comedy we saw now that i think about it is Home Alone yes i i i had seen it before Christmas but i took a date to it uh about a month ago so i i i ve seen it the second time not too long ago so yeah uh huh it was really cute i really enjoyed it of course the bad thing about it was uh uh the the second time i saw it i didn t really enjoy it as much and i was kind of surprised at that i thought that would be one of those that i would love to watch over and over but before maybe it s just the idea of my reaction the first time i laughed so hard i was hoarse yeah uh huh uh huh i really was i was hoarse getting out of there and maybe i just laughed so hard the first time that i didn t have it i mean it just wasn t as funny the second time because i had just gone overboard the first time i don t know but yeah right yeah maybe so maybe so yeah i mean it was it was a great movie though i loved the movie yeah i did too i m looking forward to this summer uh Naked Gun Two and a Half is coming out i love those movies i do too i mean they are just slapstick it you have to see those twice to catch everything oh yeah well you have to see them more than that i i i still catch things in Airplane that i didn t catch yeah yeah those yeah i do too i its amazing i love those movies i really do so i m looking forward to seeing that because that looks hilarious as they all do well we we try to go yeah oh yeah a couple of times a month i guess to see a movie it it s just getting so expensive uh huh oh isn t it though you know but that s at least the good thing about the Texas organization letting you buy the tickets cheaper that s exactly what i was going to say i keep not doing it until after i m there and then all of a sudden i m saying i wish i d bought these things right but normally we don t think about it until right i know because we can go spend fifteen dollars just getting in the three of us yeah easily yeah yeah and then if you want popcorn and stuff it s just i mean uh it s incredible i don t understand why they charge you out the kazoo for both you know popcorn is not that expensive so they get you at the ticket booth and then try and get you at the popcorn and Coke no no it s nowhere near that expensive and it it s just the idea that these uh these actors you know live in such lavish style i mean it s as simple as that yeah we just keep breeding them yeah and as long as we keep paying the money for it they are going to keep paying them you know yes oh yeah oh that was that was an excellent movie i guess so now have you seen Dances With Wolves did you love it i haven t seen we re waiting for the video no don t don t that needs the big screen it really and truly does because to get the feeling no really oh uh huh of like when the buffaloes are when they re chasing the buffaloes and everything you ve got to be where you feel it you really truly do i would i mean uh huh oh really oh i would i mean i guess my first instinct was to wait for the video too but i m glad i didn t i really and truly am i mean that movie that was one movie i came out impressed really uh huh i really and truly did i mean i have absolutely no problems with them winning seven Oscars none at all normally i m one of these people that i don t like one one movie taking all the honors i wanted him to win best that s good i heard that yeah yeah best actor on top of it like i said i wouldn t given the supporting actresses either one but even though they were okay the girl in it yeah oh yeah uh they uh somebody made an interesting observation now that i think back on it i d say yeah i can t believe that either she was the only indian to have her hair done at all times you know what i mean you know oh gosh yeah yeah it was just too perfect at all times that was a mistake that they made they shouldn t have done it now the best the supporting actor he was good yeah but from what i heard the guy who got it was better so i you know i can see that but oh yeah do you think my daughter would like it oh well there are there is one spot that was just a little bit on the gory side but um it s it s or just oh okay she doesn t mind when we cover up her eyes okay no problems it it s just the idea that there is this one spot where the white man has come by and killed a bunch a buffalo and just stripped its hide the hides so there s you know there s see that s the one that is the honest to God the one reason i don t want to see the movie is because i love buffaloes for some weird reason and i know they re fake yeah but well and and of course and well yeah that and plus i mean part of it is the idea that he goes with them on a buffalo hunt so i mean they are killing buffaloes in it but they don t stress that very much they really don t and i think it s an excellent movie for if if she enjoys okay okay movies i think it ll work pretty good yeah oh that ll be good we really need some my husband keeps wanting to yeah and i heard the video s even going to be longer they did a lot of stuff that they cut out it s it s it s a long movie oh yeah i may have to see the video i hadn t even thought of that yeah that s true they said yeah they said there s a lot that had been edited because of the length uh huh uh huh and that they wanted in so they re going to put it in the video and that way you can watch it at your leisure yeah well yeah i kind of like it when they do that because the video like i said there are certain things you can t do with a video and the idea that they may put a little extra in it i think is a good idea yeah that s true yeah yeah because i mean when you rent a video videos of course are not cheaper either and um and so the idea of getting a little extra with it i think is a good idea because they they make bundles of money off those things true yeah i know it isn t that ridiculous we have cable which helps a lot oh i do too yeah but not enough yeah i m getting to the point where you know i watch well i watch Nick at Nite yeah we keep holding out you know
