 Gorilla Warfare The current effort to sexually integrate the U S military is not without precedent Consider the natives of New Caledonia in the South Pacific who earned their place in military annals by subduing and then eating the crew of a French survey ship in 1850 The men and women typically headed off for war in unison although their roles did differ once the fighting began The women would fall back to the rear then as one 19 th century observer put it whenever they see one of the enemy fall it is their business to rush forward pull the body behind and dress it for the oven OK so these women aren t quite the role models that proponents of sexual integration would order up from central casting But history has provided few candidates for that job As Maurice Davie noted in 1929 in his cross cultural survey The Evolution of War war is the business of half the human race As a rule the fact that women have not traditionally performed a given role has no bearing on their competence to perform it now Centuries of female exclusion from academia or civil engineering haven t rendered modern women unfit for those professions However male dominance of the killing business seems to have been going on for a lot longer than a few centuries maybe long enough to have influenced human evolution shaping the biological foundation of human psychology If so does that mean male and female psychology are so different that the sexual integration of the military is misguided The question breaks down into three subquestions 1 Are men designed by natural selection for warfare As regular Earthling readers may recall the premise of evolutionary psychology is simple Those genetically based mental traits that during evolution consistently helped their possessors get genes into the next generation became part of human nature Careful thought experiments have shown that in a context of regular violence mental traits conducive to killing would do more for your genes than mental traits conducive to getting killed would So if during human evolution men often fought in wars and women didn t then indeed men might be naturally better warriors than women Of course the frequency of war in prehistory is not well recorded Hence the term prehistory But various hunter gatherer societies the nearest real life models of the social environment of human evolution and thus the purest observable expression of human nature have been known to engage in intervillage raids Australian Aborigines of the 19 th century according to one chronicler made it a point to massacre all strangers who fall into their power In some of these societies more than a fourth of the males die violently And whether or not our distant male ancestors often participated in actual war they probably fought other males and sometimes killed them The warless Kung San hunter gatherers of the Kalahari Desert once romanticized as The Harmless People were found a few decades ago to have homicide rates between 20 and 80 times as high as industrialized nations And some of this killing is coalitional two brothers and a friend gang up on an enemy etc So ethnographic evidence alone suggests that men could well be designed by natural selection to fight and perhaps to do so in groups There is more evidence which we ll get to shortly However the policy implications of any male propensity to fight would depend on other questions For example 2 Are women by nature shrinking violets innately repulsed by war incapable of violence Hardly Feuding Australian Aborigine women would sometimes square off and whack each other with yam sticks until somebody intervened Among the Ainu the indigenous hunter gatherer people of Japan women would go to war and actually fight though only against other women Even when women aren t combatants they hardly shy away from the thought of war or from its gore Among the Dayak of 19 th century Borneo women would surround a returning warrior singing songs of praise while the head of one of his victims sat nearby on a decorative brass tray Among the Yanomamo of South America women watch the one on one club fights that sometimes escalate into intervillage conflicts screaming insults and egging their men on Among the Ba Huana of the Congo one 19 th century ethnographer reported the chief instigators of war are the women If their men are insulted by other men and don t retaliate the women make fun of them You are afraid you are not men we will have no more intercourse with you Woma woma afraid Hu Hu Hu Then out go the men and fight All told though women as a group are less combative than men they are not wholly averse to combat And plainly some women are more eager and capable fighters than some men I m male but no one has ever confused me with Charles Bronson So why deny high testosterone women an opportunity to join in the fun If there is a good reason it has to do with our final question 3 Why do men fight so much Here we come to a problem that will prove stubborn if the military tries to sexually integrate ground combat forces such as the infantry The problem isn t so much that men are designed by natural selection to fight as what they re designed to fight over women Even today Yanomamo men raid villages kill men and abduct women for procreative purposes Moreover tough mean men enjoy high social status which attracts women and helps the men get genes into the next generation The anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon has shown that Yanomamo men who have killed other men have more wives and more offspring than average guys It s not just a question of men disinclined to violence getting killed off Two men might fight over a woman until one man submits and the winner gets the woman Or men might fight for seemingly nonsexual reasons but the winner still enjoys the high social status that wows the ladies Indeed it s possible that non lethal violence has done more to shape the male propensity for violence than simple killing has Male combat is common among primates It is the reason that in many primate species males are so much bigger and stronger than females Indeed the more polygynous the species that is the more females a dominant male can sexually monopolize the larger the size difference between the sexes The toughest male gorillas get a whole harem of females to themselves and the wimpiest get zilch Eons of combat over such high genetic stakes have led to males that are about twice the size of females In our species the more modest but still marked difference in size and strength between men and women is hard evidence that violence whether lethal or non lethal has paid off for men in Darwinian terms Among the other evidence is the fact that testosterone makes people aggressive The problem with fielding a sexually integrated army of gorillas wouldn t be that the females can t fight Try stealing a female gorilla s baby and see how you fare The biggest problem is that if you put three male gorillas together with one unattached female esprit de corps will not ensue Yes of course human males are better at controlling their hatreds and rivalries than gorilla males are But are humans so good that it makes sense to sprinkle a few women into a group of infantrymen and send them all off to war where everyone s prospects for survival will depend on their solidarity Hoping even subconsciously that one of your comrades will die seems a poor frame of mind to carry into battle Does the same argument apply to nonmilitary workplaces Doesn t sexual integration sow dissension there as well I d say that any downside to sexually integrating nonmilitary workplaces is not severe enough to restrict the rights of women or men And in many workplaces there may be a big upside to sexual integration But the military is special The cost of dissension is death not lower earnings And during big wars when the draft is on many of the victims are people who didn t volunteer for the job That s one big difference between this issue and the issue of sexually integrating police forces This logic has no direct bearing on the currently topical issue of sexually integrated basic training The troops that take basic together don t go off to war together so their bonding isn t a matter of life and death Still basic training is meant to model some of the rigors of war and it turns out to be a useful model indeed The complaints of sexual harassment that deluged the Army after the Aberdeen scandal which itself didn t involve basic training show how male and female psychology can complicate life for a sexually integrated army Obviously the more conspicuous problems men propositioning women for example can be minimized with sufficiently harsh punishment But the underlying psychological forces will still be there taking their toll And remember When soldiers go from training camps to actual war things get more primitive not less One can imagine combat roles for women that wouldn t fly in the face of human nature Why not try But reflecting on human nature doesn t seem to be a common pastime at the Pentagon Sexually integrating ground combat forces is now favored by one assistant secretary of the Army The secretary himself Togo West has said he is open to the idea And already combat forces are somewhat integrated in the Air Force squadrons of pilots and Navy ship crews These things though as integrating the infantry would be Given the stakes shouldn t such decisions be informed by some knowledge of sexual psychology Or instead we could just wait for a war and use 20 year olds as guinea pigs in a poorly researched social experiment
