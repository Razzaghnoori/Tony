 End of Empire GET INTERNATIONAL PAPERS BY E MAIL For Tuesday and Friday morning delivery of this column plus Today s Papers daily Pundit Central Monday morning and Summary Judgment Wednesday morning click here The French press was indecently jubilant in its response to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s rebuff to President Clinton in the Middle East negotiations Netanyahu Humiliates Clinton shrieked the liberal Lib ration on its front page picking out the word humiliates in red The headline on Page 2 was Netanyahu The Offense Done to Bill Clinton and on Page 3 America Struck by Powerlessness An editorial said that the long premeditated snub inflicted on Clinton by Netanyahu is particularly revealing of the inability of the United States to get itself listened to even by its closest allies Lib ration said U S imperialism is no longer what it used to be The world s last Superpower is forced every day to recognize the relativity of its power This phenomenon of insubordination is exacerbated by the relative isolation of President Clinton in his own country which enabled Netanyahu to play Congress openly against the White House the editorial went on Only a president with a clear vision of the world a president both convinced and convincing would have had any chance of imposing himself In similar vein the conservative Paris paper Le Figaro led its front page Monday with the headline Netanyahu Defies Clinton Next to that story was an editorial titled American Powerlessness This declared that the Israeli prime minister ran no risks when he refused to go to Washington to talk peace because the White House is incapable of punishing his insolence as six months before the midterm congressional elections Clinton is disarmed His Democratic friends in Congress know that to appear to be campaigning against Israel is the surest way to lose the elections Le Figaro said Politically weakened by the interminable inquiry into his escapades Bill Clinton cannot permit himself to open a new front it added There was a striking contrast between the attention paid in France to the U S Israel problem and the lack of interest in it in the rest of Europe Spain which has its own Basque separatist problem was far more interested in the vote by Sinn Fein and the IRA to support the Ulster peace agreement and El Pa s of Madrid devoted a front page story and its main editorial titled An End to All or Nothing to the subject Monday Page 8 in El Pa s did however carry a piece from its Washington correspondent saying the United States regards Israel s intransigence as a threat to U S interests in the Middle East Italian newspapers were still dominated by the political fallout from the mudslide tragedy in southern Italy 95 victims were buried Sunday and Corriere della Sera of Milan found room only on Page 11 for a story about the U S Israel friendship in crisis La Repubblica of Rome s angle on the story was fear in the Middle East that the peace negotiations are effectively at an end For more than a year it has been customary to say that the peace talks are blocked paralyzed in grave danger moribund the paper s Jerusalem correspondent wrote Monday Since yesterday there has been a strong temptation to say that they are dead and not worth talking about any more La Repubblica also discussed a new report on the Middle East situation by the veteran Jewish Italian journalist Arrigo Levi who after conducting high level interviews throughout the region concluded that the loss of all hope by Arafat and the Palestinians could lead to a new catastrophic war in which biological and chemical weapons might be used In one of the interviews U S Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk said The forces of extremism are destroying the Israeli Palestinian partnership He was quoted as saying that the window of opportunity created by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the results of the Gulf War is now closing To the Israeli Left which asks us to intervene to save Israel from itself we answer that it is not for us to intervene Indyk reportedly added If something is close to your heart then it is for you to do it not us In Israel the front page lead in the conservative English language Jerusalem Post said a yet to be detailed compromise between Netanyahu and U S envoy Dennis Ross makes a Washington summit this month among Netanyahu Arafat and Clinton a near certainty But the leading Israeli newspaper Ha aretz in an op ed piece by Akiva Eldar said the U S administration is debating only when to set zero hour for Netanyahu after his address in Washington next Sunday to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee convention or earlier this week by summoning him to Birmingham England where Clinton is attending the G7 economic summit The British press has been dominated for several days by the crisis threatening Foreign Secretary Robin Cook over claims the British Foreign Office secretly encouraged a private company to sell arms to help overthrow the military junta in Sierra Leone in contravention of U N sanctions against that west African nation Cook s job on the line in arms row said the conservative Daily Telegraph Monday In an editorial the same paper complained about the British government s reluctance to celebrate the West s greatest Cold War victory the breaking of the Berlin blockade which President Clinton is marking with a visit to Germany Tuesday The airlift it said had been conceived directed and largely carried out by the Royal Air Force In Hong Kong the South China Morning Post reported on its front page that Indonesia s anti riot forces have been ordered to shoot to cripple rather than kill in clashes with protestors Quoting a military manual leaked to the Jakarta Post the paper said platoon leaders have been authorized to use live ammunition in self defense to cripple rioters who are clearly threatening to kill others or to cause heavy material damage If this doesn t work it added a platoon commander has the authority to proceed with actions he deems appropriate
