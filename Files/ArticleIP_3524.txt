 Victor Hugo Lives Composers are always setting to music the words of great poets but does the music give us any better understanding of the poetry There is the case of Victor Hugo a poet of long ago born in France in 1802 died in 1885 who in recent years has somehow risen ghostily from his grandiose patriot s tomb in the Pantheon to become in our late 20 th century the poet of the hour so far as music goes Music based on Hugo s writings is everywhere today Les Mis rables the musical based on Hugo s novel of the same title opened in France in 1980 and in a somewhat different English language version has been playing on Broadway and touring the United States for 10 years now with no sign of disappearing soon Last year Disney came out with an animated movie musical for children called The Hunchback of Notre Dame based on Hugo s Notre Dame de Paris This year Hyperion Records has issued a CD Songs by Camille Saint Sa ns for piano and voice with 11 of the 27 songs from poems by Hugo Which is to say Victor Hugo rendered into music is coming at us from three directions today triophonically so to speak as a Broadway extravaganza as a mass entertainment for children and more arcanely as classical music in a 19 th century French style You might suppose that Hugo himself or his shade faced with these sundry renditions would take particular exception to the idea of a movie cartoon for children But that is not so certain Sometimes Hugo welcomed adaptations of his writings and as for children he wrote a volume of poetry L Art d tre grand p re devoted largely to the topic of children s play It s true that in The Hunchback of Notre Dame Disney has done a wretched job though The technique of the Disney empire like that of The Invasion of the Body Snatchers is to get hold of the outer shell of someone else s de souled creation Hugo s medieval fantasies A A Milne s stories about Winnie the Pooh or anything at all and fill it with a creepy committee derived cheerful substance of Disney s own That is a pity not to mention a crime The songs in Disney s Hunchback by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz are a mishmash of the ersatz sometimes imitating the old fashioned Broadway cleverness of George Gershwin s brother Ira the lyricist as in Hunchback s A Guy Like You sung by stone gargoyles which you can listen to briefly by clicking though I don t advise it other times imitating the modern Broadway cleverness of Les Mis as in Hunchback s opening number which you can also listen to with a click though why But there s no point in looking for Hugo in any of that even if it s worth noting that Disney s single inspiration of any worth in Hunchback the talking stone statues was originally conceived by Hugo himself in his epic poem La L gende des Si cles Iwent to see Les Mis the Broadway show expecting something no better than the Disney production given the tinsel stupidity of most Broadway musicals today But Les Mis as untold millions of theatergoers have discovered before me turns out to be an intelligent and moving show Technically speaking it is an opera all singing and no talking except that unlike a regular opera the music by Claude Michel Sch nberg is intended strictly as a velvet background velvet Click to see what I mean intended to display the jewels which are the lyrics These lyrics have been composed by a committee consisting of in the French original Alain Boublil and Jean Marc Natel with the addition for the English version of Herbert Kretzmer aided by James Fenton this last person being a first rate poet and arts critic well known to readers of the New York Review of Books From this assemblage has come more lyrics than you would think possible in an evening s entertainment wordy rhyming couplets pouring outward from the stage in a ceaseless gush until you feel you have been drenched as you will see if you click The lyrics tell a story that sticks pretty closely to Hugo s novel and even to its left wing spirit which I much appreciate Les Mis is decently Hugolian in that respect Even the rhyming couplets stand closer to Hugo s spirit than you might imagine His own theater plays his play Hernani for example which set off a riot in Paris when it was originally staged in 1830 consist in large part of very similar verse The only difference is that in Hugo s original writings the wordy rhymed couplets conjure a feeling of endless verbal ingenuity advancing majestically at a stately pace whereas with the lyricists committee at Les Mis everything rushes forward pell mell as always in modern Broadway productions and clich s tread on one another s heels and you have this feeling of a hidden stage director crying Next Next If you want the true Victor Hugo rendered into music you have to get hold of Hyperion s CD of Songs by Camille Saint Sa ns very capably performed by the baritone Fran ois Le Roux and the pianist and music scholar Graham Johnson The songs are in French of course which is part of what it means to have the true Hugo who once said The measure of a nation s intelligence is its ability to speak French They are written in the light teary lovely style of 19 th century French song the style that you can see in a little pastoral love poem of Hugo s with the singer and pianist joined by Philippa Davies on flute by clicking The songs convey some of the orderliness and purity of Hugo s poetic imagination his unflappable fluency his verse structures varying with perfect control as if every possible variation on rhythmic and melodic order lay easily within his grasp as in for instance the opening bars that you can hear by clicking But is there any advantage in listening to Hugo or to any poet through the soundboard of a composer s music I find it enjoyable to listen to the musical settings by Saint Sa ns but then again a little disappointing Poetry contains its own music even if the music is only hinted at and if some composer comes along and fills in the hints with imaginings of his own the effect is to close off possibilities for your own imagination Claude Debussy once said to the poet St phane Mallarm that he had set a poem of Mallarm s to music to which the poet is said to have replied I thought I had already done that The splendidly incongruous 20 th century musical resurrection of Victor Hugo makes me conclude that when composers set a poet s work to music the best thing to do is in the case of a fiasco like Disney s Hunchback to stay away completely and in the case of a show like Les Mis to enjoy the story without paying any attention to the literary art In the case of a Saint Sa ns on the other hand the best thing is to savor the musical settings and the words too and then put aside the music to enjoy Victor Hugo the poet as presented by himself on the printed page with piano accompaniment and vocal sonorities provided by your own dreamy imagination
