            no we just uh i guess im hot on this subject because we just spent three weeks camping in a recreational vehicle   uh where did you go   we took a tour of Florida   well  interestingly enough im calling from Miami   okay well i was down there visiting the uh the orchid jungle   uhhuh   there in uh Homestead   yeah   came back with about ten plants that i hadnt planned on     well  yeah   yeah we were down past Miami went down into the Keys   well you know thats something ive never done is go down to the Keys although i im just here on business but uh i would love to go down there   um well we found it a little bit of a disappointment uh we had expected some nice warm sunny days we got two days above seventy   yeah   and uh we thought the beaches would be nice but uh uh well Key West was uh just coral rubble   yeah   and uh we did find Bahia Honda was a fairly nice state park it had a nice beach   uhhuh   but the water was running about seventy five degrees so it was kind of hard to get the kids to to go in and and snorkel and and do those sort of things     yeah well ive never done any motor home camping although uh uh it it is more attractive to me now than it used to be when i was a kid uh we used to go camping up in the Ozarks in Arkansas   umhum   and uh  we found a pretty remote campground uh uh actually whenever we first started going to it you had to drive about twenty five miles on a gravel road   yeah   to get back up into it and uh it had uh no electricity and uh it had a hand pump for water but it was on a lake that was just crystal clear and we would spend a week up there you know and they had a a little country store about ten miles away that you could get you know minimal provisions so you pretty much had to carry everything you needed with you   yeah   but uh that was it was great fun but since then i honestly have not done much what you could call camping   hum well my uh my wife talks a lot about camping and uh shes taken the girls uh on off to Girl Scout camp a couple of times but my idea of camping is in a either an RV or in a thirty thirty five foot sailboat   yeah well now  yeah you kind of remind me of a friend of mine who who said her idea of roughing it is slow room service     right     but uh yeah ive got a uh ive got a friend of mine in Houston who has a forty two foot uh Tartan sailboat   yeah   and uh it which has for me has been the best of all worlds because hes got the expense and i get the pleasure of going out on it   yeah i did that for a number of years i crewed for a fellow that uh was doing a lot of racing   well thats hard work   and uh and well it was fun it was quite enjoyable   yeah ive ive been with it on on several uh races weve run the Pensacola yacht race for a couple of years   umhum   and uh but no i love to sail and i agree i had never thought really thought about that as camping before but that is that is probably one of the best ways to go   yeah   what did you do did you rent a motor home when you came to Florida   yeah we rented one from uh Cruise America   was it what is that expensive   uh it was  running about eighty seven dollars a day   well thats cheaper than a hotel room really   thats cheaper than a hotel and you add uh oh maybe another twenty five dollars for that for a camp site   uhhuh   and you know the hookup and water and sewage and so forth   how big was the one you rented   we had a uh thirty two footer   yeah was that uh any problem driving or      well its its a big truck uh but uh   yeah   when you get that big a truck the uh the fuel economy goes to pot if you try to push it at sixty five and you get pretty decent fuel economy at fifty five   oh really   so uh i just uh had a change of mind set and i would set the uh autopilot on fifty five and just cruise down the highway well everybody else wants to speed so they wind up passing you   yeah   and you just stay in the right lane and theres nobody in front of you and all you have to do is guide it   yeah yeah yeah     so its kind of a pleasant way to drive you uh ive found that i get there just about as fast as anybody else because there will be some cars that ill pass two or three times during the day the same one   oh sure yeah yeah that always irritates me when i pass somebody several times ive ive been in the other in the other uh uh uh had the shoe on the other foot     yeah because you go down there and some hotshot will go by you that you know hes got a colorful car that you recognize and   uhhuh   the next thing you know you know its lunchtime hes got to stop for lunch and you just holler at your wife to make you a sandwich   yeah yeah right right right            and uh well we enjoyed it uh one of of places we visited was uh Walt Disney World   uh
