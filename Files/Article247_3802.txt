 Only Losers Run for President Dear Steve Of course you re right about the cult of celebrity politics it s just that I still don t understand how the two current benefactors of the American obsession with that celebrity got where they are On the one hand you have George Quincy Bush and any romantic view of his dad as a guy unjustly toppled by a womanizing schemer is historical revisionism pure and simple remember the last recession went on for perhaps 6 or 7 years Bush Sr acted like Hoover didn t give a press conference for months couldn t put both nouns and verbs in the same sentence On the other is Al Gore notable for as you put it about JFK Jr not living up to his Fair Deal hero father s high standards of integrity and cojones How can these two turkeys be our leading candidates for the highest office in the land The answer methinks is that the presidency attracts losers because it s not even in the top 500 highest offices of the land The top slots belong to CEOs the guys and gals who act like guys who really run America whose lobbyists write the bills whose contributions fuel the campaigns of lackeys like Bill and Hill What did America ever do to deserve this anyway By the way there was a cool NPR spot on conspicuous consumption this morning I was too sleepy to note the reporter s name As she went on and on about 12 000 bottles of 1870 wine actually I d kind of like to try one and a Park Avenue apartment building where the grungy units start at 4 million why anyone would want to live on a street where your furniture shifts whenever the commuter trains rumble beneath is beyond me she cleverly pointed out the analogies with the 80s economic bubble and the dot com one the big difference now is that only seven people ever benefited from the 80s boom When this one heads south it ll affect a lot more people who think of themselves as middle class Today s New York Times lead may be the stupidest ever A PLAN IS IN WORKS TO PUT OFF A VOTE ON TEST BAN PACT Clinton Satisfies a Demand by Lott in Effort to Avert Showdown Gotta get the crank out of the water supply down on West 43rd Street what the hell is wrong with the headline writers First of all no one cares about the test ban Maybe they should but they don t and I don t blame them We did the Cold War and it was fine then but now is now and even though the Russians still have zillions of nukes pointing at us and nothing has really changed it s sooooo over More important how about something sexier Try NUKE VOTE NUKED Clinton Sucks Up to a Lott And they wonder why the average age of a newspaper reader is deceased Best Regards Ted
