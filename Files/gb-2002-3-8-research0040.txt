                    Background        Powerlaw behaviors have been observed in many different        population distributions Also known as Zipfs law          one of the most famous examples is the usage of words in        text documents   On grouping words that occur in        similar numbers it was noted that a small selection of        words such as the and of are used many times while        most other words are used infrequently When the size of        each group is plotted against its usage the distribution        can be approximated to a powerlaw function that is the        number of words         N with a given occurrence         F decays according to the equation         N          aF          b  This distribution has a linear        appearance when plotted on doublelogarithmic axes where         b describes the slope Strictly        speaking Zipfs law plots the frequency of occurrence of a        word against its rank where words are ranked according to        their occurrence In addition the exponent         b in the powerlaw function must be        close to  Here instead of the rank we plot the number of        words with similar occurrences and do not require an        exponent of  Some other examples of this behavior        include income levels   relative sizes of cities          and the connectivity of nodes in large networks   such        as the World Wide Web          In regard to genomic biology Mantegna         et al   discussed the fact that        the usage of short base sequences in DNA or DNA words        also follows the power law They concluded that the        behavior applies better to noncoding than to        proteincoding sequences and suggested that noncoding DNA        resembles a natural language Further instances cited in        genomic biology include the occurrence of protein families        or folds       the connectivity within        metabolic pathways   and the number of intra and        intermolecular interactions made by proteins                   From the analysis of over  of the first genomes        sequenced we show that powerlaw behavior is prominent        throughout genomic biology As noted above previous        studies have cited the occurrence of powerlaw behaviors        for individual properties Here we report the behavior for        further genomic properties that have not previously been        found in particular for the occurrence of pseudogene and        pseudomotif populations in the intergenic regions of        genomes the number of protein functions associated with a        particular fold and the number of expressed mRNA        transcripts within a cell Furthermore we bring together        all the individual observations within a single framework        and demonstrate that the powerlaw behavior is prevalent        across most different genomic properties Finally in        presenting these data we discuss the significance of power        laws in biology and discuss several models that aim to        describe how genomes evolved to their current states to        produce this type of behavior                    Results                  Genomic occurrence of mers families and          folds          We start with the usage of short DNA sequences in          genomes we consider DNA words of size           n  termed           n mers and count the occurrence          of distinct words by shifting across the entire genome          one base at a time By grouping the different mers by          their occurrences we observe that the occurrence of           to mers displays powerlawlike behavior Figure          ashows the distributions of  to mers in the           Caenorhabditis elegans genome The          distribution for each mer is staggered which          unsurprisingly indicates that shorter words have a          higher average occurrence in the genome than longer ones          A more unexpected feature of the plot is that the slopes          for the differentlength words are nearly identical            b   indicating that the          number of mers with given occurrences fall at similar          rates regardless of their length Table  Moreover we          find that mers in both coding and noncoding regions          follow the powerlaw distribution equally well see          Additional data          Having observed the occurrence of short mers we now          shift our focus towards the coding regions of genomes          Most proteins encoded in a genome can be grouped          according to their similarity in threedimensional          structure or aminoacid sequence The most common          classifications of proteins are the fold superfamily and          family   each class is a subset of the one before          and groups proteins with increasing similarity First          proteins are defined to have a common fold if their          secondary structural elements occupy the same spatial          arrangement and have the same topological connections          Second proteins are grouped into the same superfamily if          they share the same fold and are deemed to share a          common evolutionary origin owing to a similar protein          function for example Both the fold and superfamily          classes aim to group proteins that are structurally          related but whose similarities cannot necessarily be          detected only by their sequences Finally proteins are          grouped into the same family if their aminoacid          sequences are considered similar most commonly using a          measure of percentage sequence identity or an           E value cutoff Alternatively          they can also be characterized by the presence of a          particular sequence signature or motif Here we have          used the fold and superfamily assignments from the SCOP            and Superfamily databases   and the family          classifications from InterPro             By analogy with the earlier mers proteins encoded in          a genome can be thought of as longer DNA words          Therefore by grouping proteins in the classification          system above we can measure the occurrences of          collections of sequences of around mers in the          genome As we explained above members of the same          superfamily have often diverged beyond detectable          sequence similarity and in the case of folds may have          independently converged to similar structures from          unrelated DNA sequences Nevertheless the occurrences of          families superfamilies and folds in the worm          approximate to a powerlaw behavior quite well Figure          a In fact despite the differing definitions of          families superfamilies and folds the resulting          distributions for each group are very similar Compared          with the  to mers the distributions fall off more          gradually            b   this indicates a          greater difference in the relative occurrence of the most          and least common families          Returning to the noncoding regions of the genome we          also plotted the occurrence of pseudogene families and          pseudomotifs found in intergenic DNA Figure b Whole          pseudogenes were found by searching for matches to          SWISSPROT protein sequences in intergenic DNA and are          usually characterized by frameshift mutations or early          stop codons that prevent normal transcription or          translation    Therefore they encode          nonfunctional protein sequences As with functional          proteins pseudogenes were classified into families using          InterPro Pseudomotifs were found by matching PROSITE          motifs in intergenic DNA and are thought to be more          ancient pseudogenes that have accumulated so many          mutations that only small fragments of recognizable          motifs remain ZZ and MG unpublished observations          These fragments are classified according to the PROSITE          classification As shown in Figure b the occurrences of          pseudogenes and the fragments also follow a power law          The distribution for pseudogenes is similar to that for          protein families and folds            b   this is expected as          pseudogenes in the worm represent a population of DNA          sequences that used to encode functional proteins The          distribution of occurrences for pseudomotifs            b   has a wide spread and          actually bridges those of protein families and mers          This is probably because the most frequently occurring          PROSITE motifs are only  amino acids in length and          therefore are similar to mers whereas the less          frequently occurring motifs are longer  aminoacid          residues and so resemble protein families          Our findings for the worm genome also apply to at          least  other prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms          Figure cshows InterPro family distributions in           Mycoplasma genitalium Escherichia          coli Saccharomyces cerevisiae and           Drosophila melanogaster  other          distributions from many of the recently sequenced genomes          are available from our website   Interestingly          smaller genomes            b   tend to have a steeper          falloff than larger genomes with fewer genes it would          seem natural to expect a narrower distribution in these          organisms Given the prevalence of the powerlaw          behavior it is likely to be universal to other genomes          yet to be analyzed                          Functions interactions and expression          levels          The power law is not only found in the occurrence of          words families and folds but also extends to further          genomic features of biological macromolecules As shown          in Figure d the distribution fits the number of          distinct functions held by a particular protein fold             Most folds are only associated with only one or          two functions whereas a few such as the TIM barrel          have up to             b   The behavior also applies          to the number of distinct proteinprotein interactions          made by different folds            b   and the number of          transcripts for each protein family in yeast in a given          cellular state            b                            Is the powerlaw function the best fit          We have so far demonstrated that disparate types of          data display powerlaw behavior Not all genomic          properties follow a power law however and examples          include occurrences of mers shorter than six bases the          occurrence of particular amino acids in proteins and the          number of residues that are involved in protein          flexibility Figure f          The original publication by Mantegna           et al   resulted in a prolonged          debate as to whether the power law is actually the best          fit for the mer distribution                 and similar discussions are found for powerlaw behavior          outside biology      Previous publications          have only tested the suitability of individual functions          In Figure e however we examine the bestfit curves of          seven alternative functions for proteinfold occurrence          in the worm linear exponential doubleexponential          tripleexponential stretchedexponential lognormal and          Yule distributions The Yule distribution in particular          was reported as providing a better fit for the occurrence          of mers than the power law   and the          stretchedexponential and lognormal distributions have          been cited as providing good fits for nonbiological          data          We measure the fit of each function by calculating the          residual between actual proteinfold occurrence and the          mathematical functions as follows                    R             N            actual             N            fitted            For example for the fits in Figure ewe use the          following equation                    R                       folds                        N                       folds                       worm             N                       folds                       fitted            In this calculation a smaller residual           R indicates a better fit between          the data and the mathematical functions          The main differences in the fit appear at the tail of          the distribution at high fold occurrences Although most          functions describe the lower end of the distribution          well they do not extend far enough at the upper end of          the distribution The linear and singleexponential          curves clearly do not describe the data well The          doubleexponential curve provides a reasonable fit for          lower genomic occurrences but diverges from the data at          higher values The same applies for the          stretchedexponential and Yule distributions          Two functions perform well the tripleexponential and          the lognormal distributions In fact the          tripleexponential displays a smaller residual than the          powerlaw function and one would expect higherorder          exponentials to provide increasingly better fits          However this is at the expense of having more free          parameters to finetune the shape of the curve As the          fold distribution actually displays a wide spread of          values  especially for higher occurrences Figure ad           we conclude that all three mathematical functions          describe the data equally well The same also applies to          the other genomic data we discussed earlier However          given the fit across many different biological          distributions combined with the relative simplicity of          the function compared to the higherorderexponential and          lognormal distributions we suggest that the power law          provides the best description of the data                            Discussion                  The significance of powerlaw behavior          Although the powerlaw behavior has previously been          detected in individual biological distributions                     this is the first time it          has been reported for such a wide group of properties          associated with genomes Moreover here we demonstrate          for the first time that powerlaw distributions are          applicable to the occurrence of pseudogenes and          pseudomotifs in intergenic regions the number of          functions associated with a protein fold and the          expression levels of different protein families          At first glance these observations might appear to be          biological trivia However powerlaw behavior actually          provides a concise mathematical description of an          important biological feature the sheer dominance of a          few members over the overall population For example out          of the  distinct protein folds currently assigned in          the worm genome just  account for over half of the           assigned domains The top fold the          immunoglobulinlike sandwich accounts for about            domains in the genome For protein superfamilies           out of  families account for half of the           assigned domains and only  of  InterPro families          match half of the  assigned proteins Half of all          pseudogenes belong to  out of a total of  protein          families and just two types of motif make up over half          of pseudogenic PROSITE fragments          Powerlaw behavior also describes similar underlying          observations for the remaining data For proteinprotein          interactions we find that  out of  protein folds in          the yeast genome make up half of the  known          combinations of interdomain interactions and for          geneexpression levels in yeast proteins from just           out of a total  folds comprise half of all the          transcripts in the cell at any given state                          Powerlaw behavior and the underlying evolutionary          mechanism          Having discussed the significance of powerlaw          behaviors this leads us to the question of how genomes          achieved these distributions Given a mathematical          description common to many genomes and different genomic          properties it is possible to define evolutionary models          that replicate the powerlaw distributions Recently          several papers have attempted to answer this question          from a theoretical perspective by building mathematical          models for evolution          Mantegna           et al   drew analogies with          Zipfs original work to suggest that the behavior for          mers originate from similarities between DNA sequences          and natural languages This suggestion attracted          extensive criticism        and the          work of Li   demonstrated that powerlawlike          behavior could in fact simply arise from nonequal          occurrences of words in random texts Shorter mers           mers fail to display powerlaw behavior because there          are insufficient numbers of distinct words to          differentiate levels of occurrence The  and mers          have larger numbers of distinct sequences and there are          hints of powerlaw behavior in the tails of their          distributions Figure d For mers and above the          reason that words of different lengths have identical          slopes is because their distributions are not independent          of each other longer words also contain combinations of          the shorter words          Although random DNA sequences provide a possible          explanation for powerlaw behavior with mers the same          is unlikely to apply to protein sequences Rather at          these levels the distributions probably arise from          evolutionary development centered on an underlying          process of gene duplication If we treat gene duplication          as a stochastic process the chance of a given gene being          duplicated is proportional to its occurrence in the          genome With each duplication some genes increase their          presence in the genome enhancing their chance of further          duplication Combined with selective pressure accounting          for the functional significance of different protein          products such a process gives prominence to some gene          types or families over others Previous studies outside          genomic biology have linked such stochastic dynamical          processes to power laws               Three evolutionary models proposed by Huynen and van          Nimwegen   Yanai           et al   and Qian           et al   successfully replicated          the observed biological data using such a duplicative          process All three models rely heavily on gene          duplication as the underlying process and in fact this          process on its own results in an exponential          distribution Each model achieves the powerlaw          distribution by emulating biological processes that          perturb the duplicative processes this is done by          including parameters that mimic selective pressure point          mutations or lateral gene transfer          In the first model of Huynen and van Nimwegen            gene families start the simulation with one member each          Each family is allowed to expand or contract in size          through successive multiplications with a random factor          which represents duplication or deletion events depending          on its value In the second model that of Yanai           et al   genomes evolve from a          set of precursor genes to a mature size by random gene          duplications and gradual accumulation of modifications          through point mutations When an individual family member          acquires enough random mutations it breaks away to form          a new family Finally in the third model that of Qian           et al   genomes evolve from          their initial small size using two basic operations          first duplication of existing genes to expand the size          of existing families and second the introduction of          completely new genes by lateral transfer from other          organisms or           ab initio creation Both components          are vital for replicating the observed data In this          paper we have discussed the finding that genomic          distributions first take on an exponential appearance and          then adopt a powerlaw behavior after a sufficiently long          evolutionary process In a similar vein a recent paper          by Rzhetsky and Gomez   introduced a model in which          the underlying DNA duplication mechanism combined with          random production of an interprotein interaction          successfully simulates the powerlaw distribution for          interaction networks in yeast          This leads us to speculate on a possible explanation          of powerlaw behaviors for the other properties For          protein functions folds with high occurrence in the          genome also tend to have diverse functions thus the          Ploopcontaining NTP hydrolase fold is found  times          in yeast and has at least six distinct enzymatic          functions   Parallel to this we find that folds          with many proteinprotein interactions also tend to hold          more diverse functions   for example the NTP          hydrolase fold is currently associated with nine          interdomain interactions within yeast Finally the state          of the transcriptionregulatory mechanism in a particular          cellular state clearly has the most important role in          determining geneexpression levels However it has          previously been shown that some gene families with high          occurrences also display high expression levels under          diverse experimental conditions   Finally the          occurrence of pseudogene families is related to the          occurrence of the protein family from which they          originate In addition a major method of producing          pseudogenes is through reverse transcription of expressed          mRNA and so their occurrences are actually related to          expression levels of these families Given the          correlation of all the different genomic properties with          the occurrence of gene families in the genome we can          reason that they are connected to an underlying          duplicative process          The main arguments supporting the view that all          powerlaw behaviours are arise from a common duplicative          process are that the occurrences of different genomic          properties are correlated and the fits between the          distributions of biological and simulated data are good          Although these models are based on wellknown biological          processes there is unfortunately little experimental          evidence to directly confirm the validity of these          models However it is worth noting that most of the          properties that do not follow a power law Figure d are          those that are clearly not directly connected with gene          duplication                            Additional data files        The CGI script and data that are used to produce the        website are available for
