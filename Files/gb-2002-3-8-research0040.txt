 Background Power law behaviors have been observed in many different population distributions Also known as Zipf s law 1 one of the most famous examples is the usage of words in text documents 1 On grouping words that occur in similar numbers it was noted that a small selection of words such as the and of are used many times while most other words are used infrequently When the size of each group is plotted against its usage the distribution can be approximated to a power law function that is the number of words N with a given occurrence F decays according to the equation N aF b This distribution has a linear appearance when plotted on double logarithmic axes where b describes the slope Strictly speaking Zipf s law plots the frequency of occurrence of a word against its rank where words are ranked according to their occurrence In addition the exponent b in the power law function must be close to 1 Here instead of the rank we plot the number of words with similar occurrences and do not require an exponent of 1 Some other examples of this behavior include income levels 1 relative sizes of cities 1 and the connectivity of nodes in large networks 2 such as the World Wide Web 3 In regard to genomic biology Mantegna et al 4 discussed the fact that the usage of short base sequences in DNA or DNA words also follows the power law They concluded that the behavior applies better to non coding than to protein coding sequences and suggested that non coding DNA resembles a natural language Further instances cited in genomic biology include the occurrence of protein families or folds 5 6 7 8 9 the connectivity within metabolic pathways 10 and the number of intra and intermolecular interactions made by proteins 11 12 13 From the analysis of over 20 of the first genomes sequenced we show that power law behavior is prominent throughout genomic biology As noted above previous studies have cited the occurrence of power law behaviors for individual properties Here we report the behavior for further genomic properties that have not previously been found in particular for the occurrence of pseudogene and pseudomotif populations in the intergenic regions of genomes the number of protein functions associated with a particular fold and the number of expressed mRNA transcripts within a cell Furthermore we bring together all the individual observations within a single framework and demonstrate that the power law behavior is prevalent across most different genomic properties Finally in presenting these data we discuss the significance of power laws in biology and discuss several models that aim to describe how genomes evolved to their current states to produce this type of behavior Results Genomic occurrence of mers families and folds We start with the usage of short DNA sequences in genomes we consider DNA words of size n termed n mers and count the occurrence of distinct words by shifting across the entire genome one base at a time By grouping the different mers by their occurrences we observe that the occurrence of 6 to 10 mers displays power law like behavior Figure 1ashows the distributions of 6 to 10 mers in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome The distribution for each mer is staggered which unsurprisingly indicates that shorter words have a higher average occurrence in the genome than longer ones A more unexpected feature of the plot is that the slopes for the different length words are nearly identical b 3 2 indicating that the number of mers with given occurrences fall at similar rates regardless of their length Table 1 Moreover we find that mers in both coding and non coding regions follow the power law distribution equally well see Additional data Having observed the occurrence of short mers we now shift our focus towards the coding regions of genomes Most proteins encoded in a genome can be grouped according to their similarity in three dimensional structure or amino acid sequence The most common classifications of proteins are the fold superfamily and family 14 each class is a subset of the one before and groups proteins with increasing similarity First proteins are defined to have a common fold if their secondary structural elements occupy the same spatial arrangement and have the same topological connections Second proteins are grouped into the same superfamily if they share the same fold and are deemed to share a common evolutionary origin owing to a similar protein function for example Both the fold and superfamily classes aim to group proteins that are structurally related but whose similarities cannot necessarily be detected only by their sequences Finally proteins are grouped into the same family if their amino acid sequences are considered similar most commonly using a measure of percentage sequence identity or an E value cut off Alternatively they can also be characterized by the presence of a particular sequence signature or motif Here we have used the fold and superfamily assignments from the SCOP 14 and Superfamily databases 15 and the family classifications from InterPro 16 17 By analogy with the earlier mers proteins encoded in a genome can be thought of as longer DNA words Therefore by grouping proteins in the classification system above we can measure the occurrences of collections of sequences of around 1 000 mers in the genome As we explained above members of the same superfamily have often diverged beyond detectable sequence similarity and in the case of folds may have independently converged to similar structures from unrelated DNA sequences Nevertheless the occurrences of families superfamilies and folds in the worm approximate to a power law behavior quite well Figure 1a In fact despite the differing definitions of families superfamilies and folds the resulting distributions for each group are very similar Compared with the 6 to 10 mers the distributions fall off more gradually b 1 0 1 2 this indicates a greater difference in the relative occurrence of the most and least common families Returning to the non coding regions of the genome we also plotted the occurrence of pseudogene families and pseudomotifs found in intergenic DNA Figure 1b Whole pseudogenes were found by searching for matches to SWISS PROT protein sequences in intergenic DNA and are usually characterized by frameshift mutations or early stop codons that prevent normal transcription or translation 18 19 Therefore they encode non functional protein sequences As with functional proteins pseudogenes were classified into families using InterPro Pseudomotifs were found by matching PROSITE motifs in intergenic DNA and are thought to be more ancient pseudogenes that have accumulated so many mutations that only small fragments of recognizable motifs remain Z Z and M G unpublished observations These fragments are classified according to the PROSITE classification As shown in Figure 1b the occurrences of pseudogenes and the fragments also follow a power law The distribution for pseudogenes is similar to that for protein families and folds b 1 8 this is expected as pseudogenes in the worm represent a population of DNA sequences that used to encode functional proteins The distribution of occurrences for pseudomotifs b 0 9 has a wide spread and actually bridges those of protein families and mers This is probably because the most frequently occurring PROSITE motifs are only 5 10 amino acids in length and therefore are similar to mers whereas the less frequently occurring motifs are longer 82 amino acid residues and so resemble protein families Our findings for the worm genome also apply to at least 20 other prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms Figure 1cshows InterPro family distributions in Mycoplasma genitalium Escherichia coli Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster other distributions from many of the recently sequenced genomes are available from our website 20 Interestingly smaller genomes b 1 0 2 0 tend to have a steeper fall off than larger genomes with fewer genes it would seem natural to expect a narrower distribution in these organisms Given the prevalence of the power law behavior it is likely to be universal to other genomes yet to be analyzed Functions interactions and expression levels The power law is not only found in the occurrence of words families and folds but also extends to further genomic features of biological macromolecules As shown in Figure 1d the distribution fits the number of distinct functions held by a particular protein fold 21 22 Most folds are only associated with only one or two functions whereas a few such as the TIM barrel have up to 16 b 2 2 The behavior also applies to the number of distinct protein protein interactions made by different folds b 1 2 and the number of transcripts for each protein family in yeast in a given cellular state b 1 6 Is the power law function the best fit We have so far demonstrated that disparate types of data display power law behavior Not all genomic properties follow a power law however and examples include occurrences of mers shorter than six bases the occurrence of particular amino acids in proteins and the number of residues that are involved in protein flexibility Figure 1f The original publication by Mantegna et al 4 resulted in a prolonged debate as to whether the power law is actually the best fit for the mer distribution 23 24 25 26 27 28 and similar discussions are found for power law behavior outside biology 29 30 31 32 Previous publications have only tested the suitability of individual functions In Figure 1e however we examine the best fit curves of seven alternative functions for protein fold occurrence in the worm linear exponential double exponential triple exponential stretched exponential lognormal and Yule distributions The Yule distribution in particular was reported as providing a better fit for the occurrence of mers than the power law 27 and the stretched exponential and lognormal distributions have been cited as providing good fits for non biological data We measure the fit of each function by calculating the residual between actual protein fold occurrence and the mathematical functions as follows R N actual N fitted 2 For example for the fits in Figure 1ewe use the following equation R folds N folds worm N folds fitted 2 In this calculation a smaller residual R indicates a better fit between the data and the mathematical functions The main differences in the fit appear at the tail of the distribution at high fold occurrences Although most functions describe the lower end of the distribution well they do not extend far enough at the upper end of the distribution The linear and single exponential curves clearly do not describe the data well The double exponential curve provides a reasonable fit for lower genomic occurrences but diverges from the data at higher values The same applies for the stretched exponential and Yule distributions Two functions perform well the triple exponential and the lognormal distributions In fact the triple exponential displays a smaller residual than the power law function and one would expect higher order exponentials to provide increasingly better fits However this is at the expense of having more free parameters to fine tune the shape of the curve As the fold distribution actually displays a wide spread of values especially for higher occurrences Figure 1a 1d we conclude that all three mathematical functions describe the data equally well The same also applies to the other genomic data we discussed earlier However given the fit across many different biological distributions combined with the relative simplicity of the function compared to the higher order exponential and lognormal distributions we suggest that the power law provides the best description of the data Discussion The significance of power law behavior Although the power law behavior has previously been detected in individual biological distributions 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 this is the first time it has been reported for such a wide group of properties associated with genomes Moreover here we demonstrate for the first time that power law distributions are applicable to the occurrence of pseudogenes and pseudomotifs in intergenic regions the number of functions associated with a protein fold and the expression levels of different protein families At first glance these observations might appear to be biological trivia However power law behavior actually provides a concise mathematical description of an important biological feature the sheer dominance of a few members over the overall population For example out of the 247 distinct protein folds currently assigned in the worm genome just 10 account for over half of the 7 805 assigned domains The top fold the immunoglobulin like sandwich accounts for about 829 10 6 domains in the genome For protein superfamilies 21 out of 606 families account for half of the 15 450 assigned domains and only 37 of 1 936 InterPro families match half of the 12 589 assigned proteins Half of all pseudogenes belong to 10 out of a total of 70 protein families and just two types of motif make up over half of pseudogenic PROSITE fragments Power law behavior also describes similar underlying observations for the remaining data For protein protein interactions we find that 6 out of 39 protein folds in the yeast genome make up half of the 89 known combinations of interdomain interactions and for gene expression levels in yeast proteins from just 12 out of a total 145 folds comprise half of all the transcripts in the cell at any given state Power law behavior and the underlying evolutionary mechanism Having discussed the significance of power law behaviors this leads us to the question of how genomes achieved these distributions Given a mathematical description common to many genomes and different genomic properties it is possible to define evolutionary models that replicate the power law distributions Recently several papers have attempted to answer this question from a theoretical perspective by building mathematical models for evolution Mantegna et al 4 drew analogies with Zipf s original work to suggest that the behavior for mers originate from similarities between DNA sequences and natural languages This suggestion attracted extensive criticism 23 24 25 26 27 28 and the work of Li 33 demonstrated that power law like behavior could in fact simply arise from non equal occurrences of words in random texts Shorter mers 6 mers fail to display power law behavior because there are insufficient numbers of distinct words to differentiate levels of occurrence The 4 and 5 mers have larger numbers of distinct sequences and there are hints of power law behavior in the tails of their distributions Figure 1d For 6 mers and above the reason that words of different lengths have identical slopes is because their distributions are not independent of each other longer words also contain combinations of the shorter words Although random DNA sequences provide a possible explanation for power law behavior with mers the same is unlikely to apply to protein sequences Rather at these levels the distributions probably arise from evolutionary development centered on an underlying process of gene duplication If we treat gene duplication as a stochastic process the chance of a given gene being duplicated is proportional to its occurrence in the genome With each duplication some genes increase their presence in the genome enhancing their chance of further duplication Combined with selective pressure accounting for the functional significance of different protein products such a process gives prominence to some gene types or families over others Previous studies outside genomic biology have linked such stochastic dynamical processes to power laws 34 35 36 37 Three evolutionary models proposed by Huynen and van Nimwegen 6 Yanai et al 38 and Qian et al 9 successfully replicated the observed biological data using such a duplicative process All three models rely heavily on gene duplication as the underlying process and in fact this process on its own results in an exponential distribution Each model achieves the power law distribution by emulating biological processes that perturb the duplicative processes this is done by including parameters that mimic selective pressure point mutations or lateral gene transfer In the first model of Huynen and van Nimwegen 6 gene families start the simulation with one member each Each family is allowed to expand or contract in size through successive multiplications with a random factor which represents duplication or deletion events depending on its value In the second model that of Yanai et al 38 genomes evolve from a set of precursor genes to a mature size by random gene duplications and gradual accumulation of modifications through point mutations When an individual family member acquires enough random mutations it breaks away to form a new family Finally in the third model that of Qian et al 9 genomes evolve from their initial small size using two basic operations first duplication of existing genes to expand the size of existing families and second the introduction of completely new genes by lateral transfer from other organisms or ab initio creation Both components are vital for replicating the observed data In this paper we have discussed the finding that genomic distributions first take on an exponential appearance and then adopt a power law behavior after a sufficiently long evolutionary process In a similar vein a recent paper by Rzhetsky and Gomez 13 introduced a model in which the underlying DNA duplication mechanism combined with random production of an inter protein interaction successfully simulates the power law distribution for interaction networks in yeast This leads us to speculate on a possible explanation of power law behaviors for the other properties For protein functions folds with high occurrence in the genome also tend to have diverse functions thus the P loop containing NTP hydrolase fold is found 130 times in yeast and has at least six distinct enzymatic functions 20 Parallel to this we find that folds with many protein protein interactions also tend to hold more diverse functions 39 for example the NTP hydrolase fold is currently associated with nine interdomain interactions within yeast Finally the state of the transcription regulatory mechanism in a particular cellular state clearly has the most important role in determining gene expression levels However it has previously been shown that some gene families with high occurrences also display high expression levels under diverse experimental conditions 40 Finally the occurrence of pseudogene families is related to the occurrence of the protein family from which they originate In addition a major method of producing pseudogenes is through reverse transcription of expressed mRNA and so their occurrences are actually related to expression levels of these families Given the correlation of all the different genomic properties with the occurrence of gene families in the genome we can reason that they are connected to an underlying duplicative process The main arguments supporting the view that all power law behaviours are arise from a common duplicative process are that the occurrences of different genomic properties are correlated and the fits between the distributions of biological and simulated data are good Although these models are based on well known biological processes there is unfortunately little experimental evidence to directly confirm the validity of these models However it is worth noting that most of the properties that do not follow a power law Figure 1d are those that are clearly not directly connected with gene duplication Additional data files The CGI script and data that are used to produce the website are available for downloadand from 20 Additional data file 1 The CGI script and data used to produce the
