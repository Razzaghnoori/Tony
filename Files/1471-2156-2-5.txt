 Background For the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae glucose is the preferred carbon source When glucose is present in the growth media transcription of a large number of genes encoding products involved in the metabolism of alternative carbon sources is repressed for reviews see 1 2 3 These genes include the GAL SUC2 MAL and STA genes required respectively for the utilization of galactose sucrose raffinose maltose and starch At many of these genes glucose repression is mediated at least in part by the glucose dependent repressor Mig1 a zinc finger protein that binds in vitro to DNA consensus sites consisting of a GC rich core and flanking AT sequences 4 5 Mig1 is thought to bind to several promoters including GAL1 GAL4 SUC2 and MAL62 and to effect transcriptional repression by interacting with the co repressor complex Ssn6 Tup1 6 7 8 Mig1 s activity is regulated by phosphorylation and subcellular localization in high glucose Mig1 protein is hypophosphorylated and in the nucleus where it can repress transcription upon withdrawal of glucose Mig1 is rapidly phosphorylated and transported into the cytoplasm 9 This regulated phosphorylation requires the function of the Snf1 Snf4 kinase complex 10 Deletion of MIG1 however only partially relieves glucose repression at promoters such as SUC2 whereas deletion of either SSN6 or TUP1 completely abolishes glucose repression Moreover the STA1 gene of S cerevisiae var diastaticus which is also repressed by glucose is unaffected by mig1 11 Therefore other proteins in addition to Mig1 are required for glucose repression One of these proteins is Mig2 which shares sequence similarity with Mig1 in their zinc finger regions 12 13 Genetic analysis suggests that Mig2 plays a minor role relative to Mig1 Recently a previously uncharacterized gene NRG1 Negative regulator of glucose repressed genes was shown to be required for glucose repression of the STA1 gene in S cerevisiae var diastaticus 11 These studies demonstrated that LexA Nrg1 behaves as a repressor of a reporter construct and that this repression is dependent on glucose Ssn6 and Tup1 In addition Nrg1 and Ssn6 interact with each other in two hybrid and GST pull down assays indicating that Nrg1 may repress via the same pathway as Mig1 Consistent with these results Nrg1 appears to bind to two sites within the STA1 promoter The SUC2 gene of S cerevisiae has been extensively studied with respect to its glucose repression 1 2 Glucose repression of SUC2 is mediated by Ssn6 Tup1 and SUC2 has two Mig1 binding sites in its regulatory region Additionally in high glucose its promoter is also occupied by positioned nucleosomes which cause transcriptional repression themselves 14 15 Derepression in low glucose is correlated with a loss of both Mig1 and nucleosome mediated repression although the precise relationship between the two pathways is not clear Genetic screens have identified a large number of genes named SNF Sucrose Non Fermenting that are required for derepression of SUC2 transcription in the absence of glucose 16 17 18 Genetic analyses and subsequent studies have traditionally divided SNF genes into two groups One group encodes the protein kinase Snf1 and its associated regulator Snf4 required to antagonize the repression caused by Mig1 10 19 The other group consists of members of the Swi Snf complex required to counter the repressive effects of chromatin by remodeling nucleosomes in an ATP dependent manner for review see 20 Suppressors of swi snf mutations such as spt6 do not suppress snf1 21 and ssn6 a strong suppressor of snf1 only partially suppress swi snf mutations 22 In this work we report the identification of Nrg1 in a genetic screen for new regulators of SUC2 transcription We show that Nrg1 plays a role in the glucose repression of SUC2 and GAL genes in S cerevisiae Thus at these genes Mig1 Mig2 and Nrg1 are partially redundant for mediating repression by glucose Consistent with our findings recent results have demonstrated an interaction between Snf1 and Nrg1 23 We also present experiments that test the genetic interactions between mig1 nrg1 and deletions of various genes encoding activators that function at the SUC2 promoter Results Isolation of a high copy number suppressor of snf2 The Swi Snf complex is required for normal levels of expression of SUC2 when cells are grown in low glucose To identify factors that might be functionally related to Swi Snf we screened for high copy number plasmids that could suppress a snf2 mutation see Materials and Methods To sensitize the screen we used an allele of SUC2 SUC2 36 that allows an elevated level of SUC2 transcription in the absence of Swi Snf 24 The SUC2 36 mutation is a single base pair change AT to GC at position 401 relative to the SUC2 ATG SUC2 36 strains still have a Raf phenotype in a snf2 mutant To identify high copy number suppressor candidates we used a 2 circle library to transform the snf2 SUC2 36 strain FY1845 Table 1 and screened 60 000 transformants for those with a Raf phenotype Eighty two candidates were identified 25 of which contained the SNF2 gene Among the remaining plasmids most conferred a weak Raf phenotype We focused on the candidate that conferred the strongest Raf phenotype This plasmid contained a chromosome IV genomic fragment that spans from within the NRG1 gene open reading frame YDR043C through the HEM12 gene YDR047W Subcloning experiments identified the partial NRG1 clone as the sequence responsible for suppression of snf2 and demonstrated that this suppression occurred in both SUC2 36 and SUC2 genetic backgrounds Figure 1 NRG1 is predicted to encode a protein of 231 amino acids with two C 2 H 2 zinc fingers in the carboxyl terminus Sequence analysis revealed that the 2 plasmid that confers suppression of snf2 encodes just the amino terminal region of Nrg1 lacking the zinc fingers To test if the complete NRG1 gene causes the same high copy number phenotype we subcloned the complete NRG1 gene into a 2 plasmid and tested it for suppression of snf2 Our results demonstrate that the complete NRG1 gene on a 2 plasmid does not suppress snf2 Figure 1 NRG1encodes a repressor of transcription To characterize further the role of Nrg1 with respect to SUC2 transcription we constructed and analyzed an nrg1 mutant The nrg1 mutant grows normally on media containing glucose sucrose or galactose demonstrating that NRG1 is not essential for grwoth and that nrg1 mutants can utilize several different carbon sources To test for the requirement for Nrg1 in glucose repression we tested growth of an nrg1 mutant on YP sucrose media containing the glucose analog 2 deoxyglucose 2 DG 2 DG causes glucose repression but cannot be used as a carbon source by S cerevisiae Therefore wild type cells do not grow on YP sucrose plates that contain 2 DG due to glucose repression of SUC2 However strains defective for glucose repression can grow on this medium as they express SUC2 even in the presence of 2 DG We found that an nrg1 mutant was able to grow on YP sucrose plus 2 DG suggesting that nrg1 mutants are indeed defective for glucose repression To assess the role of Nrg1 relative to the two other factors known to be required for glucose repression Mig1 and Mig2 we compared the mutant phenotypes caused by nrg1 mig1 and mig2 as well as testing combinations of these deletions We observed that the three single mutants grow with different strengths on YP sucrose 2 DG plates in the order mig1 nrg1 mig2 Figure 2 The double and triple mutants had stronger phenotypes than the single mutants Figure 2 These results strongly suggest that Nrg1 Mig1 and Mig2 are each required for glucose repression at the SUC2 locus with Mig1 playing the major role We also tested growth of these strains on YP galactose 2 DG plates and found that only the triple mutant was able to grow albeit weakly on this medium perhaps because galactose is a poor carbon source data not shown This suggests that each of these three proteins contributed to glucose repression of the GAL genes Glucose repression of transcription is defective in nrg1 To test whether the nrg1 phenotype on 2 DG plates is caused by altered transcription we performed Northern analyses to SUC2 mRNA levels Under repressing conditions 2 glucose the level of SUC2 mRNA was increased by two to four fold in an nrg1 strain compared to a wild type control Figure 3A Consistent with previously published results a mig1 mutant had a nine to fourteen fold increase in SUC2 mRNA levels while a mig2 mutant had no detectable defect in glucose repression of SUC2 4 12 We also analyzed the SUC2 mRNA levels in double and triple mutant combinations In general multiple mutations caused greater derepression up to 79 fold for the triple mutant nrg1 mig1 mig2 Figure 3A These data demonstrate that Nrg1 Mig1 and Mig2 all contribute to the glucose repression of SUC2 We also tested if an nrg1 affects glucose repression of the GAL genes as described in Materials and Methods Both nrg1 and mig1 mutations cause a defect in the glucose repression of GAL1 and GAL10 whereas mig2 alone had no effect Figure 3B As for SUC2 additive effects were observed in double and triple mutant strains up to a 13 fold effect for the nrg1 mig1 mig2 triple mutant Figure 3B These data indicate that all three proteins are involved in glucose repression of GAL1 GAL10 with Mig2 playing only a minor role Deletion of MIG1or NRG1suppresses mutations in both SNF1and SWI SNFgenes Activation of SUC2 transcription depends upon both the Snf1 Snf4 kinase complex and the Swi Snf nucleosome remodeling complex To address the relationship of Nrg1 to both complexes and to compare it to Mig1 we tested the abilities of nrg1 and mig1 to suppress the Gal Suc and Raf phenotypes of mutations in SNF1 and SWI SNF genes Our results Figure 4 show that both nrg1 and mig1 suppress albeit sometimes weakly mutations in both SNF1 and SWI SNF genes With respect to suppression of snf1 mig1 is the stronger suppressor with suppression detectable for the Gal phenotype Figure 4A The observed suppression by mig1 is consistent with previous results 22 The nrg1 mutation did not detectably suppress either the Suc or Raf phenotypes caused by snf1 With respect to swi snf mutations we tested suppression of both snf2 and swp73 and observed weak suppression of the Gal and Suc phenotypes Figure 4B Suppression of the Raf phenotype was not detectable There appear to be some gene specific interactions as suppression of swp73 by mig1 was stronger than the suppression observed for the other pairs tested Discussion Our results demonstrate that Nrg1 plays a role in glucose repression of the SUC2 and GAL genes of S cerevisiae Consistent with a role in glucose repression an nrg1 mutation suppresses the defects of a snf1 mutant Recent results from an independent study have demonstrated an interaction between Snf1 and Nrg1 23 Our results also suggest that Nrg1 is partially redundant with two other factors required for glucose repression Mig1 and Mig2 At SUC2 and GAL1 10 all three proteins appear to be involved in glucose repression because double and triple deletion mutations have additive effects Interestingly both nrg1 and mig1 can also suppress the defects caused by mutations in genes encoding members of the Swi Snf complex While Nrg1 Mig1 and Mig2 are partially redundant current evidence suggestions that they do not function in the same relative fashion at all glucose repressible promoters For example while mig1 and nrg1 cause comparable defects at GAL1 GAL10 nrg1 causes a weaker defect at SUC2 Mig2 appears to have only a minimal function at either promoter In addition Nrg1 is the major repressor at STA1 whose glucose repression does not require Mig1 11 Therefore some gene specific specialization exists among these three glucose dependent repressors A previous study of Nrg1 provided evidence that it interacts with Ssn6 and confers repression by recruitment of Ssn6 Tup1 11 We initially identified NRG1 in our studies by the isolation of a high copy number plasmid encoding a fragment of Nrg1 lacking the zinc finger domain Likely the phenotype caused by this plasmid is caused by interference of repression by Ssn6 Tup1 Our studies have not yet distinguished between a direct or indirect effect of Nrg1 on glucose repression at SUC2 and GAL1 GAL10 One possible indirect effect of Nrg1 could be by regulation of MIG1 transcription However Northern analysis showed that MIG1 mRNA levels are unaffected by an nrg1 mutation H Zhou and F Winston unpublished data We tested Nrg1 for binding to the SUC2 promoter and those experiments are briefly summarized here We screened for DNA binding of Nrg1 to the SUC2 promoter region using a previously described GST Nrg1 fusion protein 11 and a gel shift assay Our results demonstrated specific DNA binding to two sites within the 1022 to 825 region 5 of SUC2 H Zhou and F Winston unpublished results However a deletion of this region does not alter SUC2 expression Based on the similarity between the zinc fingers of Nrg1 and Mig1 and our binding studies the binding site of Nrg1 may contain a GC rich core Another such site in the SUC2 promoter may occur at 570 with the sequence AGGCCCA Although we did not detect a gel shift of a fragment containing this site it is still possible that it is recognized and bound by Nrg1 in vivo Furthermore although an Nrg1 consensus binding 11 exists at 976 of SUC2 we were unable to detect binding to this site by GST Nrg1 This region also did not compete the binding that we detected by GST Nrg1 This discrepancy between our findings and previous results can be explained by the fact that Park et al 11 used 10 fold more GST Nrg1 in their binding studies than we did Finally we did not detect any binding of Nrg1 to the Mig1 binding sites Thus the DNA binding of Nrg1 to SUC2 remains to be resolved Conclusions In conclusion these studies have identified Nrg1 as a third repressor required for glucose repression at SUC2 and the GAL genes Based on the similarity between the zinc fingers of Nrg1 and Mig1 the phenotypes of nrg1 and mig1 and the reported interaction between Nrg1 and Ssn6 11 Nrg1 likely functions by binding to the target promoters and recruiting the Ssn6 Tup1 complex The relative and possible cooperative roles of each of these repressors in recruiting Ssn6 Tup1 remains to be determined Materials and methods Yeast strains All S cerevisiae strains are listed in Table 1and are in

study were previously described 29 Glucose galactose sucrose or raffinose was added to 2 final weight per volume For solid media containing a carbon source other than glucose or glycerol antimycin A was also added to a concentration of 1 g ml To test for glucose repression of SUC2 and GAL genes 2 deoxyglucose was added to YP sucrose antimycin A and YP galactose antimycin A plates to a final concentration of 200 g ml 4 We discovered during the course of this study that a ura3 0 strain had half the amount of GAL 1 10 mRNA of a URA3 strain when grown in SD media containing 2 glucose and 2 galactose A ura3 0 strain also grew more slowly than a URA3 strain on minimal media containing sucrose or galactose We do not yet have an explanation for this phenomenon To overcome this growth defect uracil was added to YP plates to a final concentration of 80 M Subcloning of NRG1 constructs The 1 8 kb SacI SalI fragment of the original library clone containing only the 5 half of NrG1 without the
