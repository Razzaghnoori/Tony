 hello hey how you doing hello not bad not bad What s your name Fernando Fernando my name is Nick wait let me turn off my stereo here sure because i ve been like waiting like for about ten minutes to get connected to somebody yeah really man am i right what time is it over there are you are you in Dallas no no i m in Detroit or not Detroit i m in uh California are you yeah i because every time i got through i went to Dallas Texas really yeah i m in North Carolina oh well you re on the uh lets see on the other coast yeah twenty one yeah shoot man it s what midnight almost what yeah yeah it s uh i m watching Saturday Night Live here yeah okay all right well i guess we re supposed to talk what about credit card what wait what what did how how did you get to know about the TI thing oh one of my instructors uh said that they were doing something like this and what what are you working on a a Master s in uh information systems really i m doing my Master s in in Computer Science and Computer Engineering yeah where at at North Carolina State University hey how do you like it out there uh i don t because uh i come from a lot a bigger city than this one and i i m in Raleigh and yeah Raleigh Durham yeah yeah that area and it s really small all all you have is like towns built around universities like Chapel Hill uh huh yeah so it it s basically a bunch of small towns anyway kind of quaint little towns but they don t have a whole lot there yeah where are you at uh well i m in Monterey California right now oh okay so so i mean it s like this this town probably has like two hundred and fifty thousand people and that s about it yeah two hundred fifty yeah okay it it s it s a lot bigger than Monterey is but we re just uh just south of uh San Jose and San Francisco oh okay and it s only a couple of hours away or a hour away to a you know to a large city so so where do you go do you go to Berkeley no no i go to the it s the Naval Postgraduate school out here oh okay because um i was looking at at the doctorate degree in Computer Science center at Berkeley um hum and they re asking like for a um GPA of like three point seven or something like that and like they re looking like for uh GRE like ninety nine percentile and this and that and it s like uh huh yeah well that s what they look for whether or not they get it it s hard to say yeah i know that s why that s why i didn t apply i mean it was like yeah for me it was like practically impossible to get between like ninety and ninety nine percentile on the on the verbal part yeah it s pretty tough it s pretty tough i mean uh let s face it you know and you know are you did the you know as far as i found it a lot of times with regards to education you know the school only takes you so far you know it s what you do yeah you know so uh i don t lose any sleep sleep over stuff like that so are are you going to go for your doctorate probably not see i m in the Navy yeah and uh you know unless the Navy funds it i probably won t do it until i if i do do it it will be after i get out of the Navy when do you get out oh probably be another twelve years oh okay oh you know i like what i m doing right now but uh but what if they pay for it what if they pay for excuse me if they pay for a PhD yeah nah they won t pay for it they ve i think they have maybe two people a year go get get their PhD because i know i know a couple of people here that work for um the Army um yeah they civilians or uh military i think i think they re military but i mean the guy is still in uh huh and um he uh he works over in Maryland uh huh um hum and so he s doing his Master s here they gave him like a scholarship like for a year and he s doing it in like in a year and a summer yeah um hum and so he s getting that and uh they said like they got a lot of benefits and that that s why you want to join yeah um hum but uh this guy i mean you can earn a lot more money so you say i go why you still there if you can earn a lot more money once you ve get your your you know Master s um hum they go well they got a lot of benefits that would go with it so well a lot of times it s you know a lot of times it s not the money that keeps people that keeps people yeah you know they they like what they re doing they you know they feel good about what they re doing that type of thing it s more but i mean i mean you the once you get your Master s you can be earning between anywhere between like thirty seven forty five thousand a year um hum and oh easily i m sure and that s not what they re paying no well it depends on what rank you are of course yeah yeah i know well i mean like i say if you re if you re you know if you re at an upper level in the rank category you know you re probably pulling down close to seventy grand a year yeah but that s uh yeah those are few and far between though yeah it s like uh in IBM in IBM you can get certain points um hum and uh everyone s a manager but nobody can get one more point to become you know like whatever you need to earn so much money ye ah i imagine it s really competitive you know it s like no i i mean IBM is like there s a joke about IBM which says you know it s like uh all all the major companies get into a a boating race right um hum and so IBM says well we have to we have to have a team right and then they come in last and they have this whole team you know analyze why they came in last right because the person asked for it uh huh yeah saying he goes uh the problem was that there were five people saying row row row and one person rowing right so he goes have you come up with a solution uh have you come up with a solution they go yeah change the rower you know it s like everyone s a manager but you know it s like only use like one person does the work so yeah too many chiefs and not enough Indians yeah so yeah oh that can be that that can really slow you down yeah that well that s the way it works i mean that s that s why they re having problems i mean everyone s a manager and yeah i didn t realize that yeah i mean it s like it s like the people that actually do the work there um hum are uh very few and then the other people just plan it you know it s like it s like have you have have you ever seen the commercial like for Federal Express where the with uh the think tank yeah push paper around uh huh you know like all these people are just standing sitting sitting sitting around just going you know like what shall we do has anybody thought of anything no And then this guy from Federal Federal Express comes along they go what s that this track which it s going around the world and they can tell you where your package is anywhere any time um hum and so it s like the same thing with IBM you know so they have this think tank and they got to come up with ideas but see uh the the thing is that IBM is so stabilized that everybody will buy their stuff yeah oh yeah they ve got a they ve got basically a uh you know a lock on a lot of the market yeah and a lot of times you figure you know with the support that they provide you know people generally go with that because they figure that the you you you probably won t get fired for getting IBM material where s if you try something different and it fails and you re dead they ll they ll say yeah why didn t you buy why didn t you try something more mainline yeah well IBM doesn t fire anybody because uh what they do is they they put you in a different job no um hum which you you actually are like sitting around not doing anything so you quit uh i mean that s their policy they never fire anybody unless you re caught doing something illegally illegal illegal or something like that yeah yeah like if you re stealing something or doing anything like that but they won t let you off what they ll do is like uh huh suppose you know like you re a manager so they ll put you into uh huh keeping up the paper you know it s like how much paper is going in um hum and then you say that s not my job so you quit so in other words that s the way they force people out right that s why they can say you know there s no layoff policy right but it doesn t they don t really say that you know you re you re always going to have great career conditions right yeah hey that s kind of sad no but i mean it s like it s like they they have like this different policy i don t know my dad works for them but it s like IBM like never in their commercials they never put down any other company you know it s like no they won t say well they re the standard right now or as far as that goes you know people think of computers they think of IBM a lot of times and the main yeah because see what happens is they have a good backup policy and anybody can fix it and so that s what you re gonna go for um hum yeah well you know that s that s a that s a big thing and and you know it s like for example like Leading Edge have you ever heard of Leading Edge yeah they are out of Korea right what leading edge don t they they they made like uh small personal computers yeah small PCs aren t they re out of Korea right i don t know i i don t know but what they do is what they did i don t know is buy all the parts that IBM would throw away and build an IBM PC with all the parts that IBM would throw away yeah uh huh oh yeah yeah because so is it like for example you test a chip it can t last seven years but it can last five IBM says let s throw it away Leading Edge will say we ll buy it from you okay and so that s i mean they re still around i think yeah i ve seen well i ve seen them around anyway you know so that s what that s what they do they buy all all the things that IBM throws away and they that s why they re so compatible um hum because i mean and by the time you have computer for five years you re going to throw it away anyway most people do or they have to anyway you know well i mean there s like when when you realize teachers one of my teachers got this computer and it was like voice synthesis and stuff um hum and he got that he said you know it s like um i was testing it and it was wonderful and then when you tried to erase and correct you know all the errors in your voice it takes up all your memory and i want more you know and it s like wow Jesus Christ you know it s like why do you want more because it s like one second of recording i mean you put into a Wave and you want to correct the errors into Wave um hum it takes so much i mean it s like of course it does i mean by the times it transforms into Wave by mark off model and you put it in there and you want to correct those and then you know you re trying to make the the Wave smooth so you can approximately of course it s going to take a lot um hum imagine imagine what it is for us to make mark off models you know it s like Jesus Christ that s amazing yeah well when you get yeah when you get right down to it the uh the more they can do for you the more uh like i say the more the more memory they re gonna require yeah yeah yeah both both in terms in RAM as well as uh you know standard memory or disk memory disk base yeah well like they say like nobody can get enough you know it s like so once you have something and it s like i was watching this program on TV yesterday in nineteen seventy six NASA came up with Three D graphics right well yeah you find out more yeah uh huh and they were showing this like Three D graphics Three D graphics view of like like those hologram deals what no no no no this is like this is like video game stuff okay but the only thing was that it was just lines okay like if you like a hologram with just graphics on a on a okay
