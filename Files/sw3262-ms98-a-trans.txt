        doing good   how are you doing okay well   doing great i had a while to think about it so why dont i start and you can chip in when you feel like it   go right ahead   uh when we were first married we didnt think we needed a budget and and i think it was fine with the two of us we just kind of spent as we wanted and seemed like we got paid off enough that it would cover   now now how long ago was it that you got married   oh its been about nine years so   nine years okay   then when we actually got out of school and employed and  we only started getting paid once a month and we found that you really had to budget things or by the last week or two you were broke so thats probably when we started budgeting and ever since we just you know     what type of budget do you have   oh i dont know   no i mean i mean how do how do you keep do you actually look to see what you have spent each month or do you plan on what youre gonna spend for the month or i mean how do you do your budget     i probably plan what were going to spend each month i mean we get paid and i deduct all that were going to have you know all the bills at first and then i set aside so much for utilities that we need and so much for this and   okay   then we have a certain amount each week to work with for groceries and and lots of times i go over that amount but   well see now for myself im a CPA so needless to say my budget is probably  extremely well fine tuned uh ive been married now for nineteen years   umhum   uhhuh   and every month since the  the day that i was married i have had a budget i take all the checks that i write and all the deposits that i make and i put into my computer and it spits out a beautiful financial statement and from the financial statement i can see each month exactly what i have spent to see what i have made and see if theres any profit in leftovers so i can tell if on a month by month basis if im spending too much and if i am i just simply go to the wife and say okay  time to cut it off you know   this is how much you spend on this youd better not do it anymore   well its its its you know our budgets so much and you can just you can look at it and you can see hey that on clothing we have spent on this particular month so much more than the average i mean was just way out of proportion   right and thats usually about schooltime   for us it always seems to be Christmas time and yeah Christmas and summer uh so i have these financial statement and i look at them month by month by month   oh yeah yeah   and i can tell you to the penny how much we have spent in groceries how much we spend in utilities how much we spend on entertainment vacations   thats great   car car expenses whatnot and we know what we should be spending and uh now for my wife shes a schoolteacher her income is fixed for for myself i own my own CPA practice   umhum right   so we have a uh uh a floating you know my income is not fixed it can go up it can go down but youve got the generalities you know what its about its going to be   right yeah   and so what we look at is is to see behind us because now i do not plan in advance i can not tell you what were gonna be spending money on in the month of November i dont i dont know but i can tell you what we did spend in September   umhum   and as i see that i can then say okay here we are in October uh so then you know were were a little bit short this you know last month we we spent way too much so we need to hold back lets not spend anything this month or next month so thats how i do my budget um   yeah yeah thats great i i break mine down quite a bit i keep whats called a nonbalanced checkbook but i put all like fifty dollars away for clothes for the month or fifty dollars for savings bonds and you know and then when i feel like it i deduct that or  so its kind of a different way to do it but   uh there was a time when i remember i always wanted to put fifty dollars into my savings account but now it just a matter i want to pay fifty dollars off of my bills that i have you know but uh i i i will not allow myself to have a credit card     yeah we do and that   that i now i i do have a credit card but i dont ever pay or have a balance of more than i can uh payoff   uhhuh no we dont either we never we use it to float mainly   yes i use it to float extremely   especially on big purchases or around Christmas and   yes i i enjoy that forty five day float very very much but uh i i have not paid an interest a penny of interest in the last ten years   yes   yeah we i bet we havent for two or three years or you know once in a while you you have something come up that is more than you can handle or or you thought you could handle and you have to leave a little balance but we havent for ages either   curiosity only only because im a CPA uh how do you budget for the April fifteenth or do yall always have a refund or   so far weve always had refunds we you know have we have three children and that seems to really help and we probably dont make enough right now so   and i i assume do you own a house   but yes   good   i think if we did see that we were starting
