          okay   um well i guess first of all i i could have asked that before do you have children   no   no okay because i i didnt know if that would make a difference in how you felt um what what do you think about the proposal that all young Americans should spend a year or two   yeah i think its a good idea i think everybody should should uh put in their time so to speak for the for the good of the the nation and for the good of themselves i think its uh would everyone everyone grow up and mature and and realize what this countrys all about   yeah i just um i guess thats  my thats something that my family has always believed strongly in and um i had opportunities in high school to work in some programs um   did you  oh   and and i agree with what you said that its uh it benefits the person doing it so much i dont think they realize and i uh   uhhuh     i i think it gives you a better perspective on life and uh it gives you a little bit uh more a glimpse of the the real world and and it would certainly help the country too uh   yeah really yeah i think thats probably like uh quite a few things that that the kids uh maybe not so much nowadays but used to go through you know they just they were they did things for people   yeah yes   you know for their communities for their their uh families for their friends where now im not sure they really do   yeah well i think sometimes through groups and organizations um my first when i first thought of it i thought it uh when they asked the question i thought well that sounds wonderful and then i wondered if people were unwilling but but i think even if you went in with a negative attitude i dont think it would stay negative very long um but i do know through some organized groups like Scouts and church um   umhum   they do still have opportunities   yeah thats probably true   but i i think thats a small uh number that could   you know but even even through those groups groups do you think that they participate as much as maybe they used to   no um not since um not as much as i remember growing up and that was something uh i think in the fifties and sixties um seemed more common in the last two decades   umhum yeah i think thats probably true   but   i think its probably more true still still in the in the smaller communities then in the larger cities   yes yeah where uh where abouts do you live what part of the country   well i live in Richardson right now which is just   oh okay were in Plano so were not far apart one of the calls id gotten before was uh down to Austin and and i know   right yeah okay sure   a friend of mine talked to someone in the midwest so i know there is the possibility that it could be out of the area   yeah gosh i hadnt even thought about it being out of the area but youre right yeah but i grew up in a real small town in Florida   oh   i mean a real small town and uh i think it was just of course it was back in the in the fifties and i think it was real prevalent back then i  i think people thought more of others than they do now you know   yeah   as far as doing things for them and and then gaining benefits from it   well and maybe um maybe this would be a way to get that feeling back um if weve lost some of that and it it seems in the last decade or two um thats true maybe thats a way if if young people had to do it um   uhhuh   maybe that would start the trend back because thats one of the things i always thought was a wonderful part of our country um   yeah i do to i do to   is helping others   im not sure that that todays kids would go for it though i think you would have to start younger   yeah   you know i i dont know how young youd have to go but i think by the time theyre oh early teenagers anyway i think its too late now at least around here um   yeah i think uh i think it does help um even preschoolers you know theyre um things even just starting around the home you know little ones can do a little bit to help the family   right umhum   and and just watching the parents do things too um it can start a pattern theres always something  no matter how young and then that helps develop that attitude um i guess i would really like to see this happen with families more you know i think this is certainly a possible way um to handle it but i wish ah thats something that i think that has been lost in families and i think thats a good place to start again   uh yeah i would have to start in the families first because if you dont it for your for your own immediate family your sure not going to do it for anybody else   yeah and i do think um the schools do try and do something even with food drives and um sometimes what Richardson and Plano both i mean when you live in areas like that where theres so much they dont realize what a small percentage of the world that is i mean thats uh   uhhuh   gosh im sure not even one percent of the world is as fortunate as these areas and uh   thats probably true thats probably true   its i know our church youth group um starts with projects young but they they have a high school group that works in the Appalachia area every year theyve done this for fourteen years now   umhum oh thats great   um and it is its um and theyve also see that theres theres a different way of life and those families are really close some of the things that we talked about that were common in the fifties are still there and um   umhum   it really every youth thats ever gone really has felt that their life has been changed and its changed their perspective and and thats just the two two weeks during during the summer so if two weeks um could have that kind of effect i would   umhum well thats thats great im glad that there are still some areas that   think uh   that that get the youth involved in that sort of thing you know like i said i think it does   well thats   even even a small amount of exposure can make a vast difference in their attitudes   yes   well   well i guess um       did you have anything else that   no i i guess thats about all okay   okay well i i enjoyed talking with you   well good talking with you   and i hope you have a good evening thanks bye bye   you too okay bye
