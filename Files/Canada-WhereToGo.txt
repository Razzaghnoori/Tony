 WHERE TO GO W ith a country this big how do you get to know the place as a whole The answer is of course that you can t Not even most Canadians will have seen all that you will see on a well planned trip A visit to Canada aiming at anything more than just one destination Toronto Montr al or Vancouver is bound to seem a little intimidating The distances to cover are enormous But it can be done with the journey itself a large part of the adventure as you zoom across the wide open spaces separating one city from another The Handy Travel Tips section beginning on page 218 gives detailed practical guidance but here are some general ideas to help you plan your trip On a first visit you ll probably be able to get a feel for just a few of the regions we describe but you can capture the essence of Canada in a judicious combination of two or three major cities and the marvelous outdoor life We do not attempt an encyclopedic coverage of every nook and cranny from the U S border to the Arctic Circle but we do provide a representative sample of the country s attractions Where We ve divided the country into six regions each with at least one major town accessible by air as a launching pad from which to explore the hinterland Ontario Qu bec the Atlantic Newfoundland and the Maritimes British Columbia the Rockies and the Prairie Provinces Alberta Saskatchewan and Manitoba and the North Yukon Nunavut and the Northwest Territories Two suggested plans of attack are either to start in Toronto or Montr al and take in Ontario and Qu bec with side trips to the Atlantic coast or even out to the West or to start in Vancouver or Calgary and explore the Rockies and British Columbia before heading east to Ontario or Qu bec taking in the Prairies on a cross country train ride The North on a first trip must be considered a proposition strictly for the adventurous In any case count on at least three weeks ideally a month to even begin to do the place justice When One of the great advantages to Canada s vast size is that apart from a couple of major tourist attractions such as Niagara Falls it s never overcrowded Even in high summer there s still plenty of room for everybody Nonetheless it is advisable to make advance bookings for some resort hotels on the Pacific coast in the Rockies or around the Great Lakes July and August guarantee the best weather though it can get very hot in Montr al Toronto and the Prairie Provinces aggravated in those provinces by the hot chinook wind off the Rockies Farther to the north mosquitoes can be a problem in summer Connoisseurs of the forests of Qu bec and the Maritimes favor the spectacular autumn from September to mid October While the West Coast is mild in May and June in central and eastern Canada you ll still find snow on the ground in May and a nip in the air into the month of June The period from November to April is strictly for winter sports enthusiasts Remember the old adage There s no bad weather only bad clothing In addition to your light summer wear be sure to bring a sweater for the occasional chilly evenings Rather than weighing down your luggage with anything cumbersome take a leaf out of the Canadians book and keep warm by wearing several layers If you re thinking of going north consider long underwear In any case don t forget a raincoat especially for British Columbia Important everywhere is a good pair of walking shoes something light but more solid than tennis shoes How The most adventurous traveler who loves to improvise will still need a certain amount of advance planning Canada s provincial tourist offices are conscientious and well worth consulting even before you leave home The national tourist office is also helpful but in Canada the provinces jealously protect their prerogatives against the federal government and maintain their own tourist offices that can give you detailed information about resorts accommodations camping and sports facilities To cover half a continent air travel is invaluable To get the cheapest deal plan the broad outlines of your itinerary ahead of time so that you can buy your tickets before you reach Canada The two national airlines Air Canada and Canadian each linked to smaller companies flying the interior have cut rate multiple flight ticketing Helicopters and hydroplanes can fly you for fishing and camping expeditions in the more remote areas Do take advantage of the boat cruises wherever you can around Newfoundland Halifax harbor the Great Lakes or the Inside Passage off the Pacific coast For a closer look at all the wide open spaces take a train VIA Rail Canada is the national passenger train system using the tracks of Canadian Pacific and Canadian National who devote themselves strictly to more lucrative freight carrying Serving pretty good food in comfortable diners with club cars observation decks and sleeping cars VIA takes a leisurely four days from Montr al to Vancouver From Montr al to Toronto it s 51 2 hours faster by train than by road You may also want to consider Rocky Mountaineer Railtours tel 800 665 7245 www rockymountaineer com which offers daylight trips through the Canadian Rockies Buses are a possibility for the occasional excursion but a car remains essential for independent mobility The airlines will arrange for car rentals at each airport The Trans Canada Highway stretches nearly 8 000 km 4 800 miles from coast to coast and secondary roads are very good until you get into the backwoods Inside the major cities you may prefer to park your car and use the generally efficient public transport One of the best ways to explore the hinterland especially in the national and provincial parks is to rent a comfortably equipped mobile home or camper This too should be done in advance ONTARIO This choice piece of real estate between the Great Lakes and Hudson Bay is the country s dominant province too dominant for the liking of many of the others With 10 million people clustered almost entirely along the southern border Ontario is the most populous province and the wealthiest generating close to 40 percent of the gross national product from manufacturing construction minerals forestry and agriculture The province has grown in vitality with the influx of Italian German Portuguese Caribbean Indian and Pakistani immigrants reducing the once overwhelming British majority to barely 50 percent If Ontarians are known for their bumptious spirit they certainly have something to be bumptious about in their province s burgeoning towns and the riches of its farmlands forests and lakes Not content with taking over from Montr al as the nation s business capital Toronto is surging forward with a vigorous cultural and social life Bemused visitors from across the border note how it has been possible to create a vibrant modern metropolis without the hassles of inner city blight and violence As the national capital Ottawa is the inevitable butt of jokes against its federal government bureaucracy but patriots revere its parliament and museums preserving Canada s cultural treasures Niagara Falls Ontario has to the chagrin of many American tour operators the best grandstand view of one of the Western World s great natural wonders Southern Ontario s countryside is a gentle green delight enhanced by two theater festivals the Shaw festival at Niagara on the Lake and the Shakespeare festival at Stratford Cruise around the Great Lakes try the watersports on Georgian Bay and explore the Thousand Islands or Point Pelee nature reserve Ontario s history is preserved in lovingly reconstructed villages and forts marking the passage of French Jesuit missionaries at Sainte Marie Among the Hurons a fur trading post at Thunder Bay military positions at Fort George Niagara and Fort Henry Kingston and the pioneer communities at Upper Canada Village Morrisburg and Black Creek Toronto Toronto Ethnically diverse Toronto is Canada s largest city home to 4 3 million people Hard to believe that this gleaming citadel of big business and the good urban life was a malarial swamp in the 1790s Muddy York once could be recommended only by its commanding position on Lake Ontario from which Fort York guarded the troublesome American border Today the mud is neatly paved over the mosquitoes have flown elsewhere and the Americans are less trouble than they used to be Yonge Street the military highway that founder John Simcoe thrust north from the fort to Lake Simcoe starts out now as downtown Toronto s main commercial artery Its intersection at the elegant shopping thoroughfare Bloor Street is the fashionable hub of the city Following John Simcoe s military grid pattern Toronto s main arteries run from the lakefront north Spadina and University Avenues Bay Yonge and Church Streets and east west Front King Queen Dundas College Carlton and Bloor Streets Our sightseeing itinerary starts down at the waterfront and works north through the business district to the chic shopping and museum area As an alternative especially if you have children you may prefer to start downtown around Union Station and visit the other sights to the north before coming back to relax among the recreational attractions of the waterfront Getting around the city is quite simple but while downtown park your car and walk or use the buses or subway Waterfront Area You might face severe punishment from those very proud Torontonians if you don t begin your waterfront tour with a trip up the CN Tower This handsome outsize TV antenna makes up for its unimaginative name from its builder the Canadian National railway and telecommunications company with all the fanciful interpretations of its shape jousting lance hypodermic needle serpent frozen rigid while swallowing a football At 605 m 1 815 ft it is currently the world s highest freestanding structure 19 m 56 ft more than a similar monster in Moscow A plexiglass elevator whizzes you up the outside of the tower to two observation decks in the Skypod The ride is free for those going to the revolving restaurant or nightclub which also rank as the world s highest if you don t count a couple in the Rockies Alps and Himalayas The view at the top reveals a whole history of Toronto in the contrast between the glass and steel skyscraper canyons of the financial district the geometric dome and cantilevered structures of the Ontario Place leisure complex and the old fashioned gabled houses of the neighborhoods Take a second elevator to the Space Deck to get the full sweep of Lake Ontario s so called Golden Horseshoe Including Toronto this dense urban belt from Oshawa in the east to Hamilton and St Catharines in the west houses half the total population of the province More romantically you can catch a glimpse of Niagara Falls and peer across the border to Buffalo After years of neglect when it served only the lake s loading docks railway depots and factories the waterfront has become a major attraction for Torontonians at play Harbourfront is a bright new neighborhood reclaimed from a swampy wasteland at the foot of the CN Tower Rundown warehouses and factories have been transformed into art galleries bars restaurants boutiques a sailing school playgrounds in the park and more recently chic apartments Young upwardly mobile peddlers of old and new old china and other bric a brac on Queen s Quay West call their flea market the Harbourfront Antique Market The Canadian Railway Museum at Spadina Pier exhibits some of the earliest engines to cross the continent For a thorough view of the port facilities take the harbor boat tour organized by the Toronto Harbor Commission Facing Harbourfront the breezy beaches and picnic areas of the Toronto Islands offer another handy escape from the city bustle They were part of the Scarborough Bluffs peninsula until storms and floods in the mid 19th century broke them up into islands joined today by bridges Ferryboats leave from the docks behind the Hilton Harbor Castle Hotel at the foot of Yonge Street calling at the three main islands No cars are allowed but you can rent a bicycle downtown or on Centre Island The latter is the most popular with Torontonians and its beaches are particularly crowded on weekends In July it is the major focus of the great West Indian Festival of Caribana celebrating those other islands extravagant costumes and music featuring steel band calypso and reggae Quieter Ward s Island at the eastern end is more residential you can join the locals for their daily constitutional on the boardwalk Swimmers tend to favor the beach at Hanlan s Point to the west behind the Toronto Island Airport Jutting out from the grounds of the annual Canadian National Exhibition Ex to locals held in late August the ultramodern recreation complex of Ontario Place is built on three man made islands It combines the atmospheres of a theme park and a cultural center Its most outstanding landmark is the white geodesic dome of the Cinesphere On a six story high circular screen it shows superb documentary films of spectacular natural phenomena such as volcanic eruptions or the latest advances in earth and space exploration Pedalos are a delightfully lazy way of getting a duck s eye view of the attractions Energetic 4 to 14 year olds love the Children s Village complete with trampoline and waterslide and toddlers can splash around in the duck ponds Before you move on put your drenched kids through the huge dryer shaped like a bird The older crowd gathers at the Molson Canadian Ampitheatre to listen to rock concerts or heads for the outdoor ForumAmpitheatre seating 11 000 spectators for its classical jazz and rock concerts The best way to ensure good seats for the top attractions is to picnic on the grass before the show begins Moored at the entrance to the park is the Canadian warship H M C S Haida a destroyer active in World War II and the Korean War named after the peace loving Haida Indians of British Columbia You ll find sea cadets on board to answer your questions Nearby the Marine Museum of Upper Canada Exhibition Place just west of Princes Gate traces the history of shipping on the St Lawrence River and the Great Lakes with all the brass and wooden paraphernalia of the old vessels in addition to some beautiful scale models If patriots make a reverent pilgrimage to Canada s Sports Hall of Fame just off Lakeshore Boulevard West at Exhibition Place to salute heroic athletes of the past the separate Hockey Hall of Fame provides a tonic lesson for American visitors to recall among the trophies masks skates and hockey sticks the fact that nearly all their ice hockey heroes are Canadian born With the many splits between Anglo and French Canadians Protestants and Catholics ice hockey is the closest thing the country has to a state religion Of all the many historic sites carefully preserved and prettied up around the country Old Fort York Garrison Road off Fleet Street between Bathurst Street and Strachan Avenue has one of the most bizarre locations sandwiched between the Gardner Expressway and the railway tracks When Lieutenant Governor Simcoe built it in 1793 it commanded a strategic position directly on the lakeshore facing potential attack from across the American border In the War of 1812 retreating British forces chose to destroy it rather than let it fall into American hands It was rebuilt in 1841 and restored in 1934 as a tourist attraction with a diorama of the Battle of York and authentically furnished 19th century officers quarters log cabins and military surgery In summertime you can watch troops parading in the British Army s famous scarlet uniforms performing bayonet drills and firing their muskets Heart of Downtown The essence of Toronto old and new is concentrated around Union Station It was inaugurated by the Prince of Wales in 1927 when stations were still built like Greek temples Corinthian pillars heroic statues and ceramic tiled ceilings it is one last proud fanfare for the transcontinental railways that founded the country s industrial prosperity In this headquarters city of Canadian National railways the station also symbolized Toronto s position as a major commercial and industrial center Across the street the venerable Royal York hotel refurbished to something of its 1929 grandeur provides a businessmen s palace as appropriate counterpart It is linked to the station by a large underground concourse of shops and banks If the station and its hotel showed where Toronto was heading the bright new Metro Toronto Convention Center to the west proclaims the city s triumphant arrival Its amenities include all the latest electronic technology for audiovisual and communications services three main halls for up to 12 000 conventioneers banquet halls Grand Ball Room and sports facilities to stretch those tired executive muscles Providing a cultural counterpoint a block north of the Convention Center Vancouver architect Arthur Erickson s transparent Roy Thomson Hall glows at night to show off the throngs of smart concert goers attending the Toronto Symphony Orchestra The more middlebrow entertainment of bouncy Broadway musicals can be had at the nearby Edwardian Royal Alexandra Theatre This along with the popular old fashioned restaurants next door was restored by discount retailing tycoon Ed Mirvish who later endeared himself to the British theater public by renovating London s Old Vic The Bay Street financial district Inland from Union Station accentuates the town s evolution Almost all the Neo Classical limestone and marble monuments enshrining the old banks and stock exchange have been replaced by glittering steel and glass towers and tiered pyramids Royal Bank Plaza at the corner of Front and Bay Streets reflects the new prosperity in the gilded glass of its windows treated with some real gold The vast lobby and atrium of the interior are correspondingly opulent a dazzling play of cascade ponds and greenery beneath a d cor of thousands of aluminum cylinders the work of Venezuelan sculptor Jes s Raphael Soto While the plaza s architect Boris Zerafa is a gifted local boy Toronto s other banks have not hesitated to bring in talents of international renown In starkly austere but elegant contrast to the Royal Bank s exuberance is German Bauhaus master Mies van der Rohe s five black steel towers for the Toronto Dominion Centre between Wellington and King Streets Immediately to the east in Commerce Court is an exhilarating 57 story glass and stainless steel tower by Chinese American architect I M Pei designer of the new wing of Washington s National Gallery and the Great Pyramid for the Louvre museum in Paris Completing the financial picture north of the Dominion Center is First Canadian Place Canada s tallest office building In one tower is the Bank of Montr al reached across a pleasant green courtyard with smart shops around the waterfall The second tower houses the infinitely more boisterous modern Toronto Stock Exchange Behind the Exchange Tower is a trading pavilion with an observation deck from which you can watch the frenetic transactions Best hours are between 10am and 2pm Mammon keeps company with the muses in the Exchange Lobby where against a handsome setting of sculptures paintings and Art Deco design computer monitors give the latest prices from around the world A bustling underground network of concourses and escalators links the major buildings of the financial district to create a whole other neighborhood of shopping malls cinemas and restaurants providing warm shelter in the winter and air conditioned relief in the humid summer East of Yonge Street along Front the Hummingbird Centre for the Performing Arts is a less than graceful concrete bunker that is home to the National Ballet of Canada and the Canadian Opera Company Next door Canadian drama both contemporary and classical is given pride of place at the St Lawrence Centre for the Performing Arts A block away at Jarvis Street the sprawling indoor outdoor St Lawrence Market is open Tuesdays to Saturdays with the flea market setting up its stalls here on Sundays Buskers turn it into something of a genteel English country fair on the weekend Nearby St Lawrence Hall once host to the freaks and darlings of Victorian vaudeville has been beautifully restored to its original pink and green to provide a second home for the National Ballet In a country not renowned for its ecumenical harmony Church Street lines up the Anglican St James Cathedral the United Church s Metropolitan Church and the Roman Catholic St Michael s Cathedral each an architectural variation of the Neo Gothic style of the Victorian era North of Queen Street Nathan Phillips Square named after a prominent Toronto mayor is the center of municipal government In the summer ethnic communities hold their festivals and parades around the great reflecting pool In the winter the pool becomes a skating rink and the focus for ebullient celebrations on New Year s Eve Old City Hall a grand Neo Gothic stone monument 1899 with clock tower and gargoyles has been converted into a courthouse to make way for the striking modern 1965 landmark of New City Hall designed by Finnish architect Viljo Revell Its two gently curving office blocks open like an oyster over a domed pearl containing the council chamber Henry Moore s statue The Archer adorns the courtyard No tour of Toronto s civic past and present is complete without a pilgrimage over to Bond Street south of Dundas to Mackenzie House home of Toronto s first and most celebrated mayor 82 Bond St tel 416 392 6915 William Lyon Mackenzie a Dundee born Scot lived here after his return from exile for leading a revolt in 1837 see page 20 In the meticulously restored interior guides in traditional colonial dress explain the memorabilia of the fiery newspaperman including the hand operated flatbed printing press on which he turned out his revolutionary newspaper The Colonial Advocate West of Mackenzie House at the corner of Yonge and Dundas streets is one of Toronto s shopping musts the Eaton Centre The late 20th century phenomenon of the giant mall becomes here a spectacular showcase of galleries under an arched glass roof with fiberglass geese suspended in a refreshing d cor of greenery and flowers West of Nathan Phillips Square beyond tree lined lawns is Osgoode Hall a true jewel of Georgian architecture in white limestone and amber brick and the seat since 1832 of the Law Society of Upper Canada Notice the beautiful wrought iron cow gates put up at the main entrance to keep the cattle out in those early rural days It may whet your appetite to see a couple of other gracious relics of the Georgian era inside Visit Campbell House 1822 on the northwest corner of Queen and University Streets Guides in Colonial Dames costumes will show you around the home of Sir William Campbell Chief Justice of Upper Canada in the 1820s The Grange can be reached through the basement of the Art Gallery of Ontario see page 59 at Grange Park There costumed guides will help to give you a sense of the grand life enjoyed by members of the much admired and hated Family Compact The Boultons built this country mansion in 1817 when its grounds stretched more than 3 km 2 miles from Queen clear up to Bloor Street Note the fine winding staircase statuary and stained glass windows Be sure to go downstairs too to visit the spacious kitchens On McCaul Street across from the Art Gallery the Village by the Grange tries to recreate something of this old world atmosphere for its boutiques and restaurants Queen s Park and Yorkville The broad tree lined University Avenue makes an appropriately dignified and pleasant approach to the High Victorian pink sandstone Provincial Parliament Building and other government offices in the middle of the oval Queen s Park Guided tours will show you the principal halls and chambers From the visitors gallery you can watch provincial parliamentary debates when in session February to June and October to December West of Queen s Park is the University of Toronto one of the top colleges in North America with most of its buildings in traditional Oxbridge Romanesque and Gothic The medical school has maintained a high reputation since its researchers Frederick Banting and Charles Best made their discovery of insulin in 1921 The university bookshop known locally as book rooms on College Street is the best in town Between Avenue Road and Yonge Street north of Bloor is Yorkville the town s most appealing district in which to stroll In a transformation no less dramatic than the Harbourfront the hippy slum of the 1960s has been refurbished into a chic neighborhood of fashionable boutiques art galleries sidewalk caf s gourmet restaurants and colorfully repainted old houses Hazelton Lanes is a delightful variation on the conventional shopping mall where the maze of walkways and staircases around sunken courtyards is deliberately designed to get you lost until you buy or eat your way out You might very easily walk right past the unprepossessing fa ade of the Metro Toronto Library on Yonge one block north of Bloor but the subtly interconnected areas of architect Raymond Moriyama s striking interior may tempt you to give up your vacation and get down to some solid study Five floors of book stacks in a d cor of orange and burnt sienna surround a brilliant atrium enclosing greenery a fountain and a reflector pool while a transparent elevator zips silently up and down Crazy Casa Loma northwest of Yorkville at 1 Austin Terrace is Toronto s answer to California s Hearst Castle Its battlements and turrets are all a self respecting financier like Henry Pellatt could have wished for After touring the castles of Europe for a few ideas he built the 98 room mansion in the early 1900s at the then astronomical cost of 3 500 000 He chose his oak and walnut from North America teak from Asia paneling marble and glass from Europe With all its terraces massive walls and echoing rooms it isn t exactly cozy That may explain why Pellatt provided himself with a secret escape route through a hidden staircase leading from his study and now open to the public Whatever folly of grandeur the financier entertained is best seen in the opulently paneled Oak Room and the stained glass dome marble floors and Italianate bronze doors of the Conservatory Take the long tunnel from the wine cellar to the stables where the horses were spoiled silly with a home of Spanish tile and mahogany The Ethnic Neighborhoods In typical North American style Toronto s ethnic communities move around as they grow more affluent or as new construction pushes them out The high rises and parking garages behind the New City Hall forced Chinatown to move west This is the largest Chinatown in Canada if not in all of North America The community has set up restaurants hardware stores and herbal medicine shops along Dundas Street and Spadina Avenue Look in at the pagoda roofed China Court shops grouped around a little Chinese garden Other ethnic groups Portuguese Greeks Italians West and East Indians buy and sell at nearby Kensington Market west of Spadina It has the delightful exotic chaos of a bustling bazaar most of all on Saturday mornings The Jews who once inhabited this Kensington Market area have moved to smarter Forest Hill northwest of Casa Loma You ll find souvlaki restaurants and bouzouki music of Little Athens across the Don River on Danforth Avenue home of the first Italian immigrants Little Italy which is actually shared with the Portuguese is located around Dufferin and St Clair West Museums Undergoing an ambitious program of renovation the richly endowed Royal Ontario Museum popularly known as the ROM 100 Queen s Park has won international recognition for its collections of Chinese Egyptian Greek and Roman antiquities as well as the art of North American Indians and Inuit The magnificent Chinese Collection presents the objects and ornaments of some 3 500 years of civilization stretching from the Bronze Age Shang Dynasty to the extinction of the Manchu Dynasty in 1912 when China became a republic The exhibits include ceramic statues of various figures of the imperial court as well as models of a noble s house and a Ming tomb In a refreshing departure from the conventionally dry and scholarly displays of antiquities the captions on the showcases do a fine job of placing the exhibits in a living context explaining for instance the way a house was designed to deal with the changing elements and seasons or the religious significance of the figurines that people the tomb The bulk of the collection was assembled by fur trader George Crofts after he settled in the port of Tianjin it was continued after his death in 1925 by the Anglican Bishop of Hunan William Charles White The Bishop White Gallery features Buddhist and Taoist frescoes of the 13th century Yuan Dynasty under Emperor Kublai Khan along with some monumental polychrome and gilded wooden statues of the Buddha Across the street from the ROM the George R Gardiner Museum of Ceramic Art offers a very attractive way of acquiring an instant history of ceramics from 2000 b c to the 18th century The huge collection includes pre Columbian earthenware figures brilliant Italian Renaissance Majolica more sedate but elegant Dutch and English Delftware of the 16th and 17th centuries and the Rococo forms of German Meissen porcelain In front of the Art Gallery of Ontario AGO 317 Dundas Street West an intense Henry Moore bronze Large Two Forms proclaims the museum s outstanding feature North America s finest collection of the Briton s works The Henry Moore Sculpture Centre occupies a whole wing designed by the artist himself The 600 pieces of the collection shown on a rotation basis include major works small scale bronze models sketches and paintings But it s the great plaster casts in their sometimes brutal original state that give the visitor a unique opportunity to see a representative sample of the monumental pieces that grace public squares and university quadrangles all over the world Besides the celebrated reclining figures look for the formidable skull like design from which the Nuclear Energy monument was cast for the University of Chicago The AGO s Walker Gallery exhibits sculpture by fellow Briton Barbara Hepworth as well as Rodin D gas and Maillol The European collection of paintings includes important works by Tintoretto Rembrandt Van Dyck Rubens Frans Hals Jan van Goyen and Poussin An Ontario collection gives a prominent place to British painters including Hogarth Raeburn Reynolds and Gainsborough Among the Impressionists and their followers represented here are Renoir Pissarro Monet C zanne and Van Gogh Moderns include Matisse Picasso and Braque The Canadian collection provides a comprehensive survey of 200 years of Canadian painting pride of place going to Emily Carr Tom Thomson and members of the influential Group of Seven Two museums on the city outskirts are well worth the trip The marvelously entertaining Ontario Science Centre stands 11 km 6 miles northeast of the city center 770 Don Mills Rd Here adults and children are expected to participate and they do so enthusiastically in what turns into a sophisticated push button play center focused as much on the future as the past and present proving that science can be fun The Centre s design in a lovely green ravine of the Don River valley makes an exciting first impression Architect Raymond Moriyama has linked up the Centre s several buildings with escalators and passageways like a series of atomic nuclei comparable to his work on the various spaces and levels of the Metro Toronto Library Inside it s one thing to remember what your teacher told you about static electricity and quite another to touch without risk the Centre s 500 000 volt sphere and see your hair stand on end You can man the controls of a space vehicle for a simulated moon landing broadcast your voice clear around the world through a parabolic sound reflector or find out what goes on off camera in a fully equipped TV studio The McMichael Canadian Collection in the village of Kleinburg 25 km 15 miles 40 minutes drive northwest of Toronto consecrates the work of one of Canada s best known schools of painting the Group of Seven These artists of the first half of the 20th century sought the sources of their inspiration in a distinctly Canadian landscape rather than in the derivative themes of European painting The museum has chosen an appropriate setting of evergreen forest overlooking the Humber valley for its location The stone and log building is itself in more solid form a visual reference to the log cabins of the country s earliest settlers Look out too for the Inuit and Indian art most notably the work of Norval Morrisseau a Mid wiwin Indian from northern Ontario whose works explore traditional subjects with a modern abstract technique Black Creek Pioneer Village Here 20 km 12 miles northwest of downtown Toronto at Jane Street and Steeles Avenue conservationists have re created an 1860s farm and an early Ontario log cabin village In horse drawn carts you visit costumed villagers tilling and harvesting sheep shearing grinding flour in the mill weaving and fashioning horseshoes in the smithy Home cooked meals are served at the posthouse inn Niagara Peninsula The 90 minute drive from Toronto to Niagara Falls 130 km 81 miles south of Toronto curves around the west end of Lake Ontario through the province s industrial heartland Mississauga Hamilton and St Catharines known as the Golden Horseshoe If you want to see the Falls without getting entangled overnight in the mob scene of the tourists 12 million visitors annually stay over in the quieter town of Niagara on the Lake a mere half hour drive away Niagara Falls The true marvel of Niagara is how nature manages to triumph over tawdry commercialism perhaps less strident on the Canadian than on the American side of the border marked by the Falls No amount of pushy peddlers or tacky pink honeymoon motels if you do stay overnight ask to see one of the hilarious bridal suites can diminish the spectacle of that mass of white water taking its awesome plunge on the way from Lake Erie towards Lake Ontario and the Atlantic Mere statistics an average of 2 830 cubic m 100 000 cubic ft of water per second generating 4 million kilowatts of energy convey nothing of the falls immensity but a close up view is unforgettable The Niagara River divides in fact into two major cascades around Goat Island to the east American Falls 61 m 184 ft high with a crestline of 350 m 1 076 ft and to the west the more dramatic Canadian Horseshoe Falls 58 m 177 ft high with a curving crestline of 670 m 2 214 ft and a smaller cascade off to the side known as Bridal Veil There are several vantage points from which to view the Falls Table Rock named after a ledge that s long since fallen in the river is right on the brink of Horseshoe Falls Down below the Table Rock Scenic Tunnels take you behind the mighty wall of water With the price of the ticket you borrow some protective clothing but nothing is totally waterproof against Niagara Don t let that worry you seeing Niagara and not getting wet would be silly Just keep a dry change of clothing in the car A boat tour below the falls in one of the three vessels that go by the name of Maid of the Mist takes you past and damply close to both falls The Spanish Aero cable car gives you a bird s eye view of the Niagara Whirlpool rapids For an overall view try the Skylon and Minolta towers Away from the hustle and hype Queen Victoria Park is a delight for hikers cyclists and picnickers even cross country skiers in winter when the falls take on a much more romantic look all the more so for being relatively deserted In spring the park gardens put on a magnificent show of daffodils tulips magnolias and roses and diners in the park restaurant get a great view of the falls nighttime illuminations Niagara on the Lake A meandering 30 km 18 mile riverside drive north along the lovely tree lined Niagara Parkway takes you from the tumult of the tourist buses to the tranquillity of this old Loyalist bastion The town settled by refugees from the American Revolution in 1792 and briefly capital of Upper Canada jealously preserves an image of a British way of life revisited by North American nostalgia The main street Queen Street pays tribute to the Anglo Saxon myth with its clock tower white clapboard and red brick houses the grand Prince of Wales Hotel tea shops serving buns and buttered scones and the lovingly restored Niagara Apothecary 1866 displaying old fashioned medicine jars in walnut cabinets under ornamental crystal gaslights On the quiet avenues off the main street you can taste something of the genteel life in some delightful little boarding houses that supplement the usual hotels They operate principally from May to October when the town hosts the popular Shaw Festival Works of George Bernard Shaw and other major playwrights are performed in the modern Festival Theatre Wellington Street and Queen s Parade Road with its pleasant garden for a cocktail between acts A couple of smaller theaters put on musical comedies and light revues On the outskirts of town Fort George the British garrison on the Niagara frontier during the 1812 War destroyed by the Americans was restored in the 1940s A rebuilt stockade of six earth and log bastions connected by a wooden palisade surrounds workshops hospital kitchens and the original 1796 stone powder house Infantry drills are staged in the summer Apart from B C s Okanagan Valley the Niagara peninsula is Canada s only serious wine growing area not comparable with Bordeaux or Burgundy but still respectable At St David s southwest of town you can visit the Ch teau des Charmes winery and taste for yourself Stratford Situated in the heart of the peninsula 130 km 78 miles or 2 hours drive from Toronto Stratford town is well worth a visit for its celebrated Stratford Festival spanning the whole tourist season from May to November Since Tyrone Guthrie opened the festival in a tent in 1953 Shakespeare and other English classics such as Sheridan and Marlowe have been given pride of place Their home is now the apron staged Festival Theatre while the Avon Theatre and Third Stage put on alternative fare offering jazz and chamber music concerts as well as a chance to discover Canadian playwrights Every effort is made to sustain an Elizabethan atmosphere with curtain times heralded by trumpeters in Renaissance doublet and hose Picnic in Queen s Park and give your crumbs to the ducks and swans on Victoria Lake A Shakespearean Garden displays the flowers mentioned by the Bard in his sonnets and plays Point Pelee National Park At the southern end of the peninsula indeed the southernmost point of the Canadian mainland Point Pelee is one of the most distinctive of the country s nature reserves It s on the same latitude as northern California or Rome and so endowed with a most un Canadian climate and vegetation that offer a hospitable crossroads for 347 species of birds on their biannual north south migrations Bald point as French explorers dubbed it is the southern half of a 20 km 12 mile sandspit jutting out into Lake Erie Its terrain is a mixture of marshland forest meadows and sandy beaches Beginning with a lookout tower for bird watchers a circular boardwalk takes you out onto the marshes to observe the flight of the redwing blackbird and purple martin while bittern stay tucked away in the reeds Look too for the pretty pink blossomed swamp rose mallow unique to Point Pelee Well marked bicycle and hiking trails wind through the woods where you ll see hackberry sassafras sycamore black walnut and red cedar many of the trees draped with hanging vines reminiscent of the American Carolinas In the spring the great sport is fishing for smelt during their spawning run ending the day with a communal fish fry on the beach In September even before the leaves turn trees go bright orange with the wings of millions of Monarch butterflies on their way to Mexico Lakes Huron and Superior Ontario s playgrounds weekend cottages and marinas hug the shores and islands of the upper Great Lakes offering resort hotel facilities The more adventurous campers hikers and canoeists can explore the national and provincial parks for a taste of the northern interior s wilderness Georgian Bay The bay practically forms a separate lake These old stamping grounds of the Huron Indians until they were decimated by Iroquois warriors and European disease are now a popular weekend and summer destination for the families of Toronto professionals The town of Midland is the center of the Huron region Its Huronia Museum and Gallery of Historic Huronia and the copy of a Huron village in Little Lake Park illustrate the simple lifestyle of the native peoples before the arrival of the Jesuits in the 17th century West of town Sainte Marie among the Hurons is a reconstruction of the Jesuit mission built in 1639 Today besides some real Huron Indians costumed students show you how the community functioned with priests carpenters gardeners and blacksmiths It s worth beginning your visit with the half hour documentary film to understand the dramatic fate of the mission It must be said that the Huron were less interested in conversion to Christianity than in the goods to be gained from the fur traders who followed the priests on this first French settlement in Ontario But dealing directly with Europeans threatened the position of the rival Iroquois as middlemen between the Huron and Algonquin and the Dutch and British traders down in Albany New York The Iroquois killed thousands of Huron in all out war and two Jesuits Jean de Br beuf and Gabriel Lalemant were tortured to death To halt the Iroquois advance the French community of 300 burned their own village and returned to Qu bec The simple little Church of St Joseph contains the tombs of the martyred missionaries A museum outside the stockade depicts the life of the 17th century French Canadians including the artifacts and birchbark canoes of the fur traders The dramatic landscapes of the Georgian Bay Islands National Park a particular favorite of the Group of Seven now attract fishermen scuba divers and other watersports enthusiasts The bay s islands are said to number 30 000 if you include all the rocky outcrops and tree clumped sandbanks and the park includes 77 of the most attractive of these islands Midland and Tobermory offer boat cruises and shuttle services out to individual islands Beausoleil Island off Honey Harbor just outside Midland is the focus or launching pad of the islands park very well equipped for camping there are no restaurant facilities on any of the islands so be sure to take your own supplies The Tobermory Islands are renowned for their rock formations most notably Flowerpot Island where tall limestone monoliths have been eroded into bizarre vase like shapes Thunder Bay For vacationers this town strategically located on Lake Superior s northwest shore is a springboard to the national parks of Ontario s interior But it s also worth taking a look first at the impressive port facilities of this western terminus of the St Lawrence Great Lakes Seaway which has given Thunder Bay its second name the Lakehead Freighters come 3 200 km 1 920 miles inland from the Atlantic to take on grain shipments from the Prairie Provinces or bring other heavy cargo to all points west in both Canada and the United States Starting out from the centrally located North Marina a harbor cruise takes you around the gigantic fortress like grain silos for a close up view of the ships in dock A longer cruise from the same marina follows the Kaministikwia River to Old Fort William 20 minutes by car the handsomely reconstructed trading post of the Nor Westers intrepid rivals of the Hudson s Bay Company see page 16 Sheep graze the courtyard lawns bread is still made in the bakery and the cookhouse provides lusty country fare In the company store you ll see the kind of simple copper and pewter utensils and steel knives that were more precious than gold to the Mid wiwin Indians bringing in their beaver pelts Just up the road 40 km 25 miles northwest of Thunder Bay the beautiful Kakabeka Falls is surrounded by its own provincial park providing a quiet natural setting that s a far cry from Niagara A boardwalk takes you through the woods along the Kaministikwia River and across a bridge for a view of the falls from both sides The 151 m 154 ft cascade flows at its fullest in spring and autumn when the hydrostations don t slow it down There are good facilities for camping and bathing Canoeists and hikers really intent on getting away from civilization head two hours west of Thunder Bay along Highway 11 to the Quetico Provincial Park This is the country through which the Nor Westers coureurs de bois paddled their way to the Indian trappers remote camps adopting the natives lore for tackling the wilderness including their snowshoes toboggans and birchbark canoes The indigenous peoples have been here for 9 000 years and have left their colored pictographs of moose caribou bears and turtles etched in the granite cliffs The only road into the park leads to the Dawson Trail Campgrounds on French Lake pleasant for a day s picnic and swimming For longer stays the information office provides detailed maps of Quetico s fantastic network of interlocking waterways You can rent a canoe no motor launches allowed and fishing equipment excellent pike bass and trout in the old mining and logging town of Atikokan Ottawa Like most national capitals created artificially to avoid favoring one established metropolis over another Ottawa is the perennial butt of carping and jokes It s true of Washington of Bras lia of Canberra and even more so in Canada where the very idea of a centralized federal government is so hotly contested by its independent minded provinces People rarely like government at the best of times and when it s the town s main almost exclusive industry they have a built in prejudice against it But Ottawa s second major source of income is nonetheless tourism because the town is pleasant offering a pretty setting of parks and waterways for its first class museums and colorful monuments The country s short history is epitomized by a skyline of solid Victorian parliamentary buildings and a bold modern architecture of office blocks and the new National Gallery And the government machinery remains firmly in touch with its roots when in winter the bureaucrats skate and ski to work along the frozen Rideau Canal Accommodatingly situated on the border between Ontario and Qu bec Ottawa is a fully bilingual city though most of the French speaking community and the best restaurants now have their homes in Hull on the Qu bec side of the Ottawa River Except for longer excursions try to leave the car in the hotel parking lot and walk or take the bus The complex system of one way streets designed to avoid rather than to reach key government buildings and the added confusion of curving rivers and canals make downtown driving a harrowing business even for locals One other point In the absence of any clear logic in street numbering it s important when noting an address to be sure you have the nearest cross streets as well as the number of the building Parliament Area Like the Parliament assemblage in London from which they unashamedly take their architectural inspiration the Parliament Buildings are an imposing Neo Gothic pile restored from the ruins left after a devastating fire in 1916 a current restoration is slated for completion in the year 2000 They dominate the Ottawa River from a bluff somewhat exaggeratedly known as Parliament Hill As a counterpart to Westminster s Big Ben the 98 m 294 ft Peace Tower with clocks on all four sides and a 53 bell carillon was built in front of the Center Block as a monument to World War I Take the elevator to the observation deck for a fine view of the town from just below the clocks Guided tours take in the chambers of the Senate in place of Britain s House of Lords and the House of Commons If you want to attend a debate the tourist office National Arts Centre 53 Elgin Street at Confederation Square will advise you on how to get a permit The handsome pine paneled Library of Parliament north of the Centre Block miraculously survived the 1916 fire Beneath the formidable Gothic rotunda you ll see an imperial almost goddess like marble statue of Victoria surrounded by more mortal early Canadian Prime Ministers Some of the latter s offices have been restored in the East Block which also survived the fire in its 1872 state Switching its echoes from Westminster to Buckingham Palace Parliament Hill provides pomp with a Changing of the Guard by 125 soldiers of the Governor General s Foot Guards June 23 to August 25 2001 at 9 45 a m On summer evenings a sound and light show illuminates the Parliament Buildings to present alternately in English and French a 30 minute history of Canada Sparks Street Mall the first street in Ottawa to be paved and then the city s indeed the country s first traffic free pedestrian zone is a pleasant shopping area enlivened by street musicians and clowns and bordered by some first class modern office buildings Pride of place goes to the elegant 12 story mirror glass Bank of Canada between Kent and Bank Streets by Arthur Erickson The green patina of the building s copper skeleton is an artful homage to the copper roofs on the old Parliament Buildings Inside is the Currency Museum see page 78 On the vast three sided Confederation Square popularly known for its traffic congestion as Confusion Square notice the great granite arch of the National War Memorial with its statues of 22 World War I soldiers and a horse drawn cannon Ironically it was dedicated by George VI just three months before the outbreak of World War II The square s bunker like National Arts Centre 1969 houses the capital s ballet opera and theater but it s the summer beer garden overlooking the Rideau Canal that is the most popular attraction Getting a federal government s priorities in proper perspective one member of parliament bemoaned the cultural center as 50 years ahead of its time that s how long it ll take the taxpayers to meet the 500 percent cost overrun The formidable Ch teau Laurier 1912 a railway hotel on the north side of the square is built in the Renaissance castle style much favored by the C P R and C N R for their luxury transcontinental hostelries Local citizens boast that the Rideau Canal which stretches 200 km 120 miles from the Ottawa River to Lake Ontario qualifies in winter as the world s longest skating rink In summer it offers delightful boat cruises and canoeing or you can explore its banks with a rented bicycle On the edge of the parliamentary district across the Rideau Canal is Byward Market one block east of Sussex Drive and north of Rideau Street Since 1846 when it was a clearing house for nearby farmers this has been the popular center of town meeting place for the non politicos In its jolly well restored state only one of the market stalls dates as far back as 1867 but the market retains much of its 19th century atmosphere Quite apart from the colorful stalls of fruit and vegetables it s a great place for breakfast open even on Sundays in a town that otherwise closes down when the bureaucrats go home Sussex Drive This is the grand parade drive along the Ottawa River to the town s smartest residential neighborhood home of ministers and Embassy Row The Neo Gothic Basilica of Notre Dame Sussex at Guigues was born with the capital The Catholic cathedral s steeples went up in 1858 though the whole church was not completed until 1890 Qu bec sculptors Louis Philippe H bert Philippe Parizeau and Flavien Rochon carved the pulpit choir stalls organ loft and bas reliefs Turn off on St Patrick Street to drive through Nepean Point Park to a statue of Samuel de

water into the Ottawa River The windmill is part of a Renewable Energy Exhibit of methods of gathering solar and wind energy For Canadians 24 Sussex Drive has the same significance as 10 Downing Street for the British This grey stone house hidden behind the greenery is the Canadian Prime Minister s residence His neighborhood in Rideau Hall just along the road 1 Sussex Drive is the official residence of the monarchy the governor general Except on official occasions the guards in appropriately British uniforms will usually let you drive or walk in to admire the sweeping stretch of lawns and gardens look for the governor s toboggan slide and skating rink The drive then circles around the immaculate gardens and fine mansions of Rockcliffe Park The park s driveway takes you out to the Rockcliffe Lookout for a spectacular view of the Ottawa River and the mouth of the Gatineau In the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Barracks at the north end of St Laurent Boulevard you can see some of the horses performing or training for the popular RCMP Musical Ride the one occasion when the Mounties are still Mounties Museums In its sparkling new premises on Sussex Drive opposite the Basilica of

Evans and August Sander to the contemporary work of Diane Arbus and Paul Diamond The august Victoria Memorial Building at Metcalfe and McLeod Streets houses museums created with the treasures uncovered by the Geological Survey of 1841 predating the foundation of Canada itself The survey went beyond geology and mineralogy to study the uncharted country s paleontology and anthropology its climate forestry and botany In the National Museum of Natural Sciences in the east wing the star attraction is Dinosaur Court devoted to the 75 000 000 year old beasts excavated in Alberta The museum is a good place to look at the country s rich wildlife as a primer to your own explorations of the Canadian forests and mountains The National Museum of Science and Technology 1867 St Laurent Boulevard is in the style of science through fun and games In Canada s largest museum there are views of the heavens through a huge refracting telescope do it yourself demonstrations of balance and optics and a plastic bubble with live chicks hatching in front of your eyes But with all the new fangled razzmatazz the museum hasn t forgotten the charm of mint condition antique cars and above all old train engines behemoths from the great era of steam that truly made Canada In a similar vein the National Aviation Museum at Rockcliffe Airport traces the history of aviation through the early flying machines bi and triplanes and the great fighters of two world wars The exhibition includes the Silver Dart the first plane flown in the British Empire in 1909 A special place is reserved for the sturdy little bushplanes used to cover the wilderness In all about 100 aircraft are displayed in three World War II hangars Many of the wartime planes take to the skies again on Annual

minute drive across the Ottawa River into Qu bec and actually the most popular of excursions from the national capital this 36 000 hectare 89 000 acre park of lakes and woodland covers an escarpment with dramatic lookouts over the plains of the Ottawa Valley It s named after the French hunter Nicolas Gatineau who first explored it and its evergreen and deciduous forests are still the home of an abundant wildlife Go hiking or biking on well planned nature trails details can be obtained from the Old Chelsea Visitors Center Besides swimming at five public beaches you can rent canoes and rowboats for fishing on Philippe and La P che lakes Visit Kingsmere the charming estate where William Lyon Mackenzie King spent his last years As well as exploring the occult he spoke to his departed mother through a crystal ball Canada s longest serving Prime Minister liked to collect ruins on his many world travels Among others you ll find in his gardens pieces of London s House of Commons brought back after the Blitz of World War II Eastern Ontario The narrow arm of territory between Ottawa and the St Lawrence River lies at the historic heart of Upper Canada This was the home of early Loyalist settlers Ships were built here to navigate the Great Lakes and later it became the site for the key section of the St Lawrence Seaway linking Montr al to Lake Ontario Upper Canada Village Here 86 km 53 miles southeast of Ottawa the two strands of the region s history come together in the meticulous recreation of a 19th century pioneering village perhaps the best of the country s many historical showpieces The homes of the region s first settlers had to be moved here east of Morrisburg when their original location was flooded in the digging of the St Lawrence Seaway Start your visit by climbing the small fort tower from which you get an overall view In a peaceful green canalside setting disturbed only by perky Canada geese notoriously loud honkers you ll find authentic pre 1867 buildings from the simple timbered sawmill or old schoolhouse to the sophisticated brick built Crysler Hall in the Palladian style favored by colonial land owners from Ontario to Alabama Crysler was a farmer on whose land an important battle was fought in the War of 1812 marked by a monument beside the village Period costumed artisans demonstrate the crafts of the village weaving bread baking plowing and sowing In the colonial setting of Willard s Hotel you can enjoy a home cooked hot meal or salad lunch Kingston Beautifully located on Lake Ontario at the head of the St Lawrence River 180 km 108 miles southwest of Ottawa the town gets its charm more from its universities and silvery grey historic houses than from its federal and provincial prisons Originally a trading post for the French and native peoples Kingston became a shipbuilding naval base in the War of 1812 Fort Henry now spruced up by nicely enacted parades was built in 1832 as the main military stronghold of Upper Canada The fort never fired a shot in anger but you can hear a few rifles and cannons blast off for the Ceremonial Retreat on Wednesday and Saturday evenings in July and August For a few years in the 1840s its location made Kingston capital of pre Confederation Canada and the sturdy pillared City Hall with its lofty dome pays due homage to an illustrious past Behind on Market Square the weekend market attracts the best of Ontario s fruit and vegetables and the most brazen of the local artists and musicians Thousand Islands Reached most easily from Kingston this archipelago of in fact 1 700 islands are strung out along the St Lawrence River for nearly 80 km 48 miles You can go fishing sailing or lie back and enjoy a luxury three day cruise around the islands aboard the Empress steamboat The island scenery is another painter s delight the dark green of the spruces and silver birches against grey and pink granite outcrops Millionaires such as songwriter Irving Berlin and cosmetic queen Helena Rubinstein made this their playground with hideaway mansions known as cottages One that escapes that euphemism is Boldt s Castle the kind of Gothic folly that magnates liked to dabble in earlier this century In this case it was George Boldt the German owner of New York s Waldorf Astoria Hotel He built it for his wife but she died before it was finished and it was abandoned as a vast empty fortress like those that Boldt admired in similar splendid ruin back home in the Rhine Valley QUEBEC If oh happy dream all the old ethnic rivalries could be set aside most Canadians would acknowledge that Qu bec is not only the original Canada of the first European settlement but also the province that most comprehensively encompasses within its borders the world s image of this huge country To begin with it is itself huge It could contain according to your taste three Frances or seven Britains Most of it two thirds of the area is forest The north is coniferous serving the province s important pulp and paper industry and the south is deciduous with the maple of the national flag providing delicious syrup and the ash oak and beech that blaze into crimson amber and gold in autumn There aren t as many beavers as in the great days of the fur trade but still enough to fell a few trees around the resort cottages in the Laurentian Mountains north of Montr al Deer and moose abound for the hunters farther north there are herds of caribou and up towards the Arctic Circle a few polar bears too Where it s not forest city or the farmland established by the habitants of the St Lawrence Valley and the Eastern Township Loyalists it s water water everywhere The mighty St Lawrence River and Seaway link the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes Gigantic dams harness the water s hydroelectric power north on James Bay and east on the Manicouagan River Lakes and streams shimmer with salmon trout eel and pike As you travel from bilingual Montr al to New France s old capital Qu bec City and the resolutely French speaking farm villages along the St Lawrence and around the Gasp Peninsula have a thought for local patriotic sensibility The Qu b cois can justly claim to be cofounders of the Canadian nation Abandoned by what many still call the damned French maudits fran ais they felt that they alone had earned the name of canadiens and that their British conquerors usurped it As a tribute to their own past courage there is both pride and resentment in the Qu b cois motto Je me souviens I Remember It was they who made the first and hardiest effort to hew a modern living out of this hard land Like colonials everywhere their missionaries sometimes brought more religion their traders more alcohol and their soldiers more guns than the natives really needed But the Qu b cois understood the importance of learning from the native peoples how best to handle the Canadian wilderness Fur trading coureurs de bois settled down with Indian wives and today more than a few Qu b cois proudly trace their ancestry back to native peoples with a tell tale birthmark on the hip high cheekbones or long sleek black hair Outside Montr al you can t assume everyone speaks English Many make it a point of pride not to until you ve at least paid them the courtesy of a Bonjour By Qu bec provincial law public signs are all in French and so we will often give you here beside the English names the French version as it appears on maps and signposts Montr al This great metropolis Qu bec s largest city with 3 1 million inhabitants is built on an island at the confluence of the Ottawa and St Lawrence rivers Second in population now to Toronto it remains a sprawling city of cosmopolitan neighborhoods each a delight to stroll around but best reached by taxi bus or the excellent M tro where the trains whoosh along on rubber tires Given the daytime traffic snarls and usual big city parking problems use your car only for out of town trips Mount Royal For an overall view of the city start with a bracing walk up the slopes of the charming Mount Royal Park Parc du Mont Royal Follow the footpath and stairs from the end of Peel Street or a shorter route from the Chemin Remembrance car park Perhaps the most pleasant way is to take a leisurely ride in a horse drawn carriage from Dominion Square Known with characteristic local irony as la Montagne the Mountain the heights were spotted by Jacques Cartier on his historic journey up the St Lawrence River in 1535 and named Mont R al in homage to his king Fran ois I From the massive timber and stone Chalet de la Montagne or the steel cross at the summit illuminated at night you can look out over the river flowing from the Lac des Deux Montagnes past the city on its northeasterly journey to the Atlantic Montr alers conveniently twist the compass by considering the St Lawrence as south of the city the roads parallel to the river are divided into east and west sectors by the Boulevard St Laurent Down by the port are the low stone buildings of Old Montr al Vieux Montr al The concrete steel and glass towers of the modern city cluster around Boulevard Ren L vesque which runs parallel to the river At the far end Jacques Cartier Bridge links Montr al Island to the Expo 67 site on St Helen s Island Ile Ste H l ne and over to the southern shore Victoria Bridge spans the St Lawrence to the south Southwest of Mount Royal on the slopes of the smaller hill of Westmount are the grand villas and mansions of Montr al s old Anglo Canadian lite North and west of the park are many of the city s ethnic neighborhoods and the chic French speaking township of Outremont On the clearest days you may spot the Laurentian Mountains to the northeast and the Green Mountains across the U S border in Vermont Landscaped by Frederick Law Olmsted designer of New York s Central Park Mount Royal is a popular refuge from the city bustle the place for picnics in the summer and tobogganing and skiing in the winter with the little Beaver Lake Lac des Castors for sailing model boats or skating A stroll around the lake is the perfect way to capture a sense of the town s ethnic diversity On the park benches you may hear gossip not only in French and English but Italian Greek Yiddish and Russian Old Montr al Between rue St Antoine and the port and flanked by rue McGill and rue Berri this is the site of Maisonneuve s original settlement of Ville Marie M tro Champ de Mars All but a few stones of the 18th century city ramparts have gone but many historic houses have been restored to evoke some of the flavor of New France The colorful tree lined Place Jacques Cartier makes a good point from which to start a walking tour or a riding tour in a horse drawn cal che available here for hire An itinerary can be mapped out over coffee at one of the many pleasant sidewalk caf s Once a fruit and vegetable market the cobblestone square remains a favorite venue for flower vendors and itinerant artists The old stone buildings were designed to beat the harsh winters with distintive tall steep sloping roofs to keep the weighty snow and ice from accumulating Across the rue Notre Dame the 19th century H tel de Ville City Hall is built in the imposing style of the French Renaissance It was from the balcony beneath the clock in 1967 that General de Gaulle delivered his incendiary cry of Vive le Qu bec libre warming the hearts of local separatists The general was not intimidated by the statue of Lord Horatio Nelson watching him from the top of Place Jacques Cartier Montr al s oldest monument was somewhat provocatively erected in 1809 just four years after the British admiral s devastating defeat of the French at Trafalgar Diagonally opposite the H tel de Ville on rue Notre Dame the Ch teau Ramezay was home of the French governor Claude de Ramezay from 1705 to 1724 It passed successively into the hands of the French West Indies Trading Company to store its spices the British and during their brief occupation of the city in 1775 the American generals Richard Montgomery and Benedict Arnold Benjamin Franklin stayed here during his fruitless attempt to win Qu bec over to the American cause After years of neglect the ch teau has been restored and transformed into a museum showing a more comfortable side of frontier life in New France elegant 18th century furnishings a grand colonial kitchen in the basement and the nice added touch of magnificent carved mahogany paneling imported from the old trading company s French offices Iroquois clothes and artifacts give a hint of life outside the stockade The rue Bonsecours is one of the principal historic residential streets leading from rue Notre Dame towards the Vieux Port Old Port The Maison Papineau Number 440 distinguished by its double row of gabled garrets in the roof dates back to 1785 It is the family home of the controversial 19th century politician Louis Joseph Papineau leader of the militant patriotes but also cautious protector of his seigneurial property see page 19 In 1837 the house nearly burned down in a violent riot and British soldiers had to come to Papineau s rescue He fled to the countryside and did not take part in the subsequent insurrection On the corner of rue St Paul the older Maison du Calvet was built in 1725 by a prominent Huguenot merchant As a Protestant Pierre du Calvet was appointed by the British justice of the peace but then ended up in jail himself for selling supplies and information to the American invaders With its broad chimney fine grained limestone frames around the doors and gracefully tapered casement windows the house is one of the more handsome architectural specimens of the French colonial era The sturdy interior of wide rough hewn floorboards and massive pinewood roofbeams is fitted out from the Montr al Museum of Fine Arts with antique Qu bec furniture rugs lanterns clocks and porcelain appropriate to the life of a wealthy 18th century businessman A framed copy of the bilingual Qu bec Gazette dating from 1786 suggests that colonials of the New World had an uncommon interest in the more arcane news of international events in the Old World such as Turkey s troubles with Venice or the quarrels of the Dutch royal family Since 1772 the church of Notre Dame de Bonsecours 400 rue Saint Paul Est has stood on the site of a chapel that was built for the colony s first schoolteacher Marguerite Bourgeois but destroyed by fire She and three young woman companions brought a civilizing influence to the harshness of the beleaguered settlement Acting as both teachers and nurses they also took charge of marriageable girls known as the filles du Roi the King s daughters The filles du Roi were in fact daughters of peasants and poor artisans shipped over from France as wives for bachelor farmers and fur traders In the 19th century Notre Dame de Bonsecours became the Sailors Chapel to which survivors of shipwrecks brought model ships they had carved as offerings of thanksgiving The models still hang from the ceiling lit up now by tiny electric bulbs Notice how the trompe l oeil painting on the low arched ceiling aspires to turn the little church into a lofty Gothic cathedral Climb the church tower for a good view of Vieux Montr al and the harbor Most of the ugly old warehouses have been demolished along the Vieux Port at the foot of Place Jacques Cartier Some have been refurbished as caf s or hotels one pier now houses the headquarters for the Cirque du Soleil another an IMAX theater Take a walk along the port to Pointe Calli res where the Ville Marie settlers first landed An obelisk on the nearby Place Royale commemorates their adventure The statue at the Pointe is of an Anglo Canadian John Young who developed the port s commerce in the 19th century The rue St Sulpice takes you over the Place d Armes close to the site of the first French battles with the Iroquois Today it serves as a visual link between the historic old town of the pioneers and the new city of commerce and industry In the middle is a statue of Maisonneuve looking very like one of Alexandre Dumas musketeers He s brandishing the royal French fleur de lys flag that inspired the Qu bec provincial flag of today The 19th century Neo Gothic Notre Dame Basilica was designed by James O Donell an Irish Protestant New Yorker so inspired by his assignment that he converted to Catholicism It once took 12 men to ring the great bell in the west tower a task now accomplished with electricity The garishly opulent interior was the work of a Qu b cois Victor Bourgeau Our Lady of the Sacred Heart Chapel behind the main altar unites modern and traditional religious art in a more intimate setting for marriages and memorial services A little museum displays church sculpture and painting notably some almost surreal works by Pierre Adolphe Arthur Guindon a Sulpician monk Next to the church is the Seminary of St Sulpice Montr al s oldest surviving edifice built in 1685 to lead the missionary work among the Iroquois It also boasts North America s oldest public clock 1710 The Place d Armes is enclosed on three sides by modern buildings including the huge Post Office tower while opposite Notre Dame stands the venerable Bank of Montr al 1847 The black marble and brass of its monumental entrance hall impose a pious appreciation of Canada s oldest banking institution The statue of Patria is dedicated to the fallen of World War I Take a peek too around the grand Exchange Room awe inspiring relic of the days when Canadian money was in the hands of august gentlemen before they handed it over to those slick young Golden Boys of Toronto A little banking museum shows the way it used to be complete with a teller s window in the style of the bank s foundation in 1817 Back down by the river Place d Youville named after a lady who established here the charitable order of the Grey Nuns offers a quieter more romantic end to your tour of Vieux Montr al The Youville Stables Ecuries d Youville are an enchanting collection of early 19th century grey stone gabled buildings now containing restaurants and offices looking out onto a peaceful garden The U shaped courtyard makes a lovely setting for open air plays and recitals in the summer The stables were in fact nothing more romantic than a warehouse but they did for a time serve as a garage for horse carriages Next to the stables is an old red brick fire station transformed into the Montr al History Center Centre d histoire de Montr al presenting an audiovisual documentary history of the city Downtown The nucleus of downtown Montr al is located between Boulevard Ren L vesque and Sherbrooke Street running parallel to the river bounded by Guy and St Denis Streets It is best characterized by its bold new office skyscrapers cultural complexes and shopping centers crowding in on a die hard bunch of old churches museums and all night delicatessens Start at Square Dorchester where the horse drawn cal ches wait they are also rather nicely known as hippomobiles Artists and flower vendors sell their wares around Henry Moore s sculpture Reclining Nude and more austere statues of Scottish poet Robert Burns and Canadian Prime Ministers Wilfrid Laurier and John MacDonald The Sun Life skyscraper built in 1933 is the city s oldest There s a summer city tourist information kiosk on the south side of the square and a year round office north of the square at 1010 rue Ste Catherine Ouest Northeast along Boulevard Ren L vesque is the Roman Catholic cathedral of Montr al something of a visual oddity at least for European visitors The cathedral of Marie Reine du Monde Mary Queen of the World is a 19th century half size replica of St Peter s Basilica in Rome Half size but still massive enough inside the nave is 109 m 328 ft long the transept is 73 m 220 ft long and the vault of the dome is 83 m 250 ft high Beneath that dome over the high altar is another replica of St Peter s Bernini s celebrated gilded bronze canopy Unfortunately there is nothing to match Bernini s great square to give you a proper perspective and the church is dwarfed by the huge Queen Elizabeth Hotel and the Sun Life skyscraper The new gigantism continues with Place Ville Marie 1962 dominated by the other side of the Queen Elizabeth Canadian National Railway s Central Station and the soaring Royal Bank building an intersecting cross shaped tower designed by I M Pei The Qu bec provincial tourist information office is at the northern corner of the square near the intersection of Peel and St Catherine Street West But Place Ville Marie is above all the starting point of Montr al s vast underground city which acts as an ecological punchline to the joke of a Qu bec winter In self defense against five or six months of ice snow and slush 500 000 pedestrians frequent a complete alternative city of shops cinemas nightclubs restaurants and caf s Hotel residents can spend a whole night out on the town in the winter months without overcoat or galoshes And it s almost as popular on a sweltering day in July Some 30 km 15 miles of subterranean galleries linked by M tro stretch across the city taking in Place Ville Marie and Place Bonaventure Les Terrasses Place des Arts and Complexe Desjardins and even passing under the St Lawrence River to the suburb of Longueuil on the south shore Above ground rue Ste Catherine is the city s main shopping thoroughfare department stores cinemas travel agencies delicatessens and bars more popular than chic but always lively At the corner of University Street the Anglican cathedral of Christ Church 1859 is a classic piece of elegant English Gothic take a look inside at the fine stone sculpture on the high altar Crescent Street with neighboring Mountain Montagne and Bishop Streets is one of Montr al s more fashionable boutique and bistro areas The Victorian stone row houses have escaped demolition and have been lovingly refurbished and brightly painted for conversion into off beat shops art galleries and bars for the singles crowd These rejuveniated buildings make an appropriate transition from Ste Catherine to the elegance of Sherbrooke Street With the Museum of Fine Arts see page 105 near the intersection of Crescent Street Sherbrooke is the town s main gallery row where high priced antiques jewelry silverware and Oriental carpet shops mingle Even if you re not staying here the ritzy Ritz Carlton Hotel makes a fine rendezvous for a restful or bracing cocktail in mid sightseeing Opposite the McCord Museum of local history see page 106 McGill University is Montr al s internationally renowned English speaking university Founded in the early 19th century by a Scottish fur trader James McGill and especially respected for its engineering and medicine faculties it has a student enrollment of 15 000 In 1969 Qu b cois separatists staged violent but unsuccessful demonstrations to have it transformed into a French speaking institution The city s other English speaking college is Concordia while the Universit de Montr al and the Universit du Qu bec Montr al are both French speaking Between Maisonneuve and R L vesque boulevards art and commerce come together at the Place des Arts and Complexe Desjardins The modern cultural center is comprised of a concert hall two theaters and a recital room for chamber music At the Salle Wilfrid Pelletier 175 rue Ste Catherine Ouest home of the Montr al Symphony Orchestra the elegant tone of the whole complex is set in the foyer decorated with Aubusson tapestries and sculptures in bronze mahogany aluminum and ceramics Notice above the concert hall doors the soapstone carvings of the Inuit sculptor Yununkpuk Across rue Ste Catherine you pass through the imposing glass portals of the attractive multilevel shopping center of Complexe Desjardins opened in 1976 during the grand building spree of the Montr al Olympic Games Montr al s Neighborhoods From a local point of view Vieux Montr al is a tourist attraction for the landmarks of the city s historical beginnings while downtown is for business and special nights out But the real color and spice of the people s everyday life is to be found in their neighborhoods And you ll find in the architecture the missing links between the French inspired homes of Vieux Montr al and the international anonymity of the city center s 20th century skyscrapers While the bourgeoisie s red brick or stone houses are clearly inspired by Georgian and Victorian London and grander residences by the country houses and ch teaux of continental Europe the working class row houses with outside iron staircases leading to upper floors thus saving space inside are a more characteristic Montr al feature Almost a neighborhood all to itself Boulevard St Laurent used to mark the border between the Anglo Canadians to the west and the French Canadians to the east Anglos call it the Main and French Canadians make a nice and rare compromise with la Main The neighborhood lines have blurred in recent years but the Main stays appropriately neutral a veritable United Nations of Portuguese Italian Greek Spanish Polish Jewish Arab and Japanese specialty shops grocery stores delicatessens and caf s Gourmets make a special pilgrimage down a little side street to Waldman s fish market French speaking students from the Universit du Qu bec Montr al meet in caf s bistros and bookshops along rue St Denis Here and around the tree shaded Square St Louis nicely restored or equally nicely battered Victorian gingerbread mansions and iron staircased row houses fight a picturesque rear guard action against the encroachment of the modern red brick blocks of the university At the West End of the square rue Prince Arthur has been transformed into a pleasant tile paved pedestrian mall of boutiques and restaurants The street is also one of the town s livelier night time hangouts for jazz and folk music Boulevard St Laurent below L vesque squeezed out by the urban redevelopment around the Complexe Guy Favreau and Palais des Congr s the compact little Chinatown huddles into a six block area around rue de la Gaucheti re Some of its residents are descendants of the valiant laborers who helped build the Canadian Pacific Railway Seek out Montr al s Little Italy north of Mount Royal around the Jean Talon Market on the Place du March du Nord M tro Jean Talon The best trattorias in town are here blessedly not the most expensive The raucous market gives a distinctively Italian flavor to the fruit and vegetables of the Qu bec countryside The Greeks some 50 000 strong have mostly chosen the area around the Avenue du Parc east of Outremont for their caf s and tavernas With second and third generation prosperity most of the Jews have moved on from the rue St Urbain neighborhood made famous by the writings of Mordecai Richler The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz to make way gradually for an equally colorful Portuguese community A nearby monument of Jewish folklore that no amount of urban upheavals can seem to budge is the ever crowded Schwartz s Delicatessen officially called Montr al Hebrew Delicatessen located at 3895 Boulevard St Laurent Assimilating more easily with the Anglo community only Protestant schools accepted their children Eastern European Jews have graduated to wealthy Westmount or emigrated again to Toronto French speaking Jews more recent arrivals from North Africa have settled in middle class Outremont On the north side of Mount Royal beyond the Chemin de la C te Ste Catherine the handsome villas of Outremont make up the favored neighborhood of the French Canadian bourgeoisie in fact an independent township situated within Montr al s city borders Originally an Anglo stronghold part of it is still known even among French speakers as Upper Outremont family home of that splendidly ambiguous French Canadian prime minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau The lower part of this independent township has a breezy street life especially among the sidewalk caf s on rue Bernard And where have all the Anglos gone Many of the upper middle class variety are holding out in Westmount This bastion of the old Montr al lite of British origin became a prime target for the more violent members of the separatist Front de lib ration du Qu bec who in the 1960s set off bombs in Westmount s mailboxes Those not put off by this can still be seen in tweeds and cavalry twill walking their dogs around Summit Park where the Belvedere affords a fine view of the city Head for the tree lined Summit Road Summit Crescent and Summit Circle and you ll spot their ivy covered mansions and grey stone turreted ch teaux half concealed behind trees and shrubbery at the top of a grassy slope The architecture here is a wonderful compendium of French Romanesque German Gothic and Italian Renaissance Westmount Square gives you a sharp but not inelegant jolt back into the 20th century with the black steel and glass office buildings of Mies van der Rohe Dominating the skyline beyond Westmount on the C te des Neiges St Joseph s Oratory Oratoire St Joseph receives up to 2 million Catholic pilgrims each year The huge sanctuary which holds 13 000 worshippers commemorates the healing powers of Brother Andr Born Alfred Bessette in 1845 one of a poor Qu b cois family of 12 children Brother Andr was gatekeeper at the monastic Congregation of the Holy Cross He administered to the sick in a small wooden chapel that he himself erected it is still standing near the transept of the present oratory Over a million faithful attended his funeral in 1937 His tomb is in the crypt The best time to enjoy the bright and airy simplicity of the oratory s modern interior is at the Sunday afternoon organ recitals Olympic Park Situated east of downtown opposite Maisonneuve Park M tro Pie IX the impressive complex of sports facilities built specifically for the 1976 Olympic Games is an eloquent monument to the visions of grandeur that characterized Mayor Jean Drapeau After the sweeping some would say devastating downtown redevelopment and the ambitious construction on the St Lawrence River for Expo 67 the Olympic Park was to be the apotheosis of his new Montr al As you can see on one of the daily guided tours through Olympic Park the result is as grandiose in design as it has been ruinous in cost to the continuing chagrin of local taxpayers with long memories and short bank balances Centerpiece is the mammoth Olympic Stadium seating 70 000 spectators for the home games of the Montr al Expos baseball team and rock n roll concerts One of the most popular facilities is the V lodrome with a redwood track for cycling and roller skating around a central arena for boxing wrestling and basketball with ice skating in winter Montr al s legendary ice hockey team the Canadiens plays at the other end of town at the Molson Centre a new arena near Place Bonaventure Beside the Olympic Park across Sherbrooke Street are the city s Botanical Gardens at 4101 Sherbrooke East This delightful oasis of greenery boasts some 26 000 species of plants and trees from all over the world lovingly tended to resist the rigors of the Qu bec climate A miniature railway takes you around the gardens Among the highlights are magnificent orchids and cacti in the greenhouses and an exquisite arboretum of Japanese bonsai St Lawrence River After years of hiding the river behind a bleak expanse of warehouses factories and railway tracks Montr al has opened up its waterfront more recently with the music festivals and flea market of the Vieux Port but largely at the earlier instigation of that much maligned Mayor Drapeau Expo 67 provided the major breakthrough with the choice of the river s Ile Ste H l ne as the principal site for the international pavilions The former U S pavilion has been converted into the Biosphere an ecology oriented museum Two other buildings house a new casino The fun and adventure of the World s Fair are perpetuated with outdoor concerts exhibits and films on ecology urban life Canadian history and the technology of the future In the middle of the island close to where the French army burned its flags in Montr al s military capitulation to the British in 1760 the D M Stewart Museum is a restoration of the fort commissioned by the Duke of Wellington 60 years later The military drills and parades staged here in the summer by uniformed students pay appropriate homage to both French and British more precisely the Scots Highlander tradition The fort s Military and Maritime Museum displays ship models maps navigational instruments and Canada s weapons and uniforms from the 17th century to World War II Beyond Jacques Cartier Bridge La Ronde amusement park plays every imaginable ultramodern variation on the swings and roundabouts of a country fair Put the kids on the Gyrotron whirligig or Aquapark waterslide and watch or forget about them from the beer garden The closest Montr al can take you to the tropics is among its exotic fish in the Aquarium on the other side of Dolphin Lake Lac des Dauphins from the waterslide park A bridge leading from the Ste H l ne M tro station crosses over to the Ile Notre Dame This artificial island built from landfill dredged for canal construction has been embellished by Les Floralies flower park in the center of a circuit for Grand Prix motor racing On the island s southern tip beyond the Victoria Bridge you can climb an observation tower for a view of the highly impressive St Lambert Lock a key point on the great St Lawrence Seaway From the Cit du Havre north of Victoria Bridge the controversial apartment complex of Habitat designed by the Israeli born architect Moshe Safdie for Expo 67 provides residents with a grandstand view of the river and its islands What looks to some like the aftermath of a child s tantrum among its building blocks is on closer inspection an artful composition of 354 precast concrete boxes originally hoisted into place by crane to create 158 homes of various sizes and combinations To see the river from the river take a harbor cruise from Quai Victoria the northern most wharf in Vieux Montr al at the foot of rue Berri For the more sporting breed rafting expeditions also start out from Quai Victoria to shoot the famous Lachine Rapids You can also rent a bicycle for a pleasant ride along the Lachine Canal dug in 1825 and deepened for the seaway in 1959 In winter it makes a great skating rink Museums Among the most important of Montr al s many museums is its Museum of Fine Arts Mus e des Beaux Arts 1380 Sherbrooke Street West It has an honorable collection of European artists including El Greco Rubens Hans Memling Cranach and Poussin and the British 18th century masters Reynolds Gainsborough Raeburn Romney and Hogarth The moderns include Picasso and Giacometti But it s worth devoting most of your time here to the excellent Canadian galleries In the 19th century section look for the imposing if rather severe classical portraits of Antoine S bastien Plamondon 1802 1895 and the markedly gentler works of his Qu b cois student and rival Th ophile Hamel 1817 1870 Mah Min or The Feather is a dramatic study of an Assiniboine Indian chief in Manitoba by Paul Kane 1810 1871 This Torontonian born in County Cork Ireland traveled all over the continent to gather a visual record at times somewhat romanticized of Canada s native peoples His contemporary Amsterdam born Cornelius Krieghoff 1815 1872 concentrated on the Qu bec peasantry and landscapes as you can see here with his striking Montmorency Falls in Winter The dazzling Village Street West Indies by Montr al s James Wilson Morrice 1865 1924 is a fine work by this most celebrated of Canada s expatriate painters A friend of Matisse he worked principally in Europe and North Africa Tom Thomson the Group of Seven and Emily Carr all have major works here But of the moderns the most significant represented is Paul Emile Borduas 1905 1960 His Les signes s envolent and L toile noire are stark disturbing abstracts by a man who began his career as a painter of church murals and stained glass Rebelling against conservative religion under the dual influences of surrealism and psychoanalysis Borduas led the school of Qu bec Automatistes represented here with outstanding works by Jean Paul Riopelle born in 1923 The Museum of Contemporary Art Mus e d Art Contemporain 185 rue Ste Catherine houses a stunning collection of works by Canadian and international artists The small but tastefully designed McCord Museum 690 Sherbrooke Street West provides some fascinating insights into Canadian life Inuit and Indian as well as the world of the fur trader and other pioneers of the 18th and 19th centuries Dominated by a totem pole from British Columbia the exhibits include costumes artifacts paintings drawings and magnificent old photographs from the William Notman archives said to contain 45 000 prints and negatives The Museum of Decorative Arts Mus e des arts d coratifs is housed in the 20th century Ch teau Dufresne corner of Sherbrooke and Boulevard Pie IX at 2200 rue Crescent More palazzo than ch teau with its frescoes and reinforced concrete columns clad in Italian marble the museum is devoted principally to international modern design in ceramics glass and textiles from 1940 to the present day Train enthusiasts should head out to the Canadian Railway Museum in the southern suburb of St Constant 122A rue St Pierre Ride an old tram to the country station where the sheds display historic train engines of the Canadian Pacific and the luxury private coach of William Van Horne the man who master minded the building of C P R s transcontinental railway On Sundays you can take a ride in one of the old steam trains Eastern Townships Stretching to the border with the U S states of Vermont and New Hampshire this pleasant region of farmland and orchards was settled at the end of the 18th century by Loyalist refugees from the American Revolution There s a distinctly New England flavor to the architecture of white clapboard houses in a landscape of rolling hills green meadows and lakes but the population is today overwhelmingly French speaking Tourist offices have tried to rename the area L Estrie but even the most militant Qu b cois prefer the customary direct if approximate translation of the English Cantons de l Est East on Motorway 10 a tour of the region makes an easy day trip out of Montr al but you may well choose to stay longer for a restful boat cruise picnic or ramble taking advantage of the many delightful old fashioned country inns and restaurants using the excellent local farm produce Popular with the sailing and windsurfing fraternity Lake Brome and the sleepy town of Knowlton make a pleasant first stop To see what the farmers are up to head over on Saturday mornings to the market in Sutton Take a leisurely boat cruise on Lake Memphremagog Beautiful Waters the region s largest stretching across the border into Vermont At St Beno t du Lac look for the graceful Neo Gothic grey stone silhouette of the Benedictine abbey much appreciated for the monks Gregorian chant The monks also make and sell some fine cheeses an Italian style ricotta blue Ermite and the Mont St Beno t great with the apples they grow in their orchard Farther east you ll find the most characteristic New England atmosphere around Lake Massawippi particularly in North Hatley where 19th century colonial mansions have been converted into elegant inns The town has some good antiques shops In summer The Piggery provides a home for one of the region s last surviving English language theaters Thanks to its situation in a sheltered valley North Hatley enjoys a particularly pleasant microclimate that attracts hummingbirds and flora indicative of more southern climes At Coaticook hikers and picnickers head for the wooded ravines along the Coaticook River In August the town stages a milk festival with the cows and some of the milkmaids dressed in fancy summer bonnets The great attraction at Cookshire is the June bread festival The Laurentians The densely forested rolling mountain range that the Qu b cois call les Laurentides constitutes a favorite summer and winter playground for the people of Montr al Swimming sailing canoeing waterskiing fishing hiking horseback riding golf the list of summer pleasures is endless In winter the skating and skiing downhill and cross country are the best in eastern Canada And the landscape is a pure joy with long narrow glacial lakes fed by cold streams gurgling down the granite mountain slopes of yellow birch beech sugar maple and fir The virgin forests were long a refuge for Algonquin Indians fleeing the Iroquois The Qu b cois began to settle here in any great numbers only in the second half of the 19th century when an enterprising curate Antoine Labelle of St J r me promoted it as an alternative for peasants who were otherwise immigrating to New England This southeastern edge of the great Canadian Shield proved poor farm country and difficult to exploit for logging but it really came into its own in the 20th century with the development of tourism In addition to local Montr alers it attracts steady traffic from New England The heart of the resort area is within an easy 90 minute to 2 hour drive from the city for a weekend or longer stay Motorway 15 northwest from Montr al then Highway 117 take you into forested foothills immediately beyond the metropolis Just 70 km 42 miles from the city St Sauveur des Monts makes a charming spot to stop for lunch on one of the roadside flowered terraces In winter the resort is popular for its floodlit nightskiing Ste Ad le on the shores of Lac Rond is a favorite with painters and their groupies The town s Village de S raphin recaptures the atmosphere of life in the Laurentians in the 1880s Probably the liveliest resort in the area is Ste Agathe des Monts It boasts plenty of good restaurants and folksong bars bo tes chansons and a famous summer theater Le Patriote Night owls overcome their hangover with a stroll or boat cruise around the Lac des Sables The full natural beauty of the Laurentians is best appreciated in Mont Tremblant Provincial Park Rent a canoe or kayak to explore some of the 500 lakes and rivers that sparkle across an area of 1 500 sq km 579 square miles It was the rush of those streams that inspired the Algonquin name Manitonga Sontana Mountain of the Trembling Spirit emitting its muffled boom when man disturbed its peace Mont Tremblant s 1 058 m 3 175 ft Johannsen peak is the highest in the Laurentians At the St Donat reception center or other entry points to the park you ll find detailed maps of self guiding nature trails with signposts describing the forest s flora and fauna The park also provides forest guides for group tours The park s wildlife even more abundant in the Rouge Matawin Nature Reserve to the north includes moose deer black bear otter mink muskrat fox and beaver Birdwatchers may spot grouse loon heron finches and warblers while anglers can hope to catch speckled and lake trout pike bass and walleye Qu bec City Whereas Montr al has become increasingly Americanized the provincial capital remains unmistakably even defiantly Qu b cois if not downright French It s difficult to miss in this proud cradle of New France that the town is borrowing a leaf from the book of the modern French republic by calling its provincial parliament the Assembl e Nationale Only one percent of the population of 664 000 do not speak French The historic center of the city has something of the atmosphere of France s Atlantic port towns in the neighborhood down by the St Lawrence River while the streets and squares up on the promontory offer North Americans a first hint of Paris s Latin Quarter or even Montmartre Certainly it s a town for that most Parisian of creatures the fl neur or stroller wandering at leisure through narrow back streets paying due homage to the monuments of Qu bec City s past triumphs and tribulations but even more alert to the colors and smells of the living present Qu bec is said to be derived from an Algonquin word meaning where the river narrows and this becomes most apparent when you see the city s great outcrop of rock jutting out over the St Lawrence It was named Cap Diamant after the shiny stones that Jacques Cartier mistook for diamonds see page 14 Thus the city dominated river traffic and prospered from a flourishing trade in fur lumber shipbuilding tanneries furniture and textiles Modern shipping and the advent of the railways crippled its port activities and the city now lives from the service industries of tourism and provincial government administration For the best view of the city s spectacular location cross over to the St Lawrence River s south bank and take the ferry traversier from the suburb of L vis Otherwise head through the airy but unexceptional modern city to the historic center of Old Qu bec where the fortified Upper and Lower Town stand at the top and bottom of Cap Diamant linked by a steep road and funicular railway Apart from the Citadel and Battlefields Park every sight worth seeing is within easy walking distance though you may like to try a 45 minute ride in a horse drawn cal che from the Parc de l Esplanade Upper Town Start on top of the rock where the city s principal landmark is a hotel the Ch teau Frontenac looming over the town since 1892 like the protective fortress it no longer needs Because of its dramatic location and the fairytale turrets of its Gothic Renaissance architecture the Frontenac is one of the most charmingly bombastic of all the many grand hotels that the Canadian Pacific and Canadian National railways put up across the country as symbols of their commercial power It is named after Count Louis de Frontenac a rascally 17th century French governor who upset the clergy by encouraging the sale of brandy to the native peoples Take a look inside at the stucco carvings tapestries and handsome wood paneling Behind the hotel beyond an 1898 statue of Samuel de Champlain the city s founder Dufferin Terrace offers a magnificent view over the St Lawrence and downriver to the Ile d Orl ans Stroll alongside a pleasant little garden Parc des Gouverneurs with its obelisk paying tribute to Generals Wolfe and Montcalm both killed at the great battle for Qu bec in 1759 The terrace is prolonged by the Promenade des Gouverneurs continuing the walk along the foot of the citadel towards Battlefields Park North of the Frontenac Place d Armes is the center of Old Qu bec where troops were mustered and paraded proclamations read out criminals whipped or executed In the middle the Monument of Faith Monument de la Foi commemorates the work of French Catholic missionaries in North America On the north side of the square the Mus e du Fort 10 rue Ste Anne stages a sound and light show alternately in English and French on the military history of Qu bec City Artists gather in the narrow rue du Tr sor at the northwest corner of the Place d Armes to display their works or paint your portrait The street leads into the city s Latin Quarter with a quite Parisian air to the 18th century houses caf s and bookshops around rue Couillard rue St Flavien and rue H bert The neighborhood s Latin derives from the scholarship of a Seminary rue de l Universit founded in 1663 by the first bishop of Qu bec Fran ois de Montmorency Laval In the summer open air concerts are held in the courtyard In the Mus e du S minaire 9 rue de l Universite you ll find a portrait of the crusty old bishop painted in 1672 by Brother Luc as well as landscapes by Joseph L gar and self portraits by Antoine Plamondon and Th ophile Hamel Set back behind tall trees off the rue des Jardins the Anglican Holy Trinity Cathedral of 1804 with its elegant spire will be familiar to Londoners for its respectful imitation of St Martin in the Fields Notice inside the solid old pews of English oak In an attractive garden setting the large Ursuline Convent was established in 1639 and rebuilt twice after fire Its chapel has a fine 18th century altar painting and pulpit Montcalm was buried here after the battle but only his skull remains in a museum otherwise devoted to the convent s first mother superior who compiled the first dictionary of the Iroquois and Algonquin languages The pasture for the convent s cattle is now the quiet spacious Parc de l Esplanade the perfect place to rest your tired sightseeing feet Lower Town Various stairways and the winding C te de la Montagne take you down past Montmorency Park to the site of Champlain s original colony which grew into the Ville Basse Lower Town One of the more hazardous ways down and so a favorite with children is the Escalier Casse Cou Breakneck Stairway merely dangerous when wet lethal when icy For the view take the funicular railway from Dufferin Terrace The funicular s Lower Town terminal was once the house of Louis Joliet great 17th century fur trader and explorer of the Mississippi River Champlain s Abitation of 1608 two wooden houses and a storehouse for furs surrounded by a stockade and a ditch stood on the Place Royale now a beautifully restored square of elegant 17th and 18th century houses In the center is a replica of a 1686 bust of Louis XIV Facing the Place Royale the church of Notre Dame des Victoires celebrates French victories over the British before 1759 After centuries of devastation by war fire plunder and sheer neglect the meticulous restoration work by the Qu bec provincial government has been a major act of faith in the cultural legacy of New France reinforcing the provincial motto Je me souviens After 1759 most colonial administrators and merchants just abandoned Qu bec while many who stayed on moved to the shelter of the new British defenses in the Upper Town During the 19th and early 20th centuries older buildings were often arbitrarily razed to make way for waterfront warehouses and workshops Among the historic houses on rue du March Champlain Maison Chevalier 1752 has become a museum of old Qu b cois furniture and domestic utensils The Maison Dumont 1689 on Place Royale is now the Maison des Vins selling good French wine and owned like all Qu b cois wine and alcohol retailers by the provincial government On the corner of the ruelle du Porche Maison Milot 1691 is notable for its sturdy roof beams The quaintest of the city s antiques shops have clustered around rue Sault au Matelot and rue St Paul down by the port The bargains here are old tools and kitchen utensils The city has renovated the warehouses of the Old Port Vieux Port as an entertainment area with concerts open air theater a craftware market and a couple of handsome old sailing ships Beyond the City Wall From the Parc de l Esplanade drive up the C te de la Citadelle hill road and through a tunnel for a guided tour around a powerful bastion of fears long gone The French built the starshaped Citadel in 1750 to resist the British The British enlarged it in 1820 to defend Qu bec City against the Americans but their cannons never fired a shot in anger The garrison was British manned for only 20 years before being handed over to Canadian troops Today it is the home of Canada s crack Royal 22nd

Assembl e Nationale provincial parliament built from 1877 1886 in the favored style of the time French Renaissance This has been the citadel of Qu bec s quest for a special identity in or outside the Canadian Confederation especially under Prime Minister Ren L vesque On Boulevard St Cyrille the Grand Th tre de Qu bec was inaugurated in 1971 as Qu bec City s arts center and home of the Qu bec Symphony Orchestra Battlefields Park Parc des Champs de Bataille 390 rue de Bernieres is devoted to the momentous battle on the Plains of Abraham that decided the fate of Qu bec in 1759 Quite apart from its historical significance the park offers delightful walks across the treelined fields In the center of the park you ll see a massive Martello tower built in 1805 as part of Qu bec s new defenses against a potential American attack In a town where every monument seems like a political statement rue Wolfe leads to one on the spot where General Wolfe was mortally wounded while anonymous Qu b cois patriots have responded with a statue of Joan of Arc off the Avenue George VI In the southern half of the park the Mus e de Qu bec possesses a first rate collection of Qu b cois painting and sculpture as well as historic furniture jewelry and gold and silver church ornaments The sculpture is principally from the 18th century but the paintings range from the colony s beginnings to the present day Look for the historical studies of Joseph L gar the portraits of Antoine Plamondon and Th odore Hamel and landscapes of Cornelius Krieghoff Among the moderns are the Automatiste abstracts of Jean Paul Riopelle and the optical art of Jacques Hurtubise C te de Charlevoix A day trip along the St Lawrence River on Highway 360 north of Qu bec City will give you a glimpse of village life and the challenging landscape in which the habitants created their farms C te de Charlevoix is part of the Laurentian heights reaching to the Saguenay River where the coureurs de bois turned off in search of furs At the northern edge of town turn right after the Montmorency River bridge into a park where a terrace overlooks the impressive Montmorency Falls plunging 91 m 274 ft into the river Ste Anne de Beaupr is a major pilgrimage town for torch lit processions in summer to the glory of the mother of the Virgin Mary Beyond the town in a sudden confrontation with the wilderness a walkway in the forest takes you up close to the pounding waters of the 80 m 240 ft Ste Anne Falls ragged and crashing around the boulders a much less neat and tidy cascade than Montmorency Painters and craftsmen who have made their home in the fishing village of Baie St Paul will be more than happy to sell you their work In a country boasting one of the world s biggest paper industries you ll find here one last town St Joseph de la Rive where you can buy handmade paper perfect for writing home with distinction On the wharf take a ferry across to the lovely little Ile aux Coudres another fishing community that has become a favorite artists haunt The island s homecrafts include weaving the rough Qu b cois rag rugs known as catalognes You may be tempted into an overnight stay by the colorful inns and folksong taverns run by retired seamen who look as if they escaped the old schooner stranded at the southwest end of the island These salts do cook up a fine heart warming fish soup When Jacques Cartier got to the island his sailors made a feast of the hazelnuts for which coudres is an old French word Ever since U S president William H Taft built himself a holiday home out at Pointe au Pic at the beginning of the century La Malbaie has enjoyed a reputation as the region s smartest resort town offering horseback riding golf and tennis Stop at the grand old Manoir Richelieu hotel at least for tea on the superbly manicured lawns overlooking the river Gasp Peninsula Gasp the first Canadian landfall of Jacques Cartier in 1534 is a Micmac Indian word for Land s End and this is indeed southern Qu bec s most remote region 700 km 420 miles from Qu bec City But it s well worth the trip for anyone with four or five days to spare and eager to get away from the throng into this still unspoiled wilderness on the Gulf of St Lawrence Densely wooded river valleys and sheltered coves break up the rugged north coast with its steep cliffs plunging down to broad pebble or fine sandy beaches The Chics Chocs Mountains of the interior the highest in eastern Canada are the northern terminal of the Appalachian Range that begins down in Alabama Descendants of Acadians and Loyalists the warm and friendly Gaspesians are a more harmonious mix of French and English speaking citizens than elsewhere in Qu bec In a region without any noteworthy industry other than cod fishing a little forestry and tourism the people add to their income by selling their craftwork and farm produce from improvised stands At the tip of the peninsula Forillon National Park offers great facilities for fishing boat cruises skin diving wetsuits are obligatory and hiking In this most spectacular of land and seascapes even the least artistic of you will be tempted to take up painting or at least photography Look out for the whales and grey seals in the gulf Wildlife inside the park includes fat little porcupine hare red squirrel deer moose and an occasional bear lynx and fox Birdwatchers have 200 species to feast their eyes on with guillemots and cormorants among the easier to spot The town of Gasp makes its livelihood from fishing cod and herring It offers good opportunities for sailing and windsurfing again wetsuits obligatory On the rue du Monument is a granite cross commemorating the wooden cross that Jacques Cartier planted on behalf of his French sovereign in front of a bemused audience of Iroquois The best hotels are in the resort town of Perc so this is naturally the most crowded place on the peninsula People come for watersports and to marvel at the cliffs pierced perc by the sea Erosion originally created two arches in the 94 m 82 ft high rocks but one has since crumbled See them at sunrise when they re pink Take a cruise around Bonaventure Island to view the penguins and puffins THE ATLANTIC The Atlantic coastal provinces lie off Canada s beaten track This implies many advantages for tourists seeking lovely unspoiled countryside away from the crowds but also for the residents some acute political and economic disadvantages Nova Scotia Prince Edward Island P E I and New Brunswick make up the Maritime Provinces more commonly known as the Maritimes Last to join the Canadian Confederation in 1949 the offshore island of Newfoundland is linked as one province with the mainland region of Labrador The Maritimes and Newfoundland together now known as the Atlantic Provinces have often felt neglected They were the last provinces to benefit from transcontinental railways and highways New Brunswick s shipbuilding timber suffered in the age of steam and steel hulls Newfoundland s fisheries were equally hard hit when modern refrigeration made it possible for foreign companies to dispense with the island s centuries old drying techniques Economic hardship prompted some to migrate to other regions But this separateness has shaped a hardy people of considerable character and charm Just getting to know them makes the journey worthwhile You ll find them cheerful friendly and more easily approachable than the big city folk of Ontario and Qu bec Newfoundland is peopled almost exclusively from the southwest of England and southern Ireland whence the special music and color of their dialect see page 145 The Maritimes have been mainly settled by Scottish Highlanders German Protestants and French speaking Acadians The cooler climate makes the region a strictly summer and early autumn destination It s a land of hiking camping and fishing with some good swimming off Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia If the Maritimes are warm to mellow from late June to early September Newfoundland is a little fresher Nova Scotia You d think the chamber of commerce carved their map as a public relations gimmick but the province really is shaped like a lobster In any case many a gourmet or glutton feels that a Halifax lobster dinner is reason enough to make the trip But weight watchers can enjoy Nova Scotia too There s the sparkling Atlantic coastline with its delightful little fishing ports Or rolling green hills across the interior to the orchards and dairy farms of Annapolis Valley This western side of the peninsula is rich in the poignant history of French Acadia The province s northern island is the site of one of Canada s best loved national parks Cape Breton Highlands where you ll drive the spectacular Cabot Trail along the coast and in and out of the forest Halifax Ships of the Canadian navy jostle with the trawlers of Nova Scotia s commercial fisheries in this major Atlantic port But the prevailing tone is one of more relaxed pleasure typified by the yachts and sailboats gliding gracefully in and out of the Northwest Arm marinas Attracted by the natural harbor one of the world s largest the British established the town in the mid 18th century as a naval garrison and shipyard to counter the French fortress of Louisbourg farther north on Cape Breton see page 130 Halifax s strategic position on the Atlantic soon proved even more

for a mainlander Seek ye first the Kingdom of God says the provincial motto But on your way look out for Newfoundland seems to have been the slogan of the old North Atlantic navigators from the good Irish Abbot Brendan in the sixth century and the wild Norsemen in the 11th to all the Basque French Spanish and Portuguese fishermen who preceded explorer John Cabot paid 10 by Henry VII for finding the new isle in 1497 It was the fishermen who really knew what the island was worth the Grand Banks to the east of Newfoundland are the richest breeding ground of cod in the world For centuries the island existed only for its offshore fish Any permanent settlement was actively discouraged so as not to compete with Britain s West Country merchants Even after the first serious colonization of the 18th century the forests of the interior were exploited just for building fishermen s cottages and their ships No towns were built away from the coast St John s Local folklore insists that the name not to be confused with Saint John New Brunswick comes from the saint s day of John the Baptist June 24 when John Cabot arrived here in 1497 Newfoundland s capital and largest city retains the simple allure of the fishing port it has always been and the picturesque harbor is the place to begin In the 19th century the town burned down five times but it still stubbornly builds wooden houses overlooking the waterfront Their brightly painted walls add a welcome touch of color to the gaunt grey trawlers in the docks from Britain of course but also Russia and even Japan Parallel to the harbor you ll find on Gower Street the prettiest Victorian houses painted burgundy lemon burnt sienna dove grey and white Newfoundland Museum on Duckworth Street recounts the human history of the

fourth centenary of Cabot s landing and diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria Four years later at 12 30pm December 12 1901 in a receiving station improvised near the tower in a hospital burned down in 1920 Guglielmo Marconi suddenly yelled Do you hear that Do you hear that What the Italian inventor was so excited about were three faint dots of the letter S in Morse from his transmitter in Poldhu Cornwall The group of dour Newfie fishermen listening in were more impressed by this fellow jumping up and down than by history s first transatlantic radio message The event is commemorated by a modest exhibit in the Cabot Tower On the north side of the hill Quidi Vidi pronounced Kiddy Viddy is a charming little fishing port with excellent seafood restaurants On the first Wednesday in August

on the gravel road leading to Cape St Francis BRITISH COLUMBIA Such a land said Rudyard Kipling in 1908 is good for an energetic man It is also not bad for a loafer That s still true today British Columbia the third largest province is supremely the land of the wild outdoors with the constant challenge of rugged mountains seemingly impenetrable forests a jagged coastline and dizzily fast moving rivers But its capital is the smiling sleepy town of Victoria evoking a genteel British past that the British themselves may well have forgotten And the province s principal city with a population of 1 7 million is the beautifully situated Vancouver home of easy living elegant architecture and all the color and movement of an international port Loafers love it Long after Northwest Coast Indians had found the region to be a hospitable land of plenty it was explored and worked by Scottish fur traders who called it New Caledonia When the discovery of gold on the Fraser River in 1858 brought in a flood of American adventurers Britain decided it was time to take the land over from the Hudson s Bay Company and create the colony of British Columbia It joined the Dominion of Canada in 1871 on the understanding that the Canadian Pacific Railway would reach B C in the next decade delay nearly caused secession The C P R choice of Vancouver as its terminus gave B C its major Pacific port The great boon of British Columbia at least in the southwest corner where three quarters of the population is clustered is its gentle relatively dry summers and mild but rainy winters B C s kind weather has been a major factor in attracting new blood in the westward expansion from Ontario Qu bec and the Maritimes Trees are the main source of B C s prosperity The spruce fir and cedar provide three quarters of Canada s construction lumber and considerable quantities of wood pulp and paper Much to the joy of sports fishermen the salmon of the Pacific coast and the great rivers of the interior remains another vital natural resource The threat of overfishing has been cut back and in a province where revenues from hydroelectric power are second only to those of Qu bec the energy industry has been prevented from damming the Fraser so as not to damage the salmon s spawning grounds B C s population 4 000 000 is concentrated around the Strait of Georgia and along the U S border with scarcely any inhabitants at all north of Prince Rupert The people are still mainly British in origin most of them Scottish Other European immigrants are German Dutch Greek Ukrainian Italian Scandinavian and a few French Native peoples number about 82 000 From across the Pacific the province has attracted a large Asian community Chinese Japanese and of more recent arrival Vietnamese Pakistanis and Indians Vancouver The city s setting in a magnificent bay embraced by soaring green mountains is one of those blessings that can turn any hard boiled atheist into a believer Cynicism dissolves with your first taste of the town s gentle ambience created by a clever combination of the comforts of sophisticated modernity with the simpler joys of the wilderness at its back door Expanding at a purposeful but more leisurely pace than other leading Canadian cities Vancouver has never lost sight of the importance of enjoying life at the same time Many business people from Toronto have been driven close to apoplexy by the relaxed style of their Vancouver colleagues In keeping with this easy going attitude the city was originally known as Gastown after saloon keeper Gassy Jack Deighton who looked after the needs of pioneer lumbermen and sailors in the 1860s It was only when the town became C P R s West Coast railway terminus in 1886 that it took on the more dignified name of one of the region s first European visitors navigator George Vancouver A fire in 1886 and property developers left few traces of the 19th century town but bold contemporary architecture downtown and out at the Simon Fraser and University of British Columbia campuses blends beautifully with the mountain and ocean backdrop Unsightly docklands have been cleaned up and handsome new housing has been built on the waterfront First View More than in most towns Vancouver s unique setting demands a carefully planned first view The city is built around the broad English Bay which funnels through First and Second Narrows into the Burrard Inlet the waterway that George Vancouver explored in a scouting boat in 1791 The harbor separates the city proper with the Stanley Park promontory from its elegant north shore mountainside suburbs of West and North Vancouver To take in all this you need to begin from not one but two observation points Cross the First Narrows on Lions Gate Bridge and take the Capilano Road for a cable car ride Skyride up to Grouse Mountain and its grand view south over the city and harbor Try to be there at sunset too to see the city light up A favorite with skiers the mountain also offers a fine view northwest over Capilano Lake and across to Vancouver Island If you feel like a quick whiff of the wilderness on your way back turn off to walk the swaying suspension bridge 76 m 230 ft above the fast flowing waters of Capilano Canyon To get an equally impressive view of the city set against its mountains go downtown to the observation deck and its restaurant if you like on top of the 40 story Harbour Centre 555 West Hastings Street A bonus on clear days is a view south with the long range telescope of Mount Baker across the American border in the state of Washington You ll find the information office of Tourism British Columbia at 865 Hornby Street useful for details about the province For the city Greater Vancouver Convention Visitors Bureau is at 200 Burrard Street Plaza Level Downtown The main streets through the West End peninsula to Stanley Park are Georgia and Robson Georgia Street continues through the park to Lion s Gate Bridge Though you will need a car in this sprawling city park it for your downtown tour and walk traffic jams can be horrendous Start your tour of the city center at Robson Square site of one of the true masterpieces of modern North American architecture Arthur Erickson s Courthouse Characteristic of the Vancouver architect s finest works the building is conceived horizontally only seven stories high but still the dominant focus among the skyscrapers towering above it Revolutionizing the whole stuffy concept of law courts with not a marble column or portico in sight this sparkling structure spreads out in tiers of glassed in walkways offices and courtrooms and also shops restaurants a small cinema and a skating rink Pools cascade from one level to another among indoor and outdoor gardens of flowering shrubs and rose bushes Japanese maples orange trees and a miniature pine forest An intriguing pattern of stairways and ramps collectively dubbed stramps very popular with rollerskaters and rollerbladers runs across the plazas from corner to corner attracting large crowds during city celebrations Robson Square also provides a home for Vancouver Art Gallery in the old courthouse a proper Neoclassical temple renovated by Erickson The star feature of this collection of Canadian artists is the outstanding work of Emily Carr 1871 1945 Crazy Old Millie as she was known locally Klee Wyck or the Laughing One to her Kwakiutl Indian friends was a popular eccentric in Victoria where she kept a boarding house and wheeled a pet monkey around in a baby carriage Years of painting among the native peoples and studying with French Post Impressionists produced a unique style of vigorous expressive landscapes and totemic themes achieved with great sweeps and swirls of bold color Look for the lush dramatic Big Raven 1928 and Forest British Columbia 1932 in which the trees have the sculptural quality of totem poles The section of Robson Street between Burrard and Bute streets is known as Robsonstrasse Now it has lost its distinctively German character to become a cosmopolitan restaurant row offering Vietnamese Japanese Scandinavian Italian and French cuisine Fresh seafood is a great attraction East of Robson Square the Granville Mall pedestrian shopping zone takes you down to the Harbour Centre and the waterfront From the foot of Granville Street take a bargain cruise on the commuter Seabus which crosses Burrard Inlet to North Vancouver 12 minutes each way Besides the fish eye view of the city and harbor you get a close up of the grand Canada Place jutting out into the harbor like an ocean liner with a hint of the port s 19th century beginnings in its white simulated sails Originally the national pavilion at Expo 86 it is now the B C Convention Centre If you don t have a taste for the down and out life of Skid Row on Hastings Street make your way east to the brighter colors of Chinatown along Pender Street Canada s largest Chinese community made up of the descendants of immigrants who worked on the Canadian Pacific Railway is much in evidence in the fruit and vegetable markets fish stalls and boutiques of silks and satins bamboo and lacquer wares from Hong Kong Taiwan and mainland China Look for the shops of traditional spices and medicines where reindeer horn and deer s tail tips are said to perk up even the weariest husband Barbecued pork and poultry glisten in the windows of the dozens of restaurants and tourists are drawn in by the garish street d cor even the telephone booths have pagoda style roofs Away from the throngs the Dr Sun Yat Sen Garden at the corner of Carrall and Pender streets offers a rare moment of peace This microcosm of nature reflecting the Taoist philosophy of yin and yang was landscaped by artists brought in from Suzhou the great center of classical Chinese gardens A pavilion with a diversity of glazed roof tiles carved woodwork and lattice windows overlooks a subtly patterned pebblestone courtyard and the miniature landscape Light is balanced by shadow and rugged limestone rocks yang are chosen for their pitted and convoluted surface balancing the smooth surface of calm pools and quiet streams yin Shrubs symbolize human virtues pine bamboo and winter blooming plum represent strength grace and the renewal of life Duly renewed then make your way towards the harbor and railyards to Gastown between Water and Hastings the resuscitated red brick cobbled street district of Vancouver s beginnings This huckster s paradise of boutiques souvenir shops bars and restaurants is frankly commercial in its polished quaintness but with a certain corny charm At the west end of Water Street is the world s first and probably only monumental steam powered clock signaling the hours with a resounding whistle On Maple Street a no less handsome statue of Gassy Jack a distinctly derelict looking riverboat captain known to his mother as John Deighton stands on a whisky barrel symbolizing the drinks he served to lumbermen persuading them to build the town in 1867 Escape the crowds by heading east along the waterfront to the Campbell Avenue Docks where you can watch the ocean going fishermen unloading their haul or join them for a hearty meal in the local canteen And if the Robson Square Courthouse whetted your appetite for the architecture of Arthur Erickson continue this side trip out along Hastings Street towards Burnaby Mountain actually only 400 m 1 200 ft high and the striking campus of Simon Fraser University The spectacular focus of student activity is the great mall of the Academic Quadrangle Note the delicate play of light and shadow among stairways and terraces under the mall s truss supported glass roof On the way back downtown swing over to the B C Place a vast concrete oval domed sports stadium where the B C Lions play their football indoors Stanley Park Covering a magnificent peninsula proudly dominating English Bay this is undoubtedly one of North America s finest city parks Its forest of majestic Douglas firs cedars and Sitka spruce remind us it was once a government reserve providing mast and spar timbers for the Royal Navy At the turn of the century the town leased it as a park named after Lord Stanley Canada s governor general His bronze statue is close to the southern entrance Turn east off Georgia Street to take the 9 km 51 2 mile drive looping the park More bracing is the Sea Wall Promenade where you can walk jog or ride a bicycle available for rent at the park entrance Passing the immaculate green playing field of Brockton Oval you may spot a cricket game reminding you this is British Columbia A splendid group of Haida and Kwakiutl totem poles nearby illustrate the province s other important cultural influence On your way to Brockton Point listen for the 9 o clock gun a cannon that fires at 9pm originally to warn fishermen of the fishing curfew Turning west you ll pass on the seaward side a bronze statue oddly named Girl in a Wet Suit a version of Copenhagen s mermaid designed not to shock Stop off at Prospect Point for a good view of oil tankers and grain cargo ships bound for Japan China or Russia A totem pole marks the site where Captain Vancouver met with members of the Squamish tribe At the Aquarium the star attractions are the dolphin show and the beluga whales closely followed by polar bears Equally fantastic are wolf eels with crab cracking jaws Bears and monkeys seem to be having much less fun at the nearby zoo You can walk marked trails to picnic at the pretty freshwater Beaver Lake from which the beavers were deported after creating havoc with the water system The park s popular sandy beaches run along the west shore of the peninsula English Bay Get away from the city center with an excursion out to Point Grey You can relax on the pleasant beaches Wreck Beach is reserved for nudists The grounds of the University of British Columbia one of the most beautiful college campuses in North America are nearby the terraced Sedgwick Library and the Faculty Club rose garden are two notable gems set against a superb sea and mountain backdrop The university s pride and joy is the great Museum of Anthropology out on Marine Drive at Point Grey Arthur Erickson designed this noble glass and concrete beam structure in 1972 as an explicit homage to the post and beam longhouses of the Northwest Coast Indians Gracing the lawns are a magnificent group of totem poles and two cedarwood houses of the Haida Indians built in the 1930s and faithful to a centuries old technique and form Inside the museum alongside the artifacts of other Pacific civilizations the rich culture of the coastal tribes Haida Kwakiutl Salish Tlingit and Tsimshian is beautifully displayed and illuminated in a space where the roof glass seems to open the halls to the heavens Compare the sturdy cedarwood canoes built to negotiate the Pacific s coastal waters with the lighter birchbark craft used by Eastern Woodlands Indians for the rivers of Ontario and Qu bec Many of the sculptures you see were incorporated into the structure of a house as posts and crossbeams One Kwakiutl giant accompanied by two slaves emphasizing the homeowner s power and prestige originally supported a massive central roof beam Others represent the tribes totemic animals such as the bear protecting a human being in his bosom Prehistoric stone carvings show the continuity of totemic styles Some smaller figures in soft black argillite stone were turned out by Haida craftsmen specifically for 19th century European tourists who found themselves caricatured in the carvings Notice the huge wooden feast dishes big as bathtubs for dispensing food at the great potlatch ceremonies at which the tribes proclaimed their greatness by the munificence of their hospitality see page 35 An important part of the collection is devoted to gold silver and copper jewelry and wooden masks and ceremonial rattles Many of these are kept in Galleries 6 and 7 but don t hurry past just because they look like the museum s store rooms That s what they are but this so called visible storage system is a major innovation to make permanently available the museum s thousands of art objects Here you re encouraged to make your own discoveries compare the work of different cultures around the world and just admire the sheer wealth of allegedly primitive creativity Just to the south of the museum the Nitobe Memorial Gardens are a fine example of classical Japanese landscaping Stone lanterned paths lead you across hump bridged ponds to a traditional teahouse set among Japanese maples and azaleas The nearby Asian Centre holds interesting exhibitions of the art costumes and photographs from China Japan India Korea and Indonesia Return to the city center on Point Grey Road and stop off near Jericho Beach to visit the Old Hastings Mill Store 1575 Alma Road Carried here lock stock and barrel from downtown in the 1930s this is the town s oldest surviving building a post office general store and the only remnant from the original Gastown to have escaped the 1886 fire It has been restored as a museum for turn of the century paraphernalia Closest that wholesome Vancouvrites get to being Bohemian the Kitsilano neighborhood here is popular with students young and old In the little Vanier Park by the Burrard Bridge you ll find two interesting little museums and the MacMillan Planetarium The Centennial Museum is devoted to local history and anthropology The Maritime Museum traces the history of the Pacific port Its showpiece is the Saint Roch This proud ship of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police sailed clear around the North American continent via the Panama Canal and the Arctic Ocean to plot a definitive Northwest Passage and hunt German U boats on the way The area where English Bay narrows into False Creek epitomizes Vancouver s taste for the good life The once miserable wasteland of run down warehouses lumber mills factories and railyards has been reclaimed not only for the upbeat commercial enterprises that are now a familiar feature of any Canadian city with a waterfront but also as a handsome residential neighborhood Under the Granville Bridge Granville Island really a triangular peninsula of landfill is a cheerful collection of markets caf s galleries boutiques and theaters Children love it not just for the toys in the Kids Only Market but also for the water playground around the fire hydrants and tons of rubber tires False Creek has given its name to a charming neighborhood of architecturally inventive houses set around garden courtyards and terraces The east end of the creek was the site of Expo 86 perpetuated by the giant geodesic dome of Expo Centre now operating as an exhibition hall and movie theatre Squamish Highway The drive over Lions Gate Bridge to Vancouver s North Shore suburbs along Marine Drive and the Upper Levels Highway Route 99 makes a gentle introduction to your exploration of the Pacific coast and interior With a view of the ocean from a setting of tall Douglas firs and red cedars among boulders and the occasional swift mountain stream the elegant or rustic houses enjoy a civilized microcosm of the classical B C landscape Route 99 turns north at Horseshoe Bay landing area for the Vancouver Island ferry to become the Squamish Highway for a spectacular 100 km 60 mile drive up to Whistler Mountain The Coastal Mountains come right down to the water s edge of the narrow Howe Sound some forming a little archipelago in the sea Stop off at Shannon Falls a short walk away from the road on an easy gravel path over footbridges into the forest You can picnic at the bottom of the cliff over which the water cascades Famous for its August log rolling contests the town of Squamish makes a useful base for hiking tours into Garibaldi Provincial Park The winter sports resort of Whistler offers excellent summer facilities too bicycles kayak and river rafting or more sedate swimming golf and tennis Take the ski lift for views across the Coastal Mountains or stroll around Lost Lake good trout fishing but beware of a pretty yellow flower known as skunk cabbage that smells like its name when you pick it As a delightful alternative to driving you can travel from Vancouver to Squamish aboard the Royal Hudson 2860 steam train a regular old puffer giving you a close up view of mountain and forest The round trip takes 6 hours including a 2 hour stopover in Squamish allowing for a walk over to Shannon Falls You also have the option of making one leg of the trip by sea 30 minutes longer Board the morning train in North Vancouver at the bottom of Pember Street and return from Squamish on the MV Britannia ferry or vice versa starting from Vancouver s Harbor Ferry dock at the bottom of Denman Street Victoria Probably the most genteel city in all of North America this town is of another age another world In its sheltered spot on the southeast tip of Vancouver Island flowers seem to be growing everywhere Geraniums in baskets hanging from five bulb lamp posts in the city s shopping streets hydrangeas and roses in the lovingly tended gardens of the residential neighborhoods shrubs and more exotic blooms in the city s parks and conservatories In the month of February while the rest of Canada is still huddled around log fires and radiators even just across the Strait of Georgia in Vancouver the people of Victoria are out in their parks and gardens for the annual flower count Yes they count every blossom in town and the figure regularly tops the 5 million mark For Victoria is blessed with an exceptionally mild climate with enough rain to water the flowers and an annual average they count everything in this town of 2 183 hours of sun to give them their brilliant colors Even the air in Victoria is sweet and gentle Not surprisingly in a town attracting an affluent retirement community the port is more pleasure than work oriented filling its harbors with cruise liners and yachts ferries and seaplanes Parliament reminds the citizenry of the town s venerable past and more serious role as B C s legislative capital Not that it detracts from the hallowed ritual of tea time act of obeisance to a more legendary than real Britain Good for a chuckle but if it highlights Victoria s resistance to the rest of the planet s hustle and bustle so much the better The town is small enough to get around on foot but there are also horse drawn carriages and red double decker buses from London The toy like quality of Victoria is emphasized in its most imposing building the Parliament Built in 1897 it was certainly erected by someone with a playful sense of what might best evoke merry old England There s a bit of London s St Paul s Cathedral in the massive central dome topped for want of a saint by a gilded statue of Captain George Vancouver The neo Romanesque arched entrance recalls the British capital s Natural Science Museum and the smaller domed turrets suggest something between an Englishman s castle and his county council The whole fairytale effect is enhanced at night when every contour of the Parliament is outlined by thousands of light bulbs Inside you can visit the debating chamber unmistakably modeled on the House of Commons In the great dome s interior rotunda painter George Southwell s murals illustrate the four virtues that made British Columbia Courage as shown by George Vancouver confronting the Spanish at Nootka Sound in 1792 Spirit of Enterprise with James Douglas establishing Fort Victoria for the Hudson s Bay Company in 1842 Work by those who had to build the Fort and Justice meted out to the unruly mob engaged in the 1858 gold rush Reasonably enough the Parliament grounds include a bronze statue of Queen Victoria It was she who chose the name of British Columbia over New Caledonia New Hanover New Cornwall or New Georgia There is also a cenotaph which is the focus of the annual mid September Battle of Britain Parade You can easily get the impression that this town is only nominally in Canada Immediately east of the Parliament is the newly housed Provincial Museum devoted to B C s fauna flora and a first rate collection of Indian art In front of the museum stands the 62 bell Netherlands Carillon Tower a gift of Dutch Canadians and tallest bell tower in the country Farther east is Thunderbird Park home of the city s most important collection of Indian carvings Tsimshian and Haida totem poles Salish sculpture of their chieftains and a reconstructed Kwakiutl longhouse The thunderbird a mythical creature whose eyes flashed the lightning and whose beating wings rumbled the thunder figures in many of the carvings in the park At the sculpture workshop you can see native peoples still practicing the ancient skills but with modern tools Most of the park s woodcarvings date from the last half of the 19th century but are restored and replaced when weather or worms get the better of them At the corner of Dallas Road and Douglas Street is Kilometer 0 of the 7 800 km 4 680 mile Trans Canada Highway ending up with the aid of a ferry or two in St John s Newfoundland It is here that the flowers and greenery of Victoria begin their most delightful assault in Beacon Hill Park an expanse of gently rolling flower bordered lawns and groves of cedar and oak sloping down to the Pacific Ocean Look for the 38 m 114 ft totem pole carved by Chief Mungo Martin and believed to be the tallest in existence At the northern end of Beacon Hill is the Crystal Gardens conservatory You can have tea on the Upper Terrace overlooking tropical plants exotic birds and repulsive reptiles They are kept at a safe distance for the palm court tea dances The Empress Hotel farther north is so renowned for its elegant servings of tea that it schedules three separate afternoon sittings everyday and you re advised to make a reservation if you want to participate The Empress was built in 1905 to serve passengers ferried across from the western terminus of the Canadian Pacific and is the archetypal grand old railway hotel There s a good replica of Victoria looking decidedly unamused in the Royal London Wax Museum in the C P R Steamship Terminal near the Inner Harbour The Royal British Columbia Museum houses prehistoric and native exhibits The Inner Harbour is a pleasant place for loitering among the yachts and seaplanes The harbor s Pacific Undersea Gardens is an unusually well presented natural aquarium that you view from beneath the sea Besides the exquisite tropical specimens there s a perfectly horrid giant octopus The Maritime Museum in the old courthouse on Bastion Square contains some fine models and navigational paraphernalia of the merchant ships of yore whalers steamers and old Hudson s Bay paddle wheelers The star attraction is the original Tilikum a 13 m 40 ft dugout canoe equipped with three sails to take Captain J C Voss in 1901 on a crazy three year voyage round the world He sailed from Victoria via Australia New Zealand Brazil the Cape of Good Hope and the Azores to land up in the English seaside town of Margate The Emily Carr Gallery 1107 Wharf Street presents changing exhibitions of Victoria s best known painter see page 150 along with memorabilia and a short film about her life and work The town s Art Gallery Wilspencer Place south of Fort Street has works of the English Impressionist Walter Sickert French watercolorist Eug ne Boudin and Dutch landscape painter of the 17th century Adriaen van de Velde Drive 22 km 13 miles north of town to a floral fairyland Butchart Gardens Robert Pim Butchart made a fortune out of Portland cement at the turn of the century and found himself stuck with an exhausted limestone quarry His wife suggested turning it into a garden The result is a bewilderingly beautiful phantasmagoria of fountains lakes rock gardens trees and flowers the Sunken Garden with symmetrical Trees of Life and rockery of gentian saxifrage and Lebanon candytuft the Rose Garden at its best in July boasting 150 varieties of hybrid tea and floribunda roses the Japanese Gardens with scarlet azaleas Himalayan blue poppies weeping larch and pond with a couple of cranes to bring you good luck and the dreamy Italian Garden cypresses singing a song of Tuscany around a cruciform basin filled with water lilies where once was Mr and Mrs Butchart s tennis court The gardens also put on firework displays and open air theater Vancouver Island Some 460 km 276 miles long and averaging 80 km 48 miles wide the mountainous island is covered by the largest stand of lumber in the world a boon to the province s most important industry but also a magnet for nature lovers They hike or flyfish for trout in the interior and then make for the superb sandy beaches along the island s west coast to picnic or troll for Pacific salmon For several thousand years it has been a favored spot for Indian hunters and fishermen living around the sheltered coves and fjords that penetrate deep inland Today about 7 000 Salish and Wakash Indians still live on the island well away from the towns and tourist resorts Coming from Vancouver board the car ferry at Horseshoe Bay for Nanaimo and head north on Highway 19 Turn west at Parksville to cross the island on Highway 4 This takes you through some of the province s finest forestland the red cedar of canoes totem poles and longhouses stately Douglas fir mainstay of white man s bridges boats houses and flagstaffs and the good old Sitka spruce Christmas tree About 20 km 12 miles from Parksville look for a signpost to Little Qualicum Falls The well marked walk loops around the upper falls tumbling into a ravine then follows the river rapids along to the lower falls that crash into another rocky gorge You can extend the hike along the river for a picnic or bracing swim at Cameron Lake Highway 4 follows the lake shore to Cathedral Grove a formidable stand of Douglas firs in MacMillan Provincial Park donated to the public by a paper manufacturer as a gesture for government permission to exploit less accessible parts of the forest Many of the firs up to 76 m 230 ft high are more than 300 years old the most ancient dating back to the 12th century Excellent explanatory panels trace the growth of these majestic trees Off the beaten track you ll steep yourself in the atmosphere of a truly primeval forest Stock up on picnic supplies in the town of Port Alberni before driving on past Kennedy Lake and down to Pacific Rim National Park Its sandy beaches are a delight the powerful ocean breakers being particularly admired by champion surfers At the coast Highway 4 turns north along one of the best resort areas the self explanatory Long Beach 12 km 7 miles of fine sand and first class fishing waters Hotels here provide you with cooking facilities for whatever fish you or a generous neighbor might catch The boardwalk that rambles along Wickaninnish Bay will take you in and out of the coastal pine forest Florencia Bay is a good bathing beach while South Bay is the mecca for collectors of worry stones These exquisite green aubergine or most prized of all jet black pebbles are gathered from hidden nooks and crannies sorted for size shape and smoothness of texture until the ideal stone is located a highly subjective appraisal All others are discarded and the collector can be seen caressing the pebble rubbing all worries away From Comber s Beach you can spot sea lions basking out on the rocks with not a worry in the world For a change of pace the sleepy town of Tofino is a community of ecologists painters and poets pursuing a style of life remote in every sense from the B C mainstream Take a look at the Indian art gallery and performances at the experimental theater On the northeast coast of the island the coastal Cape Scott Province Park offers a variety of outdoor challenges and is extremely popular with scuba divers kayakers and canoeists Departing from Port Hardy B C Ferries organizes a daytime or overnight cruise through the spectacular Inside Passage between the densely forested island coast and the nordic fjords of the B C mainland Fraser and Thompson Canyons This stark mountain landscape of pine forest progressively thinning out to more arid craggy canyons above the fast flowing river is the pioneer country that made British Columbia Driving east from Vancouver on the Trans Canada Highway and following the Fraser River north to its tributary the Thompson you are backtracking along the great exploration route traced by intrepid fur traders from the prairies to the Pacific It s also the route unerringly followed by millions of Pacific salmon between the ocean and their spawning grounds far inland And against all the odds of the terrain it s the route the railways chose to carry the riches of lumber mining and the first tourists across the continent One of the most impressive sights on your trip will be the rivalry of the Canadian Pacific and Canadian National railways in action endless trains of freight wagons pulled and pushed often by two engines at either end for the tougher stretches snake through the canyons on opposite banks of the river Turn north at Hope to Yale an old fort of the Hudson s Bay Company terminus of its stern wheelers unable to negotiate the rapids upriver at low water you can still see their ring tie ups on the river bank A little museum documents how this sleepy village of a few hundred inhabitants was once a gold rush boomtown and the major construction depot for the C P R The strands of B C s destiny come together where the Fraser Canyon narrows at the torrential rapids of Hell s Gate For thousands of years this point in the river s descent to the ocean was the local native peoples favored fishing spot for the salmon swimming to their spawning grounds It was here in 1808 that they helped Nor Wester fur trader Simon Fraser with his canoe past the rapids over a swaying ropeway of vines strung along the canyon wall enabling him to follow to the ocean the river that bears his name In 1914 the C N R blocked the salmon s passage with rock blasts through the canyon for the railway The consequent 90 percent reduction of the annual sockeye salmon catch was remedied only 30 years later when multimillion dollar steel and concrete channels were built for the fish The native peoples are back again in areas like this leaning far out over precarious rocky ledges to pluck with dip nets just a tiny amount of salmon compared with the millions caught by the commercial fisheries at the Fraser estuary Take the cable car across the gorge for a close up view of the rapids For a taste of what the fuss is all about try a grilled salmon lunch at the restaurant by the cable car terminal The Thompson River joins the Fraser at Lytton Before turning east on the Trans Canada Highway to follow the Thompson take a look just north of town on Highway 12 at the dramatic effect of the confluence mixing the lime of the tributary with the clearer mountain waters of the Fraser The drier Thompson valley soon takes on a more rugged aspect than the Fraser with the sagebrush and lizards of a semi desert in places as beautifully desolate as a moonscape The similarity with America s southwest is reinforced by the ranches around Kamloops Lake If you re here in October you may see the spectacular salmon run when the waters turn scarlet with thousands of sockeye Take the turn off on the Trans Canada at Squilax Bridge to the junction of the Adams River and Shuswap Lake On the Thompson River summer visitors can try the bumpy thrills of the sockeye experience for themselves with some whitewater river rafting organized out of Vancouver details from the city tourist information office Okanagan Valley Before heading east to the Rocky Mountains turn south on Highway 97 to the lovely Okanagan resort country about four hours east of Vancouver for golf tennis swimming hiking camping and fishing amid vineyards orchards and dozens of trout lakes The Okanagan River itself widens into an elongated lake with excellent sandy beaches sailing and other water sports facilities centered around Kelowna Across the lake at Westbank among other orchard towns you pay for what you pick apricots peaches cherries plums pears and apples At the southern end of the lake the resort town of Penticton stages a Peach Festival at the end of July Sunny Okanagan Valley is one of only two wine growing areas in Canada the other being in Niagara Peninsula Ontario Ten wineries propose tastings and sales of their not undrinkable dry whites and dry reds along with some more refined wines from the nobler European varieties Pinot Noir Cabernet Sauvignon Chardonnay Gew rztraminer and Riesling Among the wineries you can visit are Calona and Uniacke Estate in Kelowna Mission Hill in Westbank and Gray Monk at Okanagan Centre Hottest spot in the region down by the American border is Osoyoos nestling in the mountains around a good swimming lake and pocket sized but honest to goodness desert complete with cactus sagebrush rattlesnakes coyotes and horned toads THE ROCKIES AND PRAIRIES In this region the great Canadian outdoors really comes into its own The national parks of the Rocky Mountains provide unrivaled opportunities for exhilarating contacts with a wilderness where you can really escape from your fellow man camping and hiking through the forests fishing in the myriad lakes and rivers canoeing and whitewater rafting in the mountain torrents And skiing downhill and cross country has been greatly enhanced by the ultra modern facilities installed for Calgary s 1988 Winter Olympics Alberta Saskatchewan and Manitoba form the Prairie Provinces sharing the same rugged climate The full meaning of Canada s wide open spaces becomes instantly apparent here in the vast stretches of wheat field reaching to the horizon The eye is attracted not by some craggy obstacle but by the play of a sudden wind sweeping across the plain The sky is spectacular offering magnificent dawns and sunsets Play the farmers game of watching the weather come and go Stop in the provincial capitals of Edmonton Regina and Winnipeg for a glimpse of the region s history and culture Monuments and museums show how the buffalo hunting M tis the descendants of Indians and French fur traders struggled in vain against Anglo farmers from Ontario themselves subsequently relayed by waves of Eastern European immigrants brought in to exploit the grain wealth of the prairies One sidetrip in Manitoba touches on another Canadian adventure up to Churchill on Hudson Bay the center of the great fur trading company s northern activities A bonus in autumn is the rare southern appearance of polar bears Rocky Mountains If there s one region for which you should reserve most of your superlatives and stock up on rolls of film this is it For all visitors to western Canada whether they be sturdy hikers skiers and mountaineers or more easygoing loafers seeking to rest their tired bones in a hot springs spa or bask beside a cool sparkling lake the sprawling national parks of the Rocky Mountains are an undisputed imperative Straddling the border of British Columbia and Alberta the North American continent s grandest range of mountains stretches from the Yukon Territory down to the Mexican frontier For the tourist the abundance of superbly administered national parks Mount Revelstoke Glacier Kootenay Yoho Banff and Jasper give the Canadian Rockies an edge over their U S counterpart to which thousands of visitors from south of the border will testify Some of the national parks charge a nominal entrance fee check at the park entrance as you may be stopped by park rangers later on You can buy a one day permit or an annual permit that admits the vehicle and occupants to all national parks The stark drama of the mountain landscapes derives from the fact that in geological terms the Rockies were born yesterday and have not had the time to settle into more stable forms Waves of sedimentary rock lifted by vast thrust faults less than 60 million years ago have created a variety of striking silhouettes the battlements of a medieval fortress sawteeth or single pyramids like the Swiss Matterhorn The highest peak in the Canadian Rockies is Mount Robson 4 320 m 12 972 ft just inside B C Mount Revelstoke The highway through the Monashee and Selkirk mountains to Mount Revelstoke National Park follows the Eagle River and the route of the C P R on the crucial stretch that enabled the railway to break through the Rockies At Craigellachie right beside the road about 25 km 15 miles east of Shuswap Lake a granite monolith marks the spot where the eastern and western sections linked up to form Canada s first transcontinental railway At 9 22am on November 7 1885 surrounded by top hatted dignitaries and grimy overalled laborers C P R boss Donald Smith tucked in his flowing white beard and hammered home the famous Last Spike after misjudging his first swing and bending a first spike over double Leave the Trans Canada 11 2 km 1 mile east of Revelstoke town to drive the winding Summit Road up Mount Revelstoke 2 120 m 6 370 ft the only mountain in Canada that you can climb by car This is the cozy way to watch the park s landscape change from dense lowland forest through alpine meadows dotted with wild flowers to the bleak tundra of the high country From the top you look out over the Columbia and Illecillewaet river valleys and back to the Monashee Mountains There are no campgrounds inside the park but if you re planning to tent overnight along the 65 km 39 miles of clearly marked hiking trails check in with the park administration office in downtown Revelstoke P O Box 350 Revelstoke B C VOE250 tel 250 837 7500 This is the place to get your detailed maps and fishing permit In the creeks and lakes you ll find an abundance of trout rainbow brook brown cut throat and red spotted Dolly Varden as well as whitefish char and bass Nature lovers may spot elk moose and mountain goat bird watchers look for grey jay blue grouse and golden eagle while everyone should watch out for black bear The Trans Canada continues through the jagged mountains of Glacier National Park which counts over 400 glaciers within its boundaries Rogers Pass was named after the major who found this corridor in 1882 thus enabling the C P R to cut through the avalanche prone Selkirk Mountains It was also the toughest obstacle to clear for completion of the Trans Canada Highway in 1962 Yoho National Park From the railway depot and sawmill town of Golden the highway turns east to one of the prettiest of B C s national parks in the mountains and quiet lakes around the Yoho and Kicking Horse rivers Buy your food supplies at the parkside town of Field and cut back to the signposted Emerald Lake turnoff Just inside the woods is a pleasant picnic area beside the natural bridge a massive slab of rock through which the swift waters of the Kicking Horse River have forced a channel A salt lick just past the bridge often attracts moose at dawn and dusk Drive on up to Emerald Lake a place of sheer magical peace mirroring the mountains in its perfectly still green waters With only one secluded hotel on its shores the pearshaped lake s tranquillity is less troubled by noisy tour groups than some of the more popular Rocky Mountain resorts The lake path makes a delightful two hour ramble through woodland giving you a good chance of spotting some of the park s small wildlife notably some very chubby brown porcupine and an occasional beaver Back on the Trans Canada the turn off 6 km 31 2 miles after Field takes you past the park information center to a steep winding route through the pine forests of the Yoho Valley Signposted on the right 13 km 8 miles into the valley is a short walk to the foot of the spectacular Takakkaw Falls Takakkaw is an Indian word for magnificent a fair description of the waters spilling out of the outflow of the Daly Glacier Unlike many waterfalls this one is at its most spectacular on the hottest summer afternoons when the glacier ice melts For a panoramic view of the glacier take the Highline Trail 1 km 1 2 mile south of the falls starting out from the Whiskey Jack Hostel On the way back stop south of the confluence of the Yoho and Kicking Horse rivers for a view of the Spiral Tunnels Watch trains entering and reappearing from the upper of two tunnels bored into the mountain to form a figure 8 The lower spiral is visible from the Trans Canada Highway This engineering feat was necessary to overcome the steep gradient of the approach to Kicking Horse Pass At the park s eastern exit you ll see where geologist James Hector member of an 1858 expedition mapping the major passes through the Rockies was kicked senseless by a pack horse thus the name of the pass From Field you can ride through the tunnels to Lake Louise Lake Louise The fairytale setting of this blue blue lake with its monumental railway hotel Ch teau Lake Louise has made it the mecca of thousands of sightseers every year The village 3 km 2 miles east is very much a tourist trap but the lake named after a daughter of Queen Victoria and its surroundings retain their magic From the hotel terrace before breakfast and the first crowds look out onto the pine trees and snowy peaks of Fairview mountain to the south and the Beehive to the north with the dazzling white Victoria glacier producing startling reflections on the shimmering surface of the lake Give the mob the slip by walking along clearly marked paths to the far end of the lake with some pleasant teahouses on the way The path continues to the Plain of Six Glaciers requiring more stamina Take the mountain road 14 km 81 2 miles south to Moraine Lake nice drive wonderful all day hike to view the sawtooth skyline of the Valley of the Ten Peaks and the exhilarating climax of the lake s clear turquoise waters For a view of the whole area take the cable car from Lake Louise up Mount Whitehorn Banff National Park The first and most famous of Canada s national parks began as so many things in this country with the railways When the C P R reached Banff in 1883 the Rockies were suddenly opened up to public access and the government decided two years later to preserve the region s beauty by declaring Banff a national park After three railway workers discovered hot sulfur springs bubbling from the earth their bosses built one of their grandest castle hotels the Banff Springs a monument to be visited even if you re not staying there The turreted edifice set down in the Bow River Valley has something of the fairytale castles of Ludwig of Bavaria Take a canoe out on the river If you re feeling less energetic take the waters at the Cave and Basin Springs 3 km 2 miles west of the hotel or the Upper Hot Springs a short drive south The springs are 29 C 85 F in winter rising to 42 C 108 F in summer The eight minute cable car ride from Upper Hot Springs up Sulfur Mountain 2 500 m 7 500 ft will give you a panoramic view of the mountains around the Bow Valley One of many fine excursions is the drive along Bow Valley Parkway Highway 1A then a hike along the marked trail beside the rapids to the lower and upper waterfalls in Johnston Canyon Back on the Trans Canada Highway towards Lake Louise look to the east for the crenellated silhouette of Castle Mountain 3 000 m 9 000 ft high Icefields Parkway This 233 km 140 mile drive on Highway 93 up the spine of the mountain range from Lake Louise to Jasper gives a rich sense of the Rockies varied beauties glaciers waterfalls lakes and canyons Take a full day so that you have time to explore some of the sights on foot Stop first at the Crowfoot Glacier where you can see the foot s two remaining toes the third having broken away The mass of ice facing you is 55 m 165 ft thick At Bow Summit leave the Parkway at the signpost to the viewpoint overlooking the lovely Peyto Lake a deep turquoise at the height of summer If you have time stop at Kilometer 119 on the Parkway to hike up the winding path to Parker s Ridge 2 185 m 6 560 ft above pretty alpine meadows overlooking the Saskatchewan Glacier the beginning of the great North Saskatchewan River that ends up in Hudson Bay Inside Jasper National Park put on good rubber or crepesoled shoes to walk out onto the ice of Athabasca Glacier part of the Columbia Icefield You can also venture onto the ice sheet in a snowmobile Note the rock debris or rubble moraine in the language of glaciologists in front of the glacier showing that the Athabasca is retreating a hundred years ago it reached to the other side of the Parkway At the Parkway s Kilometer 200 mark take Highway 93A to Athabasca Falls A comfortable boardwalk leads you on an informative nature walk right up to where the mighty river plunges over the narrow gorge The old fur trading post of Jasper is now a refreshingly peaceful resort town with a grand park lodge and fine facilities for rafting canoeing camping and other mountain sports Take the Jasper Tramway ride up Whistlers Mountain for a view of the Rockies highest peak Mount Robson One of the most attractive excursions is the drive along Maligne Canyon Stop off to look down into the sheer limestone gorge at the roiling waters sudden cascades and tranquil pools At the end of the canyon is Maligne Lake where the great attraction is a boat cruise around the picturesque Spirit Island Alberta This province of ranches and oil derricks likes to cultivate the image of Canada s Wild West If its politics are often conservative opponents compare some of the leaders with the province s cherished collection of dinosaurs they are of the adventurous brand favoring Calgary s rodeos and the commercial extravaganza of Edmonton s celebrated mammoth shopping mall With the discovery of huge oil fields after World War II Alberta s economy boomed the population exploded and confidence soared The enthusiasm is dampened occasionally by downturns in world oil prices but the atmosphere remains decidedly cheerful Alberta is very conscious of its geology Alternating 600 to 200 million years ago between dry land and sea the region developed a plant and animal life that decayed to form the oil coal and natural gas at the base of the province s modern prosperity Subsequent floods and earthquakes left the parched Badlands of the Red Deer River Valley as a protective crust preserving the skeletons of the dinosaurs They were discovered by surveyors looking for coal seams Calgary In this part of the world in past eras gold rushes created cities out of a wasteland overnight and just as quickly returned them to dust Soaring Middle East oil prices seemed to do the same thing for Calgary in the 1970s but the shining downtown skyscrapers that shot up then do not look as if they are about to crumble Not that Calgary was a wasteland when the post World War II oil boom began but it was little more than a cow town better known for bronco busting rodeos than business acumen Population more than doubled from 280 000 in 1961 to 590 000 20 years later chasing hard behind the provincial capital and arch rival Edmonton The town now boasts a population of 944 000 Hotshot bankers have moved in to handle the new wealth polishing up but not eclipsing the frontier image While hand tooled cowboy boots and Stetson hats are still popular the business suits between the two are increasingly sophisticated even Italian in cut leaving the string ties and blue jeans for the Stampede The ten days of the Calgary Stampede in the first half of July are by any standards anthropological or purely hedonistic a phenomenon to be experienced Cowboy hyperbole demands that it be known as the Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth a title dating back to its beginnings in 1912 The Stampede was originally conceived to show all the techniques and excitement of rounding up cattle on the prairies Today at Stampede Park it does indeed stage agricultural and garden exhibitions displays of Indian crafts and dancing and all the sideshows of a country fair But after the grand opening parade of baton twirling majorettes cowboys costumed Indians champion steers and smiling stars of the chamber of commerce the great attraction remains the rodeo Bareback riding and bronco busting bull riding and steer wrestling calf roping and Indian buffalo riding culminate in marvelous chuck wagon races The Rangeland Derby as it is known races four horse wagons like those used to bring food out to the cowboy on the range during roundup time The chuck wagon races are said to have originated when the last crew back in town had to buy all the drinks now the prize pot totals over 200 000 Just as much fun as the official events are the square dancing in the streets firework displays barbecue dinners and flapjack breakfasts Spend a more sober moment in the fascinating Glenbow Museum 130 Ninth Avenue S E Beautifully arranged exhibits of furniture costumes utensils and weapons give a vivid picture of Alberta life from the pioneers log cabin homesteads to the modern artifacts of oil drillers railway builders and miners One evocative exhibit of the Great Depression of the 1930s is a farm girl s party dress bejeweled with scores of safety pins arranged in patterns The life of Ojibwa and Cree Indians is displayed in tepees magnificent buffalo robes and beaded buckskin dance masks and snowshoes The shops and offices of the downtown skyscrapers are linked by a network of all weather bridges and subterranean galleries One of the main shopping centers is the four block Stephen Avenue Mall For a view of the town s steel and glass urban canyons and the Rocky Mountains looming on the western horizon take the elevator to the observation deck of the 207 m 623 ft Calgary Tower Immediately below it is a revolving restaurant Winter sports enthusiasts will appreciate the new facilities

campus which gains attractive new student residences from the Athletes Village On Bowfort Road 15 minutes west of town the Canada Olympic Park has built two ski jumps and the country s first combined bobsled and luge run Most popular with the tourists are the new downhill runs at the Nakiska ski area on Mount Allan 80 km 48 miles southwest on Highway 40 and the cross country trails at Canmore west on the Trans Canada Highway at the foot of Mount Rundle near the entrance to Banff National Park Drumheller The area around this old coalmining town is famous for the prehistoric fossils and remarkably complete remains of dinosaurs whose stamping grounds were the Badlands of the Red Deer River Valley The 130 km 78 mile drive northeast of Calgary on Highway 9 takes you through wheat growing country where you may see the farming communities of Hutterites an austere religious sect originally from Slovakia often persecuted for their pacifism The women wear traditional dirndl costumes with headscarf and apron while their husbands dressed all in black with broad rimmed hats cultivate the heavy beards of Old Testament prophets Drumheller s Dinosaur Trail places fossils and life size models of the beasts in their original habitat though you have to imagine a luxuriant humid jungle in place of the present day arid desert Looping 48 km 29 miles round the Red Deer River the trail starts out at Drumheller s fossil museum 335 First Street devoted mainly to the region s geology But for a most exciting confrontation with the prehistoric world of dinosaurs make for the new Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology on the Midland provincial park s North Dinosaur Trail This beautifully organized museum drawing on the most modern audiovisual techniques is named after Joseph Tyrrell the geologist who made the first discovery of Alberta s 65 million year old dinosaurs while surveying coal seams along the Red Deer River in 1884 Drawing on some of the finest of the 200 creatures unearthed in the area the Tyrrell museum recreates jungle environments for superbly reconstructed skeletons and models including Tyrrell s Albertosaurus the awesome Tyrannosaurus rex measuring 15 m 45 ft long and 6 m 19 ft tall in its cotton socks and the tiny but most lovable of all a duck billed Lambeosaurus just 3 m 10 ft tall followed by her baby Edmonton You can see the source of the provincial capital s wealth as you drive in from the airport On the southern outskirts of town on Highway 2 are the derricks and grasshopper pumps that have characterized Edmonton since the oil strike at the great well of Leduc Number 1 in 1947 But the town has created another treasure trove in the astounding West Edmonton Mall Stony Plain Road Highway 16 a shopping center to end all shopping centers complete with a waterpark and attracting as many as 140 000 customers on a busy day 40 per cent of them from the United States If you want a view of the whole city and the North Saskatchewan River on your way home stop off at Vista 33 the observation level of the telephone building Saskatchewan Though revenues from oil uranium coal and natural gas now approach agricultural income Saskatchewan is still known as Canada s bread basket During the Depression it was the country s poorest province close to starvation But that all changed with the timely rise of local boy John Diefenbaker as the first federal Prime Minister from Saskatchewan Farmers won t ever forget the deals he got for their high grade bread wheat in Russia and China You can see the monuments right across the Prairies huge cathedral like grain elevators Regina The queen Latinized in the provincial capital s name is of course Victoria The city s decorum would please her It s been cleaned up considerably since the first settlers arrived in the 1880s and found the banks of the Wascana Creek littered with hundreds of buffalo bones Indian hunters used to dry their buffalo meat and stretch the hides by the creek and left the bones in a heap The town was known as Pile of Bones until they were ground up for fertilizer Today you ll find the buffalo along with other regional wildlife prehistoric and present day in the Museum of Natural History on Albert Street The museum is south of the city center in the very pretty Wascana Park one of the few places in southern Saskatchewan where you ll see any trees The creek has been dammed to form a lake with a bird sanctuary out on Willow Island Also in the park is the provincial Legislative Building with an interesting portrait gallery of Indian chiefs

offers an astonishingly rich ethnic diversity in its rural and urban populations In addition to Anglo Saxon and French stock brought here by the fur trade late 19th century immigration campaigns have

fascinating reality North of 60 as locals call the territories above the 60 latitude ignored until recently by everybody but the Inuit and other native people who live there plus a few explorers and miners Even today if they ever staged a football game between the Yukon and the Northwest Territories the whole population could be comfortably seated in the stadium But more and more adventurers from

territory with such mundane services as railways roads telephones electricity and hot and cold running water In a subarctic land of soaring mountains and elongated glacial lakes beside the great Yukon River today s tourists can thank yesterday s prospectors for using part of their paydirt for some essential creature comforts Close to the original action and still providing the most vivid testimony
