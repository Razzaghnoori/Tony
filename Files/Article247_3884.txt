 Tubular Dude Good morning Eliza I think I pulled my quad Readers should know that in the interest of providing an experiential base for our Eating Club on sports food Eliza and I jogged across the Brooklyn Bridge and back yesterday evening Prior to the run we gathered at my apartment to eat various sport fuel energy nutrition performance snacks all of which came in bar form I first sampled the TwinLab Ironman Nutrition Bar in Cookie Dough flavor First off isn t cookie dough the wrong association for someone who presumably wants to work out and stay fit and healthy Second off ewwww Who wants to eat cookie dough right before running This bar possessed a floury dryness that induced slow cud chewing It was work to eat It tasted bad But it did have the coveted 40 30 30 ratio which I will let you explain Eliza We tried several other bars too I ll let you get into the details on them but for my money they were all bad and mostly in the same way as the cookie dough chalky a chore to get down bland tasting eliciting tremendous belches I do want to give special notice to the second entry from TwinLab The Ironman Nutrition Bar in Cookies N Creme flavor This was everything that Cookie Dough was and more So much more in fact that I spat it out before I swallowed it I rarely verging on never spit out food yet this was so repulsive in its texture mucousy sludge and taste not exactly sure what it was but not cookies n creme I can for sure tell you that that I could not countenance digesting it By far the worst bar we tried The run was lovely cool breeze sparkling skyline and I actually felt quite good energy wise I m not entirely willing to ascribe this to the sports bars we ate but it can t be ruled out Halfway through the run I tried our next sport food contestant Power Gel from PowerBar a little packet of goo that one is meant to squeeze into one s mouth in the midst of an exercise session Power Gel s consistency was like a more viscous yogurt I ask you can there be any food one wants less in the middle of a long jog than yogurt only more viscous Answer No there cannot Post run we tried Ultra Fuel sports drinks Mine was grape It was pretty good and refreshing Not much different than Gatorade Maybe a little sweeter definitely a little thicker in consistency We also tried the Jog Mate Protein Tube the one you thought smelled like meat Eliza Jumping on the recent food in a tube fad Jog Mate supports muscle recovery It directs you to consume entire tube contents within 30 minutes after exercise It resembles nothing so much as pudding in a tube Actually more like just pudding skin Lots of it Compressed together In a tube It wasn t bad and in general I m a big fan of the food in a tube movement Today I feel pretty good other than the quad I guess most of my muscles recovered perhaps thanks to the tube But what I want to know is is there any reason to eat an Ironman bar instead of a granola bar or drink Ultra Fuel instead of Snapple And how are your quads As ever Seth
