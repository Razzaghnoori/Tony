 The Road to Beverly Hills Grand Junction Colo Thursday Oct 7 1999 Yesterday we began the best part of our journey the stretch between Denver Colo and Moab Utah E seemed to be buoyant even exuberant As we climbed into the Rockies out of Denver she sighed I love the mountains I think I could even live here Why would anyone not want to live here We cruised through the tunnel that replaced the Loveland pass and floated down a long steep grade The mood was mellow Multicolored pines lined our path I m so happy now she said In the distance a storm sent the twilight careening at crazy angles Snow glistened on a perfect peak I noticed a billboard that said Coach Factory Outlet Left at Next Exit I laughed and pointed it out Look at that Isn t that ridiculous What a cheap commercial thing to put into this fabulous natural scene E looked at the billboard then barked Turn left Now E wasn t mellow anymore She was possessed a look of stony purpose on her face As we approached the Coach store she spotted the Donna Karan in the distance Oh my goodness This said quietly reverentially as if she were Balboa discovering the Pacific As it turns out E had never seen a factory outlet store before The next three hours were lost But E seemed ecstatic I fear however that I may not be the beneficiary of E s new mood I admit the warning signs are subtle Have I mentioned yet that E attracts perverts and molesters like a magnet It must have something to do with her deceptively childlike look We were once neighbors in Washington living across the street from the chancery of an Eastern European nation that will go unnamed Various surly young men attached to this diplomatic outpost spent their afternoons working on old Buicks in front of the building One day one of these men exposed himself to E while she was walking to the store Oddly E argued for giving this guy the benefit of the doubt She said his penis might have just fallen out of his pants by accident I thought otherwise On this trip already a strange long haired man in a West Virginia parking lot where we were making a U turn has struck up a gratuitous conversation And two nights ago the motel night clerk phoned our room just to check and see if everything is all right The point is E realizes she s prey and is usually afraid to be alone for a second Last night we went to a 7 Eleven down the block from the motel The guy behind the counter a slightly dissolute ski bum type seemed disturbingly interested in E And E seemed disturbingly interested in him Later she insisted on returning to the 7 Eleven alone for coffee But I thought you d sworn off coffee I think I m going to need it if I m going to post anything tonight Do you want me to go with you It s dark Oh no Thanks What could happen to me She s also been checking her e mail obsessively In the glow of the screen I can see her chuckling to herself And once when she made a phone call she asked me to leave the room Toward me she s pleasant and friendly but nothing more I admit I expected something else Was I crazy I ve transported her and looked after her for 2 000 miles I took her to the hospital I do all the manly driverly things I check the oil and I tighten the straps that are holding her fucking sofabed onto the roof We have good times in the car Then nothing Nothing I m tired I ll be damned if I m going to stay up for her to get back from the 7 Eleven
