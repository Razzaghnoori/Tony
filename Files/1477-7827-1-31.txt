 Background Ion channels located in the plasma membrane provide one means to mediate cellular adaptation to local environmental changes Voltage gated K channels in non nerve non muscle cells play crucial roles in cell development proliferation migration volume regulation as well as maintenance of membrane potential and cell viability This is in part because these channels regulate the cytoplasmic concentrations of K Ca 2 and Na ions 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 The diversity of voltage gated K channels and currents present in these non excitable non muscle non nerve cells is impressive Thus the assignment of specific functions to particular subclasses of K channel proteins represents a significant challenge 4 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Voltage gated K currents with distinct electrophysiological and pharmacological properties are present in granulosa cells GC and modulate resting membrane potential 4 12 13 16 17 Furthermore selective antagonism of GC K channels with distinct molecular correlates electrophysiological properties and expression patterns can influence differentially GC proliferation steroidogenic capability and apoptosis 17 18 Our laboratory has previously identified two distinct delayed rectifier K currents in pig GC a slow current I Ks associated with channels formed by co assembly of KCNQ1 pore forming and KCNE1 accessory proteins and an ultra rapid current I Kur formed by co assembly of KCNA pore forming and KCNAB accessory proteins 4 Moreover we have shown that selective block of I Ks enhances basal progesterone synthesis while complete block of both I Ks and I Kur accelerates apoptosis 18 Here our goal was to determine the functional effects of antagonizing GC K channels formed by KCNA vs KCNQ family proteins To this end we treated primary cultures of GC and monolayers of the immortalized granulosa cell line PGC 2 19 with the K channel antagonist 4 aminopyridine 4 AP 4 aminopyridine at millimolar concentrations completely inhibits K currents conducted by heterologously expressed KCNA channels and native GC I Kur but lacks significant effects on native GC I Ks 4 12 13 20 Kusaka showed that antagonism of 4 AP sensitive slowly inactivating delayed rectifier K currents suppressed both basal and luteinizing hormone LH stimulated progesterone production 21 In this report we extend those findings by demonstrating 4 AP inhibition of follicle stimulating hormone FSH stimulated progesterone production and by elucidating the underlying mechanisms Methods Reagents Cell culture media supplements

Culture Porcine ovaries were collected at a local slaughterhouse and GC were isolated using techniques described previously in detail 4 18 Briefly small 1 3 mm diameter to medium 4 6 mm diameter follicles were aspirated by hand using a 19 gauge needle attached to a 10 cc syringe GC were separated from follicular fluid by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 minutes Cells were washed twice with a 1 1 mixture of Ham F10 nutrient medium and Dulbecco modified Eagle medium DMEM containing 4 2 Hydroxyethyl piperazine 1 ethanesulfonic acid HEPES 25 mM penicillin 50 U ml and streptomycin 50 g ml Culture conditions for GC were similar to those described previously by our laboratory and others 4 18 22 23 The basic culture medium consisted of HEPES buffered DMEM F10 1 1 supplemented with fetal bovine serum FBS 10 penicillin 50 U ml streptomycin 50 g ml gentamicin 57 ng ml and amphotericin 2 5 g ml Freshly isolated GC were plated in the basic serum supplemented culture media on collagen coated 24 well 500 l well or 6 well 2 ml well culture dishes and incubated at 37 C in a humidified atmosphere of 5 CO 2 and air In every experiment cells were plated at equal density for each treatment group Plating density between experiments varied from 2 10 4cells well 24 multiwell to 1 10 6cells well 6 multiwell Culture wells in the 6 multiwell clusters had a well diameter of 34 8 mm and a growth area of 9 4 cm 2 while culture wells in the 24 multiwell clusters had a well diameter of 15 6 mm and a growth area of 1 9 cm 2 The culture media were changed 16 h after plating to fresh serum supplemented media that contained either vehicle or treatment s Media were collected and replaced at 24 h intervals thereafter 4 AP was dissolved directly into the culture media on the day of use and the pH was readjusted to 7 4 with saturated HCl after addition of drug DIDS 4 4 diisothicyanato stilbene 2 2 disulfonic acid was diluted into culture media from a 200X aqueous stock Stock solutions of forskolin 10 mM and 3 isobutyl 1 methylxanthine IBMX 80 mM were in DMSO In a subset of experiments GC were cultured in a defined serum free medium of HEPES buffered DMEM F10 1 1 containing insulin 300 mU ml

from Bruce Downey McGill University and maintained in culture in McCoy s modified 5A medium supplemented with 10 FBS as described previously in detail 19 PGC 2 cells have been well characterized with respect to steroidogenic capability cAMP response and gonadotropin insensitivity 19 Here PGC 2 were seeded at a density of approximately 5 10 5cells ml of serum containing medium in 24 well tissue culture plates After 24 h the medium was replaced with serum free medium containing either pregnenolone 1 g ml androstenedione 100 M 5 dihydrotestosterone 5 DHT 10 or 100 M or forskolin 5 M and IBMX 10 M To ensure the validity of this model for assessing the functional effects on the K channel antagonists we used whole cell patch clamp techniques 4 to document the presence of 4 AP sensitive K currents in PGC 2 see additional file 1 Additional File 1 4 AP sensitive delayed rectifier K current in PGC 2 Whole cell patch clamp currents recorded from a PGC 2 cell in response to a series of six depolarizing test pulses of 1 s duration step 20 mV from a holding potential of 50 mV before left and after middle application of 2 mM 4 aminopyridine 4 AP The right panel shows the 4 AP sensitive current obtained by subtracting the current traces recorded in the presence middle of the drug from those recorded in the absence left of the drug Recording conditions are identical to those used previous by our laboratory to record voltage dependent K currents from pig granulosa cells Mol Pharmacol 2002 61 201 13 The data demonstrate that PGC 2 cells express K currents similar to the granulosa cell ultra rapid delayed rectifier current I Kur in terms of the voltage dependence and kinetics of activation and deactivation as well as the sensitivity to 4 AP Similar currents were recorded in 7 of 7 cells assayed using patch clamp techniques Click here for file Measurement of Membrane Potential The resting membrane potentials of cultured GC were assessed by spectrophotometric determination of DiBAC 4 3 fluorescence excitation 485 nM emission 527 nM Fluoroskan Ascent FL LabSystems Inc Helsinki Finland Cells were equilibrated with 2 M DiBAC 4 3 for 30 minutes at 37 C prior to fluorescence measurement In most experiments GC were bathed in culture media However one set of fluorescence measurements compared GC incubated in a normal Tyrode solution containing in mM 132 NaCl 4 KCl 1 MgCl 2 1 CaCl 2 5 dextrose 10 HEPES pH 7 4 to GC similarly incubated in a relatively low chloride Tyrode solution in which the NaCl was replaced with sodium aspartate Measurement of Intracellular Potassium Intracellular levels of potassium were assessed by determination of PBFI fluorescence Cells were equilibrated with the cell permeant acetoxylmethyl ester of the ion sensitive

Preparation of GC Lysates Whole cell lysates were made from GC monolayers by standard techniques using a lysis buffer consisting of PBS with 1 Nonidet P40 0 5 sodium deoxycholate 0 1 SDS and protease inhibitor cocktail 1 100 Sigma P8340 Lysis buffer was added to the culture dish after washing with cold PBS 3 times The culture dishes were scraped and the lysate was aspirated into a syringe with a 21 gauge needle to shear DNA The lysates were rocked in the cold for 1 h and centrifuged for 10 min at 10 000 g In some cases a highly enriched mitochondrial fraction was obtained using a commercially available kit Mitchondrial Fractionation Kit Active Motif Carlsbad CA according to the manufacturer s instructions Protein concentrations of GC lysates were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method Micro BCA Protein Assay Pierce Rockford IL Immunoblotting For direct comparisons of protein expression between drug treated and untreated cells equal amounts of protein were loaded in adjacent lanes on a single polyacrylamide gel separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis SDS PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by the semi dry transfer method The membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5 nonfat milk in Tris buffered saline TBS 100 mM Tris 0 9 NaCl pH 7 5 containing 0 1 Tween 20 then incubated overnight at 4

room temperature with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody diluted 1 1500 in 5 nonfat milk 0 1 Tween TBS After four additional washes with 0 1 Tween TBS bound primary antibodies were visualized using an ECL detection system and recorded on radiographic film Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Densitometric analysis was performed using Scion Image Scion Corporation Frederick MD Equal loading was confirmed by either immunoblotting for actin or Coomassie blue staining of gel lanes loaded and subjected to SDS PAGE in a manner identical to those used for immunoblotting Immunoassays Progesterone concentrations were determined by a solid phase radioimmunoassay CAC Progesterone Diagnostic Products Corp Los Angeles CA validated for measuring progesterone in the culture media The assay sensitivity was approximately 0 3 ng ml The cross reactivity with androstenedione 1000 ng mL was 0 047 The cross reactivity with pregnenolone 500 ng mL was 0 30 The within and between assay coefficients of variation for the progesterone assay were 4 3 and 11 7 respectively Aliquots of culture media were stored at 20 C for up to 60 days prior to progesterone assay In the initial series of experiments where serial progesterone measurements were made from a single culture well media progesterone concentrations 24 48 hours post treatment were normalized to pre treatment concentrations In subsequent experiments progesterone concentrations at various time points post treatment were normalized to either cell number or protein concentration Estradiol 17 was measured using commercially available reagents TKE2 Diagnostic Products Corp Los Angeles CA This assay had been validated previously for porcine serum 24 and was further modified and validated for use with culture media containing FBS In brief estradiol 17 could be quantitatively recovered when added to culture media and increasing dilutions of media spiked with estradiol 17 produced similar concentrations when evaluated in the assay The sensitivity was 4 9 pg ml The intra and interassay coefficients of variation for estradiol assay were 4 8 and 8 3 respectively Cyclic AMP was measured in GC lysates using an enzyme immunoassay according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer Assay Designs Ann Arbor MI Determination of Cell Number The number of viable GC in the monolayer cultures was determined by first harvesting the attached cells with a trypsin containing solution mg ml NaCl 8 KCl 0 4 dextrose 1 NaHCO 3 0 6 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid sodium salt Na EDTA 0 2 trypsin 0 5 and then counting directly the number of viable cells using trypan blue exclusion and hemacytometry Flow Cytometry Flow cytometry was also used to assess GC viability and size using methods described previously in detail to determine propidium iodide uptake and forward small angle light scatter respectively 18 25 Briefly ten thousand cells were examined per sample using a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur to excite the cells with a 488 nM argon laser and the collected data obtained were analyzed using Cell Quest software Becton Dickinson Mount View CA Changes in the forward light scattering properties of GC were used to infer changes in GC size Debris shrunken apoptotic GC and dead GC stained by propidium iodide were excluded from analysis Statistical Analysis Data are expressed as mean SEM unless stated otherwise Statistical analysis of treatment effects on forward scatter characteristics was performed using the non parametric Friedman test For all other data significant differences between groups were identified by analysis of variance ANOVA using appropriate general linear models and multiple comparisons were made using the least significant differences LSD procedure Statistix Analytical Software Tallahassee FL Differences were considered to be significant when P 0 05 The numbers of replicates per treatment group and independent experiments associated with specific studies are provided in the figures or accompanying legends Results and Discussion Effects of 4 AP on GC Viability and Progesterone Production Treatment with 4 AP 2 mM decreased progesterone accumulation in the media of serum supplemented GC cultures at 24 h and 48 h post treatment in the presence and absence of FSH Figure 1 The decreased progesterone concentrations in the media of drug treated cultures did not reflect significant differences in the number of viable cells under these culture conditions Figure 2A Densitometric analysis of data from 3 experiments similar to that shown in Figure 2Brevealed no significant effect of 4 AP treatment on the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen PCNA These data provide additional evidence that 4 AP exerts neither an anti proliferative nor a pro apoptotic influence on serum supplemented GC cultures because PCNA expression is a sensitive marker of GC proliferation and apoptosis 18 26 27 The lack of 4 AP effect on GC viability is also evident from the flow cytometric analysis the percentages of cells staining positive for propidium iodide were 8 2 and 7 2 in the presence and absence of drug n 4 samples of 10 000 cells each from 4 GC isolations Treatment with 4 AP 2 mM also diminished progesterone accumulation on days 1 and 2 post treatment in GC cultures maintained in the defined serum free media in the presence and absence of FSH However in these serum free cultures 4 AP treatment was associated with not only decreased progesterone accumulation but also decreased numbers of viable cells Table 1 The percentage of viable cells was unaffected by 4 AP Control 90 4 vs 4 AP 88 4 n 5 FSH 86 2 FSH 4 AP 86 2 n 9 suggesting that 4 AP inhibited growth rather than promoted cell death Overall these data are consistent with previous reports that endocrine cells express voltage sensitive ion channels that can contribute to the regulation of not only resting membrane potential and cell volume but also cell proliferation and steroidogenesis 12 13 16 18 21 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 The K currents blocked by 4 AP in pig GC are conducted by ion channels formed by heteromeric complexes of pore forming subunits from the KCNA also called Kv1 or Shaker family of proteins and accessory subunits from the KCNAB also called Kv family of proteins 4 Similar 4 AP sensitive K currents play a key role in transduction of mitogenic signals in a variety of cell types and 4 AP treatment has been associated with not only growth arrest but also apoptosis 2 3 8 9 10 14 38 39 40 41 42 Our finding that 24 h exposure to 4 AP decreased the number of viable GC in serum free but not serum supplemented primary cultures is consistent with the reported effects of 4 AP and other K channel antagonists on other cell types 8 43 44 It has been shown that the concentrations of K channel antagonists required to inhibit growth of human bladder tumor cells can be 70 times higher in the presence than the absence of serum 43 4 AP has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of human myelobastic leukemia cells by preventing growth factor activation of mitogen activated protein kinase MAPK pathways 42 This mechanism may be responsible for the anti proliferative effect of 4 AP manifest in Table 1 It is likely that MAPK pathways are less robust in GC grown in defined serum free vs serum supplemented media however validation of this hypothesis would require additional experiments beyond the scope of the present investigation We concluded that the anti proliferative effect of 4 AP may contribute to the decreased progesterone accumulation observed in serum free but not serum supplemented GC cultures then focused additional efforts on understanding other mechanisms responsible for 4 AP inhibition of progesterone production The effects of 4 AP in serum supplemented GC cultures are consistent with previous reports that antagonism of voltage sensitive K currents can modulate basal and gonadotropin stimulated progesterone accumulation in the absence of any effect on cell growth or death We have shown previously that antagonism of the slowly activating non inactivating granulosa K current I Ks enhances basal progesterone production by depolarizing membrane potential and thus enhancing calcium influx via pimozide sensitive Ca 2 channels 18 In contrast Kusaka 21 showed that antagonism of 4 AP sensitive slowly inactivating delayed rectifier K currents suppressed both basal and LH stimulated progesterone production Data presented in Figures 1and 2confirm the inhibitory effects of 4 AP on basal progesterone production by cultured pig GC and demonstrate for the first time a similar inhibitory effect of 4 AP on FSH stimulated progesterone synthesis Effects of 4 AP on Pathways for Steroid Hormone Biosynthesis The inhibitory action of 4 AP on progesterone production was investigated further using not only primary cultures but also the spontaneously established granulosa cell line PGC 2 19 Although PGC 2 lack FSH receptors these cells can serve as a useful in vitro model for GC function because they produce cAMP in response to forskolin and synthesize progesterone and estradiol when supplied with appropriate substrates We examined the effects of 4 AP on cAMP progesterone and estradiol production by PCG 2 after confirming that these cells express 4 AP sensitive voltage gated K currents similar to those in primary cells see additional file 1 4 AP decreased production of cAMP Figure 3A and expression of StAR by PGC 2 Figure 3B 4 AP had no significant effect on progesterone production by PCG 2 cultured in the presence of pregnenolone androstenedione or 5 DHT Figure 4A In contrast 4 AP significantly reduced estradiol production by PGC 2 cultures provided with androstenedione Figure 4B To evaluate the relevance of the experimental results obtained using PGC 2 we examined the effect of 4 AP on the progesterone output of primary GC cultures supplemented with either the membrane permeable cAMP analog 8 4 chlorophenylthio adenosine 3 5 cyclic monophosphorothioate 8 CPT cAMP 1 mM or estradiol 17 500 ng ml The inhibitory effect of 4 AP on progesterone accumulation was partially but not completely overcome by the addition of 8 CPT cAMP Table 2 4 AP had no inhibitory effects on either basal or FSH stimulated progesterone production by GC cultures supplemented with estradiol 17 Figure 5 Thereby the combined results of experiments performed using PGC 2 and primary GC cultures suggest that 4 AP inhibition of GC progesterone production may be linked to decreased expression of StAR decreased generation of cAMP and decreased output of estradiol StAR plays a key role in the initial steps of steroidogenesis because it is required for transport of cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane where CYP11A1 resides and the first reaction in progesterone synthesis occurs 45 cAMP is a well known second messenger in FSH and LH stimulated progesterone synthesis and a key effect of the cAMP dependent protein kinase in GC is transcriptional control of StAR 46 47 Estradiol is recognized as a biological amplifier of basal FSH and cAMP stimulated progesterone production in pig GC with significant synergistic effects distal to the generation of cAMP at one or more steps in cholesterol transport and metabolism 48 Our experimental results are thus consistent with 4 AP inhibition of GC progesterone output via drug effects on multiple interacting sites in the steroidogenic pathway Moreover despite multiple sites of action the drug s actions cannot be dismissed as non specific because 4 AP had no effects on either 3 hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 HSD mediated conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone or androgen androstenedione 5 DHT stimulated progesterone synthesis Estradiol has been reported to affect K channel expression and gating in smooth muscle 49 50 51 52 53 The data presented here do not address directly the potential for estradiol modulation of voltage gated K channel expression or activity in GC However such a mechanism seems unlikely to account for the ability of estradiol to oppose the inhibitory effects of 4 AP on GC progesterone production The K channel subunits and currents modulated by estradiol in vascular and uterine smooth muscle differ from the 4 AP sensitive KCNA family channels that contribute to the 4 AP sensitive current I Kur in pig GC 4 49 50 52 53 Moreover in the single study where estradiol was shown to influence the gating of a uterine delayed rectifier current with electrophysiological characteristics resembling those of GC I Kur the observed effect of the hormone was inhibitory 51 and thereby similar rather than opposite to the effect of 4 AP Additional experiments were performed in an attempt to identify signaling pathways that transduce specific inhibitory effects of 4 AP These focused on 4 AP modulation of membrane potential intracellular ion concentrations and cell size as described below Effects of 4 AP on Membrane Potential Intracellular Ions Cell Size Hormonal signal transduction and steroidogenesis can be affected by changes in intracellular and extracellular concentrations of inorganic ions cellular resting membrane potential and cell size 29 30 35 54 55 56 57 58 59 Blockade of 4 AP sensitive K channels in non nerve non muscle cells can lead to changes in transmembrane ion gradients membrane potential and cell volume 42 60 On this basis we determined the effects of 24 h exposure to 4 AP on GC size membrane potential and intracellular potassium K in Samples 10 000 cells of GC from 24 hour cultures associated with 4 GC isolations were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine if 4 AP treatment influenced GC size Light scattering properties did not differ significantly with GC isolate However the average forward scatter median coefficient of variation of GC cultured for 24 hours in the presence of 4 AP 768 15 was significantly greater than that of GC maintained similarly in the absence of drug 694 15 Representative dot plots are shown in Figure 6 Resting membrane potential Figure 7A and K in Figure 7B were also found to be increased in GC exposed to 4 AP based on DiBAC 4 3 and PBFI fluorescence respectively The observed drug induced increases in cell size and K in suggest that 4 AP sensitive K channels represent a significant K efflux pathway involved in maintenance of cell volume in GC Interestingly the increased K in may contribute directly to the inhibitory effects of 4 AP on production of cAMP and progesterone Loss of K from the intracellular compartment of rat GC has been associated with opposite effects namely enhanced synthesis of both cAMP and progesterone 61 The observed increase hyperpolarization of GC resting membrane potential cannot be explained easily by any direct effect of the drug In fact 4 AP inhibition of K efflux would be expected to depolarize rather than hyperpolarize membrane potential Data obtained previously in our laboratory suggest that inhibition of granulosa I Kur should be associated with a 10 to 20 mV depolarization of cell resting membrane potential block of I Ks alone decreased resting potential by 10 mV while block of both I Ks and I Kur decreased resting potential by 20 to 30 mV 18 Most previous investigations of 4 AP effects on the resting membrane potentials of non nerve non muscle cells have similarly demonstrated drug induced depolarization 42 60 although there is a single report showing 4 AP induced hyperpolarization of chondrocyte membrane potential 62 We hypothesized that hyperpolarization of 4 AP treated GC could reflect anion influx associated with activation of a Cl entry pathway sensitive to changes in cell volume as well as membrane potential To test this hypothesis the effects of 4 AP on membrane potential were examined using GC incubated in either media modified to contain the chloride channel antagonist DIDS or a physiological buffer solution modified to contain a low 8 mM concentration of chloride In contrast to the results obtained in the standard media Figure 7A 4 AP did not induce significant hyperpolarization of GC under these conditions Figure 8A 8B Exposure to DIDS alone significantly decreased depolarized GC resting membrane potential Figure 8B suggesting that an outward chloride current chloride influx contributes to the normal resting potential of pig GC Membrane potential was further depolarized in GC exposed to 4 AP in the presence of DIDS Figure 8B consistent with the hypothesis that 4 AP induced hyperpolarization depends on chloride influx Interestingly concomitant exposure to DIDS prevented 4 AP from diminishing the accumulation of progesterone in GC culture media Figure 8C suggesting that chloride influx membrane hyperpolarization or both might mediate this effect of 4 AP Chloride channels or chloride ions are known to influence cAMP stimulated steroidogenesis by adrenal cells 29 human chorionic gonadotropin hCG stimulated steroidogenesis by amphibian follicle enclosed oocytes 56 as well as LH stimulated steroidogenesis in rat Leydig cells 29 MA 10 cells 59 and chicken GC 35 In mammalian cells removal of extracellular chloride stimulates basal and protein kinase A PKA dependent steroid hormone production by increasing the expression of StAR and potentiating the effects of submaximal concentrations of cAMP 29 59 The proposed mechanism of action involves chloride efflux depolarization of the mitochondrial and plasma membranes and alterations to protein synthesis and cholesterol transport 29 59 The data shown here in Figures 7and 8suggest strongly that chloride ions can influence progesterone production in pig GC by similar mechanisms In our experiments the chloride influx and membrane hyperpolarization associated with 4 AP treatment not only decreased expression of StAR but also inhibited cAMP production and steroidogenesis The observed effects of Cl channel antagonists differ significantly between the present study where DIDS prevented 4 AP from decreasing progesterone synthesis and previous investigations where DIDS and other Cl channel antagonists prevented LH from enhancing progesterone production 29 35 56 However this discrepancy is expected because DIDS antagonizes a chloride influx pathway in pig GC and chloride efflux pathways in Leydig cells In summary the data demonstrate that 4 AP inhibits basal and FSH stimulated progesterone production by pig GC via a complex mechanism involving drug action at multiple interacting steps in the steroidogenic pathway Drug block of the voltage gated potassium channels that conduct the ultra rapid delayed rectifier current I Kur is associated with increased intracellular potassium concentration increased cell volume activation of chloride influx and hyperpolarization of resting membrane potential These changes in the GC internal milieu appear to modulate the inhibitory effects of 4 AP on expression of StAR and production of steroid hormones The physiological implications of the data are significant as they suggest novel roles for granulosa cell ion channels We demonstrate for the first time not only that delayed rectifier K channels play a significant role in GC volume regulation but also that voltage and or volume sensitive Cl channels modulate GC membrane potential and progesterone production Additional experiments are required to link these data obtained in vitro to functionally significant changes in GC volume and chloride flux during normal follicular development Conclusions In conclusion the present studies indicate that the K channel antagonist 4 AP inhibits basal and FSH stimulated progesterone production by pig GC Exposure to 4 AP is associated with decreased production of cAMP decreased expression of StAR and decreased synthesis of estradiol These inhibitory actions of 4 AP on adenylate cyclase activity StAR expression and steroidogenesis may reflect drug induced changes in the intracellular concentrations of K and Cl and the GC resting membrane potential Further studies are required to elucidate fully the mechanisms involved Additional investigation is warranted 4 AP is reported to have therapeutic potential for the relief of symptoms associated with demyelinating diseases such as spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis 63 64 65 66 67 68 The drug is currently being studied in large scale human trials 68 Drug induced inhibition of steroid hormone production could have significant effects in these patients For example 4 AP could exacerbate abnormal steroid hormone profiles associated with spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis and thereby contribute to
