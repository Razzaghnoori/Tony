                so you keep a budget   uh not really all i i just have one commitment and that is that at the end of the month that uh that everything is paid and thats basically my budget   thats your budget eh   so we use credit cards and uh lets see what else and when i get a when i get a uh a bill in the mail i write a check out for it immediately   yep   put a date on the outside of the envelope stick it in my little Franklin Planner and uh i carry it around and then on the day that im supposed to mail it why mail it and that way i know how much im in the hole so basically  my budget is uh based on   if uh the bank accounts low why we dont spend very much   yeah my uh wife and i were new young couple starting out so weve been trying to  budget its getting a lot a lot tighter and weve actually worked out a very extensive year long budget   oh wow   so we know exactly what were gonna spend when and when were gonna have money and weve worked out a cash flow we just bought a house which is another reason why were really keeping track of the pennies and that stuff   oh yeah     and so we have this detailed budget and in some ways its really kind of nice because theres not much of a worry or not much a discussion or any real conflict over whether we should do this or that or we always have a theres a sense of confidence a little bit because we both know that were going to have money to do what we said were going to do   yeah now you have a consensus   yeah we as my brother told me when he hes in accounting and he suggested we do this as we were   ahead of time huh   making these big financial steps and all this stuff and he said well you just do this and you fight once and and thats it once a year and thats it because youve worked out the budget and what youre going to spend     ah thats very good ive im uh i i tried that in the beginning and when when when i say tried it i we tried to sit down there was no consensus   ah   uh we both agreed  that uh how shall i say it was the best consensus we could get was uh were both are pretty thrifty and and uh you know it just well just watch our we just wont spend money uh big items well  kind of talk to each other about but we have two were playing uh Russian Roulette i guess although weve been married uh how many years now uh   lets see       twenty six twenty seven years now   doesnt sound sounds like you guys have gotten something worked out thats gonna work just fine   well its it what it is its just a kind of a commitment not to spend too much   yeah   and uh  so the uh but the uh the budget idea sounds pretty good i think if if if we ever had one of these financial crisis you know like a oh an an emergency of some kind a job uh loss or something like that wed have to  wed have to do that but neither one of us are predicting what what i do with her is i we have two bank accounts   umhum   one i i wanted to uh i wanted her to uh to learn how to balance her checkbook because shes she just the the best she can do is is keep it uh current so to speak so what i did was i gave her another checkbook and i said okay you this is your account you can have money anytime you   yeah   want it just tell me how much is in your account   umhum   she said no you are trying to control me i said im not you know you can have six hundred dollars in there if you want another three hundred just tell me and uh so finally we got we have one of these uh things where we get money the company puts makes a direct deposit   yes   so i give her lets see what  she gets uh like a third of the money for the household and i pay everything else   yeah what weve done see weve only been married three years and i my my wife isnt real good with checkbooks and math and all that stuff and so what i did is i just gave it all to her and i said you have to do it everything and then i come in and help her   i think thats good   and uh thats been really good because its you know weve both come to appreciate and understand whats going on and she does most everything now and its really quite nice actually and uh   i i think thats good one one of my uh friends suggested that that life would be a little easier around our house even yet if i had her do do that because
