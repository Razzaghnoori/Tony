 Questioning the Cocaine Question Ask but Don t Tell Real reporters don t write I asked because it s not important who asked the question While framing questions in a way to draw out interesting or informative answers is important as your article points out it s still the answer that matters And while reporters print and electronic talking on television often talk about themselves and how they developed a story in the newspaper itself it s the story that matters There really is enough self promotion in the business and your suggestion that we advertise our authorship of questions would make it worse Moreover you misrepresent the article you criticize Gov George Bush was not asked that day in Akron Ohio about long ago cocaine abuse and my story did not say he had been He had declined to answer a question about what he had told his daughters about drugs on the reasonable ground that he wanted to leave them out of the campaign But as NBC s David Bloom was trying to rephrase the question in a more general way Bush did it for him and said baby boomer parents should tell their children not to use drugs and do so forthrightly I then followed up with this question for which I make no apology because it corresponds with an obvious reality And if a child asks a baby boomer parent Well did you His reply which I quoted and characterized as awkward was I think the baby boomer parent ought to say I ve learned from mistakes I may or may not have made And I d like to share some wisdom with you Adam Clymer New York William Saletan replies You re a fine and careful reporter A careful reporter gives the reader enough context to put each quote in perspective and to understand how the events of the day were shaped Why doesn t this rule apply to your questioning of Bush Bush evidently would have preferred to talk to the press that day about tax cuts and religious charities Instead reporters asked him about issues arising from the controversy over his alleged drug abuse and in the case of your question the implications of that controversy for what boomer parents should say to their kids about drugs In short you David Bloom and the other reporters on hand chose the topic That s a major reason albeit not the only reason Bush provided some justification in his speech why questions about drug use ended up in your headline and faith based institutions ended up buried at the bottom In that sense you helped drive the story If you don t report this fact aren t you omitting information that the reader needs in order to understand the persistence of the drug story You say that it s not important who asked the question But if a protester had shouted your question at Bush would you have reported who asked the question If so why not follow the same practice when the person posing the question is a reporter I share your distaste for journalists talking about themselves and I don t propose that we print our names every time we ask a question Usually as you know the choice of topic is fairly obvious But isn t there some point at which the media s choice of topic can become so controversial and so determinative of the course of the campaign that the principle of self disclosure supersedes the principle of modesty You re right that I oversimplified the exchange with Bush in Ohio The questions were about what he had told his kids about drugs and what other parents should tell their kids Of course we both know that the implicit background to these questions was the rumors of Bush s own drug abuse and in that sense this larger topic was what your question and the others were about Nobody was asking Gary Bauer such questions that day except perhaps for pointed contrast because the obvious hook for these questions is Bush s alleged hypocrisy Still I should have characterized your question more carefully I ll take responsibility for my oversight Will you take responsibility for yours Lines of Succession Carter as Henry VI see by Steven E Landsburg At times Henry was mentally ill or at least clinically depressed So much so that it was unsafe to leave him alone with sharp objects Doesn t sound like Carter to me Edward IV a great king This is the guy who spurned an offer of marriage with the daughter of the king of France a marriage that would have created a valuable alliance in favor of a commoner He married her without notifying anyone in his court This shortsightedness caused his chief ally Warwick to defect to Lancaster and they were able to oust Edward from the throne for a time It was only with the aid of his brother the eventual Richard III that Edward was able to reclaim it English people turning to Henry VII That s the biggest joke of all Henry won one battle and fortunately for him killed Richard The English people accepted Henry as king despite his having the aid of foreign troops because they were tired of civil war not out of any love for Henry The fact that Henry killed off all the York heirs and blamed some of their murders on Richard helped him keep the throne And it let his son Henry VIII become the most powerful and autocratic of all English rulers So if Landsburg is correct it means that we have a dictator read Buchanan in our future David Brandon Los Angeles
