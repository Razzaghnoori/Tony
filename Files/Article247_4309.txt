 He Jests at Scars Dear Jack The thing I find most disheartening about Rosen s book is probably best summed up by an oft used Shakespeare line He jests at scars that never felt a wound That is Rosen s writing and thinking betrays almost no familiarity with what is actually required to produce good journalism He criticizes reporters mostly political reporters who maintain that an adversarial relationship with government is healthy believing instead that some fabled cooperation with civic groups would be better But what about when the adversarial relationship comes from government itself Here s one example from my backyard Shortly after taking office the Giuliani administration in New York began stonewalling the most routine media requests for information In one instance a department denied a request by the New York Daily News made under the local Freedom of Information law for a list of all investigations commenced by an agency in the previous year Just a list as had been provided by every previous administration in recent memory What re the reporter and city editor supposed to do Go to the publisher and hope that the relationship will be healed through some kind of feel good civic project between the paper and the mayor Given the politically corrupt relationship that exists between the News publisher and the mayor that d be the worst possible journalistic outcome To its credit the Daily News sued and only under court order did the administration provide the information as it was legally required to provide That s an ugly and uncivil process but it s also under the circumstances the best way to serve the public interest Rosen s worldview is so far removed from actual journalistic practice that it can t even imagine such a scenario much less grasp its importance I ll conclude by trying to give an answer to the book s title question One thing that journalists should be for is independence In my view that doesn t require objectivity or neutrality or being boring or being good citizens though it doesn t preclude any of those things either It means simply that the task of gathering and presenting news must be kept as separate as humanly possible from pretty much everything government interest groups and the publisher s own business plans Rosen s book demonstrates so little understanding of that core journalistic value that it paints itself out of the picture Best Jim
