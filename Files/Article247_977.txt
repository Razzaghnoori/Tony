 re Twelve steps in the web Hello Andrew The story about the Web confession was very disturbing involving a particularly mad and grisly crime Larry Froide A father with custody of his small daughter still felt pressed by his ex wife s presence in his life So he set the house on fire intentionally to kill the child in fact he went in as if to rescue her but instead dropped her closer to the flames After Froide confessed on line three members of the list notified the authorities and were promptly flamed by others Interestingly one who did not tell the police was the moderator of the list Dr Rotgers of yes Rutgers where he is director of the program for Addiction Consultation and Treatment Dr Rotgers said after all since the child was already dead I love those scare quotes no purpose would be served in the form of protecting anyone for rash emotional and poorly thought out action I think he meant from such action Rotgers sent Froide private e mails with referrals for therapy I think you re right about the effect of anonymity on the Web It s part of the general lack of reality about the Internet is the child dead or only dead I m not so sure about A A though This particular list wasn t following a 12 step philosophy it was something called Moderation Management and one of the people who called the FBI was an AA advocate A long time ago I used to go to Al Anon which is a support group for relatives of alcoholics and I must say I thought it was a good group people were very kind with much life experience and wisdom And it wasn t so anonymous either my buddy gave me his business card he ran a lamp store in my neighborhood Unlike on the Net people in 12 step groups often get to know each other outside they go out for coffee become friends for a while AA was a big date scene maybe it still is There s an egalitarianism about the original 12 step programs I really like a humble improvising approach And the thing is it s not like there is some fabulous alternative that works better In AA though the anonymity well semi anonymity is due to the social stigma of alcoholism On the Internet it seems connected with the desire to lead a fantasy life Lots of people didn t believe Froide was describing real events as if they often encountered very detailed and plausible first person accounts of imaginary crimes Weird Interesting that we both were taken by stories about evil fathers in divorce cases Let s not forget the one in last week s horrific story who injected his son with the AIDS virus to avoid paying child support It casts an interesting lurid glow on the current obsession with Fatherhood and father s rights But how long do you think it will be before the Wall Street Journal runs an op ed by David Blankenhorn pointing out that if the couples in these cases had only had covenant marriages those kids would be alive today Cheers Katha ps I haven t read Conversations with God What is it
