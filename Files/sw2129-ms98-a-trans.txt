          all right   uh what kind of um besides your besides your salary whats whats the most the thing that you would consider to be most important as a benefit   yeah well i guess uh i i im kind of in uh in an unusual situation probably for this particular topic because im selfemployed   oh   uh   have you ever worked for a large organization   but yes i have worked ive worked for TI and ive worked for LTV   oh okay   uh and i suppose that uh so far as benefits are concerned the most important to uh me today would probably be uh something to do with retirement benefits   okay   at at this point in my life though im im im a little older probably than you know than the typical new employee would be anyway uh   uhhuh   in you know in my younger days i i was interested in whats the vacation policy and then as i matured a little bit you know i was more interested in what are the insurance benefits you know   yeah   but uh so i i you know i guess it from my point of view it depends on uh you know on where you are in life as to whats most important   yeah probably because you said retirement and that really has not even occurred to me once   and uh yeah yeah uh you know if youre not uh if you havent havent looked forward to you know what are you going to do when you retire   uhhuh   when you get to the point where youre looking forward to it then it gets to be important because youve got to do some planning for it uh you know especially if the company is not doing it for you   yeah thats true thats true   and uh there are you know there are companies that do and there companies that dont you know that dont have good retirement plans   uhhuh   uh i guess uh the companies that participate in the K type plans where you know you have the the uh option of contributing to uh to a retirement plan   uhhuh   and uh maybe even the company does some kind of a matching program for that thats those are good programs uh   yeah   i i im a CPA so i look at you know i get to see a lot of these uh a lot of different programs and things and along that line   uhhuh   and uh i like to see where the company makes those makes benefits available at least to the employees   uhhuh   so that they can pick and chose what they like uh you know there theyve got one that they call a cafeteria plan i dont know whether youre familiar with that or not   no what is that   and uh essentially the cafeteria plans are programs where the company makes available a a different uh uh different packages of benefits you you know you can pick the kind of insurance you want and the kind of dental coverage and the kind of vacation policy you want an and all of these different things and you pick the ones that you want as long as the total cost to the company essentially the total cost to the company fits you know within their guidelines so every employee gets the same dollar amount of benefits but they can pick them from different whatever is most important to them   um no i hadnt heard of that   so you can uh so you can get you know you can get the insurance plan thats important to you and somebody else can get the vacation plan thats important to them and the company winds up paying the same you know the same amount for each one   um is that something that you should change from year to year   uh i believe that you can that you can change well maybe not from year to year but at least you can change periodically uh as to you know as to to get the stuff thats more important to you yeah thats uh something that the uh that the federal government you know put into uh you know into the IRS regulations as uh as   that sounds like it might be a really good idea   uh deductions uh allowable deductions for companies they put those in oh four of five years ago uh you know the the different insurance companies and things started promoting those plans   uhhuh uhhuh   and uh i i think there you know its a pretty good option to have of course the K K is is a good you know its a good savings vehicle   yeah   so uh anyway uh what kind of plans are you are you in now are what have you been in before   well i think of uh you mean as far as retirement   well as so far as benefit packages indicate in total   i think the the most important thing for me right now is is really the medical coverage   uhhuh   uh   yeah   i am in uh in uh involved in a four K but im uh contributing such a such a small amount right now   yeah   just to go ahead and have the account open because uh   yeah   uh i just lets see ive been with this company for about three months and before that uh we were were were still in the process of trying to catch up   yeah i understand that yeah   we were we were way behind financially and so havent really uh quite managed to catch up yet   yeah so   exactly and were also trying to buy a house which complicates matters even further   right yeah its and its uh it its uh uh a hassle trying to to uh uh put your money all in the right in the savings you know in the right pockets i guess it would be a way to say it   yeah   you know to get everything do you have children and so so they i guess the uh   no no that would complicate things even more   yeah the yeah the medical insurance would really be a lot more important if you had uh if you had children i guess if youre of child bearing age then its important too you know because   yeah yeah thats probably   you know because you got to have uh at least have the coverage in case that your in case you have another child or have a child   uhhuh yeah thats true   and uh   you want to have that coverage so anyway uh but what else   well theres lets see what other   yeah uh i guess uh what what kind of typical vacation programs uh vacation plans do do the companies have that youve worked for uh so far as when you get vacation and how much   it seems like everybody has it used to be that they used to give like two weeks a year and now they give one week after the first six months   uhhuh yeah its i have not uh i have not seen vacation policies you know written in about seven years so im not real sure how theyre how theyre changing what theyre doing now   most most of the time now they do the first week after the first six months so that if somebody really needs that time   yeah yeah   they can go ahead and use it then or they can just wait the full year and then have two   yeah but uh yeah thats a good deal   so it work it would work either way   yeah how what do you what do you find that that theyre uh when they change from two weeks to three weeks is it five years or ten years or   probably five years i think   yeah uh   or seven uh thats kind of far away   yeah       so thats uh thats a thats a bit of a a wait to get i know that uh in the past ive worked for companies you know where they they had a pretty good uh pretty good plan uh vacation policy you know you got you got the two weeks  the first year and then they went up   okay um ive got another call coming in   oh is that yours okay well and its been nice talking to you   okay all right bye bye   okay thanks
