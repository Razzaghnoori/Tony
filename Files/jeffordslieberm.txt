 Economic Analysis of a Multi Emissions Strategy Prepared for Senators James M Jeffords and Joseph I Lieberman U S Environmental Protection Agency Office of Air and Radiation Office of Atmospheric Programs October 31 2001 Executive Summary In response to a May 17 2001 request from Senators James M Jeffords VT and Joseph I Lieberman CT this report describes the results of a modeling study done to evaluate the potential impacts of reducing nitrogen oxides NOx sulfur dioxide SO2 mercury Hg and carbon dioxide CO2 emissions from the US electric power sector In their request Senators Jeffords and Lieberman asked the Environmental Protection Agency to undertake an economic assessment of four technology based scenarios designed to achieve the following emissions caps in the US electric power sector by the year 2007 Reduce nitrogen oxides NOx emissions to 75 percent below 1997 levels Reduce sulfur dioxide SO2 emissions to 75 percent below full implementation of the Phase II requirements under title IV Reduce mercury Hg emissions to 90 percent below 1999 levels and Reduce carbon dioxide CO2 emissions to 1990 levels The request also specified that EPA should evaluate the cost of achieving these reductions using four alternative technology scenarios The Energy Information Agency s Standard Technology Scenario The Energy Information Agency s High Technology Scenario including technology assumptions with earlier introduction lower costs higher maximum market potential or higher efficiencies than the Standard Scenario Two scenarios from Scenarios for a Clean Energy Future published by Oak Ridge National Laboratory National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory which include assumptions about changes in consumer behavior additional research and development and voluntary and information programs Under each scenario the costs of meeting the emission constraints are included in the price of electricity Such costs include the purchase and installation of emissions control equipment and the purchase of emissions permits Factors that mitigate projected cost increases include the availability of more cost effective energy efficient technologies for both consumers and electricity suppliers EPA s analysis indicates that under the conditions described above Electricity prices in 2015 would increase by about 32 to 50 depending on the technology scenario Coal fired electric generation would decline by 25 to 35 by the year 2015 Overall costs measured by the decline in household consumption of goods and services would be between 13 and 30 billion annually or 0 1 to 0 3 of total consumption Under all four of the policy scenarios evaluated in this assessment gross domestic product GDP would remain relatively unchanged as sacrificed consumption permits higher investment and government spending to reduce emissions Oil and gas fired generation would be expected increase by about 8 under more restrictive technology assumptions but decrease by as much as 20 under scenarios that embody more optimistic assumptions about energy efficiency demand and supply technologies The combination of increased prices and the availability of more energy efficient equipment and appliances are projected to reduce electricity demand by about 10 With the combination of higher prices and improved efficiency total expenditures for electricity consumption in 2015 are projected to increase by about 17 to 39 depending on the scenario The increase in electricity prices and cost of the program as well as the impact on the fuel mix varies considerably based the technology future that is assumed For example the 30 electricity price increase the 13 billion reduction in personal consumption and the 25 decline in coal use are all associated with the Clean Energy Future Advanced Scenario which includes the most optimistic technology assumptions Likewise the 50 electricity price increase the 30 billion reduction in personal consumption and the 35 decline in coal usage are all associated with EIA s Standard Technology Scenario EPA was not asked to evaluate the merits of the alternative technology scenarios We note however that they are the subject of considerable controversy The Clean Energy Future scenarios have been criticized on several grounds assumed changes in consumer behavior that are not consistent with historic behavior patterns results from research and development funding increases that have not occurred and voluntary and information programs for which there is no analytic basis for evaluating the impacts On the other hand supporters of those scenarios point to economic analyses showing that the assumed investments can pay for themselves over time The range of estimates associated with the different technology scenarios highlights the importance of the technology assumptions In conducting the modeling requested by Senators Jeffords and Lieberman EPA has assumed that the reductions would be achieved through a nationwide cap and trade system similar to the Acid Rain program established under the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act together with increasing penetration and performance of energy technologies In accordance with the Senators request the analysis also assumes the use of banked allowances made possible by early emissions reductions achieved in the years 2002 through 2006 In practice significant reductions beginning in 2002 would be difficult to achieve Because of the contribution of those banked allowances to overall emissions reductions the analysis shows emissions in 2007 above the caps Regardless 2007 emissions are substantially reduced from current levels At the end of 2015 a small pool of banked allowances continues to be available for use in later years The analysis contained in the report covers the years 2002 through 2015 The results provided in this analysis should not be construed as forecasts of actual scenario outcomes Rather they are assessments of how the future might unfold compared to a previously defined reference case given the mix of technology and policy assumptions embodied in each of the scenarios The results also imply a national commitment that is successful in achieving the level of emission reductions described within the report The economic impacts of the emissions reduction scenarios are evaluated using Argonne National Laboratory s AMIGA model a 200 sector computer general equilibrium model of the U S economy The modular design and economy wide coverage of the AMIGA model makes it a logical choice to analyze alternative technology scenarios Although it does employ the same plant level coverage of the electricity sector as the IPM and NEMS models used in other analyses the pollution control technology assumptions are not included at the same level of detail as the IPM model This may be particularly relevant for mercury controls where the effectiveness varies by coal type and may be difficult to model correctly without additional detail In addition we note that the AMIGA model is relatively new and has not been subject to the same degree of peer review and scrutiny as the older IPM and NEMS models It would be desirable in future work to establish the comparability of results across these models 1 Introduction 1 1 Background Responding to an earlier Congressional request the Energy Information Administration EIA released a detailed study reviewing the effects of a so called three pollutant strategy in December 2000 Energy Information Administration 2000 The three emissions in the EIA assessment included nitrogen oxides NOx sulfur dioxide SO2 and carbon dioxide CO2 Although a coordinated climate and air quality policy appeared to lower costs compared to a series of separate policy initiatives the EIA assessment indicated significant costs associated with capping emissions At about the same time five of the nation s national energy laboratories released an extensive review of some 50 different policy options that might achieve cost effective reductions of both air pollutants and carbon dioxide CO2 emissions The study Scenarios for a Clean Energy Future Interlaboratory Working Group 2000 indicated that domestic investments in energyefficient and clean energy supply technologies could achieve substantial reductions in both sets of emissions at a small but net positive benefit for the economy On May 17 2001 Senators James M Jeffords VT and Joseph I Lieberman CT sent a letter to EIA and EPA seeking further clarity in the scenarios examined by the December EIA analysis stating that the analysis appears to unnecessarily limit the market and technology opportunities that might significantly affect the costs and benefits of emission reductions In particular the potential contributions of demand side efficiency gas fired cogeneration and of renewable energy sources appear to be inadequately represented In responding to this request EPA modeled the combined impacts of both the emissions caps and the advanced technology scenarios specified by the Senators We are aware that EIA has modeled the combined impacts but has also modeled the effects of the emission caps and the advanced technology scenarios separately This approach provides perhaps a better technique for isolating the actual costs of the emissions caps We have reviewed the EIA analysis of these separate effects and we believe that they offer interesting and important insights and that if we had performed the same kind of analysis we would have seen similar results This report responds to the Senators request The results provided in this analysis should not be construed as forecasts of actual scenario outcomes Rather they are assessments of how the future might unfold compared to a previously defined reference case given a national commitment to achieve the emission reductions and given the mix of technology and policy assumptions embodied in each of the scenarios 1 2 Technology Scenarios In the letter to Administrator Whitman Senators Jeffords and Lieberman asked for an analysis of four different scenarios requesting that EPA analyze the cost and benefits including all sectors of the economy and impacts on both the supply and demand side of the equation of the following multi pollutant emission control scenarios for the nation s electricity generators Where feasible this should include power plants both within the conventionally defined electric utility sector as well as electricity generated by industrial cogenerators and other independent power producers The four scenarios are identified as follows Scenario A Standard Technology Scenario Assume standard technology characteristics as defined in AEO2001 Further assume a start date of 2002 By 2007 reduce NOx emissions 75 percent below 1997 levels reduce SO2 emissions to 75 percent below full implementation of the Phase II requirements under title IV reduce mercury emissions 90 percent below 1999 levels and reduce CO2 emissions to 1990 levels Scenario B High Technology Scenario Continue the 2002 start date but assume the advanced technology assumptions of both the supply and demand side perspectives that are referenced in AEO2001 By 2007 reduce NOx emissions 75 percent below 1997 levels reduce SO2 emissions to 75 percent below full implementation of the Phase II requirements under title IV reduce mercury emissions 90 percent below 1999 levels and reduce CO2 emissions to 1990 levels Scenario C Moderate Clean Energy Future Scenario Continue the 2002 start date but assume the moderate supply and demand side policy scenario of the Clean Energy Future CEF study By 2007 reduce NOx emissions 75 percent below 1997 levels reduce SO2 emissions to 75 percent below full implementation of the Phase II requirements under title IV reduce mercury emissions 90 percent below 1999 levels and reduce CO2 emissions to 1990 levels Scenario D Advanced Clean Energy Future Scenario Continue the 2002 start date but assume the advanced supply and demand side policy scenario of the Clean Energy Future study By 2007 reduce NOx emissions 75 percent below 1997 levels reduce SO2 emissions to 75 percent below full implementation of the Phase II requirements under title IV reduce mercury emissions 90 percent below 1999 levels and reduce CO2 emissions to 1990 levels In requesting an analysis of these four scenarios the Senate request asked for results through 2020 in periods of five years or less using the Annual Energy Outlook 2001 AEO2001 as the baseline 1 3 Multi Emission Targets Table 1 identifies the 2007 emission caps used for each of the four scenarios The emission cap is defined by a benchmark emission level that is modified by the desired level percentage of reduction For example the benchmark for the SO2 emissions cap is the Phase II requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments That total 8 95 million short tons is reduced by a specific percentage 75 percent to reach the emissions cap of 2 24 million tons Following a similar pattern the remaining emission caps are set as 1 51 million tons for NOx emissions 4 8 tons for mercury emissions and 475 million metric tons MtC of carbon emissions Table 1 Benchmark Emission Levels and Assumed Emission Caps 1 4 Other Analytical Assumptions As previously noted the letter from Senators Lieberman and Jeffords requested that EPA use four different sets of technology and policy assumptions to meet the specified emission caps shown in Table 1 The full set of technology and policy assumptions are described more fully in section two of this report All scenarios are implemented in 2002 At the same time there are other key assumptions that EPA adopted to facilitate the evaluation of the four scenarios In addition to the different technology scenarios EPA was asked to include the assumption that utilities would begin to make cost effective emission reductions in the five years that precede the 2007 compliance date These early reductions would be banked for use in the post 2007 period of analysis For purposes of this simulation the amount of allowances banked from 2002 through 2006 was calculated as the simple difference between the reference case projections and the actual emission trajectory of each scenario The decision to earn and hold early allowances is based on the assumption that allowances are viewed as an asset that must earn at least an 8 real return 1 Following the assumption used in the CEF study all four of the policy scenarios assume nationwide restructuring of the electric utility industry This implies that prices are based on the marginal rather than the regulated cost of service pricing now used throughout much of the country EPA employed the Argonne National Laboratory s AMIGA modeling system to evaluate the impact of capping emissions under the four different technology scenarios AMIGA is a 200 plus sector model of the U S economy that captures a wide variety of technology characteristics and their resulting impact on key indicators such as emissions employment and income 2 EPA 1 In practice it is more likely that significant reductions that contribute to any kind of allowance bank would be difficult to achieve before 2004 Assuming a delay in implementation to 2004 would raise the economic impact of any of the scenarios 2 AMIGA is especially suited to the t ask identifying and evaluating a different mix of technologies in the production of goods and services within the United States It is not only a 200 plus sector model of the U S economy but it also includes the Argonne Unit Planning and Compliance model and database that captures a wide variety of technology characteristics within the electric generating sector including industrial combined heat and power systems and the typically available emission control technologies When the electricity module is integrated with asked Argonne to benchmark AMIGA to the reference case projections of AEO2001 AMIGA was then modified to approximate the assumptions behind each of the four scenarios An economic analysis of a policy compares the world with the policy the policy scenario to the world absent the policy the reference case or baseline scenario The impacts of policies or regulations are measured by the resulting differences between these two scenarios In effect any meaningful analysis should compare the full set of benefits and costs to the extent possible For purposes of this exercise there are at least seven categories of costs and four benefits that might be reviewed The costs include 1 direct investment costs 2 operating and maintenance costs 3 research and development and other government program costs 4 transaction search and compliance costs 5 adjustment costs associated with large changes in specific capital stocks 6 lost economic flexibility created by additional emission requirements and 7 potential interactions with the existing tax system At the same time there are at least four categories of benefits These include 1 direct savings from lower compliance costs 2 process efficiency and other productivity gains 3 environmental and health benefits not captured within normal market transactions and 4 spillovers and or learning induced by either the technology investment or the R D efforts The costs associated with the emission limits in each scenario are computed as the increased expenditures on pollution control investment in more efficient equipment and appliances research and development tax incentives and additional government programs all relative to the reference case The increased costs are coupled with credits for reductions in fuel use and productivity gains from technology The economic impact of each scenario is reported in two ways The first is as a change in household personal consumption measuring the goods and services available for consumers to enjoy after subtracting these net expenditures The second is as a change in economic output measured as Gross Domestic Product GDP The AMIGA model reasonably captures those costs and benefits noted above that arise in market transactions Some such as loss of flexibility and adjustment costs on the cost side and health benefits and spillovers on the benefit side remain beyond the scope of this analysis 2 Multi Emissions Analysis This section provides additional details about the technology assumptions that underpin the four emission scenarios It also describes the results of the scenario analysis both in terms of the various marginal costs associated with emission control strategies and the economy wide impact of each scenario Although EPA made every effort to calibrate AMIGA to the AEO2001 reference case AMIGA is a different modeling system than EIA s National Energy Modeling System NEMS Hence it was not possible to reproduce the exact AEO2001 reference case the larger macroeconomic system the model can then generate key outputs including projected electricity sales and net generation resulting emissions for each of the four pollutants under consideration and the set of energy and permit prices associated with the resulting production levels Finally AMIGA can provide an estimate of the consequent impact on the economy including key indicators as consumption investment government spending GDP and employment Hanson 1999 For more background on the AMIGA model see Appendix 5 1 projections Moreover Argonne researchers recently upgraded AMIGA to incorporate SO2 NOx and mercury emissions For this and other reasons AMIGA currently reports results only through the year 2015 Nonetheless the differences in the resulting baseline projections are minor for the purposes of this analysis 2 1 Modeling Technology Assumptions Scenarios A and B are based on the AEO2001 standard and advanced technology characteristics respectively The standard technology assumptions of scenario A were used by EIA in the development of the AEO2001 reference case projections The advanced technology assumptions of scenario B were used as a sensitivity analysis in the AEO2001 They demonstrated the effects of earlier availability lower costs and or higher efficiencies for more advanced equipment than the reference case 3 Scenarios C and D are based on the recently published DOE sponsored report Scenarios for a Clean Energy Future Interlaboratory Working Group 2000 see also Brown et al 2001 Both of the CEF scenarios assumed nationwide restructuring of the electric utility industry From an analytical perspective this means that prices are based on the marginal costs of generation transmission and distribution of electricity rather than the regulated cost of service pricing now used throughout much of the country Moreover both scenarios reflected increased spending for research and development and other programs designed to accelerate the development and deployment of low carbon energy efficient technologies Each of the scenario assumptions are described more fully in the sections that follow 2 1 1 Reference Case Scenario The scenario A reference case assumes a business as usual characterization of technology development and deployment As projected in the AEO2001 assessment the nation s economy is projected to grow at 2 9 per year in the period 2000 through 2020 Given anticipated energy prices and the availability of standard technologies the nation s primary energy use is expected to grow 1 3 annually while electricity consumption is projected to increase by 1 8 annually Further details are provided in Appendix 5 2 1 2 1 2 Advanced Technology Scenario Under the AEO 2001 advanced technology characterization scenario B assumes that a large number of technologies have earlier availability lower costs and or higher efficiencies For example the high efficiency air conditioners in the commercial sector are assumed to cost less than in scenario A This encourages a greater rate of market penetration as electricity prices rise in response to the emissions caps Building shell efficiencies in scenario B are assumed to improve by about 50 percent faster than in scenario A The AEO2001 was published in December 2000 Energy Information Administration 2000 On the utility s side of the meter the heat rates for new combined cycle power plants are assumed to be less compared to the standard case assumptions This means that more kilowatthours of electricity are generated for every unit of energy consumed by the power plants Moreover wood supply increases by about 10 and the capacity factor of wind energy systems increases by about 15 20 compared to the reference case assumptions In the AEO2001 report the combination of higher efficiencies and earlier availability of the technologies lowers the growth in electricity use from 1 8 in the reference case to 1 6 2 1 3 CEF Moderate Case Scenario The authors of the Clean Energy Future CEF report describe their analysis as an attempt to assess how energy efficient and clean energy technologies can address key energy and environmental challenges facing the US Brown et al 2001 In that regard they evaluated a set of about 50 policies to improve the technology performance and characterization of the residential commercial industrial transportation and electricity generation sectors The policies include increased research and development funding equipment standards financial incentives voluntary programs and other regulatory initiatives These policies were assumed to change business and consumer behavior result in new technological improvements and expand the success of voluntary and information programs The selection of policies in the CEF study began with a sector by sector assessment of market failures and institutional barriers to the market penetration of clean energy technologies in the US For buildings the policies and programs include additional appliance efficiency standards expansion of technical assistance and technology deployment programs and an increased number of building codes and efficiency standards for equipment and appliances They also include tax incentives to accelerate the market penetration of new technologies and the strengthening of market transformation programs such as Rebuild America and Energy Star labeling They further include so called public benefits programs enhanced by electricity line charges For industry the policies include voluntary agreements with industry groups to achieve defined energy efficiency and emissions goals combined with a variety of government programs that strongly support such agreements These programs include expansion and strengthening of existing information programs financial incentives and energy efficiency standards on motors systems Policies in the CEF analysis were assumed to encourage the diffusion and improve the implementation of combined heat and power CHP in the industrial sector For electricity the policies include extending the production tax credit of 1 5 cents kWh over more years and extending it to additional renewable technologies Broadly speaking the CEF Moderate scenario can be thought of as a 50 increase in funding for programs that promote a variety of both demand side and supply side technologies For example the moderate scenario assumes a 50 or 1 4 billion increase in cost shared research development and demonstration of efficient and clean energy technologies in 1999 dollars with half as federal appropriations and half as private sector cost share It further assumes a careful targeting of funds to critical research areas and a gradual 5 year ramp up of funds to allow for careful planning assembly of research teams and expansion of existing teams and facilities In addition the CEF moderate scenario anticipates increased program spending of 3 0 and 6 6 billion for the years 2010 and 2020 respectively These expenditures include production incentives and investment tax credits for renewable energy energy efficiency and transportation technologies They further include increased spending for programs such as DOE s Industrial Assessment Centers and EPA s Energy Star programs The combined effect of the R D and program expenditures together with other policies described in the CEF report implies a steady reduction in total energy requirements over the period 2000 through 2020 By the year 2020 for example primary energy consumption and electricity sales were projected to decrease by 8 and 10 respectively compared to the CEF reference case 2 1 4 CEF Advanced Technology Scenario Building on the policies of the moderate scenario the CEF advanced scenario assumes a doubling of cost shared R D investments resulting in an increased spending of 2 9 billion per year again in 1999 dollars with half as federal appropriations and half as private sector cost share In addition the advanced scenario anticipates increased program spending of 9 0 and 13 2 billion for the years 2010 and 2020 respectively The added spending covers all sectors including buildings industry transportation and electric generation The combined effect of the program and R D expenditures together with other policies described in the CEF report including a 50 carbon charge applied in the CEF Advanced Scenario drove a steady reduction in the need for energy compared to the CEF reference case By 2020 total energy use fell by 19 compared to the reference case At the same time electricity sales in 2020 were projected to decrease by 24 compared to the CEF reference case 2 1 5 Implementation of the Technology Assumptions The assumptions embedded in each of these scenarios have the effect of progressively increasing market penetration of higher performance energy efficiency and energy supply technologies As shown in Table 2 the net effect of these assumptions is to lower the expected level of electricity consumption while continuing to meet the same level of service demanded by utility customers The technology assumptions also have the effect of increasing the availability of cleaner energy supply technologies that reduce the level of emissions per kilowatt hour of generation The critical assumption used in the EPA analysis is that program spending affects both supply and demand technologies in a way that interacts with the emission caps that are to be imposed in 2007 Benchmarked to the year 2010 Table 2 shows the percentage change of key indicators for each scenario with respect to its respective reference case These changes provide EPA with approximate targets so that each of the scenarios can be mapped into the AMIGA model As such the figures in Table 2 should be seen as inputs into the AMIGA model not outputs of the model Table 2 Influence of Technology Assumptions on Key Scenario Indicators 2010 By definition scenario A assumes the standard technology assumptions of the AEO2001 reference case Hence there are no additional programs or policies that generate changes in the reference case technologies when the emission caps are imposed by the year 2007 The level of technology responsiveness grows for scenarios B C and D as a result of greater program spending The CEF advanced scenario for example assumes a significant increase in program funds to promote a variety of both demand side and supply side technologies As a result of this greater level of program activity there is an accelerated penetration of energy efficient technologies that drives electricity sales down by 6 8 percent in 2010 compared to the CEF reference case for that same year At the same time the combination of a lower demand for electricity and an increased investment in cleaner energy supply technologies reduces both carbon and NOx emissions by 10 7 and 8 1 percent respectively again compared to the CEF 2010 reference case As EPA modeled this scenario the bundle of policies in the CEF advanced scenario became in effect a complement to the emission caps imposed by 2007 To avoid overestimating the impact of the policy scenarios in this analysis EPA made a number of adjustments before implementing the CEF assumptions in the four scenarios reported here First the CEF analysis was benchmarked to a 1999 reference case In the AEO2001 reference case however the demand for electricity in 2020 is about 10 higher compared to the CEF reference case Second the Senate request asked EPA to assume a 2002 start date in running the technology and policy scenarios In effect there are fewer years in which programs can achieve the desired level of technology improvement compared to the CEF scenarios In addition the CEF analysis includes a significant review of transportation technologies and policies EPA chose to exclude all assumptions related to transportation focusing only on the supply and demand side technologies associated with electricity and natural gas consumption With the adjustments described above now reflected in the current analytical framework and using the program cost information documented in the CEF study Table 3 summarizes the incremental program costs that were assumed as necessary to drive the kind of changes in electricity consumption and emissions described in Table 2 Since transportation programs drove a significant part of the CEF expenditures and since there are fewer years to implement policies the estimated program expenditures are also smaller compared to the CEF assumptions Table 3 Incremental Policy Costs of the Technology Scenarios billion 1999 dollars Because scenario A characterizes existing program and technology performance no additional funds are required to drive that scenario Scenario B on the other hand anticipates some changes in the technology characterization that will affect the electricity sector as shown in Table 2 While the AEO2001 analysis anticipated no program spending to drive these changes EPA assumed that additional spending would be required for scenario B Calibrating to the CEF policy scenarios EPA estimated that program and policy spending would increase by 0 8 billion in 2002 rising steadily to 2 9 billion by 2015 For scenario C program spending increased by 1 2 billion starting in 2002 rising to 4 8 billion by 2015 Finally program spending in scenario D started at 2 1 billion in 2002 and increased to 5 5 billion by the last year of this analysis 4 The net effect of mapping increased program spending together with adjustments needed to update the assumptions of the CEF policy scenarios can be highlighted by reviewing the change in electricity generation for scenario D In the CEF Advanced Scenario based on a 1999 reference case for example the level of electricity generation in 2010 was lowered by 10 from the reference case requirements of 3 920 billion kilowatt hours kWh As the CEF technology assumptions were applied in scenario D within this analysis updated to the AEO2001 reference case electricity generation was reduced by 9 from 4 253 billion kWh The trend was more pronounced in 2015 Rather than a roughly 16 reduction from a generation level of 4 200 billion kWh in the 1999 CEF Advanced Case the scenario D equivalent in this analysis achieved only a 12 reduction from a generation of 4 580 billion kWh 2 1 6 Reasonableness of the Scenario Assumptions The results of the technology driven scenarios should not be interpreted as an EPA endorsement of any of the policies or technology assumptions behind each of scenarios described in this report On the one hand EPA has not conducted any significant review of the EIA assumptions that underpin the AEO2001 projections On the other hand some analysts do not necessarily agree with the assumptions and projected level of impacts in the CEF assessment despite the fact that it was peer reviewed and its findings published this fall in an academic journal The EIA 2001 for example notes that the CEF policies assume changes in consumer behavior that are not consistent with historically observed behavior patterns Moreover the EIA suggests that there is little documentation to support the assumed technological improvements generated by the research and development R D initiatives described in the report Finally EIA notes that The program spending assumptions developed in this analysis are used only to approximate the impact of the CEF scenario s They do not reflect EPA endorsement of these spending levels the effectiveness of voluntary or information programs may be less than assumed in the CEF scenarios At the same time the lead CEF analysts have responded to the EIA assertions by citing relevant economic literature and noting that the CEF study is one of the most carefully documented and complete analysis of U S energy futures that has ever been funded by the U S government Koomey et al 2001 Notwithstanding these concerns EPA attempted to respond to the Senators request by mapping in the critical assumptions of the CEF as a range of policies that provide a set of alternative assumptions about the future In this regard the scenarios are more like descriptions of alternative future outcomes rather than predictions or recommendations about how the future should unfold To provide a more complete context for understanding the magnitude of the changes in electricity generation that are suggested by the different scenarios the figure below illustrates both the historical and projected trends in the nation s electricity generation The information is shown as the number of kWh per dollar of GDP measured in constant 1999 dollars The historical data covers the period 1970 through 2000 while the projected trends are through the year 2015 The historical period shows a moderate level of volatility The reference case projections suggest an annual rate of declining intensity of 1 6 per year through 2015 with a final value 0 33 kWh Historical and Projected US Electricity Trends kWh per 1999 GDP 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 In comparison to the reference case Scenario D adapting the CEF Advanced Case assumptions reflects a national commitment to improve both electricity supply and the efficiency of demandside technologies The presumption is that such a commitment would be supported by a significant increase in R D and program spending as described above Under these assumptions the nation s electricity intensity is projected to decline at an annual rate of 2 5 dropping to a final intensity of 0 28 kWh This level of decline is greater than previously seen in the recent past In the period 1980 through 1986 for example and again 1993 through 2000 the annual rate of decline was only 1 7 percent Hence it appears that the assumptions driving the advanced scenario are aggressive At the same time however the research undertaken by the CEF analysts indicates that the technology is available to achieve such a reduction should a national commitment be successful in driving similar policies 2 2 Results of the Scenario Analysis With the model benchmarked to AEO2001 and given the different mix of scenario assumptions previously described AMIGA reports the results in the figures and tables that follow More complete data including reference case assumptions are available in Appendix 5 2 2 2 1 Emission Projections All program and policy assumptions have a start date of 2002 Moreover the analysis anticipates the use of banked allowances made possible by early emissions reductions achieved in the years 2002 through 2006 as requested in the Senate letter Figures 1 through 4 on the following page illustrate both the emissions projections and the impact of banking the early reductions on all four emissions caps implemented in 2007 Although all four categories of emissions are down substantially they only achieve 50 75 of the proposed cap by 2007 shown as the dotted horizontal line in each of the above figures This is because of the availability of the banked allowances that can be used by sources to meet emissions caps in 2007 and beyond Note that costs would be noticeably higher if power plants were required to actually hit the target in 2007 In 2015 carbon and mercury emissions continue to be 15 or more above the target The reductions that generate the banked allowances are shown as the area to the left of each vertical dotted line as the differences between the reference case and scenario emission trajectories The emissions above the cap are shown to the right of each vertical dotted line and between the scenario emissions and the dotted horizontal line Subtracting these two areas on each graph reveals the level of the bank in 2015 Using Scenario D as an example the remaining allowances in 2015 are 100 million metric tons for carbon 1 3 million tons for SO2 0 2 million tons for NOx and 25 tons for mercury In the case of carbon the bank would last another two years at the rate of drawdown in 2015 or longer if the drawdown declined Figure 1 Carbon Emissions million metric tons Figure 2 SO2 Emissions million tons Figure 3 NOx Emissions million tons Figure 4 Mercury Emissions tons 2 2 2 Changes in Electric Generation Expenditures Given the assumptions and economic drivers in each of the scenarios the AMIGA model calculates the capital investment operation and maintenance and fuel costs necessary to meet consumer demand for electricity The incremental expenditures required to generate electricity under each of the four scenarios as compared to the reference case are summarized in Figure 5 in billions of 1999 dollars In effect the incremental expenditures reflect the range of decisions made by the electricity sector to comply with each of the four scenario constraints but do not reflect efforts made outside the electricity sector Because these expenditures ignore spending on energy efficiency research and development outside the electricity sector spending that can be substantial they are not measures of program costs Note that incremental expenditures are incurred as early as 2002 in all four scenarios to generate early reductions that can be banked for use in 2007 and beyond The generation expenditures vary in each of the scenarios change for at least three reasons 1 the size of the allowance bank made possible by early reductions driven in part by program spending prior to the introduction of the caps 2 the varying levels of demand for electricity over time resulting in changes in the overall mix of generation resources and 3 the gradual reduction in the banked allowances available for withdrawal necessitating additional actions to reduce emissions As expected scenario A has the largest increase with expenditures rising by nearly 17 billion in 2015 compared to the reference case The higher level of expenditures is driven by a 21 increase in unit generation costs caused primarily by the emissions caps and offset only slightly by a small decrease in electricity demand With less energy efficiency technology penetrating the market a greater level of control equipment must be installed and operated which in turn drives up the cost of generation Scenario B follows a similar pattern with expenditure increases being offset by further reductions in electricity demand as more efficient technology penetrates the market The expenditures for scenario C decline even further as reduced demand continues to lower both the level generation and the unit cost of that generation compared to scenario A Scenario D on the other hand actually shows a decline in total expenditures by 2015 The combination of a 12 5 reduction on generation load together with only an 11 9 increase in the unit cost of generation both with respect to the reference case results in a 3 11 billion reduction in total electric generation expenditures Figure 5 Incremental Expenditures on Electric Generation Billions of 1999 2 2 3 Marginal Costs The marginal costs of emission reductions over the period 2005 through 2015 are shown in Figures 6 through 9 for all four scenarios Figure 6 Projected Marginal Cost of Carbon Reductions Metric Ton Figure 7 Projected Marginal Cost of SO2 Reductions Ton Figure 8 Projected Marginal Cost of NOx Reductions Ton Figure 9 Projected Marginal Cost of Hg Reductions Million Ton The marginal cost of carbon reductions range from 46 to 138 metric ton through 2015 with each scenario showing successively smaller costs as technology characteristics improve and more energy efficient and or low carbon technologies penetrate the market The marginal cost of SO2 and NOx reductions through 2015 are less than 450 and 2 300 ton respectively in all four multi emissions reduction scenarios The marginal cost of mercury reductions by 2015 ranges from 350 million ton to 432 million ton again depending on the scenario It is important to note that marginal cost reflects the additional cost of one more ton of reductions and not the total cost associated with each pollutant One can make a very rough estimation of this overall cost for each pollutant on top of the costs associated with the other three by multiplying half the marginal cost to approximate average cost by the volume of reductions By 2015 as an example scenario A returns cost estimates of 15 2 billion for carbon 1 1 billion for SO2 2 7 billion for NOx and 6 4 billion for mercury In Scenario D the cost estimates are 8 6 billion for carbon 1 6 billion for SO2 3 3 billion for NOx and 7 8 billion for mercury Note that these figures cannot be added together for an overall estimate because they a double count the benefits of controlling multiple pollutants simultaneously and b ignore the consequences of the underlying technology policy We discuss overall costs below Surprisingly the marginal cost of SO2 NOx and Hg reductions increases as the marginal cost of carbon decreases The reason appears to be that as efficiency technology penetrates the market and reduces carbon prices more of a price signal is required to generate further reductions in the three conventional pollutants In the advanced scenarios for example both demand reductions and the increased use of gas tends to reduce carbon emissions But gas prices begin to rise which allows coal to make a modest comeback with respect to scenario A This is especially true as cleaner and more efficient coal technologies begin to penetrate the market as assumed in scenarios B through D In order to offset the tendency for coal generated emissions to increase permit prices need to adjust upward 2 2 4 Fuel Use Impacts Figure 10 shows both total electricity consumption and the fossil fuel consumption used in the generation of electricity for the year 2010 The results are in quadrillion Btu in both the reference case and each of the four policy scenarios As each successive scenario generates a greater reduction in electricity demand coal use is reduced significantly by about 30 percent Gas consumption increases slightly in scenarios A and B and decreases by a small amount in scenarios C and D as lower electricity consumption reduces the need for new capacity Figure 10 Total Electricity Consumption and Fossil Fuel Generation in 2010 Quadrillion Btu 2 2 5 Energy Price Impacts The model suggests that under the conditions described above electricity prices are expected to increase by about 30 under scenario D to 50 under scenario A by the year 2015 This is the logical result of increased control costs and permit prices The combination of increased prices and the availability of more energy efficient equipment and appliances reduce electricity demand by about 10 Total electricity expenditures increase by about 15 to 30 depending on the year and the scenario see Table 3 below and the tables in Appendix 5 2 for more detail on the changing pattern of expenditures 2 2 6 Economy wide Impacts Table 3 provides a summary of key macroeconomic data for the year 2010 to compare the impact of emissions reductions on both personal consumption and other components of gross domestic product GDP The effects on personal consumption show a decline of between 13 billion and 31 or 0 1 to 0 3 depending on the scenario This reflects the cost of the program in terms of the decreased well being of households who must forego a fraction of their consumption of goods and services in order to pay for both research and development programs energy efficiency improvements and more expensive electricity production Table 3 shows little change in GDP under any of the policy scenarios reflecting the fact that this foregone consumption turns up as expenditures in other categories of GDP namely investment and government spending 5 Table 3 Summary of Economic Impacts by Scenario 2010 The AMIGA modeling system reports the costs and benefits of each scenario with several major exceptions The first omitted benefit is spillover and productivity gains beyond energy bill savings A number of studies suggest that energy efficiency technology investments also tend to increase overall productivity of the economy especially in the industrial sector Sullivan et al 1997 Finman and Laitner 2001 and Laitner et al 2001 To date however no systematic effort has been undertaken to incorporate such benefits into the current generation of policy models Hence this potential benefit is not reported at this time The second missing benefit includes gains in environmental quality especially improved health benefits On the cost side the model ignores costs associated with rapid changes in capital stocks as well as potential loss of flexibility and interactions with the existing tax system For example the model forecasts significant changes in the level and composition of electricity generation in 2002 ignoring the difficulty of rapidly changing the capital stock by then end of 2001 Losses in flexibility occur when pollution control activities potentially interfere with efficiency and other operational programs at a regulated facility Finally there are interactions with the tax system when in response to a rise in the relative cost of purchased goods people decide to enjoy more A more complete assessment of each policy scenario can be made by reviewing the more detailed data contained in the Appendix leisure which is now relatively less expensive work less and lower taxable income Parry and Oates 2000 2 3 The Results in Context Recent studies suggest significant economic consequences as a result of substantial emission reduction strategies EPRI 2000 and EIA 2000 On the other hand the presumption of a trade off between environmental and economic benefits may not provide an entirely appropriate framework for analysis of such policies DeCanio 1997 Indeed there are a number of studies that show net economic benefits may be possible when a full accounting of both benefits and costs are included within an appropriate analysis Krause et al 2001 and Bailie et al 2001 At the same time understanding the proper characterization and role of technology improvements Edmonds et al 2000 and then capturing that characterization within an appropriate model structure Peters et al 2001 is a critical aspect of all such economic assessments Finally it is important to recognize that the mere existence of technologies and the potential for positive net benefits does not assure that these technologies will be commercialized and adopted nor that the net benefits will be realized Jaffe et al 2001 An unanswered question is whether and how policies might encourage these activities This current study while drawing on credible data sources and applying a state of the art modeling system cannot adequately capture all such nuances associated with emission reduction scenarios The results of this analysis should be viewed within this larger context 3 Conclusions The analysis suggests that under the conditions described above emissions through 2015 will be significantly reduced although they won t meet the 2007 target This is largely because of assumptions about the banking of allowances earned prior to 2007 At the same time coal fired electric generation is expected to decline by 25 to 35 by the year 2015 On the other hand oil and gas fired generation is projected to increase by about 8 under more restrictive technology assumptions but decrease by as much as 20 under scenarios that embody more optimistic assumptions about energy efficiency demand and supply technologies Electricity prices are expected to increase by 32 to 50 in 2015 depending on the scenario The combination of increased prices and the availability of more energy efficient equipment and appliances are projected to reduce electricity demand by about 10 compared to the reference case With the combination of higher prices and improved efficiency total expenditures for electricity consumption in 2015 are projected to increase by about 17 to 39 depending on the scenario Interacting with other changes in consumer and business spending that is driven by each of the scenario assumptions the personal consumption reduced by about 0 1 to 0 3 This again depends on the year and the scenario The results provided in this analysis should not be construed as forecasts of actual scenario outcomes Rather they are assessments of how the future might unfold compared to a previously defined reference case given the mix of technology and policy assumptions embodied in each of the scenarios The results from these scenarios imply a strong national commitment one that is successful in developing the programs and policies necessary to achieve the level of emission reductions described within the report 4 References Alison Bailie Stephen Bernow William Dougherty Michael Lazarus and Sivan Kartha 2001 The American Way to the Kyoto Protocol An Economic

Appendices 5 1 Description of the AMIGA Model The All Modular Industry Growth Assessment AMIGA model is a general equilibrium modeling system of the U S economy that covers the period from 1992 through 2030 6 It integrates features from the following five types of economic models 1 Multisector AMIGA starts by benchmarking to the 1992 Bureau of Economic Analysis BEA interindustry data which a preprocessor aggregates to approximately 300 sectors 2 Explicit technology representation AMIGA reads in files with detailed lists of technologies currently with a focus on energy efficient and low carbon energy supply technologies including electric generating units containing performance characteristics availability status costs anticipated learning effects and emission rates where appropriate 3 Computable General Equilibrium AMIGA computes a full employment solution for demands prices costs and outputs of interrelated products including induced activities such as transportation and wholesale retail trade 4 Macroeconomic AMIGA calculates national income Gross Domestic Product GDP employment a comprehensive list of consumption goods and services the trade balance and net foreign assets and examines inflationary pressures 5 Economic Growth AMIGA projects economic growth paths and long term dynamic effects of alternative investments including accumulation of residential vehicle and producer capital stocks In addition the AMIGA system includes the Argonne Unit Planning and Compliance model that captures a wide variety of technology characteristics within the electric generating sector This includes a system dispatch routine that allows the retirement and the dispatch of units on the basis of traditional cost criteria as well as the impact of various permit prices on operating costs It also includes non utility generation sources such as industrial combined heat and power applications and renewable energy systems Climate change mitigation policy has been the main application of the AMIGA system to date But the AMIGA modeling system recently has been enhanced to include policies involving the reduction of sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxide and mercury emissions Moreover a new intertemporal optimization module has been added to AMIGA that allows an evaluation of early reductions and the banking of allowances to be incorporated into policy scenarios Hence the system is well suited to evaluate a variety of multi emission strategies that are driven by price incentives as well as R D programs voluntary initiatives and cap and trade policies Because of recent upgrades and enhancements made in the model the current reporting period is extended only through the year 2015 We expect the full reporting period to extend back to the year 2030 in the very near future The model includes a complete database of all electric utility generating units within the United States The cost and performance characteristics of the electricity supply technologies generally follow those modeled within the Energy Information Administration s National Energy Modeling System The characteristics associated with the various emission control technologies generally follow those modeled within the Integrated Planning Model used by the Environmental Protection Agency The AMIGA modeling system is a highly organized flexible structure that is programmed in the C language It includes modules for household demand production of goods motor vehicles electricity supply and residential and commercial buildings and appliances The production modules contain representations of labor capital and energy substitutions using a hierarchy of production functions The adoption rates for cost effective technologies depend on energy prices as well as policies and programs that lower the implicit discount rates sometimes referred to as hurdle rates that are used by households and businesses to evaluate energy efficiency and energy supply measures 7 For a more
