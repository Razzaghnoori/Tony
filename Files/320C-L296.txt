 July 2000 Dear Friend If your pet were lost would you spend 18 39 to get him back Did you know 1 out of every 3 pets is lost every year 95 of the animals we take in come from Nashua Of that number 70 are stray lost pets Last year we aided 1 418 stray animals but 1 191 of them were never claimed by their owners Incoming strays increased by 19 over the last three years and is expected to continue to climb Almost 80 390 000 of our operating budget is consumed by programs to serve stray and unwanted animals the National Charities Information Bureau s standard is 60 All these animals need some form of costly care including boarding food medical care testing surgery medicine training or physical therapy We are faced with the real possibility of turning away animals if donations do not increase Our goal for the remainder of this year is to raise 100 000 00 to meet the 2000 operating budget If each person receiving this letter gives just 18 39 we will make the goal Please donate today Your humane society provides not only effective community social services for animals and their people but also serves as the pound for the City of Nashua Pound services ensure that lost pets have a clean and safe place to stay and be cared for until their owners can be located In the case of animals that are not recovered by their owners your Humane Society uses a wide variety of services to aid those animals and give them a chance at a happy life While every animal that makes it to the Humane Society receives the care it needs and deserves the ones that go unrecovered claim the lion s share of resources For 21 years we have been under contract with the City of Nashua to provide these services as mandated by state law Over the years the Humane Society has lobbied the mayor s office for ever increasing levels of funding to help us meet expenses In the past our relationship with the City has been quite good but we have never been able to achieve 100 funding for the services the City expects and that which the community requires Instead the City provided only 14 57 000 of our 1999 revenues Twenty one years of providing care for an increasing number of animals has eroded the Humane Society s reserve funds to 35 000 one minor emergency and we could be wiped out The most recent three year pound contract with the City expired on June 30 2000 Six months prior to that we began working with Mayor Streeter s office to negotiate a new agreement that would provide the funds we need to continue full service to the community without suffering the ongoing operating deficits we have endured for over 21 years Mayor Streeter was sensitive to our needs but cited the spending cap as the roadblock to providing us with sufficient funding In June the mayor sponsored a resolution seeking 70 000 per year to fund our contract for one year with a provision to seek an additional 10 000 from the contingency budget in January 2001 The City s Finance Committee approved that contract on July 3rd But if the additional 10 000 is not approved by the Board of Aldermen in January our Board of Trustees will be forced to cut services Over the course of the next year Executive Director Mike Philbrook along with the Board of Trustees will continue to work closely with Nashua s Aldermen to negotiate an annual contract that will come closer to providing the needs of the stray and abandoned animals in Nashua WE NEED YOUR HELP WE ARE FACED WITH THE REAL POSSIBILITY OF TURNING AWAY ANIMALS IF DONATIONS DO NOT INCREASE You can help in two ways 1 Please donate today Our goal for the remainder of this year is to raise 100 000 00 If each person receiving this letter gives just 18 39 we will make the goal However the average response rate to our appeals is 10 which means that about 544 of you send in checks if history repeats itself with this appeal then each of you will have to give 182 to make the 100 000 goal We are most grateful for your support in whatever amount you can spare We love animals and we know you do too Thank you for your support we can only do this because of you 2 Contact your ward Alderman and lobby for his her support of the Humane Society s needs If you don t know who your Alderman is contact the Mayor s office at 594 3341 If you would like more information please call me at 603 880 1490 ext 235 or email me at john jghenry com or contact Mike Philbrook at 603 889 2275 ext 23 or email him at philbrook hsfn org Thank you for your continued support Sincerely Yours John Henry President of the Board of Trustees
