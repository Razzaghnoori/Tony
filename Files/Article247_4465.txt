 One System Does Not Fit All Dear Ann As I see it there are three separate issues what topics are being taught how much homework kids get and what approach is used for teaching With that in mind let me continue for a minute on the question of what topics are being taught The debate between covering a smaller number of topics in depth versus getting all the facts into kid heads has raged is raging and will rage as long as there are children to teach Bennett wants to believe that you can teach in depth and in breadth at the same time But when I read him I can t help thinking that the former secretary of education has never actually been a grade school classroom teacher at least not for long I know that many schools with the Core Curriculum whose emphasis is breadth are doing a good job I m willing to bet though that the best teachers in those schools prune the lists in order to spend more time on specific topics diminish the breadth for the sake of depth This is usually the secret of first rate education No matter how radical a new curriculum may be the best teachers have always quietly moderated it My worry about Bennett s lack of teaching experience struck me especially while reading the math section in The Educated Child Bennett presents a perfectly reasonable sequence of math skills But he also launches into a rather startling anti math rap Math is hard work he says Math is not fun You shouldn t expect it to be fun You must practice practice practice He assumes that kids will not like learning math and that parents will not have the foggiest idea about what is going on He even provides parents with the solutions to second grade math problems I suppose this is necessary in his mind since he makes a math error or two himself In his list of basic math facts he can t seem to get product and quotient straight when it comes to multiplying and dividing integers I d like to suggest he spend a few minutes polling first graders about their favorite academic subject Math he will soon discover is far and away the favorite of a large number of kids boys in particular but that s another discussion Just as there are children who have a seemingly natural affinity for reading and others who have an amazing ability to imagine historical events there are those youngsters who just get numbers Now to homework You suggest that public schools assign more than private schools But in my experience there are private schools that assign a lot and private schools that assign a little and likewise with the public schools In New York some of the more traditional private schools load on homework I tutor fifth graders who are at it three four and sometimes five hours a night Literally Not wise from my point of view The load is lighter in private progressive schools but there too by fourth grade knapsacks usually bulge In some of the public schools kids get a rigorous curriculum with homework to match But Bennett is right about many of the other schools They don t demand enough from students I work next to a public high school and the kids go to and from with sunken backpacks when they have backpacks at all The new testing requirements for high school graduation may change that but I haven t seen it in the backpacks yet Leaving homework aside though which method is superior progressive or traditional Bennett clearly sides with a traditional methodology that employs some aspects of progressive thinking That can work I also think that for the right student and with the right teacher an old fashioned traditional classroom can be a great place to learn Personally I prefer teaching in a progressive style But some students require something more traditional I remember one child who needed help in math I tried hard to give him insight into the concepts that underlie addition and subtraction I used blocks I used money I used graph paper progressive methods all Finally the child said to me Just show me how to do it and I ll figure out why I m doing it later It was a light bulb moment for me Although most children I work with learn best when they go from the concept to the rote process this student learned best when I reversed my usual system I have another student an exceptionally bright child who was enrolled in one of the most prestigious traditional schools in the city A real drill the skill kind of place He was floundering This year he moved to a progressive school and he is sailing along without problems Children and teachers are individuals One system cannot fit all And so although I can see standardizing the curriculum at least to a degree I worry about standardizing the approach to teaching What does this mean about school choice not that we can discuss everything Peggy
