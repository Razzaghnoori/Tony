          well now i i have a question for you do you like uh fresh water fishing or salt water fishing   okay i like well what i usually do is fresh water fishing i havent been salt water fishing since i was about ten   is that right   yeah and i do everything up at Lake Texoma oh yeah im a striper fisherman   oh you do okay oh where do you fish for striper there   oh everywhere wherever those little suckers are       but uh we camp at the lodge Texoma State Park   okay   over on the Oklahoma side and uh but usually when we go striper fishing when i go out for the big ones we travel down the you know where the channel is down the middle of the lake   oh umhum uhhuh pretty much   we usually chase them down through there   okay so youre out in a boat then   oh yeah oh yeah do you ever go up there   oh ive gone up there camping like at Eisenhower State Park and ive observed fishing but ive never actually fished there   uhhuh oh its good fishing up there   yeah so you like to go for striper then   yeah of course i wont you know i wont throw anything back     well the time i went and watched i went over to the uh to the dam and it was right after one of the major major rains that wed had uh in fact i think it had been over the spillway recently when we went it was back down but uh some of the roadblocks were still up or there was evidence of them   oh yeah uhhuh   and people were they really had the gates open   oh my gosh thats supposed to be the greatest time to fish   big time well i couldnt believe some of the striper that these people were pulling out and there were just people galore for that matter just just everywhere just huge fish   yeah oh yeah oh yeah its fun well my dad got me hooked on it   so to speak   and uh yeah oh God pun pun and uh wed go out he liked to go out about five thirty and you know watch the sun come up every morning and uh boy we   all right   we knew a bunch of the striper guides and and so wed follow them and he had a CB on the boat and all that kind of stuff and wed just follow the channel and when its you know middle July through late August when its so hot they stay down real deep all the big ones do yeah follow that channel on up   deep in the channel huh ill be   but uh so now my cousin will i make him get up early in the morning and take me out striper fishing and then we usually fish under the bridge at night with the kids and his wife and stuff like that because where we go a lot of times   oh wow   uh the waves are so big i dont want my kids out there because its sort of dangerous but i love it i love it   right well i used to fish go every summer to northern Canada   oh really   and so i ive been spoiled by that uh but i had a string of seven or eight years in a row   oh   of uh sort of a close knit group we would just hop in the car and drive straight through two thousand miles   oh how much fun   and uh we started out fishing out of a lodge and then we started uh either taking our own canoes or renting them when we got there and hitting a few of the   oh my goodness   you know smaller lakes along the river chain and uh catch Northern Pike and walleye primarily   uhhuh oh my goodness   and sometimes Lake Trout also   oh how much fun   so wed always go the first week in June you know essentially as soon as school was out and everything is all over and done wed uh we go uh   uhhuh   course one year i went two weeks too early with a friend that was he at this point hed graduated from college and was in the Army and he had a two week period he he had to work with before he got shipped off to Germany   oh my goodness   and so i went with him in the middle of May and much to our surprise when we got there all the lakes were still frozen  no yeah the first week we were there we just had to camp and   oh youre kidding ooh not for me   uh we could go on the streams they were open up you know the flowing where the water was flowing but the lakes themselves were still iced over for the whole yeah whole first week we were there   uhhuh oh my gosh ooh   but then the next week they were just just like day and night difference we had some rain and wind and it it cleared all the lakes off and uh you know the fishing was already really picking up but uh   uhhuh   those were my favorite fishing trips the most serious fishing i guess ive done   yeah yeah when i take the kids out like i say we in fact Memorial Day weekend we went up to the lake and uh my cousins have a boat my boat is sitting in my driveway not running and uh so we go up there and we decided   oh   that wed you know go out first we got everybodys tents up and camp made and all that and said come on lets go fishing we hauled in well we brought in thirty three fish and we had thrown a bunch of little ones back   good grief yeah   and uh so then we had a huge fish fry the next afternoon and we went back out fishing and we caught and brought in thirty three more and had thrown a bunch of the little ones back but we had more fun those kids   wow   theyve got real fishing poles but theyre the little short ones   right   and it was so funny because i mean theyd just be hanging over the side of the boat mom i think i got a fish i think i got a fish oh it was hysterical but   thats incredible boy   Jamies getting to the age now that when i get up and go fishing early in the morning he wants to go too you know he doesnt want to get left behind anymore   oh boy yeah   so its getting a little difficult to do that but       we love it we just love it   well i need to break my kids in they i have a son you know Wesley that enjoys it but he hasnt really caught enough fish to appreciate any fishing so i id like to break them in a little bit   uhhuh uhhuh well i have to watch it because Ashleyll out fish her brother half the time and so you know that gets a little sore   uhoh yeah   but where we camp there theres a you know little bit of a inlet where we park the boats and stuff so real early in the morning before it gets hot and then you know right at dusk   uhhuh   um down in the trees down there boy all those little sunfish come up and theyll go down there while im cooking dinner and just start reeling those little babies in and they ha ve more fun with that   right huh what do they use for bait   oh usually ill buy them a thing of worms or a lot of times ill just give them a piece of bacon and theyre taught theyll tear up bacon and stick it i mean those theyll theyll bite empty hooks thats whats so funny   yeah good grief   and when were out chasing the big stripers we use those perch for bait     yeah use the little ones for bait yeah why not   yeah its great   oh me   but we just love it up there in fact Jamie wanted to go up this weekend with it being fourth of July weekend but uh i cant put the tent up and all that kind of stuff quite yet im still pretty sore   fourth of July yeah oh me   so anyway but have you been um salt water fishing   i havent really done any of that uh and oddly enough uh Jackies parents live on the the Carolina beach in North Carolina and and weve i guess we went out one time   right oh my goodness   and just fished you know from the shore like in the winter you know one Christmas trip   uhhuh   but other than that thats really been it yeah they uh ive always wanted to actually go out in the boat i think i went out on a a snapper party boat in the Gulf once upon a time but uh and i was i was too sick to   yeah uhhuh   to to enjoy that   right
