        regarding uh taxes im you know taxes are really a necessary evil in in a civilized society but really people get upset at taxes because you its more efficient to do things yourself     right hm   and uh and so as as a result uh you know its its a tradeoff you know for the common good you know for for the benefit of others you know how much of your resource should you dedicate to uh making things work for others have you uh you know ever thought you know just how much of that money should should go to other people that really dont deserve it   uh well yeah  i know its its a lot you know  that uh that i feel like you know just like you said that theres just so much that you can do yourself that you take care of your own self that you dont need the money for but theyre giving it to other people that dont really need it either either but yet they accept it   well the thing of it is if i wanted to just uh you know permanently become a book reader i guess i could just uh you know uh go on public assistance uh you know  look look look for uh look for people to uh take care of me and uh probably a good woman right   like so many people do uhhuh right   just you know just just con somebody to take care of me and and then you dont have to be on the tax roll   right   but uh but taxes are are very difficult kind of thing and everybody everybody really hates it it was very timely i i i always over pay my my deductions so i wind up with my getting money back on my uh from my uh withholding   uhhuh   so uh you know that thats always a smile but of course you know ive ive paid it in and i should calculate it better   you are you in business for yourself   no no i i i i work for the FBI   okay i see   so i im a federal employee yeah guess i dont sound like it huh   right uh well i think i no i think that people that work for the government are just as against taxes as as everybody else you know most of them unless you work for Internal Revenue     yeah ive blown yeah oh i ive got all four feet in a trough you know being a federal employee and and and so but but i can understand that uh that you know the uh who gets benefits like every every time there is a a bond issue   yeah umhum   you know i vote no on every one of them   right   im i but this this is this is tax not tax revolt country i mean theres too many every one of us most of us have our have all four feet in the trough you know plus our snout right up to our ears   yeah   so you know its not exactly that kind of a place that that that you wanna you know get into a tax revolt situation   right   but uh um the um the local taxes here i i in in this particular area um you know ive uh i think i pay about uh oh thirty five hundred for for taxes on my four bedroom house you know and which is a lot of money and and uh and so as as people get older and older uh you know they think about retirement and that sort of thing and   right umhum   and they theyre building old peoples homes uh you know at tax expense sell i think you know the old people ought to just bail out of here and go where its cheaper at thirty three hundred dollars at or thirty five hundred dollars im paying in taxes why i i i could go down to Bulverde and probably rent a rent a house for that right   yeah thats right for   you know instead instead its its the taxes here so course i dont know whether i wanna go to Bulverde or not   yeah     yeah or Seguin or someplace like that   yeah   but uh theres certainly lots of inexpensive places where the services are poorer and and i think really the only place you can really reduce the amount of taxes you pay is to move to an area where the services are poorer if youre not gonna use them then you wanna be in in an environment thats a strategy i think that that the people have to have to take is is how to be able to to lessen their cost of living you know and im im five six away years before im eligible to retire and and im saying well you know i really cant stay here uh as a retiree its too expensive   after you retire yeah yeah   yeah im gonna have go out in and you know in  you know East Fork someplace and and do my thing you know   right oh my parents are in the same situation you know they their home is paid for but still their taxes are so high that you know my father doesnt feel like he can retire because they couldnt pay the taxes and they have no children in school or you know anything now they dont use any of those services that a lot of the taxes go towards   right they they redecorated in nineteen seventy five you know and theyre not doing it again again you know so well its certainly uh uh you must be a TI employee   uh yeah yeah   you must be what   you must be a TI employee   no im not  no i i dont work im a student i go to school im in nursing school   youre not a TI employee who do you work for youre
