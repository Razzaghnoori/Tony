 Famous Last Words Anyone who lived in New York in the last 40 years and whose life touched even briefly on that in town industry of the printed word had to have heard of Harold Brodkey Writer and reputation were inseparable from the beginning no doubt because his self aggrandizement dovetailed so nicely with the spirit of literary kingmakers around town It began as an explosion in 1954 with the publication of his still astonishing collection of stories First Love and Other Sorrows The Big Novel was promised and promised but it seemed as if it would never come There were rumors that Brodkey was getting a kind of perpetually renewable advance from his publisher Farrar Straus Giroux Fragments of fiction appeared in The New Yorker throughout the 60s and 70s but they eventually amounted not to a novel but to a second collection Stories in an Almost Classical Mode 1988 Brodkey began to write an acerbic column about life and letters for the New York Observer and it was said that this new diversion proved he would never finish the novel Somehow when The Runaway Soul a novel of some 800 pages finally appeared in 1991 it was an anticlimax Though reviewed positively it was even its partisans admitted perhaps too long too repetitive too fragmentary Literary fashion is elusive what in the 1960s might have seemed like an apotheosis of modernism had by the decidedly postmodern 1990s come to seem old hat Then in 1993 while he was putting the finishing touches on his second novel Profane Friendship Brodkey learned that he was ill with AIDS He promptly published a declaration of his illness in The New Yorker and suddenly he was as fascinating as a train wreck once again This Wild Darkness The Story of My Death is his final book a series of diary essays chronicling the two years leading up to his death on Jan 26 1996 An agonizing production of willful beauty it gives the lie to the implicitly posed question about Brodkey megalomaniac or genius Because he was both Brodkey s account takes us from his discovery that he was ill with AIDS through his prolonged hospital stay with pneumonia his decision to return home and the slow months many in a quiet equilibrium that was not health but not death either that followed During this time he was able to revisit his beloved Venice and spend a final summer in his country house in upstate New York Even though we know the end the story is filled with suspense and we turn the pages intently He was too great a writer not to milk the drama of his own demise Running parallel to the story of the author s dying is that of his relationship with his wife Ellen Schwamm Brodkey and the mixture of deathbed wit tenderness and sensuality the couple share The portrait of Ellen is an understated valentine that colors the entire book with almost inadvertent charm The great relief here for reader as well as writer is that the fictional mask has been cast aside Brodkey s work was always obviously insistently autobiographical but one could get muddled trying to decide if for instance this story s narrator from a St Louis suburb was the same as that story s narrator from a St Louis suburb Although the various narrators might sound exactly the same they would have different names and one a sister And then there were the confusions among the many Venetian lovers male and female and the mystery of the alter ego who directs films These are no doubt parochial concerns but Brodkey always seemed to be deliberately provoking the puzzlement coyly playing hide and seek with us By contrast it seems calming to Brodkey s voice to find itself in a true first person and a lucid present tense Medical attention and the horrors of death great death amused me in a quiet way Amused Well what do you feel when you re expected to fight an often fatal pneumonia and you ve been sentenced to death already The connection to the ordinary world is broken yet not entirely And there is a cartoon aspect the curses people hurled at you have come true What do you suggest I do Be unamused There is unsurprisingly given Brodkey s reputation no shortage here of paranoia and score settling Brodkey often darkly refers to his enemies the enemies of his work of his marriage the enemies of genius He manages to get one smart crack in writing I do think about suicide a lot because it is so boring to be ill rather like being trapped in an Updike novel There are also embarrassing or if you prefer honest references to his being recognized and accepted as an important writer to the conviction that his work will live after he is gone He chews over his past counts up his debtors enumerates his aches and pains and worries the issue of subjectivity to the bone A friend says that I am a monstre sacr but I am not so famous I am aware of the monstrosity of my own will and of individual will in anyone he writes Or again I believe that the world is dying not just me Is all this his special megalomania or just garden variety egotism Either way Brodkey embraces a self absorption so extreme that it succeeds paradoxically in turning him into an Everyman My body is to me like a crippled rabbit that I don t want to pet that I forget to feed on time that I haven t time to play with and get to know a useless rabbit kept in a cage that it would be cruel to turn loose Brodkey underplays the untying of an old psychological knot when he reveals details of his childhood His mother died when he was young and he was adopted by the Brodkeys His new parents became physically ill which exacerbated their psychological torture of their son so much one could have gathered already from Brodkey s fiction The new details in This Wild Darkness make explicit the sexual abuses of his adoptive father Brodkey tells us that after several years of unwanted fondling I said he could not touch me anymore not even a handshake unless he behaved He turned his face to the wall telling me I was a cold fish because I would not sex around with him He was lecherous and strange Brodkey expresses enormous ambivalence about his own later life adventures in homosexuality referring at one unsavory moment to his illness as the wages of sin While it is easy to see how infuriating such a pose must be to others offensiveness in the service of subjective truth has its place here If not here then where Brodkey is not obliged to be a poster boy for AIDS Besides in another mood he writes It seemed to me that I was surrounded by braveries without number that I had been inducted into a phalanx of the wildly alive even if dying and I felt honored that I would so to speak die in the company of such people On the page Brodkey has always been a brilliant egotistical talker As a listener one is both stimulated and frustrated longing to get a word in edgewise Perhaps that s why he has always seemed to want to preclude critical judgment with pre emptive strikes within his prose anticipating our responses and silencing us He does that here too but with a somewhat milder air I think what I think and the hell with the rest of it the rest of you you don t actually exist for me anyway you re all myths in my head Perhaps the absoluteness of the act of writing in effect his own elegy and the absoluteness of his inability to answer his critics afterward curiously mellowed him It turns out to be surprisingly easy to get past the whining and the nonsense about fame And Brodkey s strenuous feats of observation and language in the teeth of death more than repay the effort At one time I was interested in bird watching and I noticed that when I saw a bird for the first time I couldn t really see it because I had no formal arrangement no sense of pattern for it But once I identified the bird the drawings in bird books and my own sense of order arranged the image and made it clearer to me and I never forgot it From then on I could see the bird in two ways as the fresh unpatterned vision and the patterned one Well seeing death nearby is very like the first way of seeing What can one do with Brodkey s gift of his own death given in a manner at once casual and shocking Receive it with gratitude
