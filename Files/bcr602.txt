 Introduction Breast cancer is predicted to be newly diagnosed in about 211 300 women in 2003 in the United States 1 2 Twelve percent of all women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime and 3 5 will die of the disease The cell transformation associated with breast cancer requires the coordinated activation or inhibition of specific intact or altered genes Transcription factors frequently regulate these processes An important type of transcription factor contains a conserved region of 60 amino acids called the homeodomain HD encoded by a DNA region the homeobox HB HD proteins are involved in the control of development and differentiation in many organisms 3 4 Initially discovered in Drosophila mutations of the HB in homeobox genes result in vast morphologic abnormalities 3 Subsequently homologous HB genes have been cloned in many species including humans 5 6 7 Vertebrate HB genes are divided into two classes Class I genes HOX genes are organized into four clusters HOX A B C D with a total of 39 members 8 Members of Class II are also called divergent genes including genes such as PAX MSX IRX and DLX named after their homologs in Drosophila paired muscle segment Iroquois and distal less respectively 9 10 Accumulating evidence suggests that homeobox genes are important in malignant transformation Not only have altered expression levels of HB genes been detected in a variety of human malignancies 8 11 12 13 14 but the ectopic expression of certain HOX genes can induce tumors 15 16 17 Abnormal HOX gene expression has been associated with breast cancer For example the murine Hoxa 1 gene is upregulated in neoplastic murine mammary glands 18 In humans the lack of HOXA5 expression results in the loss of p53 expression in breast cancer 19 Enforced HOXB7 expression in SkBr3 breast cancer cells induces the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor and increases growth rate serum independent growth and the ability of cells to form colonies in semisolid medium 20 Nude mice when injected with SkBr3 HOXB7 cells developed tumors 21 We have cloned a human homeobox cDNA called BP1 belonging to the DLX family BP1 is apparently involved in the regulation of diverse pathways In normal erythroid cells it acts as a repressor of the globin gene 22 23 However BP1 was also expressed in 47 of the adult and 81 of the pediatric acute myeloid leukemia patients we examined and its overexpression increased the leukemogenic potential of K562 cells in vitro 11 Molecular analysis revealed that BP1 expression is required for the survival of K562 leukemia cells suggesting that BP1 might be part of an anti apoptotic pathway Davenport GJ Fu S Haga SB Do K Stevenson H Pinzone J Chase MB Berg PE unpublished data Furthermore these results imply that aberrant BP1 expression might also be involved in other malignancies In the present study we analyzed BP1 expression in human breast cancer cell lines and assessed BP1 expression in invasive ductal carcinoma tumors correlating its expression with age tumor size lymph node metastasis histologic grade estrogen receptor ER status progesterone receptor PR status and race Methods Cell lines The breast cancer cell lines Hs578T MCF7 MDA MB 231 MDA MB 468 and T 47D were kindly given to us by Dr Angela Brodie MCF7ADR and MDA MB 435S were a gift from Dr Joseph Fontana and MCF10A was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection ATCC Manassas VA USA Cell lines were grown in Dulbecco s modified Eagle s medium supplemented with 10 fetal calf serum except for MCF10A cells which were grown as recommended by the ATCC Human breast tissues Human breast tumor samples were obtained from The George Washington University Department of Pathology and the NCI Cooperative Human Tissue Network Southern Division all with Institutional Review Board approval and as previously described 24 Breast tissue samples 0 5 1 0 cm in diameter were obtained from fresh surgical resection specimens from patients with breast tumors and were characterized pathologically in terms of their stage in malignancy The samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and were kept frozen until use Normal breast tissues were obtained from the periphery of specimens surgically resected for treatment of cancer or from an autopsy specimen obtained from a patient who had died of injuries sustained in an accident not breast cancer the latter was obtained from the Brain and Tissue Bank for Developmental Disorders at the University of Maryland RNA isolation and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction RT PCR Total RNA was extracted from human breast cell lines frozen breast tumor tissues and normal breast tissues with Trizol reagent Invitrogen Gaithersburg MD USA in accordance with the manufacturer s protocol Total RNA 1 g was used to synthesize cDNA with a SuperScript II reverse transcriptase system Invitrogen After synthesis of the first strand cDNA PCR was performed by initial denaturing at 94 C for 2 min followed by 28 cycles of denaturation at 94 C for 1 min annealing at 60 C for 1 min and extension at 72 C for 1 5 min The PCR primers for BP1 which span an intron were 5 GTATG GCCACCTCCTGTCTT 3 forward and 5 GAGTA GATGGTCCTCGGCTT 3 reverse giving a product of 225 base pairs The internal control for all samples was actin Statistical analyses Statistical analyses were used to determine the relationship between BP1 positivity measured by RT PCR and clinicopathological parameters All P values were calculated with Fisher s Exact Test Tests were considered significant if their associated P value was 0 05 or less two tailed All statistical analyses were performed with SAS 8 2 SAS Institute Cary NC USA Results BP1 expression in breast cell lines BP1 mRNA levels were analyzed in a series of breast cell lines by using RT PCR The cell lines are derived from breast cancer patients with the exception of MCF10A which is an immortalized non transformed epithelial cell line 25 As shown in Fig 1 the levels of BP1 expression varied widely between the cell lines from barely detectable Hs578T MDA MB 435S and MCF10A lanes 2 6 and 9 respectively to highly expressing MCF7ADR MDA MB 468 and T 47D lanes 4 7 and 8 respectively MCF7 and MDA MB 231 lanes 3 and 5 respectively showed intermediate expression For comparison one normal breast tissue from an autopsy was included in the first lane it was BP1 negative There was a correlation between BP1 expression and tumorigenesis in mice Table 1 The cell lines that express little or no BP1 Hs578T MDA MB 435S and MCF10A are not tumorigenic whereas MCF7ADR MDA MB 468 and MDA MB 231 express BP1 and are tumorigenic MCF7 and T 47D cells express variable BP1 levels and are tumorigenic only in the presence of estradiol 26 27 BP1 expression might therefore be involved in tumorigenesis in mice Transgenic studies would provide direct evidence for this hypothesis BP1 expression in breast tumor tissues BP1 mRNA expression was examined in 46 invasive ductal breast tumors including grades I II and III tumors and in some cases compared with adjacent normal breast tissue Of these tumors 80 expressed BP1 In contrast of seven normal breast tumors analyzed six were BP1 negative and one showed low BP1 expression A representative RT PCR analysis of five tumors three with matched normal tissue is shown in Fig 2 All of the tumors shown are ER negative and PR negative Matched normal and tumor tissues from three patients are shown in lanes 1 and 2 patient 1 3 and 4 patient 2 and 5 and 6 patient 3 No BP1 expression was seen in the normal samples lanes 1 3 and 5 whereas BP1 was expressed in all of the tumors lanes 2 4 and 6 Two additional tumor tissues shown in lanes 7 and 8 were positive for BP1 matched samples were not available To determine the significance of BP1 expression in the tumor tissues clinicopathological data were related to BP1 expression Table 2 No significant relationship was detected between BP1 status and age tumor size or lymph node metastasis Because 5 year survival data were not available for some patients we were not able to evaluate survival outcome BP1 expression was significantly more prevalent in ER negative tumors of which 100 were BP1 positive compared with ER positive tumors of which 73 were BP1 positive P 0 03 There was also a significant difference in BP1 expression between PR negative tumors of which 96 were BP1 positive and PR positive tumors of which 67 were BP1 positive P 0 02 BP1 expression was associated with race it was expressed in 89 of the tumors of African American women but in only 57 of the tumors of Caucasian women P 0 04 There was no significant difference in BP1 expression between the three tumor grades BP1 was expressed in 80 of grade I tumors 73 of grade II tumors and 90 of grade III tumors Discussion In the present study we found that 80 of invasive ductal breast tumors expressed BP1 a member of the DLX homeobox gene family In contrast only 14 of normal breast tissues expressed BP1 Our previous studies showed that BP1 is also expressed in leukemia and has characteristics of an oncogene in acute myeloid leukemia BP1 is highly expressed in the bone marrow of 63 of patients overall with a preponderance of expression in pediatric patients 11 When overexpressed in a leukemia cell line K562 BP1 increased the ability of cells to grow in soft agar an indicator of leukemogenic potential up to 45 fold 11 Consistent with a possible oncogenic role for BP1 in breast cancer was the observation that its expression was correlated with the ability of breast cancer cell lines to cause mammary tumors in mice Recent studies have shown that abrogation of BP1 expression in a leukemia cell line leads to apoptosis Davenport GJ Fu S Haga SB Do K Stevenson H Pinzone J Chase MB Berg PE unpublished data Coupled with the increased clonogenicity resulting from overexpression of BP1 these observations suggest that the expression of BP1 in breast tissue might also lead to increased survival and conversely that the abrogation of BP1 expression in malignant breast tissue could cause apoptosis of those cells expressing BP1 Estrogen and progesterone which stimulate the growth of breast epithelium are two crucial hormones involved not only in normal breast development but also in carcinogenesis of breast epithelium and progression of breast cancer 28 About 40 of breast cancers are ER negative 28 ER negative tumors are unresponsive to anti estrogen therapy probably because of constitutive growth factor expression 28 29 In general these tumors have a higher histologic grade and a higher proliferative rate and are associated with poorer prognosis 28 The finding that 100 of ER negative tumors expressed BP1 might therefore be highly relevant to both the prognosis and therapy of those difficult to treat tumors It is well known that African American women have a higher mortality rate from breast cancer than Caucasian women reviewed by Mancino and colleagues 30 Although socioeconomic factors account for some of this difference several recent studies have shown that the median survival of African American women presenting with Stage III or IV disease was significantly lower than that of Caucasian women diagnosed at the same stage of disease in Stage III disease the median survival was 91 3 months for Caucasian patients and only 36 0 months for African American patients whereas in Stage IV disease the median survival was reduced to 24 0 months for Caucasian patients and 8 9 months for African American patients 30 31 African American women also have a higher risk of ER negative tumors after adjustment is made for stage and age at diagnosis These results have led to speculation that there could be biological differences between African American and Caucasian women that contribute to the differences in outcome Interestingly more African American women than Caucasian women were BP1 positive P 0 04 It will be important to expand further the number of women studied to determine whether BP1 expression might be one biological factor that underlies survival differences between African American and Caucasian women Because BP1 was expressed in all tumor grades we propose that it is activated in an early stage of malignant development or even in a premalignant state We have therefore begun to examine ductal carcinoma in situ DCIS which are preinvasive malignant lesions derived from epithelial cells and fibroadenomas which are non malignant tumors composed of epithelial and stromal cells 32 33 So far we have analyzed one DCIS which was BP1 positive and two fibroadenomas both of which were BP1 positive compared with no expression in the matched normal tissue for each fibroadenoma data not shown The sample number is very small but the fact that any of the DCISs or fibroadenoma tumors are positive for BP1 demonstrates that activation of BP1 might be an early event perhaps promoting cell survival as seems to occur in leukemia cells This idea is also supported by the fact that BP1 is as likely to be expressed in small tumors less than 2 0 cm as it is in larger tumors 2 0 cm or more The mechanism for overexpression of BP1 in breast cancer is unknown However because of its map location at 17q21 22 23 the BP1 gene is a potential candidate for DNA amplification which could lead to its activation or overexpression This hypothesis is based on the fact that two regions on chromosome 17q are sometimes amplified in breast cancer one at 17q11 21 and another at 17q22 24 34 35 The locus of BP1 is also near BRCA1 the implications of this proximity are not yet known To begin to identify genes that might be targets of BP1 we have overexpressed BP1 in K562 cells and screened a microarray Davenport GJ Fu S Haga SB Do K Stevenson H Pinzone J Chase MB Berg PE unpublished data Although K562 cells are derived from leukemia among the genes showing altered regulation were several that are also dysregulated in breast cancer including c myc and cyclin D2 their altered expression was verified by real time PCR c myc was upregulated in K562 cells overexpressing BP1 and c Myc protein is highly expressed in more than half of breast cancer patients 36 Cyclin D2 downregulated on the array is repressed in breast cancer 37 It will be important to determine whether either of those genes is a target for BP1 in breast cancer These data strongly implicate BP1 in breast cancer More case studies are underway to further strengthen our findings and to determine whether there is a statistical association between BP1 expression and prognosis or outcome of breast cancer patients Conclusion These data demonstrate a statistically significant association between the expression of the transcription factor BP1 not previously implicated in breast cancer and ER negative breast tumors This together with other studies strongly suggests that BP1 has oncogenic properties making it a new potential target in breast tumors especially the difficult to treat ER negative tumors Interestingly BP1 is expressed in 73 90 of tumors including all grades This finding and the observation that fibroadenomas non malignant tumors can express BP1 strongly suggest that its activation might be associated with loss of growth regulation which is consistent with our molecular data Competing interests None declared Abbreviations DCIS ductal carcinoma in situ ER estrogen receptor HB homeobox HD homeodomain PR progesterone receptor RT PCR reverse transcription
