        uh uh uh from my father     oh really huh   yeah he had he had given me the information and i said hm thats interesting so i thought id uh get involved and see whats going on with it   yeah kind of curious because um some people found about it on the computer network others yeah   oh is that right so they have a bulletin out on it   yeah on the uh uh theres a network around like around the world and uh theres a Telecom Digest   oh okay huh interesting       um i guess uh the topic were talking about did they introduce the topic on your side   yeah taxes   yeah and whether were getting enough for the income and all that stuff   right   okay this the first time ive done this so um um well just     yeah  hold on a sec im on a im on a cordless its giving me some trouble   oh you are     jeez   that make it better   uh all set   yeah   okay now what what do we do just press one and go for it     yeah   this is kind of weird       um all right um uh what what do you want to do as a prompt for the question     um oh you you didnt press it yet did you no okay um i dont know see uh   no   im a student i dont pay much in taxes except for when i work thats a little bit yeah   oh youre a student oh okay   um hm   uh why dont i ask you the question um you know uh i dont know um being uh do ill just ask you know do do you think income taxes work for this country or should we have a broad base tax     a broad base tax in terms of   of everybody just pays a flat rate   okay i have an answer for that   ten percent what   i have an answer for that   okay all right ill talk to you in a bit hold okay uh ill just press one okay here we go   yeah okay go ahead yeah       okay   right i guess i guess im just wondering uh what your thoughts are on taxes uh um do you think that we should just have a kind of a broad based tax or just uh or do you like it the way its set up now     um i think a progressive tax the way it is now is is good um taxing uh those people with more money uh taxing them a little more i mean those people who can afford to pay it out i mean there it wouldnt be fair to um like with say lower class people who dont make as much money   yeah   to uh pay out the same amount of taxes as someone making millions of dollars   well yeah i suppose thats i suppose thats true in i i guess im more for kind of a just a across the board tax because that way everybody would pay       the same a rate thats equal to what they were doing i mean if somebody only made ten thousand dollars a year and it was a ten percent tax theyre paying a thousand dollars whereas if somebodys making a million dollars a year   yeah okay   uh you know what i mean theyre paying a hundred thousand dollars in taxes   yeah   as opposed to which what it seems like now which is you know these guys get away with uh all these tax breaks and everything else like that that apply to them but they dont apply to the little guys so it seems like the  all the taxes you know taxes are being paid by everybody else seems kind of crazy   so youre saying um ten percent lets say a broad base ten percent tax uh without any loopholes or   yeah exactly exactly just everybody pays ten percent thats it       and then nobody has to worry about whether you know i get this and i get that and uh you know or this person gets a tax break but this person doesnt when this person makes that much more money   right   i mean that way you know somebody thats uh thats making uh ten million dollars pays a million bucks in taxes they um uh see i guess the problem with that is are they really using their fair share   is who   of the person that pays that many that much more taxes   yeah   but then again they have as much use to the of the system as everybody   right hm i yeah i see the i see the logic behind that   i dont know if that that would make sense i guess uh i guess what people do i guess the governments incentive now is to create incentives so that people will do more i guess house building or buying homes or you know because of they give them break tax break on their interest because i have a break on our interest i mean all our our all our mortgage interest is deductible   yeah right   um but it doesnt seem like they do a damn good job with the uh uh with the way theyre spending the taxes   to hm yeah promote borrowing with tax breaks promote investment yeah   exactly i mean they only just recently got rid of the interest uh that was deductible on credit cards and car loans and things like that   right personal tax   yeah but the major borrowing is still there i mean you know on mortgages and things like that uh although i dont think that we could afford our house without having that uh mortgage deduction   hm right   um you know it actually cuts down four hundred bucks a month   i think that   think something like that luxury tax was a mistake did they did they repeal that yet   i dont know thats a good question i i dont know whether they did or not   because i mean yeah youre uh trying to get back at trying to sort of maybe punish i dont know the rich and make them pay some more but it what happened was the the result was that uh sales went down in yachts and those kind of things   right   and so the little guy who works for those that employer
