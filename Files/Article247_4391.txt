                                 RealWorld Libertarians and the Net                        Im finding it a bit hard to locate my book in Richards kickoff to thisdiscussion Its argument is not as he suggests that liberty converges ontoanarchy To the contrary My argument is that a certain form of libertarianismwill lead to less liberty A certain form of libertarianisma knee jerklibertarianism that looks at every proposed intervention by government and saysleave the Net alone My argument is that this response will lead to a Netwith far less liberty than the Net we know now with a potential to be far moreregulated than any world we have knownever            How            Thats the second part of the argument that seems to have gone missing thatthe liberty or freedom that cyberspace guarantees now is a function of thearchitecture of that space That that architecturewhich I call codemeaning the software and hardware that constitutes cyberspace as it iswasinitially an architecture that protected fundamental freedoms But that thatarchitecture is changing As it changes the freedoms that the Net willguarantee changes as well            How is it changing            This is the third part AWOL in this initial kickoff of a discussion Theoriginal architecture given to us by researchers and hackers and generallylibertarian sorts is being changed as new layers of code are being added tothis architecture And these new layers are being added not by the samelibertarian sorts who gave us the initial version of the Internet They arebeing added by coders who work for commerce The values implicit in their codeare different from the values implicit in the code of the original InternetAnd under one story about how that code evolves they threaten to flip thecharacter of the Netfrom a place that protects liberty to a place whereliberty has been coded away            Rather than focusing on those arguments Richard wants to defendlibertarianisma cause that he has admirably defended for a great deal oftime Libertarianism is not Richard says quoting me the view thatgovernment is the enemy nor is it a focus on reducing governments powerThat is not the way in which a libertarian  thinks about governmentRather the libertarian starts in the state of nature His or her objectivefunction starts with the goal of minimizing the use of force and fraud in humaninteractions The hard part of the system is to figure out a way in which thatminimization takes place over both public and private actors            But there is libertarianism in the Ivory Tower and there islibertarianism on the ground I recognize the species that Richard describesI am a permanent resident of the Ivory Tower But my book describes a presentpolitical attitude not the Ivory Tower It is about a present politicalreality and a present rhetorical push I am describing it because I have beenwatching it for the past six years In that world if someone argued asRichard does above that a law of privacy was needed as well as lawprotecting trade secrets that laws regulating libel and slander werenecessary as well as a law regulating blackmail if one even raised the issueof taxation or suggested that the government was needed to secure theinfrastructure then one would not be a libertarian One would be a Red Thelibertarian of the Net has a simple message quite different from Ivory TowerLibertarianism It is Keep the government out            Now of course this is an extreme but the extreme affects the mean And sowhile there are few who would insist that the government always stay out ithas become mainstream to argue that the government should just leave the Netalone Let the Net take care of itself is the slogan of our generationandthe current administration But if we do then the Net will become somethingvery different from what it is just now            Thats the argument of my book Not an attack on Ivory Tower LibertarianismNor even an attack on sensible libertarianism But an attack on a certaindonothingness that pervades our present political culture            So forgive me Richard if I decline your sending it over to me toexplain why the same version of sensible libertarianism  should not guideour activities in cyberspace Thats the question of your many valuable andimportant books My book asks a different set of questions Let me send it backover to you to address some of them
