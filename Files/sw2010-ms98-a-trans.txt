 this is Archie hi Archie i m Sharon have you seen Dancing with Wolf yeah i ve seen that that s uh that was a really good movie probably one of the best things about it was the scenery and uh i thought the story was pretty good too i think i think Kevin Costner did a really good job with it have you ever lived in that part of the country no i haven t have you ever visited it um i ve visited the Wyoming area i m not sure exactly where Dances with Wolves was filmed i think it was the Black Hills of South Dakota could be i i haven t been to South Dakota have have you been up to that well i lived in Omaha for five winters and that rolling kind of uh oh okay terrain yeah is is fairly familiar the thing that i thought was interesting was that the critics apparently it s gonna win everything really uh and i had been told you know you wouldn t notice that it was three hours long and all this kind of that s true i agree with that um i i noticed yesterday in the paper something said that it i think it s been nominated for twelve awards and and all the critics initially said that you know it wouldn t go anywhere that it was just gonna be a dud so it it has surprised everybody well the interesting thing was is i had heard that and i i i tend to i think overreact occasionally when somebody tells me it s that great and and it was the thing is it was a it was a good story uh huh right and and and i guess that s what i really like although i must admit i did look at my watch after about an hour yeah did you have you seen Sleeping with the Enemy no i ve heard i ve heard that s really great though you you have to go see that one and how about Silence of the Lambs go no you must really keep up i do i go every weekend i i uh those are two definite must see movies i think well isn t isn t Sleeping with the Enemy isn t that a is is it is it a terror movie or is it just suspenseful it s suspenseful i don t think it s very terror i mean there s not really any uh blood and guts in it or anything like that it s it s more suspense um the other one Silence of the Lambs is kind of a a gory movie if if somebody s not into that kind of stuff it s it s pretty graphic at points but uh i think they re both excellent movies do you do you listen to Gary Cohill Cohill is uh you know who he is no huh uh yeah somebody in South Carolina told me about him he s a the movie critic um oh you ve oh okay he s a movie critic on channel eight in Dallas yeah and he does uh he has a talk show on the KLIF anyway it s on from seven to nine or something and and and people call in and it s if you keep up with movies it s kind of interesting there s a certain amount of drivel that they do they ve got uh they ve got a couple of kids ten or twelve years old and they call in and they review movies but it s uh oh he anyway he it s interesting you listen to him and then you you go watch the movie fact they had people had just seen i was listening Sunday night a little bit when i was going to uh huh pick up my daughter but anyway it was uh it the it it s interesting though the the the difficulty with with Dancing with Wolves is that when you make a movie like that and you produce it and then you star in it uh the question is did he did he really know it was gonna be good or did he just do it i think that i think he really his heart was in it but i don t i don t think he really knew it was gonna be as big as it was i think it was something that he really wanted to do he wanted to direct it he wanted to act to star in it you know he he enjoyed the story line and i think he just really wanted he really wanted it whether it whether it won all kinds of awards or whether it just was okay at the box office i think he would have been happy because i think that i think he did a good job and and the self satisfaction he got out of it is much greater than any awards that they can give him do you know who the guy was that was playing the uh the the wagon driver um a little piece of trivia you know the guy when he first headed out from the army post yeah who no i don t know who that guy is he he plays on Murphy Brown oh he does yes he s as a recurring character every week he s Eldon her housepainter oh no now see i d a i d a never put those two together do you believe that that s that s one of those interesting pieces of trivia that somebody said did you notice that i thought no it s really funny but i thought it it turns you think back and yeah it was him but with a huh uh yeah you know with the beard and all that stuff i mean it s uh yeah real scruffy looking yeah real scruffy looking and it was it was really funny it s uh that that he winds up playing in the movie but i thought it s good that you know it was a lot of fun yeah i don t know how long this conversation is supposed to go but we re at about five minutes i should think we ve done enough you think so i mean i haven t been watching my watch um well i don t know what how do we end this thing i think it just says hang up why don t we do that good bye Sharon
