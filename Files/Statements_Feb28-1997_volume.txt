 STATEMENTS OF FEDERAL FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING CONCEPTS AND STANDARDS as of February 28 1997 SFFAC Nos 1 2 SFFAS Nos 1 8 Selected Materials GAO Document FOREWORD This volume is the first of a two volume set referred to as the Codification It contains the original text that currently constitutes the body of accounting concepts and standards for the U S Government Specifically the volume incorporates the following documents published through February 28 1997 Statements of Federal Financial Accounting Concepts 1 2 and Statements of Federal Financial Accounting Standards 1 8 1 Origins of the Statements The concepts and standards presented in the two volume set resulted from the joint efforts of the Department of the Treasury Treasury the Office of Management and Budget OMB and the General Accounting Office GAO These three central agencies referred to collectively as the principals established the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board FASAB in 1990 FASAB was created to consider and recommend accounting standards and principles 2 The principals ultimately decide upon the principles and standards The Codification includes only those principles and standards agreed to by the principals FASAB is publishing the Codification as a comprehensive basis of accounting for Federal reporting entities It is expected that FASAB will continue to recommend statements on specialized topics As new statements and interpretations are adopted the Codification will be updated Purpose of the Codification The Codification of Federal accounting concepts and standards is a two volume set with extensive cross referencing and indexing The volumes are designed to meet the needs of users for references to original statements Volume I and to standards alphabetized by topic Volume II Both volumes serve as authoritative references to the standards and interpretations 1 Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards No 8 Supplementary Stewardship Reporting has been approved by the Board s principals but may not be implemented until it has undergone a 45 day review by Congress The review was not completed at the time this Volume was published SFFAS No 8 is provided herein for your convenience and future use An announcement will be made in the Federal Register when the review has been completed and SFFAS No 8 can be implemented 2 For a more extensive description of FASAB s role refer to Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Concepts No 1 Objectives of Federal Financial Reporting Paras 23 29 Volume I This volume Volume 1 Federal Financial Accounting Concepts and Standards Original Statements is a compilation of the documents produced by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board and adopted by the principals the Secretary of the Treasury the Director of OMB and the Comptroller General of the United States Once adopted the documents are referred to as Statements of Federal Financial Accounting Concepts SFFAC or Concepts and Statements of Federal Financial Accounting Standards SFFAS or Standards respectively This volume presents the Concepts in their entirety Concepts do not establish Federal financial accounting standards rather they describe the concepts used by FASAB as a framework as it considers and recommends accounting principles for the Federal government Concepts are meant to guide others involved in Federal financial reporting such as preparers and auditors This volume extracts the authoritative portions of the Standards originally published in individual statements as well as the explanatory text contained in any appendices It does not reprint the summaries or all introductory and background material since these sections are not always essential to applying the standards or understanding the Board s conclusions The Basis for the Board s Conclusions for each standard is included since it serves to explain the specific provisions of the standards The glossaries originally published with each statement have been codified in a single glossary This glossary is presented as the last appendix to the volume Volume II Volume II of this set A User s Guide to Federal Financial Accounting Standards is a codification of the standards Volume II presents the standards alphabetized by topic pulls together all references to a particular topic in one section and integrates illustrative material from both the SFFASs and the original Exposures Drafts wherever possible Applicability The mission of FASAB is to recommend accounting concepts and standards that result in federal agencies financial reports including understandable relevant and reliable information about the financial position activities and results of operations of the United States government and its component units In addition the standards should foster the improvement of accounting systems and internal controls that will help provide reasonable assurance to users that government activities have been conducted economically efficiently and effectively and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations Therefore FASAB believes that federal financial accounting concepts and standards should be considered in establishing systems and in maintaining day to day financial records as well as being applied to general purpose financial reports of U S Government reporting entities This belief is consistent with the requirements of the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 which states that each agency shall implement and maintain financial management systems that comply substantially with Federal financial management systems requirements applicable Federal accounting standards and the United States Government Standard General Ledger at the transaction level 3 The specific applicability of the standards to components of the Federal government was considered during the development of Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Concepts No 2 SFFAC No 2 Entity and Display SFFAC No 2 lists criteria for including components in Federal reporting entities see pp 75 77 and provides the following guidance with regard to components required by law or policy to issue financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting standards other than those constituting Federal GAAP For example some components are required to apply accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or a regulatory agency Those components should continue to apply the standards required by law or policy for their financial statements The reporting entities of which the components are a part however need to be sensitive to differences that may arise from the different accounting standards If these differences are material the standards constituting Federal GAAP should be applied for purposes of including the components in entity wide statements In such cases the components may need to provide additional disclosures or different measurements required to comply with Federal GAAP The standards need not be applied to immaterial items Hierarchy of Federal Generally Accepted Accounting Principles The hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles4 GAAP governs what constitutes GAAP for all U S government reporting entities OMB publishes the hierarchy in its bulletin entitled Form and Content of Agency Financial Statements It lists the priority sequence of sources that an entity should look to for accounting and reporting guidance 3Title VIII Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 Sec 803 a 4 Accounting principles are those conventions rules and procedures necessary to define acceptable accounting practice at a particular time In 1996 through the joint efforts of the Treasury OMB and GAO a body of generally accepted accounting principles GAAP covering most transactions was promulgated for the Federal government However agencies may engage in transactions that are not addressed by these standards In that event agencies should view the hierarchy as providing sources of GAAP for the Federal Government While many of the standards comprising Federal GAAP have already been made effective three of those standards will not be effective until fiscal year 1998 The following hierarchy5 determines GAAP for U S government reporting entities beginning in fiscal year 1998 1 Individual standards agreed to by the Director of OMB the Comptroller General and the Secretary of the Treasury and published by OMB and the General Accounting Office 2 Interpretations related to the SFFASs issued by OMB in accordance with the procedures outlined in OMB Circular A 134 Financial Accounting Principles and Standards 3 Requirements contained in OMB s Form and Content Bulletin in effect for the period covered by the financial statements 4 Accounting principles published by authoritative standard setting bodies and other authoritative sources a in the absence of other guidance in the first three parts of this hierarchy and b if the use of such accounting principles improves the meaningfulness of the financial statements The above hierarchy may be implemented earlier than fiscal year 1998 with approval from OMB Until the above hierarchy is effective U S government reporting entities will continue to follow the hierarchy established6 for an Other Comprehensive Basis of Accounting OCBOA and presented below 1 Individual statements agreed to and published by the JFMIP principals 2 Form and content requirements included in OMB Bulletin 93 02 dated October 22 1992 and subsequent issuances 3 Accounting standards contained in agency accounting policy procedures manuals and or related guidance as of March 29 1991 so long as they are 5The hierarchy was published in OMB Bulletin 97 01 dated October 16 1996 6The hierarchy was published in OMB Bulletin 94 01 dated November 16 1993 prevalent practices 4 Accounting principles published by authoritative standard setting bodies and other authoritative sources 1 in the absence of other guidance in the first three parts of this hierarchy and 2 if the use of such accounting standards improve the meaningfulness of the financial statements Source for Interpretations OMB Circular A 134 describes the policies for seeking and providing interpretations and other advice related to the standards An interpretation is a document of narrow scope that provides clarifications of original meaning additional definitions or other guidance pertaining to an existing SFFAS Requests for interpretations should be directed to OMB s Office of Federal Financial Management or to the Executive Director FASAB OMB and FASAB will respond to the request for guidance by providing technical assistance unless they determine that the response should be an Interpretation In that event FASAB staff will provide written copies of the request to the Board members FASAB staff will examine as appropriate applicable literature and consult with knowledgeable persons and draft an Interpretation of Federal Financial Accounting Standards FASAB will consider the draft interpretation at an open meeting After a majority agrees and the representatives of the three principals Treasury GAO and OMB approve and sign the interpretation the interpretation will be published by OMB and GAO Organization of the Codification Volume I presents the text of the original statements as described above Each statement is presented as a separate chapter The issue date and effective date of each statement are presented first Next references to relevant sections within Volume I and to Volume II are provided Any interpretations that relate to the statements are also identified In some cases the statements have been affected by later statements or affect earlier statements References direct the reader to the affected paragraphs and indicate the source of the change Within the text of the statements provisions deleted as a result of other statements are marked with strikeouts and provisions affected by other statements are doubleunderlined Double underlined text remains as originally published The double underlining is intended to alert the reader to the fact that it has been modified or affected by a later statement A brief summary of the statement is presented A table of contents referenced to both page and paragraph numbers follows the summary Note that the paragraph numbers are those originally expressed in the individual statements despite the omission of some paragraphs Any omitted paragraphs are indicated in the table of contents Volume I also presents the following appendices Volume II is under development at this time and will be organized alphabetically by topic Topics will be specific financial statement items Each topical section will be identified by an alpha numeric code for example P10 for Pensions with numbers selected to allow addition of future topics Paragraphs within each section will be numbered consecutively The following numeric format has been proposed Paragraphs 100 599 Standards and Potential Note Disclosures Paragraphs 600 699 Interpretations Published by OMB Paragraphs 700 799 Nonauthoritative Discussion Illustrations Source references will be provided in paragraphs 100 599 to indicate the original statement from which material was drawn The references will appear in brackets at the end of each paragraph or illustration For example the reference SFFAS 7 para 81 refers to Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards No 7 Accounting for Revenue and Other Financing Sources and Concepts for Reconciling Budgetary and Financial Accounting paragraph 81 Source references will be provided in the nonauthoritative paragraphs as footnotes to permit more descriptive identification of the sources Volume II will present the following appendices and may present others Topical Index FASAB Active and Future Projects Topics Not Yet Addressed Consolidated Glossary TABLE OF CONTENTS Page TRANSACTIONS WITH THE PUBLIC Nonexchange transactions with the public 242 Individual income taxes corporation income taxes social insurance taxes and contributions 37 excise taxes estate and gift taxes and customs duties Taxes including customs duties are levied through the exercise of the power of the Government to compel payment In broad terms taxes are the price we pay for civilization More specifically they finance spending of many types to promote the general welfare provide for the common defense and ensure domestic tranquillity national defense a judicial system aid to the elderly construction of infrastructure education and training and so forth The relationship between the tax paid and the value received is too indirect and disproportionate to relate the revenue that is received from any identifiable taxpayer to the cost that is incurred for providing that identifiable taxpayer with benefits This is especially the case where the benefits are of a collective or public nature such as national defense in which case consumption by one taxpayer does not reduce the consumption available for another or where the benefits are designed to redistribute income from one group of people to another Therefore tax revenue is nonexchange revenue 243 All excise taxes like other taxes are classified as resulting in nonexchange revenue Some excise taxes considered to be benefit taxes are levied on bases that are related to the use of publicly provided goods and services or the public provision of other benefits such as the gasoline tax certain other excise taxes are levied on bases related to a cause of some damage and are dedicated to pay down costs such as the tax on domestically mined coal which is dedicated to the black lung disability trust fund Even in these cases however the relationship between the tax and the benefit received by an identifiable recipient is relatively indirect and disproportionate Moreover these excise taxes like other taxes are determined through the exercise of the power of the Government to compel payment Therefore like other taxes they are classified as producing nonexchange revenue 244 Board members have differing views on whether social insurance programs result in exchange or nonexchange transactions 38 However they agree that social insurance tax revenue should be reported in the same way as other tax revenue for the purposes of financial reporting This is because social insurance taxes like other taxes are determined through the exercise of the power of the Government to compel payment Furthermore individuals and businesses subject to social insurance taxes are subject to them as a byproduct of their decision to enter covered employment or engage in a covered business so especially for the major broad based social insurance programs Social Security Medicare hospital insurance and unemployment 37 Social insurance does not include programs established solely or primarily for Federal employees such as pension and other retirement plans Social insurance taxes and contributions do however include payments made by or on behalf of Federal employees to social insurance plans such as Social Security and Medicare 38See discussion of social insurance programs in FASAB Exposure Draft Supplementary Stewardship Reporting August 1995 compensation they have virtually no legal option except to pay 245 Tax receipts are generally collected from the public by the IRS Internal Revenue Service and to a lesser extent by the Customs Service and other entities acting as agents for the recipient entities rather than on their own behalf The collecting entity receives the cash and then transfers it to the General Fund trust fund or special fund on whose behalf it was collected The amount so collected should be accounted for as a custodial activity by the collecting entity The tax is recognized as a nonexchange revenue by the entity that is legally entitled to the amount This would be a trust fund or special fund in the case of an earmarked i e dedicated tax If collected on behalf of the Government as a whole it would be recognized in the Government wide consolidated financial statements 246 Social insurance taxes and contributions paid by Federal employees 39 Federal employees may be covered by social insurance programs such as Social Security40 and Medicare under the same terms and conditions as the remainder of the covered population The payments made by Federal employees are in the nature of taxes compulsory payments demanded by the Government through the exercise of its power to compel payment Insofar as the social insurance program applies to employees of the United States government the terms and conditions are generally the same as the program for private employees The employer and employee contributions are generally calculated in the same way the employee contribution is not earned by the social insurance program and the benefits are generally calculated in the same way The employee does not obtain particular benefits under the plan from rendering service in Federal employment because he or she would have been similarly covered by the program if privately employed and would have obtained similar benefits For these reasons the employee contribution should have the same classification as contributions by non Federal employees which is nonexchange revenue 247 Deposits by states for unemployment trust fund States deposit the receipts from the state unemployment tax to the U S Treasury for the unemployment trust fund in order to finance most of the benefits under the unemployment compensation system The state unemployment tax differs from state to state in terms of the tax rate tax base and certain other characteristics and unemployment benefits also differ from state to state Nevertheless the deposit has long been construed as a Federal budget receipt a governmental receipt and the unemployment trust fund has long been included as an account in the Federal budget 248 This is for a combination of reasons taken together a the unemployment compensation system including the system of taxes the system of benefits and the trust fund was established by the Social Security Act of 1935 and has been amended by Federal law many times b deposits are held in a trust fund operated by the U S Government c Federal law specifies extensive requirements for the state unemployment tax and unemployment benefits d the Federal unemployment tax finances grants to states to cover their entire cost of administering the unemployment 39 Social insurance does not include programs established solely or primarily for Federal employees such as pension and other retirement plans 40 Most Federal civilian employees hired before 1984 are not covered by Social Security system and e Federal law effectively coerces states to participate in the system with participation requiring them to levy the state unemployment tax and deposit the collections in the U S Treasury If a state does not participate or is not certified by the Department of Labor as meeting Federal requirements i the Federal unemployment tax is levied within the state at its maximum rate ii the system does not pay any unemployment compensation benefits within the state and iii the Federal Government provides no grants to state governments to pay for the costs of administration The deposits of the state tax are therefore nonexchange revenue of the unemployment trust fund The Federal unemployment tax is levied and collected separately from the state unemployment tax 249 User fees Harbor Maintenance trust fund This is an example of a tax that is termed a user fee by law while classified in the budget as a governmental receipt together with other taxes and duties It is an ad valorem tax of 0 125 percent imposed on commercial cargo loaded and unloaded at specified U S ports open to public navigation The receipt is earmarked to the Harbor Maintenance trust fund It is similar in nature to other excise taxes that result from the Government s power to compel payment and that are dedicated to a trust fund or special fund to be spent for a designated purpose for example the gasoline excise tax which is dedicated to the Highway Trust Fund It therefore should be recognized as nonexchange revenue by the Harbor Maintenance trust fund 250 Customs Service fees The Customs Service collects revenue primarily from duties on imported merchandise but also from two types of fees the merchandise processing fee and a group of fees called user fees 251 The merchandise processing fee is primarily an ad valorem charge on formal merchandise entries into the United States at 0 19 percent subject to a maximum and minimum charge It also includes flat fees on informally entered goods The collections are earmarked by law to a special fund from which receipts are made available to finance Customs Service operations to the extent provided by current appropriations 252 The merchandise processing fee is associated with the cost of the Customs Service s operations The fee as originally enacted was modified by the Customs and Trade Act of 1990 to make it consistent with U S obligations under GATT the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade after a GATT panel had ruled that the original fee a straight ad valorem fee exceeded the cost of services rendered and was a tax on imports that discriminated against imports in favor of domestic production The maximum and minimum fees and the flat fees were enacted to meet the U S obligation 253 However the associated cost is primarily some of the costs of assessing and collecting duties on imported merchandise such as the salaries of import specialists who classify merchandise and the costs of processing paperwork The importer pays duties that are required by law it does not receive anything of value from the Government in the nature of an exchange Furthermore these costs are not likely to depend significantly on the value of the merchandise and the fee is levied through the power of the Government to compel payment Therefore for the purpose of a classification system for financial reporting the fee is akin to dedicated taxes that are also related in the aggregate to associated costs and that are classified as nonexchange revenue e g the excise tax on gasoline The merchandise processing fee is therefore classified as a nonexchange revenue 254 The user fees consist of a group of flat fees charged on passengers and conveyances entering the country 41 The collections are dedicated by law to a special fund whose receipts are made available by permanent indefinite appropriation to finance Customs Service operations 255 These fees are intended to offset certain inspection costs that relate to the processing of passengers and conveyances entering the country They are levied through the power of the Government to compel payment and the person or entity that pays these fees does not receive anything of value from the Government in exchange The inspection activities are for a variety of purposes to ensure that dutiable merchandise is declared to seize contraband such as narcotics and illegal drugs to detect infringements of patent and copyright laws and so forth Some of these purposes are related to the Government s powers to raise taxes which are nonexchange revenue and to enforce laws Only to a limited extent are they like regulatory user fees based on the Government s power to regulate particular businesses or activities Therefore like the merchandise processing fee the user fees are classified as nonexchange revenue 256 Deposits of earnings Federal Reserve System The Federal Reserve System consists of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks Under Federal accounting concepts it is not considered to be part of the Government wide reporting entity Therefore payments made to or collections received from the Federal Reserve System would be reported in the financial statements of the Federal Government and its component reporting entities 42 The Federal Reserve earns large amounts of interest on its portfolio of Treasury securities and deposits to the Treasury all net income after deducting dividends and the amount necessary to bring the surplus of the Federal Reserve Banks to the level of capital paid in 257 The Federal Reserve was established by Act of Congress pursuant to the Government s sovereign power over the nation s money and its investment in Treasury securities is necessary for carrying out its monetary function It does not receive anything of value from the Government in exchange for its deposit of earnings and on occasion it has been required by law to make extra payments The revenue from the deposits is therefore nonexchange 258 Donations except types of property plant and equipment that are expensed Donations are contributions to the Government i e voluntary gifts of resources to a Government entity by a non Federal entity 43 The Government does not give anything of value to the donor and the donor receives only personal satisfaction The donation 41These fees are sometimes called the COBRA user fees This term comes from the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 which established these fees 42SFFAC No 2 Entity and Display para 47 43 The term donations includes wills disposing of property and judicial proceedings other than forfeitures of cash other financial resources or nonfinancial resources except stewardship property plant and equipment is therefore a nonexchange revenue 259 The exception stewardship PP E consists of Federal mission PP E heritage assets and stewardship land Such PP E is expensed if purchased but no amount is recognized if it is received as a donation 44 Correspondingly no revenue is recognized for such donations 260 Fines and penalties Fines and penalties are monetary requirements imposed on those who violate laws or administrative rules The person or other entity that pays a fine or penalty does not receive anything of value in exchange nor does the Government sacrifice anything of value The Government collects these amounts through the exercise of its power to compel payment Fines and penalties are therefore a nonexchange revenue 261 Fines from judicial proceedings are collected by the entity acting as an agent for the Government as a whole rather than on its own behalf They are therefore accounted for as a custodial activity of the collecting entity and recognized as a nonexchange revenue in the Government wide consolidated financial statements 262 Fines and penalties produced by an entity s operations such as inspections to ensure compliance with Federal law and with regulations that are the responsibility of the entity e g inspections by the Office of Surface Mining or compliance with regulations for the conduct of a Federal program are recognized as nonexchange revenue by whichever entity is legally entitled by law to the revenue In some cases but not all this would be the collecting entity If the collecting entity transfers the nonexchange revenue to the General Fund or another entity the amount is accounted for as a custodial activity by the collecting entity If transferred to the General Fund the penalties are recognized as nonexchange revenue in the Government wide consolidated financial statements if transferred to another entity they are recognized as nonexchange revenue by the entity that receives the transfer 263 Penalties due to delinquent taxes in connection with custodial activity The person or other private entity that pays a penalty on delinquent taxes does not receive anything in exchange nor does the Government sacrifice anything of value The Government collects these amounts through its power to compel payment Penalties on delinquent taxes are therefore a nonexchange revenue The penalties are accounted for as a custodial activity If transferred to the General Fund the penalties are recognized as nonexchange revenue in the Government wide consolidated financial statements if transferred to another entity they are recognized as nonexchange revenue by the entity that receives the transfer 264 Forfeitures Property may be seized as a consequence of various laws and regulations and forfeited to the Government Forfeited property may be acquired through forfeiture proceedings be acquired to satisfy a tax liability or consist of unclaimed and abandoned merchandise Forfeited property is principally managed by the Asset Forfeiture Fund of the Justice Department and the Treasury Forfeiture Fund of the Treasury Department Revenue is recognized from forfeited property unless the property is distributed to state or local law enforcement agencies or foreign 44SFFAS No 6 Accounting for Property Plant and Equipment para 61 and 71 governments or is received in satisfaction of a previously recognized revenue e g accrued tax receivables 45 265 The timing of revenue recognition depends on how the property is forfeited and the nature of the property In the case of unclaimed and abandoned merchandise revenue is recognized in the amount of the sales proceeds at the time the property is sold In the case of property acquired through forfeiture proceedings the timing of recognition depends on the nature and disposition of the property For monetary instruments the revenue is recognized at the time of obtaining forfeiture judgment for property that is sold at the time of sale and for property that is held for internal use or transferred to another Federal agency at the time of obtaining approval to use the property internally or transfer it 46 266 The method of measuring revenue depends on the nature of the property The amount of revenue recognized for monetary instruments is the market value when the forfeiture judgment is obtained For property that is sold it is the sales proceeds For property that is held for internal use or transferred to another Federal agency it is the fair value of the property less a valuation allowance for any liens or third party claims 267 The revenue from forfeiture is nonexchange revenue because the Government seizes the property through the exercise of its power The Government does not sacrifice anything of value in exchange and the entity that forfeits the property does not receive anything of value More than half of the forfeiture revenue of the two funds mentioned above is from currency and other monetary instruments Although other types of forfeited property must be sold in order to recognize revenue or constructively sold if transferred to another Federal agency or placed into internal use this is the last step in a process that is inherently nonexchange 268 The disposition of the revenue from forfeiture is determined by law Revenue or the property itself may ultimately be distributed to the seizing entity state or local law enforcement agencies foreign governments or the general fund Revenue is recognized as nonexchange revenue by the entity that is legally entitled to use the revenue or to use the property itself If the property is distributed to a state or local law enforcement agency or a foreign government revenue is not recognized by a Federal Government reporting entity If the revenue is transferred to the General Fund it is recognized as nonexchange revenue in the Government wide consolidated financial statements 269 Some entities may be involved in the management and liquidation of forfeited property but not themselves be entitled to the revenue or to the use of the property For example a central fund created to support the seizure activities of multiple entities 45This amends SFFAS No 3 Accounting for Inventory and Related Property with respect to forfeitures related to satisfying tax liabilities 46 SFFAS No 3 para 57 78 The standard also requires deferred revenue to be recognized when a forfeiture judgment is obtained but the deferred revenue is reversed when revenue is recognized The amount of revenue ordinarily differs from the amount of deferred revenue In some cases an adjustment subsequent to the original forfeiture judgment may be necessary when it is later determined that a portion of the forfeiture is to be distributed to state or local law enforcement agencies or foreign governments may manage forfeited property and the collection and disposition of the revenue from that property These entities should account for the property as a custodial activity Revenue is shown when it is recognized and it is shown as transferred to others when the cash is disbursed or the property is delivered The disposition of property to an entity outside the Federal Government is also accounted for Exchange transactions with the public revenue 270 Sales of goods and services The cost of production for goods and services such as electricity mail delivery and maps is defrayed in whole or in part by revenue from selling the goods or services provided The sales may be made by a public enterprise revolving fund such as the Bonneville Power Administration an intragovernmental revolving fund such as the Government Printing Office or a fund that is not a revolving fund such as the Geological Survey Each party receives and sacrifices something of value The sale is therefore an exchange transaction and the revenue is exchange revenue for the entity making the sale 271 Sales of goods and services in undercover operations The cost of the Government s undercover operations is defrayed in whole or in part from the proceeds of sales of goods that have been purchased as opposed to goods that have been forfeited Each party receives and sacrifices something of value These characteristics of the transaction are not affected by whether the sale is illegal The sale is therefore an exchange transactions and the revenue is exchange revenue of the entity making the sale 272 Interest unless classified elsewhere dividends and rents except for mineral rights on Government property Each party receives and sacrifices something of value so the inflow of resources is an exchange transaction 273 Interest is classified as exchange revenue notwithstanding the fact that the entity may not be charged a cost of capital for the assets that yield these inflows or if the entity borrowed from Treasury to acquire the assets it may have been charged a below market interest rate The gross cost of the entity is understated in such cases and to recognize an exchange revenue is to recognize a revenue without some or all of the related costs and hence to understate the entity s net cost of operations Nevertheless in some cases the entity does pay the Treasury at least some interest and the Government s cost of borrowing to acquire the assets is recognized as a cost of the Government as a whole Since some cost is recognized even if not always the full cost of the entity 47 an exchange revenue is recognized for the entity that receives the inflow of interest 274 Rents royalties and bonuses on Outer Continental Shelf OCS and other petroleum and mineral rights Rents royalties and bonuses are exchange revenues because each party receives and sacrifices something of value The amounts are earned by sales in the market and therefore are exchange revenue They are collected by the Minerals Management Service MMS of the Department of the Interior which 47 The partial recognition of associated cost distinguishes interest from rents royalties and bonuses on the Outer Continental Shelf and the auction of the radio spectrum For the latter transactions see the subsequent paragraphs manages the energy and minerals resources on the OCS and collects the amounts due the Government and Indian tribes from minerals produced on the OCS and other Federal and Indian lands 275 MMS does not recognize a depletion cost for various reasons including the fact that under present accounting standards natural resources are not recognized as an asset and depletion is not recognized as a cost As a result this exchange revenue bears little relationship to the recognized cost of MMS and cannot be matched against its gross cost of operations Therefore although the inflows are exchange revenue they should not be subtracted from MMS s gross cost in determining its net cost of operations 276 MMS should instead account for the exchange revenue as a custodial activity MMS collects rents royalties and bonuses acting as an agent on behalf of the recipients designated by law the General Fund certain entities within the Government to which amounts are earmarked the states and Indian tribes and allottees The amounts of revenue should be recognized and measured under the exchange revenue standards when they are due pursuant to the contractual agreement 277 The rents royalties and bonuses transferred to Treasury for the General Fund or to other Government reporting entities should be recognized by them as exchange revenue However neither the Government as a whole nor the other recipient entities recognize the natural resources as an asset and depletion as a cost Therefore this exchange revenue should not offset their gross cost in determining their net cost of operations It should instead be a financing source in determining their operating results and change in net position 278 Proceeds from the auction of the radio spectrum The proceeds from auctioning the right to use the radio spectrum are exchange revenues because each party receives and sacrifices something of value The amount of revenue is earned by sales in the market at auctions It bears little relationship to the costs recognized by the Federal Communications Commission FCC which collects the revenue or to the costs recognized by the U S Government as a whole Therefore it should not be offset against the costs of the FCC in determining its net cost of operations or against the costs of the Government as a whole in Government wide consolidated financial statements 279 The FCC should therefore account for this exchange revenue as a custodial activity acting as an agent on behalf of the General Fund and it should be included as exchange revenue in the Government wide consolidated financial statements 280 Interest on post 199148 direct loans 49 Interest on direct loans is an exchange transaction because it is part of a broader exchange transaction in which the entity makes a loan to the borrower and the entity and borrower each receives and sacrifices something of value Interest on direct loans that are budgeted according to the provisions of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 consists of two components the nominal interest the stated interest rate times the nominal principal and the amortized interest change in present value of the loans receivable due to the passage of time The combined effect of these components equals the effective interest which is directly defined as the present value of the loans receivable times the Treasury interest rate applicable to the particular loans i e the interest rate used to calculate the present value of the direct loans when the direct loans were disbursed The effective interest causes an equal increase in the aggregate value of the assets on the balance sheet and therefore the effective interest is the amount recognized as exchange 50 revenue 281 Interest on delinquent taxes and other receivables that arise as the result of custodial operations Receivables that arise as the result of custodial operations are custodial or non entity assets held by the IRS or another entity as an agent for the Government as a whole rather than on its own behalf e g IRS tax receivables on which the delinquent taxpayer must pay interest The interest is an exchange revenue because each party receives and sacrifices something of value but it is not related to the costs incurred by the collecting entity The interest is accounted for as a custodial activity by the collecting entity If transferred to the General Fund the interest is recognized as exchange revenue in the Government wide consolidated financial statements because it is related to the government s cost of borrowing if transferred to another entity it is recognized as nonexchange revenue by the entity that receives the transfer 282 Regulatory user fees such as patent and copyright fees immigration and consular fees SEC registration and filing fees and Nuclear Regulatory Commission fees Regulatory user fees are charges based on the Government s power to regulate particular businesses or activities The revenue is related to the cost in one of two ways Special benefits may be provided to identifiable recipients who pay the fees beyond the benefits if any that accrue to the general public e g passport fees or the Government may incur costs in order to regulate an identifiable entity for the benefit of the general public or some other group in which case the user charge compensates the Government for its regulatory costs that were caused by the activity of the party that pays the charge e g SEC and Nuclear Regulatory Commission fees 48 Post 1991 direct loans consist of direct loans that were obligated after September 30 1991 whereas pre 1992 direct loans consist of direct loans that were obligated before October 1 1991 The same accounting that is used for post 1991 direct loans is also used for pre 1992 direct loans that were modified and transferred to financing accounts loans receivable arising from defaulted post 1991 guaranteed loans and loans receivable arising from defaulted pre 1992 guaranteed loans that were modified and transferred to financing accounts 49 For interest on pre 1992 direct loans see the preceding section on interest unless classified elsewhere 50See SFFAS No 2 Accounting for Direct Loans and Loan Guarantees paragraphs 30 31 and 37 for an illustrative case study also see Appendix B Because in general the revenue is closely related to the cost of operations these fees are classified as exchange transactions and the revenue is an exchange revenue of the entity that charges the fee 283 Diversion fees Department of Justice Registrants in the Diversion Control Program e g physicians pay fees to the Drug Enforcement Administration in exchange for which the DEA provides the registrants with the authority to prescribe controlled substances The diversion fees are intended to cover the costs of the Diversion Control Program Because the revenue is related to the cost and the registrants both receive and sacrifice value the payment of these fees is an exchange revenue of the Diversion Control Program 284 Premiums for SMI Supplementary Medical Insurance bank deposit insurance pension benefit guarantees crop insurance life insurance and other insurance In exchange for a premium and other considerations the Government promises to make payments to program participants if specified events occur The premium offsets the cost of the program in whole or in part The degree to which participation is voluntary differs from program to program Because the revenue is related to the cost of the providing service it is an exchange revenue of the insurance program 285 Federal employee contributions to pension and other retirement benefit plans 51 Employees of the Federal Government provide service to their employer in exchange for compensation of which some is received currently the salary and some is deferred pensions retirement health benefits and other retirement benefits This is an exchange transaction because each party sacrifices value and receives value in return As part of this exchange transaction the Government promises a pension to its employees after they retire The Government also promises other retirement benefits notably health benefits In return the employee provides services and under some plans makes a contribution to the retirement fund out of his or her salary The financing of these benefits may include contributions paid by the employee to the retirement fund 286 In broad terms the employee contribution is an inflow of resources to the retirement fund as part of this exchange transaction More narrowly it is a payment by the employee as part of an exchange of money and services for a future pension or other retirement benefit Therefore it is an exchange revenue of the entity that administers the retirement plan and thus is an offset to that entity s gross cost in calculating its net cost of operations 52 51Federal employee retirement plans do not include social insurance such as Social Security and Medicare 52For further discussion of the accounting standards for pensions and other retirement benefits of Federal employees see SFFAS No 5 Accounting for Liabilities of the Federal Government para 56 93 and 148 181 The standards do not cover accounting for the plan per se as distinct from the administering entity Nor do they cover defined contribution plans or administrative entities that are not Federal reporting entities 287 Federal employee contributions to health benefits plan for current coverage Employees of the Federal Government provide services to their employer in exchange for compensation of which some is received currently in the form of money the salary some is received currently in the form of payments to a third party the employer entity contribution to the medical insurance plan for current coverage of its employees and some is deferred pensions and other retirement benefits This is an exchange transaction because each party sacrifices value and receives value in return As part of this exchange transaction the Government and its employees both contribute to a medical insurance plan that provides current coverage of the employees 288 In broad terms the employee contribution out of his or her salary is an inflow of resources to the health benefits plan as part of this exchange transaction More narrowly it is a payment in exchange for current coverage by a health benefits plan Therefore it is an exchange revenue of the entity that administers the health benefits plan and thus is an offset to that entity s gross cost in calculating its net cost of operations 289 Reimbursement for collecting revenue The Customs Service collects duties on goods imported by Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands The Customs Service retains an amount equal to the estimated cost of collecting these duties including all costs of operations in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and an allocation of overhead it transfers the remainder to the Treasury which in turn transfers the collections to Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands 290 The total amount of duties collected on these goods should be accounted for as a custodial activity by the Customs Service Notwithstanding that duties are a nonexchange revenue these particular duties are a nonexchange revenue of an entity other than the United States and therefore are not recognized as a nonexchange revenue of the U S Government 291 The method of disposing of these collections combines two distinct transactions into one The entire amount of the duties could be transferred to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and these governments could then pay the Customs Service to reimburse it for its services of collecting duties The payment to Customs would be exchange revenue of the Customs Service The actual procedure for reimbursement whereby Customs retains an amount equal to the estimated cost is simpler but equivalent in substance Hence the custodial transfer to Treasury for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and the amount retained by Customs should be shown as separate components of the disposition of the revenue from customs duties The amount retained by Customs to reimburse itself for its costs is exchange revenue of the Customs Service and is offset against its gross cost in calculating its net cost of operations 292 Reimbursement for cleanup costs The Coast Guard or other Federal entities may incur costs to clean up environmental hazards caused by private parties and in some cases require these private parties to reimburse it for the costs incurred Notwithstanding that the Government demands the revenue under its power to compel payment the revenue arises from the action of the private parties and is closely related to the cost of operations incurred as a result of that action Therefore the revenue is an exchange revenue of the entity that incurs the cost Exchange transactions with the public gains and losses 293 Note As explained in the introduction to this appendix transactions that are classified as producing gains or losses should instead be classified as producing revenue or expense if they are usual and recurring for a particular reporting entity 294 Sales of Government assets other than property plant and equipment and forfeited and foreclosed property The sale of Government assets other than property plant and equipment and forfeited and foreclosed property is an exchange transaction because each party receives and sacrifices something of value If the sales price equals book value there is no gain or loss because a cash inflow equal to book value is the exchange of one asset for another of equal recorded value and therefore not a net inflow of resources If the sales price is more or less than the book value of the property a gain or loss respectively is recognized to the extent of the difference The amount of the difference between sales price and book value is ordinarily a gain or loss rather than a revenue or expense because sales of property are ordinarily an unusual or nonrecurring inflow of resources 295 Sales of property plant and equipment The transaction is an exchange transaction because each party receives and sacrifices something of value If the sales price53 equals book value there is no gain or loss because a cash inflow equal to book value is the exchange of one asset for another of equal recorded value and therefore not a net inflow of resources If the sales price is more or less than book value a gain or loss respectively is recognized to the extent of the difference The amount of the difference is ordinarily a gain or loss rather than a revenue or an expense because sales of property plant and equipment are ordinarily an unusual or nonrecurring inflow of resources 296 The entire sales price is a gain if the book value of the asset is zero The book value is zero a if the asset is general property plant and equipment PP E that is fully depreciated or written off or b if the asset is stewardship PP E for which the entire cost is expensed when the asset is purchased 54 297 Acquisition of property plant and equipment through exchange The cost of property plant and equipment PP E acquired through an exchange of assets with the public is the fair value of the PP E surrendered at the time of exchange If the fair value of the PP E acquired is more readily determinable than that of the PP E surrendered the cost is the fair value of the PP E acquired If neither fair value is determinable the cost of the PP E acquired is the cost recorded for the PP E surrendered net of any accumulated depreciation or amortization In the event that cash consideration is included in the exchange the cost of PP E acquired is increased or 53 The sales price may include the fair value of items received in exchange 54SFFAS No 6 Accounting for Property Plant and Equipment has divided property plant and equipment PP E into two basic categories general PP E and stewardship PP E which consists of federal mission PP E heritage assets and stewardship land General PP E is capitalized and recognized on the balance sheet stewardship PP E is expensed and thus has no book value Stewardship PP E is presented in a stewardship statement decreased by the amount of the cash surrendered or received 298 Any difference between the cost of the PP E acquired and the book value of the PP E surrendered is recognized as a gain or loss 55 It is a gain or loss rather than a revenue or expense because ordinarily the amount would be an unusual or nonrecurring inflow of resources 299 If the fair value of the PP E acquired is less than the fair value of the PP E surrendered the PP E acquired is recognized at its cost and subsequently reduced to its fair value The difference between the cost of the PP E acquired and its fair value is recognized as a loss 56 300 Sales of foreclosed property associated with pre 1992 direct loans and loan guarantees Foreclosed property associated with pre 1992 direct loans and loan guarantees is recognized as an asset at net realizable value The sale is an exchange transaction and any difference between the sales proceeds and book value is recognized as a gain or loss 57 301 Sales of receivables except direct loans The transaction is an exchange transaction because each party receives and sacrifices something of value Upon sale any difference between the sales proceeds and book value is recognized as a gain or loss If the sales price equals book value there is no gain or loss because the exchange of one asset for another of equal value is not a net inflow of resources 302 Sales of direct loans The sale of a direct loan is a modification according to the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 regardless of whether the loan being sold was obligated after FY 1991 or before FY 1992 The book value loss or gain on a sale of direct loans equals the book value of the loans sold prior to sale minus the net proceeds of the sale It normally differs from the cost of modification which is recognized as an expense 58 Any difference between the book value loss or gain and the cost of modification is recognized as a gain or loss 59 303 Retirement of debt securities prior to maturity Debt securities may be retired prior to maturity if they have a call feature or if they are eligible for redemption by the holder on demand Many Treasury bonds issued before 1985 are callable savings bonds the Government account series the foreign series and the state and local series 55See SFFAS No 6 Accounting for Property Plant and Equipment para 32 56Ibid footnote 38 57See SFFAS No 3 Accounting for Inventory and Related Property para 79 91 58 This difference is due to the different interest rates used to discount future cash flows for calculating the subsidy cost and subsidy allowance when the loan is made and for calculating the cost of modification at a later time If the sale is with recourse the present value of the estimated loss from the recourse is also recognized as an expense 59See SFFAS No 2 Accounting for Direct Loans and Loan Guarantees para 53 55 and Appendix B Part II B of Treasury securities are redeemable on demand although sometimes with a penalty or other adjustment or only after a specified period of time 304 Each party receives and sacrifices something of value in buying and selling debt securities that may be retired prior to maturity The sales price reflects such features Therefore the transaction is an exchange transaction The difference if any between the reacquisition price and the net carrying value of the extinguished debt is recognized as a loss or gain 60 Other financing sources from the public 305 Seigniorage Seigniorage is the face value of newly minted coins less the cost of production which includes the cost of the metal manufacturing and transportation It results from the sovereign power of the Government to directly create money and although not an inflow of resources from the public does increase the Government s net position in the same manner as an inflow of resources Because it is not demanded earned or donated it is an other financing source rather than revenue It should be recognized as an other financing source when coins are delivered to the Federal Reserve Banks in return for deposits INTRAGOVERNMENTAL TRANSACTIONS Nonexchange transactions intragovernmental revenue 306 Interest on Treasury securities held by trust funds and special funds except trust revolving funds Many trust funds and special funds hold Treasury securities on which they receive interest In most cases the invested balances of these funds derive predominantly from the funds earmarked taxes which are nonexchange transactions with the public e g employment taxes and gasoline taxes and to a lesser extent from other financing sources received from other government entities e g the General Fund payment appropriated to the Supplementary Medical Insurance fund The balances are not earned in exchange transactions by the entity s operations Most fundamentally they are not produced by operations in which the entity incurs a cost 307 Therefore in such cases the interest on Treasury securities should not be deducted from the gross costs of the trust fund or special fund or the organization in which it is administered in determining its net cost of operations As a result that interest should not be classified as exchange revenue It should instead have the same classification as the predominant source of the invested balances which for most trust funds and special funds is nonexchange revenue The interest received from invested balances of trust funds and special funds except trust revolving funds is therefore normally a nonexchange revenue 308 The source of balances for some trust funds and special funds may not be predominantly nonexchange revenue For example the main source of balances for two major trust funds the Civil Service Retirement and Disability fund and the Military 60SFFAS No 5 Accounting for Liabilities of the Federal Government para 54 Retirement fund consists of exchange revenue and other financing sources In such exceptional cases as explained in the Basis for Conclusions the interest should be classified in the same way as the predominant source of balances in these cases as exchange revenue rather than according to the normal rule 309 Interest received by one fund from another One fund within the Government may borrow from another For example in 1983 the Old Age and Survivors Insurance trust fund borrowed from the Disability Insurance and Hospital Insurance trust funds When that occurs the lending fund sacrifices interest from Treasury securities on its invested balances and instead receives interest from the borrowing fund on the amount of the loan Since the predominant source of balances to the lending fund is the same regardless of whether it invests in Treasury securities or lends to another fund the interest received from the other fund should be classified in the same way as nonexchange or exchange revenue as the interest received on Treasury securities 310 Employer entity contributions to social insurance programs 61 Federal employees may be covered by social insurance programs such as Social Security62 and Medicare under the same terms and conditions as the rest of the covered population Intragovernmental contributions to social insurance programs such as Social Security and Medicare are nonexchange transactions just as payments made by private employers to these programs are nonexchange transactions Contributions by private employers are in the nature of taxes i e compulsory payments demanded by the Government through the exercise of its power to compel payment Insofar as the social insurance program applies to Federal employees the terms and conditions are generally the same as the program for private employees The employer and employee contributions are generally calculated in the same way the employer entity contribution is not earned by the social insurance program and the benefits are generally calculated in the same way The employee does not obtain particular benefits under the plan from rendering service in Federal employment because he or she would have been similarly covered by the program if privately employed and would have received similar benefits For these reasons the employer entity contribution should have the same classification as private employer contributions which is nonexchange revenue Nonexchange transactions intragovernmental gains and losses 311 Retirement of debt securities prior to maturity trust funds and special funds except trust revolving funds Treasury securities held by trust funds and special funds are primarily issued in the Government account series which can generally be redeemed on demand Other Treasury securities held by these funds may also be callable or redeemable on demand If these debt securities are retired before maturity the difference if any between the reacquisition price and the net carrying value of the extinguished debt should be recognized as a gain or loss by the fund that owned the securities The gain or loss should be accounted for as a nonexchange gain or loss if 61 Social insurance does not include programs established solely or primarily for Federal employees such as pension and other retirement plans 62 Most Federal civilian employees hired before 1984 are not covered by Social Security the interest on the associated debt securities is classified as nonexchange revenue and it should be accounted for as an exchange gain or loss if the interest on the associated debt securities is classified as exchange revenue For trust funds except trust revolving funds and special funds as explained elsewhere the interest is normally but not always a nonexchange revenue 312 The difference if any between the reacquisition price and the net carrying value of the extinguished debt should be recognized as a loss or gain in accounting for interest on Treasury debt The amount should be equal in absolute value but with the opposite sign to the gain or loss recognized by the trust fund or special fund The amount should be recognized as a gain or loss from exchange in order to offset it against the gross interest on Treasury debt in the Government wide consolidated financial statements 313 Cancellation of debt The debt that an entity owes Treasury or other agency may be canceled by Act of Congress The amount of debt that is canceled including the amount of capitalized interest that is canceled if any is a gain to the entity whose debt is canceled and a loss to Treasury or other agency The purpose of borrowing authority is generally to provide an entity with capital rather than to finance its operations Therefore the cancellation of debt is not earned by the entity s operations and is not directly related to the entity s costs of providing goods and services As a result the cancellation is a nonexchange gain to the entity that owed the debt and a nonexchange loss to the lender Exchange transactions intragovernmental revenue 314 Intragovernmental sales of goods and services by a revolving fund The cost of providing goods or services by a revolving fund is defrayed in whole or in part by selling the goods or services provided Intragovernmental sales may be made by an organization that maintains either an intragovernmental revolving fund such as the Defense Business Operations Fund or a public enterprise revolving fund such as the Postal Service Each party receives and sacrifices something of value The proceeds are an exchange revenue 315 Intragovernmental sales of goods and services by a fund other than a revolving fund The cost of providing goods or services is defrayed in whole or in part by selling the goods or services provided Each party receives and sacrifices something of value The proceeds are an exchange revenue 316 Employer entity contributions to pension and other retirement benefit plans for Federal employees Employees of the Federal Government provide service to their employer in exchange for compensation of which some is received currently the salary and some is deferred pensions retirement health benefits and other retirement benefits This is an exchange transaction because each party sacrifices value and receives value in return As part of this transaction the Government promises a pension and other retirement benefits especially health benefits to the employees after they retire The financing of these benefits may include contributions paid by the employer entity to the retirement fund 317 In broad terms the employer entity contribution is an inflow of resources to the retirement fund as part of this exchange transaction More narrowly it is a payment by the employer entity in exchange for the future provision of a pension or other retirement benefit to its employees Therefore it is an exchange revenue of the entity that administers the retirement plan and thus is an offset to that entity s gross cost in calculating its net cost of operations 63 318 Employer entity contributions to health benefit plans for current coverage of Federal employees Employees of the Federal Government provide services to their employer in exchange for compensation of which some is received currently in the form of money the salary some is received currently in the form of payments to a third party the employer entity contribution to the medical insurance plan for current coverage of the employees and some is deferred pensions and other retirement benefits This is an exchange transaction because each party sacrifices value and receives value in return As part of this exchange transaction the Government and its employees both contribute to a medical insurance plan that provides current coverage of its employees 319 In broad terms the employer entity contribution is an inflow of resources to the health benefits plan as part of this exchange transaction More narrowly it is a payment in exchange for current coverage of the employer entity s employees by a health benefits plan Therefore it is an exchange revenue of the entity that operates the health benefits plan and thus is an offset to that entity s gross cost in determining its net cost of operations 320 Employer entity payments for unemployment benefits and workers compensation The employer entity recognizes a liability and an expense for Federal employees who are laid off or injured on the job and are entitled under law to unemployment benefits or workers compensation respectively 64 The payment to the former or current employee is made by the unemployment trust fund Department of Labor in the case of unemployment benefits and by the special benefits fund Department of Labor in the case of workers compensation Unemployment benefits are reimbursed by the former employer entity and workers compensation costs are mostly charged back to the employer entity 321 Since the costs are recognized by the employer entity and its payment to the unemployment trust fund or the special benefits fund reimburses these funds for the costs they incur the amounts these funds receive from the employer entity are exchange revenues 322 Interest on Treasury securities held by revolving funds A revolving fund conducts a cycle of business type operations in which the expenses are incurred to produce goods and services that generate revenue and the revenue in turn finances expenses Revolving funds need capital in their operations and may invest some of that 63For further discussion of the accounting standards for pensions and other retirement benefits for federal employees see SFFAS No 5 Accounting for Liabilities of the Federal Government para 56 93 and 148 181 The standards do not cover accounting for the plan per se as distinct from the administering entity Nor do they cover defined contribution plans or administrative entities that are not Federal reporting entities 64See SFFAS No 6 Accounting for Liabilities of the Federal Government para 96 and para 181 footnote 70 capital in Treasury securities Since their holding of invested balances and the sale of goods and services are both integral to the funds operations the interest on the funds securities is related to the funds cost of operations just as is the revenue earned from selling goods and services Furthermore the source of the invested balances is predominantly revenue earned from their sales of goods and services for which the funds incurred costs of operations when that revenue was earned The interest they receive should therefore be classified in the same way as their revenue earned from selling goods and services and should likewise be deducted from gross cost in determining the net cost of operations For this reason interest earned by revolving funds should normally be classified as exchange revenue 323 The source of balances for some revolving funds may not be predominantly exchange revenue For such exceptions as explained in the Basis for Conclusions the interest should be classified in the same way as the predominant source of balances rather than according to the normal rule 324 Interest on Treasury securities held by trust revolving funds A trust revolving fund is a revolving fund that is also classified by law as a trust fund Like other revolving funds it earns exchange revenue which is an offset to its gross cost For example the revenue that the Employees Health Benefit fund earns from contributions by Federal employees annuitants employer entities and the Office of Personnel Management OPM is an offset to the insurance premiums that it pays to private firms Trust revolving funds need capital in their operations just like other revolving funds the source of which is predominantly the revenue they have earned When some of their capital is invested in Treasury securities the interest is related to their cost of operations in the same way as the revenue earned from selling services Furthermore the source of the invested balances is predominantly revenue earned from the sales of services for which they incurred costs of operations when the revenue was earned The interest they receive should therefore be classified in the same way as the interest received by other revolving funds which is exchange revenue 325 The source of balances for some trust revolving funds may not be predominantly exchange revenue For such exceptions as explained in the Basis for Conclusions the interest should be classified in the same way as the predominant source of balances rather than according to the normal rule 326 Interest on uninvested funds received by direct loan and guaranteed loan financing accounts A guaranteed loan financing account holds uninvested balances as reserves against its loan guarantee liabilities and earns interest on these balances that adds to its resources to pay these liabilities A direct loan financing account may hold uninvested balances to bridge transactions that are integral to its operations such as when it borrows from Treasury to disburse direct loans prior to the time of disbursement it earns interest on these balances to reflect the time value of money and thereby finance the interest it pays on its debt to Treasury Thus in both cases the interest received by the financing account is earned through exchange transactions with Treasury and is an offset to the financing account s related costs of operations The interest is therefore an exchange revenue of the financing account 327 Interest received by Treasury Accounts or funds including direct loan and guaranteed loan financing accounts may be authorized to borrow from the Treasury or from the Federal Financing Bank an entity within Treasury or other sources The interest that the entity pays on its borrowings is a cost to the entity and an inflow of resources to the Treasury The Treasury may be deemed to have borrowed from the public to finance the outlays for which the entity borrowed and thus to have incurred a corresponding interest cost of its own The interest received by Treasury from the entity is therefore related to Treasury s cost of borrowing from the public and should be classified as an exchange revenue Exchange transactions intragovernmental gains and losses 328 Note As explained in the introduction to this appendix transactions that are classified as producing gains or losses should instead be classified as producing revenue or expense if they are usual and recurring for a particular reporting entity 329 Retirement of debt securities prior to maturity revolving funds and trust revolving funds Treasury securities held by revolving funds and trust revolving funds are primarily issued in the Government account series which can generally be redeemed on demand Other Treasury securities held by these funds may also be callable or redeemable on demand If these debt securities are retired before maturity the difference if any between the reacquisition price and the net carrying value of the extinguished debt should be recognized as a gain or loss by the fund that owned the securities The gain or loss should be accounted for as a nonexchange gain or loss if the interest on the associated debt securities is classified as nonexchange revenue and it should be accounted for as an exchange gain or loss if the interest on the associated debt securities is classified as exchange revenue For revolving funds and trust revolving funds as explained elsewhere the interest is normally but not always an exchange revenue 330 The difference if any between the reacquisition price and the net carrying value of the extinguished debt should be recognized as a loss or gain in accounting for interest on Treasury debt The amount should be equal in absolute value but with the opposite sign to the gain or loss recognized by the revolving fund or trust revolving fund The amount should be recognized as a gain or loss from exchange in order to offset it against the gross interest on Treasury debt in the Government wide consolidated financial statements Other financing sources intragovernmental 331 Appropriations Appropriations a form of budget authority permit an entity to incur obligations and make payments and thus are a means of financing the entity s cost They are not otherwise related to the entity s cost and therefore are not an offset to its gross cost in determining its net cost of operations They are not earned by the entity s activities demanded by the entity or donated to the entity Therefore appropriations provide an other financing source instead of a revenue 332 More precisely appropriations used is recognized as an other financing source in determining the entity s operating results when the entity receives goods and services or provides benefits grants or other transfer payments To avoid double counting appropriations used are not recognized for the appropriation of earmarked revenues or other financing sources which are already counted in determining the entity s operating results Appropriations that have been made available for apportionment but have not been used are recognized as unexpended appropriations in the entity s capital 333 Cost subsidies difference between internal sales price reimbursement and full cost One entity may receive goods or services from another entity without paying the full cost of the goods or services or without paying any cost at all Other Federal accounting standards may require the receiving entity to recognize the full cost as an expense or if appropriate as an asset In these cases the difference between full cost and the internal sales price or reimbursement sometimes called a transfer price is an imputed cost to the receiving entity 65 334 The financing of the imputed cost is also imputed to the receiving entity Imputed financing is necessary so that the imputed cost does not reduce the entity s operating results and net position The imputed financing equals the imputed cost and is recognized as an other financing source It is not a revenue because the receiving entity does not earn the amount imputed or demand its payment 335 Cost subsidies difference between the service cost of pensions and other retirement benefits less the employee contributions if any and the employer entity contributions The service cost of pensions and other retirement benefits to the employer entity less the employee contributions if any is recognized as a cost to the employer entity The difference between the employer entity s cost and its contributions if any is imputed to the employer entity as part of its recognized cost For pensions the cost recognized by the employer entity is more than its contribution for employees who are covered by the Civil Service Retirement System and several minor systems in a few of which the employer entity does not make any contributions toward the service cost For retirement health care benefits neither the employees nor the employer entity make any contributions while the employee is working 66 Therefore the entire service cost is recognized as a cost to the employer entity and imputed to it 336 The financing of the imputed cost is also imputed to the employer entity 67 The imputed financing is necessary so that the imputed cost does not reduce the employer entity s operating results and net position The imputed financing equals the imputed cost and is recognized as an other financing source It is not a revenue because the employer entity does not earn the amount imputed or demand its payment 68 65See SFFAS No 4 Managerial Cost Accounting Concepts and Standards for the Federal Government para 105 115 66Retired employees do pay premiums however and the service cost to the employer entity is defined net of the actuarial present value of those future premiums 67The employer entity s own contribution if any is generally financed by an appropriation but could be financed by earned revenue or other sources 68For further discussion of the accounting standards for pensions and other retirement benefits for federal employees see SFFAS No 5 Accounting for Liabilities of the Federal Government para 56 93 and 148 181 The standards do not cover accounting for the plan per se as distinct from the administering entity Nor do they cover defined contribution plans or administrative entities that are not Federal reporting entities 337 This transaction differs from the immediately preceding transaction in which an entity does not pay the full cost of the goods or services it receives from another entity In the present case the employer entity acquires the services of the employees itself but another entity pays part of their cost 338 Contribution by the General Fund to the SMI trust fund The General Fund makes a contribution to the SMI Supplementary Medical Insurance trust fund This appropriated payment is separate from the transfer of earmarked premiums and is not a transfer of earmarked taxes or other income It does not arise from an exchange transaction because SMI does not sacrifice any value to the General Fund in exchange for the payment and the General Fund does not receive anything of value from SMI Instead the payment constitutes a General Fund subsidy of the SMI trust fund Since the payment is not demanded or earned it is an other financing source to SMI rather than a revenue 339 Examples of other payments of a similar nature and also classified as other financing sources are the payment by the General Fund to the social security trust funds for military service credits and for certain uninsured persons at least 72 years old and the payment by the General Fund to the Railroad Retirement Board for the vested dual benefit payments received by certain retirees under both the railroad retirement and the social security systems The quinquennial military service credit adjustment paid between the General Fund and the social security trust funds is likewise an other financing source to the social security trust funds but one that may be either positive or negative 340 Transfer by CCC to Federal Crop Insurance Corporation The Commodity Credit Corporation CCC makes transfers to the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation FCIC which it finances by an appropriation This payment does not arise from an exchange transaction because FCIC does not sacrifice anything of value to CCC and CCC does not receive anything of value from FCIC It differs from the contribution to SMI primarily in that it is paid by another program entity the CCC rather than directly by the General Fund Since the payment is not demanded or earned it is an other financing source to FCIC rather than a revenue 341 Interchange between the Railroad Retirement Board and the Social Security and Hospital Insurance trust funds The Railroad Retirement Board pays benefits equivalent to the amounts that would have been paid if railroad workers had been covered under Social Security since its inception plus additional amounts unique to that program The railroad retirement program is partly financed by an annual financial interchange that takes place between the Railroad Social Security Equivalent Benefit Account a trust fund and the trust funds for old age and survivors insurance disability insurance and hospital insurance OASDHI The interchange is designed to place each of the OASDHI trust funds in the same position as it would have been if railroad employment had been covered under Social Security since its inception 342 The amount of the payment reflects the difference between a the benefits that the OASDHI trust funds would have paid to railroad workers and their families if railroad employment had been covered by OASDHI and b the payroll taxes that the OASDHI trust funds would have received if railroad employment had been covered by OASDHI If benefits would have exceeded taxes the OASDHI trust funds make a payment to the Railroad Social Security Equivalent Benefit Account if benefits would have been less the OASDHI trust funds receive a payment Currently OASI and DI make payments to that Account and HI receives payment The interchange differs from the examples in the previous cases primarily in that a the payment is between two trust funds and b the payment may be made in either direction 343 The financial interchange does not arise from an exchange transaction because it is a reallocation of resources among funds all of which are financed primarily from nonexchange revenue Furthermore the nature of this reallocation is such that the transferring entity does not receive anything of value and the recipient entity does not sacrifice anything of value Therefore the recipient entity recognizes the transfer in as an other financing source and the transferring entity recognizes the transfer out as a negative financing source 344 Transfer of cash and other capitalized assets without reimbursement Cash and other capitalized assets may be transferred without reimbursement from one Government entity to another Cash may include exchange revenue that is recognized by the transferring entity in determining its net cost of operations but is required to be transferred to the General Fund or another entity other capitalized assets may include general property plant and equipment The receiving entity does not sacrifice anything of value and the transferring entity does not acquire anything of value Therefore the transfer is not an exchange transaction The receiving entity recognizes the transfer in as an other financing source the transferring entity recognizes the transfer out as a negative financing source The amount recorded by both entities is the transferring entity s book value of the asset 345 Transfer of property plant and equipment without reimbursement types that are expensed Property plant and equipment PP E of types that are expensed i e stewardship PP E may be transferred from one Government entity to another If the asset was classified as stewardship PP E in its entirety by both the transferring entity and the recipient entity the transfer does not affect the net cost of operations or net position of either entity and therefore in such a case it is not a revenue a gain or loss or other financing source 346 However if the asset that is transferred was classified as general PP E for the transferring entity but stewardship PP E for the recipient entity it is recognized as a transfer out a negative other financing source of capitalized assets by the transferring entity REVALUATIONS 347 Revaluation of capitalized property plant and equipment Capitalized property plant and equipment PP E may be removed from the general PP E accounts if it no longer provides service in the operations of the entity because it has suffered damage become obsolete in advance of expectations or is identified as excess It is recorded as an asset at its expected net realizable value Any difference between the book value and the expected net realizable value is recognized as a gain or loss in determining the net cost of operations because the revaluation results from the entity s operations The expected net realizable value is adjusted at the end of each period and any further revaluation is also recognized as a gain or loss in determining the net cost of operations 69 348 Since the revaluation does not affect obligations incurred but does affect net cost an amount equal to the revaluation is recognized in determining the reconciliation between obligations incurred and net cost of operations A reconciliation is not needed in determining the change in net position because the revaluation affects net cost and net position equally 349 Revaluation of inventory and related property Inventory and related property may be revalued for such reasons as determination that the property is excess obsolete or unserviceable that stockpile materials have decayed or been damaged that a loss is estimated on commodity purchase agreements or that a change has occurred in the net realizable value of commodities valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value The amount of revaluation is recognized as a loss or a gain in determining the net cost of operations because it results from the entity s operations Assets are correspondingly reduced or increased 70 350 Since the revaluation does not affect obligations incurred but does affect net cost an amount equal to the revaluation is recognized in determining the reconciliation between obligations incurred and net cost of operations A reconciliation is not needed in determining the change in net position because the revaluation affects net cost and net position equally TRANSACTIONS NOT RECOGNIZED AS REVENUES GAINS OR OTHER FINANCING SOURCES 351 Borrowing from the public Borrowing from the public is a means of financing the Government s outlays However it is not a net inflow of resources to the Treasury or other borrowing entity because the asset received cash is offset by an equal liability debt Therefore it is not revenue or an other financing source 352 Borrowing from Treasury the Federal Financing Bank or other Government accounts An entity may be provided the authority to borrow from Treasury the Federal Financing Bank or other Government accounts Intragovernmental borrowing is a means of financing the entity s outlays However it is not a net inflow of resources to the entity because the asset received cash is offset by an equal liability debt Therefore it is not revenue or an other financing source 353 Disposition of revenue to other entities custodial transfers Revenue primarily nonexchange revenue may be collected by an entity acting on behalf of the General Fund or another entity within the Government on whose behalf it was collected The collecting entity accounts for the disposition of revenue as part of its custodial activity These custodial transfers by definition do not affect the collecting entity s net cost of operations or operating results nor are they part of the reconciliation between its obligations and net cost of operations The receiving entity 69SFFAS No 6 Accounting for Property Plant and Equipment para 39 70See SFFAS No 3 Accounting for Inventory and Related Property para 29 30 47 48 54 97 and 107 recognizes the revenue as nonexchange or exchange revenue depending on its nature according to the applicable revenue standards 354 Sales of different types of Government assets The sale of Government assets other than forfeited property is an exchange transaction because each party receives and sacrifices something of value As a general rule any difference between the sales proceeds and book value is recognized as a gain or loss when the asset is sold The remainder of the transaction does not provide a net inflow of resources so no gain revenue or other financing source is recognized If the sales proceeds equal book value there is no gain or loss because the exchange of one asset for another of equal recorded value is not a net inflow of resources 355 This general rule applies to property plant and equipment receivables other than direct loans foreclosed property associated with pre 1992 direct loans and loan guarantees and miscellaneous assets It does not apply to inventory nor does it apply to forfeited property as explained in the previous section on nonexchange revenue It also does not apply to the sale of direct loans and the sale of foreclosed property associated with post 1991 direct loans and loan guarantees The latter transactions are discussed in subsequent paragraphs 356 Acquisition of property plant and equipment through exchange The cost of property plant and equipment PP E acquired through an exchange of assets with the public is the fair value of the PP E surrendered at the time of exchange If the fair value of the PP E acquired is more readily determinable than that of the PP E surrendered the cost is the fair value of the PP E acquired If neither fair value is determinable the cost of the PP E acquired is the cost recorded for the PP E surrendered net of any accumulated depreciation or amortization In the event that cash consideration is included in the exchange the cost of PP E acquired is increased or decreased by the amount of the cash surrendered or received 71 357 Any difference between the cost of the PP E acquired and the book value of the PP E surrendered is recognized as a gain or loss If the cost of the PP E acquired equals the book value of the PP E surrendered there is no gain or loss nor a revenue or other financing source because the exchange of one asset for another of equal value does not provide a net inflow of resources Therefore the amount of the transaction equal to the book value of the PP E surrendered is not recognized as a gain a revenue or an other financing source 358 Transfer of property plant and equipment without reimbursement types that are expensed Property plant and equipment PP E of types that are expensed i e stewardship PP E may be transferred from one Government entity to another If the asset was classified as stewardship PP E in its entirety by both the transferring entity and the recipient entity the transfer does not affect the net cost of operations or net position of either entity and therefore in such a case it is not a revenue a gain or loss or other financing source 359 However if the asset that is transferred was classified as general PP E for the transferring entity but stewardship PP E for the recipient entity it is recognized as a transfer out a negative other financing source of capitalized assets by the 71See SFFAS No 6 Accounting for Property Plant and Equipment para 32 transferring entity 360 If multi use heritage assets are transferred and some cost was recognized for them on the books of the transferring entity that cost is recognized as a transfer out a negative other financing source of capitalized assets No amount is recognized by the entity that receives the asset 72 361 Donation of property plant and equipment types that are expensed The acquisition cost of stewardship property plant and equipment PP E is recognized as a cost when incurred Such PP E consists of Federal mission PP E heritage assets and stewardship land When such PP E is donated to the Government however no amount is recognized as a cost 73 Since the donation of such PP E does not affect the net cost or net position of the recipient entity it is not a revenue a gain or an other financing source 362 Negative subsidies on post 1991 direct loans and loan guarantees A negative subsidy means that the direct loans or loan guarantees are estimated to make a profit apart from administrative costs which are excluded from the subsidy calculation by law The amount of the subsidy cost is recognized as an expense when the direct loan or guaranteed loan is disbursed A negative subsidy is recognized as a direct reduction in expense not as a revenue gain or other financing source 74 363 Downward subsidy reestimates for post 1991 direct loans and loan guarantees A downward subsidy reestimate means that the subsidy cost of direct loans or loan guarantees is estimated to be less than had previously been estimated The initial subsidy cost is recognized as an expense a positive subsidy reestimate is recognized as an expense and a downward subsidy reestimate is recognized as a direct reduction in expense not as a revenue gain or other financing source 364 Fees on post 1991 direct loans and loan guarantees The present value of estimated fees is included as an offset in calculating the subsidy cost of direct loans and loan guarantees which is recognized as an expense when the loans are disbursed The present value of estimated fees is likewise included as one component in calculating the value of loans receivable or loan guarantee liabilities When cash is received in payment of fees the loans receivable decrease by an equal amount or the loan guarantee liabilities increase by an equal amount The increase in one asset is offset by an equal decrease in another asset or by an equal increase in liabilities Therefore fees are not recognized as a revenue a gain or an other financing source 75 365 Repayment of post 1991 direct loans The present value of estimated loan 72SFFAS No 6 Accounting for Property Plant and Equipment para 61 and 72 73Ibid 74For standards on direct loans and loan guarantees see SFFAS No 2 Accounting for Direct Loans and Loan Guarantees The accounting for negative subsidy costs is symmetrical to the accounting for positive subsidy costs 75 The fee component of the subsidy cost is required to be disclosed separately repayments is included in the calculation of the subsidy cost of direct loans and this subsidy cost is recognized as an expense when the loans are disbursed The present value of estimated loan repayments is likewise included in the value of the loans receivable When cash is received for the repayment of loans the loans receivable decrease by an equal amount The increase in one asset is offset by an equal decrease in another asset Therefore cash inflow from the repayment is not recognized as a revenue a gain or an other financing source 76 366 Repayment of pre 1992 direct loans When pre 1992 direct loans are repaid in whole or in part the entity exchanges one asset loans receivable for another cash with equal value There is no net inflow of resources Therefore the amount of cash inflow equal to book value is not recognized as a revenue a gain or an other financing source 77 367 Repayment of receivables except direct loans When receivables other than direct loans are paid or repaid in whole or in part the entity exchanges one asset loans receivable for another cash with equal value There is no net inflow of resources Therefore the amount of cash inflow equal to book value is not recognized as a revenue a gain or an other financing source 78 368 Sales of direct loans The sale of a direct loan is a modification according to the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 regardless of whether the loan being sold was obligated after FY 1991 or before FY 1992 The book value loss or gain on a sale of direct loans equals the book value of the loans sold prior to sale minus the net proceeds of the sale It normally differs from the cost of modification which is recognized as an expense 79 Any difference between the book value loss or gain and the cost of modification is recognized as a gain or loss 80 The amount of cash inflow equal to book value is not a net inflow of resources to the entity because it is an exchange of one asset for another of equal recorded value Therefore the amount of cash inflow equal to book value is not recognized as a revenue a gain or an other financing source 76 If the actual repayment is different from the previous estimate the present value of the difference between cash inflows and outflows over the term of the loan calculated as of the date of disbursement is reestimated and is recognized as a subsidy expense or a reduction in subsidy expense 77 If the loan is not repaid the unpaid amount is recognized as an adjustment to the bad debt allowance and does not affect revenue gains or other financing sources 78 If the receivable is not repaid the unpaid amount is recognized as an adjustment to the bad debt allowance and does not affect revenue gains or other financing sources 79 This difference is due to the different interest rates used to discount future cash flows for calculating the subsidy cost and subsidy allowance when the loan is disbursed and for calculating the cost of modification at a later time If the sale is with recourse the present value of the estimated loss from the recourse is also recognized as an expense 80SFFAS No 2 Accounting for Direct Loans and Loan Guarantees para 53 55 and Appendix B Part II B 369 Sales of foreclosed property associated with post 1991 direct loans and loan guarantees The net present value of the cash flow from the estimated sales of foreclosed property is included in calculating the subsidy cost of post 1991 direct loans and loan guarantees This subsidy cost is recognized as an expense when the loans are disbursed When property is foreclosed the property is recognized as an asset at the net present value of its estimated net cash flows When the foreclosed property is sold any difference between the sales proceeds and the book value i e the net present value as of the time of sale requires a reestimate of the subsidy expense which is recognized as a subsidy expense or a reduction in subsidy expense The amount of cash flow equal to book value is an exchange of one asset for another of equal recorded value and therefore is not recognized as a gain a revenue or an other financing source 81 370 Deposit fund transactions Deposit funds are accounts outside the budget that record amounts that the Government a holds temporarily until ownership is determined or b holds as an agent for others The standards and guidance in this Statement do not apply to deposit funds except insofar as a particular deposit fund may be classified as part of a Federal reporting entity or a disclosure may be required due to a fiduciary relationship on the part of a Federal reporting entity toward a deposit fund 81 See SFFAS No 2 Accounting for Direct Loans and Loan Guarantees para 57 60

604 STATEMENT OF FEDERAL FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO 8 Supplementary Stewardship Reporting STATUS Volume I Version 1 0 February 28 1997 605 SUMMARY This Statement establishes standards for reporting on the Federal Government s stewardship over 1 certain resources entrusted to it identified as stewardship property plant and equipment and stewardship investments and 2 certain responsibilities assumed by it identified as the current service assessment The resources and responsibilities do not meet the criteria for assets and liabilities that are required to be reported in the financial statements but are nonetheless important to an understanding of the operations and financial condition of the Federal Government at the date of the financial statements and in subsequent periods Because the Government has been entrusted with and made accountable for these resources and responsibilities they should be recognized in the financial reports of the Federal Government and of its component entities Stewardship resources are investments by the Federal Government for the benefit of the Nation When made they are treated as expenses in the financial statements These expenses however are intended to provide long term benefits to the public Therefore this Statement requires that information on these resources be reported to highlight their long term benefit nature and to demonstrate accountability over them Depending on the nature of the resources stewardship reporting could consist of financial and nonfinancial data This Statement also establishes a standard for reporting projections that will aid in assessing the sufficiency of future budgetary resources to sustain public services and meet obligations as they come due This Statement establishes reporting requirements based on the categories defined below Stewardship Property Plant and Equipment PP E property owned by the Federal Government and meeting the definition of one of the following three categories Heritage Assets property plant and equipment of historical natural cultural educational or artistic significance Federal Mission PP E property plant and equipment integral to certain unique Federal missions Stewardship Land land other than that acquired for or in connection with general PP E Stewardship Investments items treated as expenses in calculating net cost but meriting special treatment to highlight their substantial investment and long term benefit nature This includes Nonfederal Physical Property grants provided for properties financed by the Federal Government but owned by the state and local governments Costs incurred for education and training programs that are designed to increase or maintain national economic productive capacity and research efforts to provide future benefits or returns These include Human Capital education and training programs financed by the Federal Government for the benefit of the public Research and Development basic and applied research and development Stewardship Responsibilities the projected financial impact on the Government of sustaining current services that it provides Projections of current services provided by the Government aid in assessing the sufficiency of future budgetary resources to sustain public services and meet obligations as they come due This assessment termed a Current Services Assessment provides receipt and outlay data on the basis of projections of future activities All stewardship information is deemed required supplemental stewardship information RSSI Audit requirements for RSSI will be established in a collaborative effort by the Office of Management and Budget OMB and the General Accounting Office GAO TABLE OF CONTENTS CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 4 Each standard is summarized briefly in a box followed by a detailed explanation of the standard However the standards comprise the summaries in the boxes and the entire text of the explanations BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 5 The Concepts Statement Objectives of Federal Financial Reporting was developed on the basis of an in depth assessment of user needs and is used to guide the Board in developing Federal accounting and reporting standards The objectives cover four areas budgetary integrity operating performance stewardship and systems and control 6 This Statement of accounting standards addresses the objective of reporting on stewardship over certain resources entrusted to the Federal Government and responsibilities assumed by it The need for a report on the Federal Government s stewardship over the resources entrusted to it and the responsibilities it has assumed arises because of the unique nature of the Federal Government as described in the following section STEWARDSHIP AND THE REPORTING OBJECTIVES 7 Financial position is a representation of an entity s economic resources and the claims on those resources as of a particular date In the private sector the principal objective of reporting on financial position is to assess the viability of the entity the business firm and its potential profitability 8 Assessing the overall performance of the Federal Government is not exclusively a matter of comparing revenue and expense or its accumulated assets and liabilities 9 The Federal Government s viability and perpetuity are assumed It has unique access to financial resources and financing and the power to tax to borrow and to create money For the Federal Government financial performance is a vital issue but traditional financial measures provide data that are appropriate for assessing only some not all of the responsibilities for which the Government should be held accountable Since it exists not to make a profit but to serve the needs of the citizens and to promote the general welfare of the Nation other measures of accountability need to be used Measures of accountability are to be reported for elements that are defined as stewardship property plant and equipment PP E stewardship investments and stewardship responsibilities These elements of stewardship exist because the Federal Government is dissimilar to industrial and commercial entities Financial Condition 10 The measures of accountability mentioned above help to portray the Government s financial condition Financial condition is a broader and more forward looking concept than is financial position Financial condition allows an assessment of an entity on the basis of additional data that could include financial and nonfinancial information about current conditions These additional data provide a more complete indication of performance In some cases it may be necessary to present and characterize financial data in ways that differ from traditional financial reporting and to supplement traditional data with nonfinancial data In other cases it may be necessary to rely almost entirely on nonfinancial data to provide a more complete presentation of entity performance Moreover assessment of financial condition could include analysis of trends demands commitments events and uncertainties 4 Stewardship PP E 11 Stewardship PP E consists of items whose physical properties resemble those of general PP E traditionally capitalized in financial statements However the nature of these Federal physical assets that are classified as stewardship PP E differ from general PP E in that their values may be indeterminable or may have little meaning for example museum collections monuments assets acquired in the formation of the nation or that allocating the cost of such assets for example military weapons systems and space exploration hardware to accounting periods that benefit from the ownership of such assets is meaningless However the Federal Government should be able to demonstrate accountability for stewardship PP E by reporting on its existence and on its condition by a reference to deferred maintenance reported in the financial statements Stewardship PP E would include stewardship land that is land not acquired for or in connection with general property plant and equipment heritage assets for example Federal monuments and memorials and historically or culturally significant property and Federal mission property plant and equipment for example space exploration and military weapons systems Stewardship Investments 12 Stewardship investments are substantial investments made by the Federal Government for the benefit of the nation When incurred they are treated as expenses in determining the net costs of operations However these items merit special treatment so that readers of Government financial reports know the extent of these investments that are made for long term benefit Such investments will be measured in terms of expenses incurred for certain education and training programs federally financed research and development and federally financed but not federally owned property such as bridges and roads 4 Chapter 7 of the Objectives of Federal Financial Reporting provides a full discussion of financial position and financial condition 13 Because the Government has been entrusted with and made accountable for these resources they should be reported in the financial reports of the Government and of its component entities This will help satisfy the stewardship objective defined in the concepts statement Objectives of Federal Financial Reporting SFFAC No 1 The goal of the stewardship objective is that the Federal Government report on the broad outcomes of its actions Such reporting may provide information that could help report users assess the impact of the Government s operations and investments for the period 5 Stewardship Responsibilities 14 A key aspect of the stewardship objective requires that Federal reporting provide information that helps users determine 1 whether the Government s financial condition improved or deteriorated over the period and 2 whether future budgetary resources will likely be sufficient to sustain public services and to meet obligations as they come due 6 15 Information on stewardship responsibilities will aid in these determinations It will provide an essential perspective on the Government s commitment to discretionary and mandatory programs 16 Reporting on this stewardship responsibility may be accomplished in a stewardship section in the consolidated financial report of the Federal Government STEWARDSHIP CATEGORIES OR ELEMENTS 17 In defining the specific categories of items or elements that would appear as stewardship information the Board decided on the following Property owned by the Federal Government and meeting the definition of one of the following three categories Property plant and equipment of historical natural cultural educational or artistic significance referred to as heritage assets for example the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial 5 See SFFAC No 1 pp 41 42 6 Ibid pp 42 44 Property plant and equipment that are integral to meeting a unique Federal mission referred to as Federal mission7 property plant and equipment PP E and Investments in stewardship land 8 that is land not acquired for or in connection with general property plant and equipment for example national forests parks and historic sites Some investments in stewardship land for example national parks will be reported by both 1 the number of acres used as a park or an historic site in the stewardship land category and 2 by the number of physical units identified as national parks in the heritage assets category Such reporting would not be considered duplication as the type of information reported on an item would be different for each category of stewardship asset Properties financed by the Federal Government but owned by state and local governments referred to as nonfederal physical property for example highways and bridges Expenses that are incurred for education and training that are intended to increase national economic productive capacity or for research and development that are intended to provide future benefits or returns This includes Investments in human capital that is education and training programs provided by the Federal Government for example job training programs and grants for higher education Investments in research and development for example research on the effects of early medical intervention in delaying the onset of AIDs symptoms in HIV positive individuals and Federal investment in genetic code research to advance national medical research Information on the projected financial impact on the Government of providing current services assuming a continuation of current programs This information will be in the form of a current services assessment providing future receipt and outlay data on the basis of projections of future activities 7 The term Federal mission refers to activities that are typically Federal such as National defense In addition Federal mission PP E is limited to PP E that would not typically be used by non federal entities Clearly any functions performed by a Federal entity could be broadly labeled Federal mission The definition of this category however clarifies the characteristics of PP E appropriately included in this category a much narrower group than inferred by the category s title 8 The Board is including only surface land as supplementary stewardship information because the issues associated with other than surface land i e the natural resources on and under that land are complex The Board is researching these complex issues and will publish a separate exposure draft on a proposed accounting standard for natural resources at a later date for the Government as a whole and will include both discretionary and mandatory programs and interest on debt 18 The previous categories of items or elements result from or exist largely because of the Federal Government s role as a sovereign power The components that they include are defined and discussed in detail in their respective chapters of this standard The Nature of Stewardship Reporting 19 The Board recognizing the Federal Government s size complexity diversity and impact on others has determined that the aforementioned information is needed in addition to that included in financial statements 20 Such information may not link directly with the basic financial statements because the data to be reported may be other than financial for example physical units or projections It will supplement the basic financial statements 21 This information as indicated in each of the standards will be designated as required supplementary stewardship information RSSI for the consolidated financial statements of the Federal Government and of the entities who have stewardship responsibilities over resources identified earlier in this document The Board has chosen to call this RSSI to distinguish it from required supplementary information RSI for which audit responsibilities are prescribed in existing professional literature The Board believes that OMB and GAO should establish and cause the implementation of the audit responsibilities for RSSI STEWARDSHIP INFORMATION 22 Stewardship information may be presented in varying formats depending on the nature of the Federal investments or claims to Federal resources controlled by an entity Such information is required for those entities 1 that control stewardship resources and 2 whose financial statements purport to be in accordance with Federal accounting principles as recommended by FASAB and approved by the Secretary of the Treasury the Director of OMB and the Comptroller General 23 Examples of selected portions of stewardship report sections are included at Appendix B MEASUREMENT 24 The separate standards for each stewardship element contain specific guidance for that element In general however stewardship investments shall be measured on the same basis of accounting as used for financial statements including appropriate accrual adjustments general and administrative overhead and a share of the cost of facilities for example depreciation 9 25 For investments that are intended to maintain or increase the economic productive capacity of the Nation that is investments in human capital research and development and nonfederal physical property trend data shall be presented Trend data should reflect the full cost including allocation of facility and administrative costs of the investment 26 For stewardship land and heritage assets measurement will be done on other than a financial basis For example measurement may be on the basis of physical units such as acres of land Specific data requirements are addressed in the individual stewardship standards 27 Generally amounts shall be reported in nominal dollars If trend data that span many years are reported and the entity believes that constant dollar information would be meaningful for data interpretation constant dollar data may be provided in addition to nominal dollar data 28 Split Grants Frequently stewardship elements are financed by grants In some cases the grants may have more than one purpose 10 For such grants the investment shall be allocated among stewardship elements on the basis of an estimate of the proportionate funding of the various grant objectives If allocation is not feasible the investment shall be reported on the basis of the predominant use of the grant 29 Performance Indicators For some stewardship elements categorization of these elements as investments is predicated on producing outputs and outcomes The specific procedures including a phasing in process for requiring such justification is contained in the individual respective standards 30 Reporting Program Expenses Trend data reported on stewardship investment elements should reflect the full cost11 of the investment for the year being reported upon and the preceding 4 years Additional years data also may be reported if such data would better indicate the investment nature of an item 9See Managerial Cost Accounting Concepts and Standards SFFAS No 4 for a discussion of Federal cost accounting principles and standards 10 An example of a grant with a split purpose is a grant issued to a teaching hospital to perform both medical education and medical research 11See Managerial Cost Accounting Concepts and Standards SFFAS No 4 for a discussion of Federal cost accounting principles and standards 31 In some cases before the issuance of Federal accounting standards entities have maintained records on the basis of outlays rather than expenses It may be impracticable for such entities to reconstruct their accounts on the basis of expense In such cases entities may report data on an outlay basis for any years for which expense data are not available At the end of 5 years entities should have sufficient expense data to be able to report expenses rather than outlays 32 Reporting Deferred Maintenance Many state and local governments members of Congressional oversight committees and national groups have raised the issue of the deteriorating condition of federally owned PP E because of deferred maintenance associated with these assets The issue was addressed in association with PP E As a result a deferred maintenance standard in Accounting for Property Plant and Equipment SFFAS No 6 establishes reporting requirements related to the condition and future maintenance requirements for PP E 33 These requirements are flexible since different conditions may be considered acceptable by different entities as well as for different items of PP E held by the same entity The deferred maintenance standard is applicable to all PP E whether the PP E is reported as general PP E or stewardship PP E REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 34 Within each of the standards minimum required and in some cases recommended reporting is described These requirements and recommendations including a phasing in process for entities who may not have required data available at the implementation of the standards are contained in the individual standards These requirements describe the nature of items to be reported by Federal entities guidance on the form and content of agency financial reports including the specific guidance on the format in which items addressed in this Statement will be reported will be prescribed by OMB 35 Reporting should be at the major program or category level individual transactions need not be reported unless significant Additional reporting is encouraged when preparers believe such information would make the financial report more meaningful or understandable SOCIAL INSURANCE 36 The Board first considered accounting and reporting for social insurance programs while considering SFFAS No 5 Accounting for Liabilities of the Federal Government The Board concluded at that time that the topic should be made part of the Supplementary Stewardship Reporting project 37 Research and deliberations regarding social insurance have continued as part of the Supplementary Stewardship Reporting project However the Board recognizing the magnitude and complexity of these programs the strength of the views on the accounting and reporting issues the significant attention being focused on these programs at the present time and the potential for change to the programs has again concluded that additional consideration is appropriate before issuing final guidance Accordingly the Board has not included guidance on social insurance in this Statement and has added a Social Insurance Accounting project to its agenda APPLICABILITY 38 This standard requires that the consolidated financial reports12 of the Federal Government and the financial reports12 of its component units contain RSSI relating to amounts invested in human capital research and development and nonfederal physical property and quantities stated in terms of physical units or dollars of land heritage assets and Federal mission property Although FASAB s sponsors do not set accounting standards for the legislative or judicial branches Federal accounting standards would be appropriate for them 39 Because the financial reports of the Federal Government present the aggregation of information about stewardship investments and assets related to varied agencies and programs further deliberations by the Board are needed to reach a decision on the amount and nature of information to be required under this standard for reporting in the consolidated financial report Accordingly except for the standard described in Chapter 8 Current Service Assessment the effective date of the stewardship standards as they apply to the consolidated financial report is deferred pending that decision The effective date of the standard in Chapter 8 is for fiscal periods beginning after September 30 1997 In the interim the consolidated financial reports should include such summary or selected information as is feasible Experimentation is encouraged as is the reporting of such additional information as will enhance the financial report 40 Some Federal entities including those government corporations listed in the Government Corporation Control Act and certain others such as the US Postal Service are required by law or policy to publish financial statements pursuant to the standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Some entities also may be required to prepare statements pursuant to standards set by a regulatory agency That practice would not be affected by this statement of standards For such entities this standard provides the following general principles 12 The terms financial statements and consolidated financial statements are used throughout this document to refer to the basic financial statements of a reporting entity the basic financial statements normally include the balance sheet the statements of net cost changes in financial position financing budgetary resources and custodial activities and the notes to the financial statements The terms financial reports and consolidated financial reports are used to refer to a document which would include the financial statements but which would also include items such as a management discussion and analysis section a statement of program performance measures required supplemental information or required supplementary stewardship information not included in the financial statements or other supplemental financial and management information Applying Applicable Accounting Principles Separately issued stand alone general purpose financial statements on such entities should apply applicable accounting principles that will best meet user needs and comply with any relevant statutory requirements This principle would continue to be true for separately issued statements even if pursuant to the provisions below other information about these entities might need to be presented when their financial statements are included within reports of a larger Federal entity Reporting Additional or Supplementary Information When financial information on such entities is included in general purpose financial reports of a larger Federal reporting entity including Treasury s consolidated financial report any applicable standards recommended by the FASAB and issued by OMB and the General Accounting Office GAO that call for additional reporting or supplementary information should be applied Applying Applicable Standards When Differences Arise When financial information on such entities is included in general purpose financial reports of a larger Federal reporting entity including Treasury s consolidated financial report standards recommended by FASAB and issued by OMB and GAO should be used if the difference arising from differences between Federal accounting standards and FASB s would be material to users of the report of the larger entity CHAPTER 2 HERITAGE ASSETS Heritage Assets Heritage assets shall be reported as required supplementary stewardship information accompanying the financial statements of the Federal Government and the component units of the Federal Government responsible for such assets Heritage assets shall be reported in terms of physical units rather than cost fair value or other monetary values DEFINITION 43 Heritage assets are PP E that are unique for one or more of the following reasons historical or natural significance cultural educational or artistic for example aesthetic importance or significant architectural characteristics 44 Heritage assets are generally expected to be preserved indefinitely One example of evidence that a particular asset is heritage in nature is that it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places 45 Some investments in heritage assets for example national parks will be reported by both 1 the number of physical units identified as national parks in the heritage assets category and by 2 the number of acres used as a park or an historic site in the stewardship land category see Chapter 4 of this document Such reporting would not be considered duplication as the type of information reported on an item would be different for each category of stewardship asset MEASUREMENT 46 Heritage assets shall be quantified in terms of physical units for example number of items in collections or the number of national parks No asset amount shall be shown on the balance sheet of the Federal financial statements for heritage assets 47 The costs of acquiring constructing improving reconstructing or renovating heritage assets shall be considered an expense in the period incurred when determining the net cost of operations 13 The cost shall include all costs incurred to bring the heritage asset to its current condition and location MULTI USE HERITAGE ASSETS 48 Not all heritage assets are used solely for heritage purposes some serve two purposes by providing reminders of our heritage and by being used in day to day government operations unrelated to the assets themselves The cost of renovating improving or reconstructing operating components of heritage assets used in Government operations shall be included in general PP E The renovation improvement or reconstruction costs to facilitate Government operations for example installation of communication wiring or redesign of office space would be capitalized and depreciated over its expected useful life The cost should not be depreciated over an unrealistically long life 49 Costs of renovating or reconstructing the heritage asset that cannot be associated directly with operations shall be considered heritage asset costs and included as expense in calculating net costs MINIMUM REPORTING 50 The determination of the most relevant information to be presented should be made by the preparer however reporting at the entity level shall be more specific than at the governmentwide level The following are examples of information that should be considered for presentation Description of each major category of heritage asset The number of physical units added and withdrawn from the heritage asset records during the year and the end of year number of physical units for each type of heritage asset Heritage assets consist of 1 collection type heritage assets such as objects gathered and maintained for exhibition for example museum collections art collections and library collections and 2 noncollection type heritage assets such as parks memorials monuments and buildings Description of the methods of acquisition and withdrawal of heritage assets 13For guidance in measuring and reporting the cost of heritage assets transferred from other federal entities and heritage assets acquired through donation or devise see the general PP E standard contained in Accounting for Property Plant and Equipment SFFAS No 6 Condition14 of the assets unless it is already reported in a note to the financial statements in which case a reference to the note will suffice A reference to a note to the financial statements if deferred maintenance is reported for the assets 15 IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE 51 For guidance on heritage assets that were previously recognized as assets for balance sheet reporting see Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards SFFAS No 6 Accounting for Property Plant and Equipment paragraphs 63 64 and 65 14Examples of condition information include among others 1 averages of standardized condition rating codes 2 percentage of assets above at or below acceptable condition or 3 narrative information 15For guidance relating to deferred maintenance reporting see the Deferred Maintenance standard in Accounting for Property Plant and Equipment SFFAS No 6 CHAPTER 3 FEDERAL MISSION PP E Federal Mission Property Plant and Equipment Federal mission property plant and equipment PP E shall be reported as required supplementary stewardship information accompanying the financial statements of the Federal Government and the component units of the Federal Government responsible for such PP E Federal mission PP E shall be valued and reported using either the total cost or the latest acquisition cost valuation method DEFINITION 52 Federal mission PP E includes items used to meet a Federal Government mission in which the specific PP E used is an integral part of the output of the mission 16 PP E should be considered Federal mission PP E if it possesses at least one of each of the two types of characteristics presented below One type of characteristic relates to the use of Federal mission PP E and the other relates to its useful life 53 Characteristics related to the use of the Federal mission PP E are that it has no expected nongovernmental alternative uses or is held for use in the event of emergency war or natural disaster or is specifically designed for use in a program for which there is no other program or entity Federal or nonfederal using similar PP E with which to compare costs 54 Characteristics related to the useful life are that it has an indeterminate or an unpredictable useful life17 because of the unusual manner in which it is used improved retired modified or maintained or is at a very high risk of being destroyed during use or of premature obsolescence 16 The name Federal mission PP E may cause readers to erroneously assume that this category should include any PP E supporting a Federal mission Federal mission PP E is limited to those items specifically identified herein as well as any other items exhibiting at least one characteristic from each of the two groups listed 17 This may be evidenced by the ability 1 to retire the PP E and later return it to service or 2 to continually upgrade the PP E to maintain its usefulness 55 Federal mission PP E excludes land whether the land is general PP E land or stewardship land 56 Federal mission PP E however specifically includes 1 weapons systems PP E for example fighter or attack aircraft submarines and tracked combat vehicles and 2 space exploration equipment for example space hardware and launch tracking and recovery facilities Weapons systems and space exploration equipment are defined in the following paragraphs 57 Weapons Systems Weapons systems are a combination of one or more weapons18 with all related equipment materials services personnel and means of delivery and deployment required for self sufficiency 19 This standard addresses only the PP E component of weapons systems PP E included in weapons systems are distinguished from general property plant and equipment held by defense agencies and defense support agencies in that they are intended to be used directly by the armed forces to carry out combat missions when necessary and to train in peacetime 58 Weapons systems include only those assets owned by defense agencies and defense support agencies that would otherwise meet the property plant and equipment definition Items meeting other than the PP E asset category definitions are excluded from Federal mission PP E such as items of inventory or operating materials and supplies 59 Space Exploration Equipment Space exploration equipment includes items that are intended to operate above the atmosphere for space exploration purposes and any specially designed equipment to aid service or operate other equipment engaged in exploring space MEASUREMENT 60 Federal mission PP E shall be valued using either the total cost or the latest acquisition cost valuation method 61 There is a presumption that the valuation method previously used by the entity was appropriate for the circumstances and therefore should be applied on a consistent basis Accordingly the preparer shall justify any changes in the use of a valuation method 18Weapons are instruments of combat used to destroy injure defeat or threaten an enemy adapted from Dictionary of Weapons and Military Terms 19Joint Chiefs of Staff Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms Joint Publication 1 02 March 23 1994 62 For purposes of this standard the total cost method is defined to include the actual acquisition cost of each item held plus the costs of any additions improvements alterations rehabilitations or replacements that extend the useful life of the Federal mission PP E 63 Under the latest acquisition cost method all like units that are held are valued at the invoice price of the most recent like item purchased less any discounts plus additional costs described in the following paragraphs 64 Using either cost valuation method the cost assigned to an item of PP E shall include all costs incurred to bring the Federal mission PP E to a form and location suitable for its intended use For example the cost of acquiring Federal mission PP E may include amounts paid to vendors transportation charges to the point of initial use handling and storage costs labor and other direct or indirect production costs for assets produced or constructed engineering architectural and other outside services for designs plans specifications and surveys acquisition and preparation costs of buildings and other facilities an appropriate share of the cost of the equipment and the facilities used in construction work fixed equipment and related installation costs required for activities in a building or a facility direct costs of inspection supervision and administration of construction contracts and construction work legal and recording fees and damage claims fair value of facilities and equipment donated to the government and material amounts of interest costs paid 20 65 No asset amount shall be shown on the balance sheet for Federal mission PP E 20 Interest costs include any reimbursable interest paid by the reporting entity directly to providers of goods or services related to the acquisition or construction of Federal mission PP E It excludes any interest costs paid by a reporting entity in financing its own debt 66 The acquisition cost of Federal mission PP E shall be considered an expense in determining the net costs of operations in the period acquired The cost of constructing improving reconstructing or renovating Federal mission PP E also shall be considered an expense in determining net costs in the period incurred 67 For acquisitions of Federal mission PP E where costs are incurred over a number of years the portion of the cost incurred during the reporting period shall be considered an expense in the period incurred in determining the net cost of operations and the total cost to date considered an acquisition in process cost in the required supplementary stewardship information MINIMUM REPORTING 68 Federal Mission PP E shall be reported as required supplementary stewardship information Reporting at the entity level for Federal mission PP E shall be more specific than at the governmentwide level At a minimum the following information shall be reported A description of major types of Federal mission PP E by the holding entity and the values assigned under the valuation method used The value of Federal mission PP E added and withdrawn during the year the increase or the decrease in value resulting from revaluations of assets held to latest acquisition cost and the end of year value for each major type of property using the entity s valuation method A description of the methods of acquisition and withdrawal of Federal mission PP E This should be reported at the major program or category level individual transactions unless significant need not be reported Condition21 of the assets unless it is already reported in a note to the financial statements in which case a reference to the note will suffice A reference to the applicable note to the financial statements if deferred maintenance is reported for the assets IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE 69 For guidance on Federal mission PP E previously recognized as assets for balance sheet reporting see SFFAS No 6 Accounting for Property Plant and Equipment paragraphs 55 and 56 70 For guidance on deferred maintenance reporting see SFFAS

assets above at or below acceptable condition or 3 narrative information CHAPTER 4 STEWARDSHIP LAND Stewardship Land Land not acquired for or in connection with22 items of general PP E that is stewardship land shall be reported as required supplementary stewardship information accompanying the financial statements of the Federal Government and the separate reports of component units of the Federal Government responsible for such land Stewardship land shall be reported in terms of physical units rather than cost fair value or other monetary values DEFINITION 71 Land is defined as the solid part of the surface of the earth Excluded from the definition are the natural resources that is depletable resources such as mineral deposits and petroleum renewable resources such as timber and the outer continental shelf resources related to land 72 Although the Federal Government holds vast amounts of proven and inferred natural resources the major reasons for addressing only surface land in this project were 1 the allotted time frame within which to complete this standard 2 existing studies that point out the difficulties and the complexities of accurately estimating and valuing natural resources and 3 disputes regarding the boundaries of the outer continental shelf 23 73 Land and land rights24 owned by the Federal Government and acquired for or in connection with items of general PP E shall be accounted for and reported as general PP E 74 Land and land rights owned by the Federal Government and not acquired for or in connection with items of general PP E will be reported as stewardship land Examples of stewardship land include land used as forests and parks and land used for wildlife and grazing 22 Acquired for or in connection with is defined as including land acquired with the intent to construct general PP E and land acquired in combination with general PP E including not only land used as the foundation but also adjacent land considered to be the general PP E s common grounds 23 The Board presently has an active project to address standards for natural resources 24 Land rights are interests and privileges held by the entity in land owned by others such as leaseholds easements water and water power rights diversion rights submersion rights rights of way mineral rights and other like interests in land MEASUREMENT 75 Stewardship land shall be quantified in terms of physical units for example acres rather than in monetary terms 76 No asset amount shall be shown on the balance sheet of the Federal financial statements for stewardship land 77 The acquisition cost of stewardship land shall be considered an expense in the period acquired when determining the net cost of operations 78 In some cases land may be acquired along with existing structures The following treatments may apply if the structure which would be deemed a heritage asset is significant in and of itself the entity shall use its judgement as to whether the acquisition cost shall be treated as the cost of stewardship land heritage asset or both if the structure is to be used in operations for example as general PP E but 1 the value of the structure is insignificant or 2 its acquisition is merely a byproduct of the acquisition of the land the cost in its entirety shall be treated as an acquisition of stewardship land or only significant structures that have an operating use such as a recently constructed hotel or employee housing block shall be treated as general PP E by identifying the cost attributable to general PP E and segregating it from the cost of the stewardship land acquired 79 However no amounts for stewardship land acquired through donation or devise25 shall be recognized as a cost in calculating net cost The fair value of the property if known and material shall be disclosed in notes to the financial statements If fair value is not estimable information related to the type and quantity of assets received shall be disclosed in the year received 80 Any costs to prepare stewardship land for its intended use for example razing a building shall be expensed as a part of the cost of stewardship land MINIMUM REPORTING 81 Reporting at the entity level for stewardship land shall be more specific than at the governmentwide level Minimum reporting shall include the following The number of physical units of stewardship land by category of major use broken down within that category by principal holding agency Where parcels of stewardship land have more than one use the predominant use of the land shall be considered the major use Examples of major uses of stewardship land include forests and wildlife grazing parks recreation and historic sites In cases where land has multiple uses none of which is predominant a description of the multiple uses shall be presented Acquisitions withdrawals and ending balance should be shown by major categories of use and methods of acquisition and withdrawal identified Reporting should be at the major category level individual transactions unless significant need not be reported The condition26 of the stewardship land unless it is already reported in a note to the financial statement in which case a reference to the note will suffice A reference to the note to the financial statements if deferred maintenance is reported for the assets 27 25 A will or clause of a will disposing of property IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE 82 For guidance relating to stewardship land that was previously recognized as assets for balance sheet reporting see SFFAS No 6 Accounting for Property Plant and

PROPERTY STANDARD Nonfederal Physical Property Expenses included in calculating net cost for nonfederal physical property programs shall be reported as investments in required supplementary stewardship information accompanying the financial statements of the Federal Government and the separate reports of component units of the Federal Government responsible for such investments Reporting will include data in nominal dollars on investment for the year being reported upon and the preceding 4 years Additional years data also may be reported if such data would provide a better indication of the nature of the investment DEFINITION 83 Investment in nonfederal physical property refers to those expenses incurred by the Federal Government for the purchase the construction or the major renovation of physical property owned by state and local governments including major additions alterations and replacements the purchase of major equipment and the purchase or improvement of other physical assets Grants for maintenance and operations are not considered investments MEASUREMENT 84 Expenses incurred The financial investment shall be measured on the same basis of accounting as used for financial statement purposes including appropriate accrual adjustments general and administrative overhead and costs of facilities 28 Amounts shall be reported in nominal dollars 85 Cash grants related to nonfederal physical property programs are recognized and reported as expenses in arriving at the net cost of operations 86 Expenses incurred for program costs contracts or grants with split purposes29 shall be reported on the basis of an allocation of the expenses If allocation is not feasible the investment shall be reported on the basis of the predominant application of the expense or transfer 28See Managerial Cost Accounting Concepts and Standards SFFAS No 4 for a full discussion of Federal cost accounting principles and standards 29 An example of an investment with a split purpose is a grant issued to a state to construct segments of the National Highway System and to conduct highway research MINIMUM REPORTING 87 Minimum reporting shall include the following Annual investment30 shall be reported including a description of Federallyowned physical property transferred to state and local governments This information will be provided for the year ended on the balance sheet date as well as for each of the 4 years preceding that year If data for additional years would provide a better indication of investment reporting of the additional years data is encouraged In those unusual instances when entities have no historical data only current reporting year data need be reported Reporting shall be at a meaningful category or level for example a major program or department Reporting of major investments at the entity level shall be more specific than at the governmentwide level In some cases the information called for above is not available because entities have maintained records on the basis of outlays rather than expenses For such entities to reconstruct their accounts on the basis of expense data may be impracticable Agencies in this situation will continue to report historical data on an outlay basis for any years for which reporting is required and for which expense data are not available If neither historical expense nor outlay data are available for each of the 5 years entities need report only expense data for the current reporting year and such other years as available At the end of 5 years however the agency will be able to report the expenses to be categorized as investments for nonfederal physical property rather than the outlays for each of the preceding 5 years Reporting shall include a description of major programs involving Federal investments in nonfederal physical property including a description of programs or policies under which non cash assets are transferred to state and local governments RECOMMENDED REPORTING 88 Reporting of the amount of significant state and local total contributions to shared or joint programs is encouraged but is not required If it is known however that other contributions in a significant amount were made that fact for example expressed as a percentage of the total program shall be reported even if the exact amount of the contribution is not known 30As defined in this standard annual investment includes more than the annual expenditure reported by character class for budget execution Annual investment is the full cost of the investment Full cost shall be measured and accounted for in accordance with Managerial Cost Accounting Concepts and Standards SFFAS No 4 CHAPTER 6 HUMAN CAPITAL Human Capital Expenses included in calculating net cost for education and training programs that are intended to increase or maintain national economic productive capacity shall be reported as investments in human capital as required supplementary stewardship information accompanying the financial statements of the Federal Government and its component units Continued categorization of expenses as investments for stewardship purposes is predicated on demonstrated outputs and outcomes consistent with the intent of the program Reporting will ordinarily include data in nominal dollars on investment for the year being reported upon and the preceding 4 years Additional years data also may be reported if such data would provide a better indication of the investment DEFINITION 89 Investment in human capital refers to those expenses incurred for programs for education and training of the public that are intended to maintain or increase national productive capacity and that produce outputs and outcomes that provide evidence of maintaining or increasing national productive capacity 90 The definition excludes education and training expenses for Federal civilian and military personnel It also excludes education and training expenses whose purpose is not maintaining or enhancing national productive capacity MEASUREMENT 91 Expenses incurred The investment shall be measured on the same basis of accounting as used for financial statements including appropriate accrual adjustments general and administrative overhead and costs of facilities 31 Amounts shall be reported in nominal dollars 92 Expenses incurred for programs contracts or grants with split purposes32 shall be reported on the basis of an allocation of the investment expenses If allocation is not feasible the investment shall be reported on the basis of the predominant

reported measures and the program s purpose Examples of human capital output are high school and college graduates as a percentage of population over 25 Outcome An assessment of the results of a program compared to its intended purpose Outcomes shall 1 be capable of being described in financial economic or quantitative terms and 2 provide a plausible basis for concluding that the program has had or will have its intended effect Examples of human capital outcomes are program graduates obtaining jobs within 2 months of program completion or program graduates obtaining jobs making more money than they previously received on Federal aid MINIMUM REPORTING 94 Minimum reporting shall consist of The annual investment34 made in the year ended on the balance sheet date as well as in each of the 4 years preceding that year shall be reported If data for additional years would provide a better indication of investment reporting of the additional years data is encouraged In those unusual instances when entities have no historical data only current reporting year data need be reported Reporting shall be at a meaningful category or level for example a major program or department

expectation of maintaining or increasing national economic productive capacity or yielding other future benefits Research and development is composed of Basic research systematic study to gain knowledge or understanding of the fundamental aspects of phenomena and of observable facts without specific applications toward processes or products in mind Applied research systematic study to gain knowledge or understanding necessary for determining the means by which a recognized and specific need may be met and Development systematic use of the knowledge and understanding gained from research for the production of useful materials devices systems or methods including the design and development of prototypes and processes 35 35See OMB Circular A 11 section 44 MEASUREMENT 97 Expenses

shall be systematically or periodically captured through an accounting or management information system and 2 there shall be a logical connection between the reported measures and the program s purpose In research and development programs this might consist of data for the year concerning the number of new projects initiated the number continued from the prior year the number completed and the number terminated It also might consist of such quantitative measures as bibliometrics for example publication counts citation counts and analysis and peer evaluation patent counts and analysis and science indicators that assess the ongoing vitality of the research for example statistics on scientific and engineering personnel graduate students and degree recipients by field and sector 39

grant issued to a teaching hospital to perform both medical education and medical research 38The research and development outputs and outcomes should be the same as those measured for the Government Performance and Results Act GPRA and the budget and will be reported in a Statement of Program Performance Measures as described in Appendix 1 F to Entity and Display SFFAC No 2 39 Research Funding as an Investment Can We Measure the Returns A Technical Memorandum Congress of the United States Office of Technology Assessment Apr 1986 Outcome An assessment of the results of a program compared to its intended purpose Because of the difficulty of measuring such results for research and development programs in financial economic or quantitative terms outcome data for such programs are expected to consist typically of a narrative discussion of the major results achieved by the program during the year along the following lines Basic Research an identification of any major new discoveries that were made during the year Applied Research an identification of any major new applications that were developed during the year or Development the progress of major developmental projects including the results with respect to projects completed or otherwise terminated during the year and the status of projects that will continue The information provided concerning outcomes should be chosen to provide in concise form a plausible basis for judging the extent to which the program is achieving its purpose MINIMUM REPORTING 100 Minimum reporting shall consist of the following The annual investment40 made in the year ended on the balance sheet date as well as in each of the 4 years preceding that year shall be reported If data for additional years would provide a better indication of

that other contributions in a significant amount were made that fact for example expressed as a percentage of the total program may be reported even if the exact amount of the contribution is not known CHAPTER 8 CURRENT SERVICES ASSESSMENT Current Services Assessment A Current Services Assessment CSA on the basis of receipt and outlay data as published in the President s Budget will be reported for all programs for the base year and 6 years subsequent to the base year Base year data will be actual receipt and outlay data for the last completed fiscal year projected data will be receipt and outlay data that are included in the current services estimates in the President s Budget published after the close of the base year The data would be presented as required supplementary stewardship information accompanying the consolidated financial statements of the Federal Government but not in individual reports of its component units Reporting of projected data for additional years is encouraged where it would be useful and relevant 102 A Current Services Assessment provides receipt and outlay data on the basis of projections of future activities It is relevant for assessing the sustainability of programs established by current law that is the sufficiency of future resources to sustain public services and to meet obligations as they come due The CSA focuses on the totality of government operations rather than on individual programs It provides an analytical perspective on the Government because it shows the short and long term direction of current programs MEASUREMENT 103 CSA will present receipt and outlay data published in the President s Budget Data will be presented for all programs for the base year and at least 6 years subsequent to the base year summarized in sufficient detail to identify at least 1 receipts by major source e g individual income taxes social insurance taxes etc 2 outlays for the defense Social Security Medicare and net interest functions 3 allother receipts and outlays and 4 the deficit or surplus The base year is the year for which the financial statements are being prepared Reporting of projected data for additional years is encouraged where it would be useful and relevant 104 CSA data for the 6 year projection will be identical to projected data published in the President s Budget for the same period Base year data will be actual receipt and outlay data for the last completed fiscal year projected data will be the current services estimates of receipt and outlay data that are included in the President s Budget published after the close of the base year MINIMUM REPORTING Governmentwide Report of the Federal Government 105 The CSA shall present flow data as described in the two preceding paragraphs for inclusion in the consolidated financial report of the US Government 106 Preparers of financial reports are encouraged to experiment with the presentation of the CSA data in order to make it more understandable 107 In some cases summary data will be more effective than detailed data There may be situations too where graphic presentations will be more effective than tabular presentations Reporting Entities of the Federal Government 108 None APPENDIX A BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS 109 This appendix provides a discussion of the more significant comments that the Board received from respondents to the exposure draft Supplementary Stewardship Reporting dated August 1995 and from testimony at a public hearing on the exposure draft that was held December 5 1995 110 Responses overall were generally favorable to the concept of reporting stewardship information In some cases respondents had questions about the specific reporting requirements or requested clarification on particular items Where feasible these areas were addressed or clarified in the final standards in this Statement In the case of issues raised by the respondents this appendix explains the basis of the Board s conclusions THE NATURE OF STEWARDSHIP REPORTING 111 The exposure draft presented the Board s approach to reporting in a manner other than is done in the basic financial statements for those items that it has categorized as stewardship items As the Board stated in the Introduction and Background chapter of this Statement it believes that these stewardship items warrant specialized reporting to highlight their importance and to portray them in additional ways than provided by financial accounting The Board designated a new category of reporting to highlight the unique nature of stewardship reporting Required Supplemental Stewardship Information RSSI 112 Some respondents believed that although reporting on stewardship items might be warranted a separate manner of reporting might not They believed that stewardship reporting could be accommodated either within the basic financial statements for example as a note or as Required Supplemental Information RSI They did not see the need for the separate category of RSSI 113 The Board however believes that a new category for reporting on stewardship items is more appropriate If stewardship information were required to be reported in a note to the basic financial statements it would be subject to the same level of audit scrutiny as that of the basic financial statements Since some of the stewardship information is non financial for example physical units and other data is based on projections or assumptions the same degree of audit coverage as that of the basic financial statements for these items may not be appropriate Such data is not drawn directly from the financial records Thus reliance on financial records for audit backup would not be feasible 114 On the other hand the Board believes that certain stewardship information should receive more audit scrutiny than it would if it were RSI For RSI the auditor reviews the data for overall compliance with associated guidance and for consonance with the basic financial statements The auditor usually provides in depth review of the RSI only if there appears to be some problem with the data If he or she believes that the data is not fairly presented the auditor still may issue a clean opinion on the basic financial statements while noting that there are problems with the RSI 115 Therefore the Board has proposed that a new category RSSI be designated to cover stewardship reporting By developing this new category it is anticipated that audit standards will be developed to address the specific items in that category Although the Board does not have authority to set audit standards it established RSSI with the expectation that OMB and GAO will in collaboration determine appropriate audit procedures for this information SOCIAL INSURANCE 116 Consideration of guidance for the recognition measurement and display of obligations for social insurance programs has continued to present the Board with significant vexing theoretical and practical problems The Board notes the strength of feelings of respondents and commentators some of whom believe a liability should be recognized for amounts that will be paid in future periods to or on behalf of current or future program beneficiaries and others who believe that there is no obligation associated with these programs that meets the definition of a liability other than amounts due and payable at the end of an accounting period additionally some favor disclosure of projected data relating to the magnitude of the present value of future net benefit payments at a particular date while others favor cash flow information for a long period of time The Board notes too the magnitude and complexity of these programs and the extreme sensitivity of projections relating to the programs to assumptions whose range of possibilities is large More importantly the Board notes that social insurance programs are presently being studied and discussed frequently and seriously within government and by the public a report and recommendations are expected shortly from the 1994 95 Quadrennial Advisory Council on Social Security The prospects of significant changes to the programs are reasonably high 117 After deliberating the issue the Board has concluded that additional investigation and further deliberation is required and has directed the FASAB staff to continue to research social insurance issues focusing especially on identifying the characteristics of programs which should cause them to be subject to the guidance provided in a Statement on Social Insurance the appropriate display of information in the financial statements the identification of additional information if any which should be required for social insurance programs the means for measurement of financial data included in such additional information and the desirability of nonfinancial indicators ratios of data to GDP or covered payroll to describe the status of programs or the implications of potential changes to or needs of the programs The Board has instructed the staff to be mindful of all current developments in structuring its research and its recommendations EXPENSING STEWARDSHIP PP E 118 Echoing their earlier comments to the Board s Exposure Draft Accounting for Property Plant and Equipment some respondents expressed concern that expensing rather than capitalizing costs associated with stewardship PP E would lessen the value of the operating statement as a tool for performance measurement since it would overstate the cost in the year an asset is acquired 119 The Board however believes that capitalizing and depreciating stewardship PP E provides information that is of little usefulness Stewardship PP E includes heritage assets Federal mission PP E and stewardship land Period costs related to stewardship PP E are of diminished usefulness because of uncertain useful life e g heritage assets Federal mission PP E uncertain historical cost basis e g stewardship land or probability of being destroyed in use e g Federal mission PP E Therefore the Board believes that attempting to capitalize and depreciate stewardship PP E is not warranted It believes that reporting on information related to the existence and the condition of the stewardship PP E has more relevance to decision makers and other users of the financial report COSTING OF FEDERAL MISSION PP E 120 Respondents to the Board s question on whether the alternatives of presenting costs of Federal mission PP E in terms of either total historical or latest acquisition cost generally believed that both options should not be allowed Some believed that use of alternative methods would not ensure consistency in reporting Others believed that only total historical costs should be used Still others believed that total historical cost should be the long term goal with the use of latest acquisition cost allowed only until such historical cost data would be available 121 The Board however recognizes that significant practical problems may arise if an agency is compelled to adopt a specified costing approach for reporting stewardship assets and that such cost approach would not be used for computing the net cost of operations Therefore it believes that its decision to accept either the historical cost or latest acquisition cost method is appropriate However it also emphasizes that once a method is chosen an entity should switch to the other method only with appropriate justification REPORTING EXPENSE OR OUTLAY DATA 122 The standards require that expense data be reported for investments in human capital research and development and nonfederal physical property The standards also provide for a period of 5 years to transition to reporting expense data for those agencies that currently maintain only outlay data Some Board members suggested that since some agencies currently maintain only outlay data requiring that only outlay data be reported might be more practical However the responses reflected a clear consensus for reporting expenses with little or no support for reporting outlays only and a minority preferring to report both expenses and outlays Therefore the standards as proposed remain unchanged REQUEST FOR MORE SPECIFICITY IN REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 123 When the Board developed the standards for stewardship reporting its intention was to provide overall guidance on definitions recognition measurement and minimum and recommended reporting This broad guidance was intended to provide the basic reporting requirements while allowing each entity maximum flexibility in such areas as determining what constitutes the individual stewardship items for that entity which costs are directly attributable to the stewardship item and how best to report on multi use items so that users will gain the best picture of the entity s financial and performance information 124 The Board believes that the desire for more specific guidance expressed by several respondents stems from the belief that without such guidance an entity s determination of how to apply the standards could be questioned Nevertheless the Board reiterates its position that entities should be provided maximum flexibility when applying the stewardship standards However entities should make the determination of how best to apply the stewardship standards based on a thorough analysis of their individual entity including its mission financial practices and the impact of its mission and operation on financial report users and on the Nation Finally all entity determinations of the applicability of stewardship standards should be thoroughly documented ISSUES FOR WHICH CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE PROPOSED STANDARDS 125 Multiple Category Reporting Some respondents were concerned that there would be double counting if as proposed by the standards some stewardship items would be reported in two separate categories for example Yellowstone National Park would be reported as a heritage asset and as stewardship land 126 Reporting supplementary stewardship information in two categories will not be deemed double counting This is because where multiple reporting is required the units of measure are different for each of the stewardship categories In the example above Yellowstone National Park would be reported under a category such as National Parks as one of the total number of heritage assets under the auspices of the Department of the Interior it also would be reported by the number of acres that it occupies under the stewardship land category for the Department To clarify this point the discussion of the process of multiple reporting was expanded in the statement to explain that the Board does not consider this reporting as double counting 127 Reporting the Fair Value for Stewardship PP E Transferred to State or Local Governments Many respondents questioned the need for and the cost benefit of requiring that the fair value of stewardship PP E transferred to state and local governments be reported They stated that monetary values for stewardship PP E are not required to be reported because such values are either difficult to obtain e g lack of historical cost data on land acquired at the birth of the Nation or not meaningful e g the historical cost to build the Washington Monument Therefore they questioned the cost benefit of requiring that the fair value of stewardship property transferred to state and local governments be determined and reported 128 The Board agreed that the fair value of stewardship property transferred to state and local governments need not be determined and reported The standards have been revised to require a description of the property transfer transaction if the fair value is known nothing would preclude reporting it EFFECTIVE DATE FOR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 129 In considering required reporting of stewardship information the Board became increasingly aware of the need to be highly selective in proposing requirements for the consolidated financial report of the Federal Government It recognized the potential for implementation problems in the first few years after the effective date of this statement In addition to the normal problems associated with adapting to new standards several of these standards provide for a transition period during which agencies may or in some cases may not report investments in human capital research and development and nonfederal physical property if investments are reported for each of five years as called for in this statement they may be reported for earlier years during the transition period on the basis of either outlays or expense The merit of reporting the aggregate of information prepared on different bases is questionable 130 Further the information required to be reported by these standards goes beyond that customarily accompanying financial reports of governments or commercial enterprises Standards related to heritage assets and stewardship land call for reporting in terms of physical units e g number of parks or acres of land rather than in terms of historical cost Implementation problems are foreseen at the consolidated statement level because of differing measures Also the Board is concerned with the possibility of establishing requirements so detailed as to render the consolidated financial report unwieldy unfriendly to the potential user and obfuscating of important information 131 Because of these possible implementation problems and the need to consider other disclosures or presentations the Board expressed a desire for further deliberations relative to the consolidated financial report of the Federal Government 132 Accordingly the effective date of this statement will be for fiscal years beginning after September 30 1997 as it relates to financial statements of component units of the Federal Government this same effective date applies to chapter 8 as it relates to the consolidated financial statements of the Federal Government The effective date of the statement as it applies to the consolidated financial statements except for chapter 8 is deferred pending further deliberations of the Board In the interim the consolidated financial reports should include such summary or selected information as is feasible Experimentation is encouraged as is the reporting of such additional information as will enhance the financial report REPORTING OF INFORMATION NOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED IN THE STANDARDS 133 Some respondents requested that the standards provide for reporting additional information such as transfers of stewardship property to foreign governments stewardship land sold to the private sector the Federal Government s interest in such things as property held by nonfederal entities or patents generated through Federal research and development funds and foreign contributions to Federal programs 134 In developing the standards for stewardship reporting the Board concentrated on providing guidance in the principal areas of stewardship resources that have materiality for the majority of Federal entities and for the consolidated financial reporting for the Nation The Board s intent was to ensure that these significant areas if material for an entity would be reported regularly and in a consistent manner 135 In some cases an entity may have other resources or obligations that were not specifically addressed in the stewardship standards but that the entity believes may be material to the presentation of its stewardship information In such cases if the reporting of such additional data would be useful and relevant to readers and would provide a better indication of the resources and obligations of the entity the Board encourages such reporting APPENDIX B SAMPLE REPORTS NOTE The sample report sections in Appendix B are intended to illustrate the type of reporting contemplated by the Board Certain data are taken from various reports for one or more recent years and are actual data Other data have been estimated by judgmentally extrapolating from actual data Still other data and program references have been fabricated and are hypothetical Therefore readers should not rely on the validity of the data in the sample reports Specific form and content guidance on financial reports will be provided by OMB HERITAGE ASSETS ANNUAL STEWARDSHIP INFORMATION Heritage assets are PP E that possess one or more of the following characteristics historical or natural significance cultural educational or aesthetic value or significant architectural characteristics The cost of heritage assets is not often relevant or determinable In addition the useful life of heritage assets is generally not reasonably estimable for depreciation purposes The most relevant information about heritage assets is their existence and condition Therefore heritage assets are reported in terms of physical units Various agencies operate and maintain heritage assets During the period maintenance expense is recognized as incurred However certain maintenance was deferred over the past several years Below is information on deferred maintenance on stewardship assets Summary of Deferred Maintenance as of September 30 199Z in Millions of Dollars aCondition Assessment Survey CAS bSee accompanying notes to the financial statement for the reporting of condition of Heritage Assets cMany paintings were refurbished at a cost of 5 million Refurbishment was required because of deficient climate control equipment dDuring the fiscal year three complete collections of manuscripts and historical papers with an estimated value of 17 million were donated to the library collection eThe number of deletions was negligible FEDERAL MISSION PROPERTY PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ANNUAL STEWARDSHIP INFORMATION Federal mission property plant and equipment PP E comprise certain PP E that possess at least one of each of the two types of the following characteristics relating to the use of the property and its useful life Characteristics related to use are that it has no expected nongovernmental alternative use is held for use in the event of an emergency a war or a natural disaster or is used in a program for which there is no other comparable program Federal or nonfederal using similar PP E Characteristics related to useful life are that it has an indeterminate or an unpredictable useful life because of the unusual manner in which it is used improved retired modified or maintained or is at a very high risk of being destroyed during use or of premature obsolescence Generally accepted government accounting standards specifically recognize weapons systems and space exploration facilities and equipment as Federal mission PP E At this time only weapons systems and space exploration equipment have been identified as Federal mission PP E for this entity In the display that follows items included under the caption weapons systems are valued at the most recent acquisition cost of a comparable item Those under the caption space exploration are valued using the specific identification method that is the specific cost of each unit of PP E is attributed to that unit In each category cost includes all costs to put the item in usable condition for its intended purpose including among others transportation assembly and inspection costs The value of land associated with the facilities included among Federal mission PP E is not included in the display that follows Land data are included in a separate section of this information entitled Stewardship Land Virtually all items of Federal mission PP E are useable for their intended purposes at September 30 199Z In some cases however scheduled maintenance has been deferred On the basis of engineering estimates the estimated cost of deferred maintenance ranges from 200 to 300 million in 199Z and 175 to 275 million in 199Y Costs to complete critical maintenance that is maintenance that if not performed could lead to irreparable damage to the PP E or to its unusability range from 120 to 150 million On the following page is a summary of changes in Federal mission PP E for the fiscal years ended September 30 199Z FEDERAL MISSION PROPERTY PLANT AND EQUIPMENT SUMMARYf Annual Stewardship Informationg For the Fiscal Year Ended September

adjustments column 2 and deletions and additions columns 3 and 4 hIncluded as expense in calculating net cost iFacilities include tracking launching and training facilities STEWARDSHIP LAND ANNUAL STEWARDSHIP INFORMATION Land is defined as the solid part of the surface of the earth Excluded from the definition of land for reporting purposes here are materials beneath the surface that is depletable resources such as mineral deposits and petroleum the space above the surface that is renewable resources such as timber and the outer continental shelf resources These materials will be addressed in a future standard The Federal Government holds approximately 650 million acres of land Land that is acquired for or in connection with items of general PP E are reported on the balance sheet Land that is not acquired for or in connection with items of general PP E is considered stewardship land Of the total amount of land held by the Federal Government about 617 million acres are considered stewardship land The cost or value of stewardship land is often not determinable The most relevant information about stewardship land is its existence condition and use Therefore stewardship land is reported in terms of physical units rather than cost fair value or other monetary values The major uses of stewardship land are for forests wildlife grazing parks recreation and historic sites Where parcels of stewardship land have more than one use the predominant use of the land is considered the major use Two Federal agencies are responsible for maintaining virtually all stewardship land held by the Federal Government the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture Virtually all stewardship land is useable for its purposes at September 30 1994 In some cases however scheduled maintenance has been deferred Estimates of costs to complete critical maintenance range from 40 to 50 million Critical maintenance refers to maintenance that if not performed could lead to irreparable damage to the assets or to unusability On the basis of engineering estimates the estimated cost of deferred maintenance ranges from 75 to 100 million in 199Z On the following page is a summary of the stewardship land by category of major use broken down within each category by principal holding agency at September 30 199Z jSee accompanying notes to the financial statements for the

PROPERTY ANNUAL STEWARDSHIP INFORMATION For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 199Z Annually the Federal Government provides funding to state and local governments for the purchase the construction or the major renovation of physical property owned by state and local governments additionally from time to time the Federal Government transfers PP E to these governments in exchange for less than fair value These grants and transfers relate to roads and transportation systems clean water and environmental projects and other projects for the common good The investments in nonfederal physical property in the 5 years from 199V to 199Z were as follows in billions of dollars 199V199W199X199Y199Zm Transportation 19 0 20 0 20 0 22 0 23 0 Natural Resources and Environment3 74 03 93 74 2

category the fair value of land and facilities associated with former military installations that were transferred to local governments approximated 40 million in 199Y and 52 million in 199Z Certain transportation and environmental programs involving Federal investments of 22 billion and 4 billion respectively in 199Z required matching support by local governments of about 20 percent and 80 percent of the Federal grants mIncluded as expenses in calculating net cost nExpenses of administration include an appropriate allocation of agency overhead costs HUMAN CAPITAL ANNUAL STEWARDSHIP INFORMATION For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 199Z Federal investment in human capital comprises those expenses for education and training programs for the general public that are intended to increase or maintain national economic productive capacity It does not include expenses for internal Federal education and training Expense data are expressed in nominal dollars for the fiscal year being reported upon and the preceding 4 fiscal years Following is a summary of stewardship data for the program entitled Transition Training for Former Navy Contractor Personnelo for the 5 fiscal years ending September 30 199V through 199Z Program Transition Training for Former Navy Contractor Personnel oThis hypothetical program is for illustration only pIncluded as expenses in calculating net cost qExpenses are reported on an accrual basis including contractual amounts due for counseling services delivered and educational costs incurred by participants rExpenses of administration include an appropriate allocation of agency overhead costs HUMAN CAPITAL SAMPLE REPORT continued Program Outcomes Preliminary data appear to confirm that the services provided by the program accelerate the transition of participants into alternative employment some savings are realized in the Unemployment Insurance Fund A follow up survey of the 415 participants in the year 199W showed that 80 were earning at least as much as they were earning in their Navy contractor positions A more extensive evaluation including an assessment of effects on long term earnings is currently planned for completion in 1999 Narrative Discussion This program was authorized in 19XX by P L XX XXX to ease the transition into other civilian positions of skilled technical administrative and managerial personnel who are no longer needed in certain shipyards because of declining orders for Navy ship construction Eligibility is limited to those who have been employed at designated shipyards for at least 5 years but who are not yet eligible for retirement benefits Participants receive intensive counseling to help them develop individual transition plans This counseling is provided by a private job placement service under contract Participants are then reimbursed up to 5 000 per year for up to 2 years not to exceed 80 percent of the cost of the cost of tuition fees books and other student materials required for attendance at approved educational institutions An additional increment of education or technical training is expected to reduce the period of transitional unemployment and increase the subsequent earnings of participants RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ANNUAL STEWARDSHIP INFORMATION For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 199Z Federal investment in research and development comprises those expenses for basic research applied research and development that are intended to increase or maintain national economic productive capacity or yield other benefits Expense data are expressed in nominal dollars for the fiscal year being reported upon and the preceding 4 FYs Following is a summary of stewardship data for the Ceramic Materials Research Programs for the 5 fiscal years ending September 30 199V through 199Z Program Ceramic Materials Research Program sThis hypothetical program is for illustration only tIncluded as expenses in calculating net cost uExpenses are reported on an accrual basis and include an allocation of overhead costs vDevelopment grants are for a fixed amount not to exceed 50 percent of the cost of the project wIndicates inventions financed with Federal funds to which the government has patent rights in accordance with the Bayh Dole Act RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SAMPLE REPORT continued Programs Outcomes The increasing number of articles published on the basis of funded research including announcements of several newly discovered properties of certain composite ceramics is evidence of the utility of this part of the program The number of patents emerging from the program is also increasing primarily from the development component of the program Narrative Discussion This program was authorized in 19XX by P L XX XXX to accelerate the development of this industry in the United States The research element of the program operates through interagency agreements with the Federal laboratories and grants to university researchers The researchers are selected through peer review procedures The development component provides grants to private firms to develop improved manufacturing procedures for ceramic materials based products and to accelerate the development of marketable products incorporating advanced ceramic materials CURRENT SERVICES ASSESSMENT ANNUAL STEWARDSHIP INFORMATION A Current Services Assessment CSA provides
