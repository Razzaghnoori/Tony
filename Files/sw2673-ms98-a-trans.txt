        okay so um seeing were both from different parts of the country um i imagine that uh social changes have happened in both areas but you know is rapid im not sure could you tell me some of the things thats happened in your area     well i thought the second part of the question you know how do you perceive life in the United States differently you know as opposed to ten to fifteen years ago um   yeah   you know that one  my oldest children are are fifteen so thats huh you know that that was immediately what clicked in my head what do i see now different than i do you know when they were born   when they were born yeah   you know um i have my oldest are two girls they are fifteen and fourteen   oh boy   so not quite fourteen the um i think were seeing lots and lots of  of changes as regarding families you know at that point i felt like i was one of the few people that truly wanted to children and now i think youre seeing that a little bit more its coming back again   oh is that right   and       but people are certainly having their children their families later you know its not   uh yeah in some cases uh   and the ones that are having them earlier theyre having them a lot earlier  like eleven  or ten   thats yeah thats early uh i was kind of young i i got married as soon as i got out of school and started raising a family so   umhum   uh my oldest is uh thirty four and my youngest is going to be twenty six   uhhuh uhhuh   uh   so that uh       definitely makes a difference my husband was quite a bit older when we married and we decided to you know we wanted to to get our family pretty quick you know and   yeah right yeah   um that was you know really a definitely uh identifying factor you know we began   yeah i dont i im not sure about that  excuse me   in having a well i know that uh here in Dallas we have the unfortunate um reputation as being i think its the fifth largest of uh im trying to think how that was fifth on the list of teenage mothers in the United States   is that right   oh yeah we have i think in nineteen it seems like the statistic was for nineteen eighty eight       in Dallas County there were   yeah the problem yeah   i want to say three hundred and fifteen gosh that seems like an awful lot   well   of children born to mothers under the age of thirteen   oh yeah but  under thirteen probably what do you contribute that to then as compared to say uh uh twenty years ago you know with with children   it cant be education because you know theres more and more family related issues being raised at school um you know theyre lot more progressive more pointed sex education programs all over the country   yeah right right right i grew up in kind of uh there was a rural area and there was nothing but farms and mostly mostly dairy and orchards apple orchards and you know peach orchards uh   one thing that i really see a difference and i guess you know overall uh you know that its a negative is that you know these kids and we live in suburban a suburban area of Dallas   yeah   these kids do not have the aunts and uncles the cousins you know that builtin kind of security you know   why because were a more mobile society   yeah i think so   uh people are just moving out getting jobs and our families on   you know of course you have lots and lots of moms working   thats thats a big problem because at least i i see that up here when when i was growing up and going to school uh people never locked their doors and uh you know you had family that was   thats right   generally in the area most people kind of stayed put you know very few moved away   uhhuh   um     so theres kind of a nucleus of cohesion there   right   that you could rely on you know if you were ready to just you know   yeah i think the whole country back then was naive   strangle your parents you kind of had course theres just a different uh just different feeling as to who whos in control i dont think we ever talked about childrens rights   yeah   you know we didnt talk about womens rights  you know we sure didnt talk about kids rights   yeah right and and right children have children have responsibility but i think the the biggest thing now is that uh information is is passed on a lot quicker with with TV and radio and uh   oh yeah   uh children are under a lot more pressure because from their peers than than it used to be   well you know i can remember as a teenager   um   you know we would get things fashion wise you know we always consider considered Dallas the third coast you know i mean you know feel very uh um   yes right yeah   always felt like we were on the edge of of new trends and you know i had a lot of uh friends and in   right   Wyoming and Utah and Colorado because thats where my parents were from   uh   and we would go there they were always seeing movies that had been here six months before and they were wearing clothes and saying lingo using new lingo that   yeah   we heard way before and so we always felt you know a little you know kind of thumb your nose and   yeah   but now thats not so you know if those those those parts of the country arent behind you know theyre getting the movies if not you know   thats right   right at the same time theyre getting them you know six weeks later its not you know not so   yeah yeah um   and yet i think i think were really evolving right now i you know the seventies and eighties were so uh get all you can cause you may not be here tomorrow and money hungry  i think were seeing some comeback to family um   yeah i think i yeah its uh a family unit yes um but you cant trust anybody anymore   its its a different family unit though   yes it is   you know its not the same that we  traditionally thought of   no it it goes back i guess way way back  peo ple had a lot of children and they and they they were kind of uh they most of them were on farms i guess or they worked in factories at least in the east you know my father my grandfather and his father before him always worked at this place so then i would work at this place   uhhuh uhhuh   um out in the rural areas we were always farmers or was always going to be farmers so you had a lot of children they kind of money didnt seem to be important back then   when we uh moved to this particular town this a suburb of Dallas ten years ago there was still a lot lot of agriculture of of land that was used for agricultural purposes and that is just you know every year just a little bit more a little bit more slips away   so   yeah but with a uh  excuse me with a uh run by families or or were the younger children going out into the world and then they were bringing in   i dont know um   you know labor is to to take care of the crops   i think probably main a lot of it was you know contract labor um   because the kids wanted something more i guess   yeah the kids want something more theres a great deal of respect in this area for agriculture and for the foundation that it has given this particular community and we still have a couple of very viable families who are you know make large contributions time money you know emotionally to the community and preservation preservation of its heritage but we dont uh   yeah   you know but but even their concerns are becoming more diversified   yeah i i your   but you know one thing that and this is just totally off the wall but its another uh another element as we see the encroachment of of progress on just the ecosystem ecosystem when we moved here and the the fields were mowed every summer we would have this massive influx of crickets   right   from the fields into our homes you know just  i mean crickets so thick you couldnt walk without stepping on them   yeah   and course that then brought different birds that didnt normally come to our area and i dont know what all other effects on the ecosystem because thats not my bailiwick but see we dont have that anymore   yeah   so you wonder what other little   mans changed it   uhhuh i was reading in uh i think it was the Readers Digest just earlier in the week about
