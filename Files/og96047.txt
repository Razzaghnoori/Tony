were published in the Federal Register as final rules on August 20 1996 61 Fed Reg 42979 and 61 Fed Reg 42970 The first listed rule provides for a catastrophic risk protection plan of crop insurance and the second rule provides noninsured producers policyholders and insurance companies the regulations applicable to the catastrophic risk protection program This new catastrophic risk protection

Federal Crop Insurance Corporation Page 2 GAO OGC 96 47 ENCLOSURE ANALYSIS UNDER 5 U S C 801 a 1 B i iv OF TWO MAJOR RULES ISSUED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE FEDERAL CROP INSURANCE CORPORATION ENTITLED CATASTROPHIC RISK PROTECTION ENDORSEMENT RIN 0563 AB09 AND GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS FEDERAL CROP INSURANCE REFORM ACT OF 1994 REGULATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION RIN 0563 AB11 i Cost benefit analysis The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation FCIC prepared a cost benefit analysis in connection with the final rules The costs and benefits discussed in the analysis consider both rules The analysis estimated 25 million in savings associated with requiring a producer to obtain at least catastrophic coverage for any crop of economic significance as a condition of receiving benefits for that crop under certain Department of Agriculture programs linkage requirement or signing a waiver for eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance A 3 million cost resulting from the loss of revenue is estimated from the tobacco marketing card and the undivided interest language which allows a landowner to obtain catastrophic coverage to satisfy the linkage requirement for all other landowners who hold an undivided interest in given insurable acreage Therefore a 22 million annual savings is estimated to result from the rules In addition the rule is expected to result in less volatility of producers incomes and less risk of no income due to adverse weather events and rural communities and producers will benefit from the certainty of payments in times of catastrophic yield losses The Government benefits from a single disaster protection program as opposed to the previous ad hoc disaster programs and reduced Federal outlays ii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 U S C 603 605 607 and 609 Pursuant to section 605 b of the Act FCIC certified in the preambles to both the interim rules 60 Fed Reg 2000 and 1996 January 6 1995 and the final rules 61 Fed Reg 42980 and 42970 August 20 1996 that the rules would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities Therefore there was no requirement to prepare an initial or final regulatory flexibility analysis under sections 603 or 604 of the Act For the same reason sections 607 and 609 are inapplicable GAO OGC 96 47 However the preambles to the final rules do discuss additional flexibility and cost savings for small entities in several areas First producers are no longer required to obtain at least catastrophic coverage for economically significant crops but may sign a waiver foregoing emergency crop loss assistance Second all producers with a share in a tobacco crop are allowed to be under one marketing card to insure the crop under one insurance policy Finally with certain restrictions persons who hold an undivided interest in a crop may be eligible to purchase one insurance policy covering all shares to satisfy linkage requirements thereby not having to pay the 50 processing fee in these situations According to an official at FCIC publication of the certifications in the Federal Register was treated as providing notice under section 605 b to the Small Business Administration s SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy The SBA has confirmed that some agencies follow this practice without objection from SBA iii Agency actions relevant to sections 202 205 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 2 U S C 1532 1535 In the preambles to the final rules FCIC explains that the rules do not contain a Federal mandate under Title 2 of the Act for State local or tribal governments or the private sector and therefore sections 202 and 205 of the Act are inapplicable In addition the final rules do not affect small governments or contain a significant intergovernmental mandate Accordingly sections 203 and 204 of the Act which require agencies to consult with small governments and solicit input from State local and tribal governments are also inapplicable iv Other relevant information or requirements under Acts and Executive orders Administrative Procedure Act 5 U S C 551 et seq The rules were promulgated through the notice and comment rulemaking procedures of the Act 5 U S C 553 Because the Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994 required that the statutory changes be implemented by the 1995 crop year and many of the changes were mandated by the statute FCIC invoked the exception to the notice and comment requirements contained in 5 U S C 553 b B that it would be impractical and contrary to the public interest to publish the rules prior to making the rules effective Therefore the rules were published as interim rules rather than as proposed rules However a 60 day period was afforded for comments to be submitted on the interim rules which period was reopened on August 7 1995 and extended to August 18 1995 Forty comments were received and considered prior to the issuance of the final rules Each of the comments and the response and changes Page 2 GAO OGC 96 47 made by the FCIC based on such comments are discussed in the preambles to the final rules Paperwork Reduction Act 44 U S C 3501 3520 The information collections contained in the rules which include the Crop Insurance Application and Crop Insurance Acreage Report were submitted to the Office of Management and Budget OMB for approval as required by the Act The submittal which was made available to the public contained the reasons for collecting the information and the burden estimates as required by the Act On March 22 1996 OMB approved the information collection and assigned OMB Control No 0563 003 Statutory authorization for the rules The Corporation is authorized under 5 U S C 1506 l and p to issue regulations to carry out the function of providing crop insurance These rules implement section 106 of the Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994 Pub L 103 354 and section 193 of the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 Pub L 104 127 requiring the FCIC to offer catastrophic risk protection Executive Order No 12866 The rules were determined to be economically significant under Executive Order 12866 requiring review by the Office of Management and Budget Office of Regulatory Affairs OIRA OIRA approved the final rules as complying with the requirements of the Order based on the information supplied by FCIC including a planned regulatory action document describing the reasons for the rules and an assessment of the costs and budgetary impact of the rules Other Executive Orders and Statutes The preambles to the final rules state that the rules have been reviewed under Executive Orders Nos 12372 Intergovernmental cooperation and 12612 Federalism and found not subject to those Orders Also according to the preambles the final rules were reviewed pursuant to Executive Order No 12778 Civil Justice Reform However that Executive Order has been replaced by Executive Order No 12988 effective May 5 1996 The prior Executive Order contained a similar requirement now found at section 3 b 2 A of the newly effective Order requiring that the preemptive effects of the rule be specified FCIC has been determined that the provisions of the rules that preempt Page 3 GAO OGC 96 47 State and local laws to the extent such State and local laws are inconsistent with the rules meet those standards Page 4 GAO OGC 96 47
