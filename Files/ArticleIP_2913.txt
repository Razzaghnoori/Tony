 Inside Out About 25 years ago artist Chris Burden arranged to have a friend shoot him in the arm with a rifle He also crawled over broken glass and was briefly crucified on top of a Volkswagen Bug Works like Shoot made Burden famous within art circles after a Guinness Book of World Records fashion But Burden s masochistic performance art had something in common with more mainstream American art of the 1960s and 1970s Like pop and minimalism it was provocatively easy to make Aside from the hours spent documenting such feats and recovering from them Burden s art didn t occupy much of his time At this year s Whitney Biennial the prestigious roundup of new American art Burden s Pizza City is one of the highlights of the show There are no guns or glass shards here however Burden has abandoned drama for a childlike laboriousness Composed of thousands of miniature parts Pizza City is a scale model of a sprawling whimsical metropolis laid out on table tops a model train set minus the trains Some of the houses shrubs trees and cars actually come from train set manufacturers The other elements are miscellaneous plumbing fixtures kitchen appliances yard sale leftovers all ingeniously recycled to become skyscrapers factories freeways The result is likable but not much more It s a kid s toy albeit one that an established artist devoted seven years of his life to making Such cottage industriousness is the ruling spirit of the 1997 Biennial At its best it translates into a kind of stoop sale liveliness There s lots to look at most of it has an introverted made from scratch intensity Like Burden Michael Ashkin does scale models though his are solemn not whimsical stretches of miniature Western highway so realistic that photographs of them are indistinguishable from photos of real highways Ashkin s fastidiousness pales beside that of Charles Ray For a film project called Self Portrait with Homemade Clothes Ray learned how to sew his own clothing and grind his own eyeglasses then traveled to Switzerland to learn to make a watch from scratch Obsession is the name of the game Devote three months to a project and you re a hobbyist Devote seven years and you re in the Biennial Obsession has always been a buzzword in the art world a less corny more secular sounding synonym for inspiration But suddenly it s a word that art is measured against Obsession after all is what connects increasingly popular outsider artists such as Henry Darger a Chicago janitor who painted and wrote a 15 000 page fantasy about little girls with penises to insider artists such as Burden Ashkin and Ray Darger isn t in this exhibition but his work ethic is In the catalog essay curators Lisa Philips and Louise Neri give a nod to the insider outsider connection but they dismiss it as a fluke of economic history they claim that in today s weak market artists have more time on their hands This is ridiculous For most artists fewer sales means less time to work more time spent paying the rent The explanation for the ethos of laboriousness strikes me as much simpler it serves as proof of the artist s personal commitment Even the worst work demands from you the admission that at least the artists are authentic They ve put in too much sweat equity to be bluffing Of course getting shot in the arm is about as far as you can go in the I m not bluffing department which may be why the curators call Burden one of the two role models for the mostly younger artists in this Biennial The other is Vija Celmins who paints numbing meticulous copies of nature photographs But the real role model here is Marcel Duchamp Duchamp s The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors Even familiarly known as the Large Glass is the granddaddy of this kind of hands on conceptualist art Duchamp worked for more than 12 years on the Large Glass devising pet names for its idiosyncratic imagery and writing detailed incomprehensible notes Calvin Tomkins an ardent Duchampian calls them magisterially unclear As anyone who has ever been to Philadelphia to see it knows the result isn t particularly engaging By the time he made it Duchamp was opposed to visual art as such He disparaged painting as retinal stupidity Many of the works on display here could be seen as personal variations on the Large Glass They vary enormously in appearance since appearances are not necessarily important They can be big and messy as in Jason Rhoades factory floor style installation or small and neat as in Bruce Conner s inkblot drawings The only visual quality they have in common is a dogged intricacy This intricacy isn t just unlike minimalism it is its ideological opposite Minimalist art was simple serious and totally public It sat on the wall and left us to make up our own minds about what it was all about Obsessivism drags us into its space though we remain voyeurs Minimalism enforced a poker faced code of silence Obsessivism chatters to itself in a bizarre idiolect Both however leave us out in the cold For me the low point of the show and of obsessivism in general is Annette Lawrence s Moon series Lawrence draws large spirals composed of hundreds of calendar dates 12 2 95 12 7 95 1 1 96 1 5 96 etc arranged we re told according to a Mayan counting system Once work like this might have at least had a polemical feminist edge Now it just comes across as a new form of navel gazing It s menstrual narcissism In his most recent book philosopher Arthur Danto claims that this bleak retreat into the fortress of the self is a permanent one Art history has flickered out he says and though art will continue to be made each artist will follow his or her bliss without any larger motive or connective scheme It s Pizza City forever Walking around this Biennial which happens to be the last of the 20 th century I had the glum feeling that Danto was right On the other hand millennial melancholia has a way of being wrong There are reasons to be optimistic about the future of art even at the Whitney One of them is Kara Walker a young African American artist from Atlanta who makes narrative murals in a 19 th century style silhouette technique Walker s works are a sort of lewd fantasia about the Old South full of sex cannibalism chivalry folklore and humor It isn t always easy to figure out what she is talking about Her stories too can seem hermetic like pictures from a private universe But most of the time her cutouts are generously imaginative and outward directed connecting viewers to their shared national past Walker makes History painting that musty patriarchal fossil seem like the most seditious and vital new idea of the 21 st century
