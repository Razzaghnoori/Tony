 Background Transection of the peripheral axons of primary sensory neurons results in profound alterations in their metabolism regenerative capacity survival excitability transmitter function and sensitivity to diverse extrinsic and intrinsic signals 1 2 These changes are contributed to by transcriptional alterations triggered by a loss of trophic support from peripheral target organs and by novel signals generated at the injury site The transcriptional changes lead both to adaptive responses such as the capacity to survive the injury and re grow the injured axon and maladaptive responses that can lead to a change in sensation including the generation of neuropathic pain 3 4 Measurements of mRNA and protein made in many laboratories using diverse methodologies have identified approximately 40 genes that are up regulated and 25 down regulated after peripheral nerve injury 3 5 6 These regulated genes include members of several classes G protein coupled receptors ligand and voltage gated ion channels receptor tyrosine kinases growth factors cytokines neuropeptides cell cytoskeletal genes cell surface extracellular matrix genes and a miscellaneous group of enzymes We have now used high density rat genome oligonucleotide microarrays to analyze changes in gene expression at an early time point 3 days following a peripheral nerve injury in adult rats Oligonucleotide microarrays provide the capacity to analyze parallel changes in many thousands of genes and have been used successfully to examine expression profile changes in many neuronal and non neuronal systems 7 including DRG neurons 8 9 Studying the effect of peripheral nerve injury on gene expression profiles in the DRG offers several advantages The DRG represents a dense collection of cell bodies of one general class of neuron the primary sensory neuron The lesion has a uniform impact on the cells and the existence of a large pool of genes with known regulation allows for quality controls for changes identified by the microarrays 3 5 6 Although microarrray technology offers enormous potential advantages there remain important concerns about representation sensitivity reproducibility variability and the false positive and negative detection rates 10 11 What if any is the threshold fold difference between probe sets that reflects real regulation Is fold difference the most sensitive measure for detecting changes Are genes with a low expression levels in all conditions detected What is the concordance rate between genes identified as regulated by independent methods and genes identified by the microarray analysis What criteria need to be used to jointly minimize the false negative and the false positive rates How many arrays need to be analyzed We now show that fold difference alone results in a high degree of error whilst detecting regulated genes from microarrays replicate arrays with statistical analysis reduces false positives and negatives The oligonucleotide microarray screen indicates that hundreds of genes are regulated by neuronal injury and that this technique is a powerful primary screen for such changes Results Array sensitivity and variability Affymetrix rat U34A oligonucleotide arrays were used to screen for changes in gene expression in DRG neurons three days following a peripheral nerve transection axotomy Ax by comparing expression levels with non injured DRGs na ve N Nine biologically independent array hybridizations were performed six na ve and three axotomy DRG tissue L4 and L5 from the left or ipsilateral side to the injury from 5 male Sprague Dawley rats were pooled for each RNA population Each RNA sample was labeled separately and hybridized to a separate array Genes were defined as detected if they received a present or marginal call in at least one of the arrays within each comparison Of the 8799 annotated genes and expressed sequence tags ESTs represented on the rat U34A array 52 n 6 na ve arrays were detected in arrays hybridized with na ve rat DRG cRNA and 54 n 3 axotomy arrays genes in the axotomy comparisons To assess the degree of variability inherent in the system the mean probe set intensity values of the two independent sets of three na ve samples were compared on a scatter plot Figure 1A The majority of probe sets from the two control groups N vs N lie on or very close to the identity line with a linear regression of r 2 0 9898 for all detected genes in the N vs N comparison Figure 1A Figure 1Ashows that most of the variation between the two na ve groups exists at the lower end of the gene expression levels This suggests that this variability is in part due to array sensitivity In consequence differences in low intensity genes may be unreliable A plot of the mean intensity from triplicate naives against triplicate 3 day axotomy N vs Ax arrays Figure 1B show many data points lying both above and below the identity line suggesting regulation Since each individual sample was pooled from 5 male Sprague Dawley animals of a similar age and from a single supplier Charles River biological variation is likely to be minimal Defining regulated genes Many of the detected genes in both the N vs N and the N vs Ax array comparison groups show no difference defined as fold difference up or down less than 1 15 69 N vs N and 47 N vs Ax Figure 1E Further many show small fold differences of 1 15 to 1 5 27 N vs N and 41 N vs Ax Figure 1E In total genes displaying a fold difference below 1 5 fold accounted for 97 of the N vs N arrays and 88 of the N vs Ax comparison When statistical significance is not taken into account 122 genes display a difference of 1 5 2 0 fold and 28 a greater than 2 fold difference in the N vs N group 2 6 and 0 6 of present genes respectively In the N vs Ax group 369 genes show a fold difference of 1 5 2 0 and 178 greater than 2 fold 7 8 and 3 8 of present genes respectively Although a greater than 2 fold change cut off eliminates most false positives estimated error rate 16 this specificity is at the expense of many putatively regulated genes In the 1 5 2 0 fold range in the N vs Ax group there are still three times as many genes as are in the N vs N group 369 genes N vs Ax vs 122 genes N vs N Figure 1E In order to distinguish systematic from random differences in the array intensity levels a two tailed t test was performed for both comparison groups which was possible since each group consisted of three independent experiments One of the fundamental problems in analyzing microarray data is the risk of false positive results due to multiple hypothesis testing The most conservative approach to this problem a Bonferroni corrected significance threshold would not result in any significantly regulated genes as the adjusted threshold would be 1 06 10 5 while the lowest P value attained in our data set for the N vs Ax comparison was 1 51 10 5 This would also rule out identification of genes via step down methods based on the Bonferroni correction Therefore we attempted to assess the accumulation of false positives empirically by testing multiple hypotheses in our system on a sample not expected to include any true positives i e the N vs N comparison Those probe sets with a unadjusted significance of P 0 05 blue P 0 01 green or P 0 001 red are indicated on the scatter plots in Figures 1Cand 1D while the distribution of significant differences at different fold changes is illustrated in the table in Figure 1E Of the 4599 detected genes in the na ve samples 109 show a significant difference between the two sets 2 4 P 0 05 The vast majority of these genes however exhibit low fold changes 1 5 fold 89 Figure 1E Of the 369 genes that show a fold difference of 1 5 2 0 and the 178 that were above 2 fold in the N vs Ax comparison 223 60 and 84 57 respectively were not significant Figure 1E P 0 05 These data indicate that using a fold difference of greater than 2 from triplicate samples to select regulated genes will include many false positives However combining fold difference with significant difference in a two dimensional matrix can reduce the false positive error rate drastically The combination of a 1 5 fold and significant difference P 0 05 identifies 12 genes in the N vs N comparison compared with 240 genes for N vs Ax a 20 fold difference Figure 1E The estimated error of 5 using these two criteria is much less than that obtained using just above 2 fold 16 or significance alone 20 and prevents many genes regulated below 2 fold being excluded from consideration of regulation The inherent array error rate determined by the significant difference rate in the N vs N analysis is clustered at low fold changes Figure 1E However many more genes achieve statistical significance at these small fold changes in the N vs Ax comparison than in the N vs N group 1 15 1 5 fold 6 2 N vs Ax and 1 9 N vs N Figure 1E indicating that some low fold differences may be real The degree of significance P 0 001 0 01 0 05 helps distinguish erroneous changes at these low fold levels Figure 1E Comparison of array data with the literature Table 1 see additional file 1 lists those genes previously shown to be regulated in various sciatic nerve injury models using a variety techniques as well as the expression intensity fold change and P value derived for these genes from the arrays Of 69 genes reported in the literature to be expressed in the DRG Table 1 see additional file 1 16 are not detected by the arrays indicating that array sensitivity is an issue Amongst these are particular functional classes i e such as G protein coupled receptors which are expressed at low levels 12 Additional File 1 Comparison of microarray and known regulation data for genes whose expression pattern within the DRG following nerve injury has been studied previously Click here for file 25 of the 53 detected genes matched the criteria 1 5 fold P 0 05 for defining regulated genes across the N vs Ax comparison and all of these were concordant with the changes reported in the literature Table 1 see additional file 1 In addition 4 of the 53 detected genes whose levels had previously been described as unchanged by axotomy also did not vary on the arrays Mismatches between changes expected from the literature and the arrays may be due to a failure of small differences to achieve statistical significance when using a triplicate analysis Furthermore differences in the timing the nature of the injury models used and detection methods employed between this and earlier studies make detailed analysis of these data unfeasible In order to detect true false positive and negative rates a direct comparison needs to be made between the array data set and transcript levels measured in samples equivalent to those used for array hybridization Northern blotting validation of transcriptional regulation Twenty four genes detected by the arrays as being present in the DRG and displaying up down or no regulation three days after sciatic nerve axotomy were analyzed by replicate quantitative slot blot Figure 2 and Northern blot analysis Figure 3 The genes were chosen in a non random fashion to encompass the range of hybridization intensities seen on the arrays with expression levels less than 1000 to intensity levels greater than 10 000 Genes were also chosen which displayed a wide range of fold changes and varying p values and possible functions were taken into account Table 2 Figure 2illustrates representative triplicate slot blots for three genes with altered expression 2 showing an increase after axotomy Figure 2Aand 2B and one a decrease Figure 2C Cyclophilin a gene known not to alter following axotomy 13 was used to correct for loading Figure 2D Each blot was prepared from independent L4 and L5 DRG RNA samples extracted from different groups of animals than those used for the arrays Triplicate slot blots were produced for all 24 genes present in Table 2 The concordance rate between the microarray and slot blot fold changes for the 24 genes was 83 overall but concordance depended on gene expression level Table 2 Genes expressed at low levels in the arrays tended to display fold changes that varied from that found by the slot blots It is likely that this is a consequence of the unreliable average intensity estimation for low level genes due to limited array sensitivity Figure 1A If genes with a mean intensity expression level of less than 1000 are removed from the analysis top five rows Table 2 and the array fold changes of the remaining 19 genes are plotted against the slot blot fold changes a very strong correlation is evident linear regression r 2 0 8567 Figure 2E The concordance rate of this group is 95 using 1 5 fold P 0 05 to predict regulation This shows that within the bounds of array sensitivity average fold changes for genes found to differ significantly between triplicate control and experimental arrays represent a reasonable estimate of the relative changes in gene expression Northern blot analysis although requiring more tissue both confirms that the correct transcript size is recognized by the probe and enables splice variants to be identified Figure 3 All 24 genes in Table 2were analyzed in this way and alternate splice forms were evident for 5 genes A list of all the putatively regulated genes within the DRG detected by the arrays 1 5 fold and P 0 05 3 days following a sciatic nerve transection are given as additional data in table 3 see additional file 2 Additional File 2 Summary of genes identified as regulated 1 5 fold P 0 05 in the DRG 3 days after sciatic nerve axotomy Click here for file In situHybridization Dorsal root ganglia as well as containing the cell bodies of primary sensory neurons also contain satellite glial cells Schwann cells and immune cells and it is important therefore to determine which of these cell types express the regulated genes Here we use isotopic in situ hybridization ISH to determine the cellular localization of 6 transcripts Figure 4 All genes selected are neuronal GTPcylo IES JE CCHL2A and VGF all show a marked increase in the number of labeled neurons while SNAP25 and the 5HT3 receptor show a decrease in numbers and intensity of labeled DRG neurons following axotomy Figure 4 Time dependent changes in transcription The pattern of expression of four genes within the DRG Lysozyme PACAP MET 1 and SNAP25 were further quantified across a time course of 1 3 7 and 14 days post axotomy by triplicate northern slot blot Figure 5 These genes show diverse patterns of regulation While lysozyme PACAP MET 1 are all up regulated for MET1 this is only transient Identical results were found by in situ hybridization Fig 4 Profiling changes in transcription over time is therefore important Potential roles of injury regulated genes Table 4 see additional file 3 indicates the pattern of expression class action and functional role for 15 previously uncharacterized and 9 novel injury regulated genes amongst the 24 validated genes Five of these genes have been reported in DRG neurons previously and six of the genes are expressed in PC12 cells a pheochromocytoma derived cell line that shares neural crest origin with neurons of the DRG Two genes are expressed in macrophages and 6 in glial cells Three genes have been reported to show axotomy induced regulation in non DRG neurons sympathetic and motor neurons These genes belong to several different functional classes and from what is known about their functional role in other cells may have a role in regeneration cell survival or alterations in sensory processing after nerve injury Table 4 see additional file 3 Once a change in expression of the 240 genes in Table 3 have been validated similar analyses of their putative function need to be made in order to begin to address what role the genes play in the adaptive and maladaptive response to nerve injury Additional File 3 Summary of expression patterns and functional roles of uncharacterized nerve injury regulated genes Click here for file Global changes in transcription The 240 genes defined as putatively regulated 1 5 fold P 0 05 within the DRG 3 days after sciatic nerve section represent 5 1 of the detected genes and of these 2 8 are up regulated and 2 3 down regulated Figure 6A These genes were assigned into functional classes and characterized as up and down regulated Some gene classes are selectively regulated after axotomy Figure 6B Genes associated with the cell cytoskeleton positive and negative regulators of apoptosis as well as immune markers tend to be up regulated whereas genes involved in membrane excitability ion channels or neurotransmission neurotransmitters and vesicle trafficking genes tend to be down regulated Discussion Although many studies have used microarray technology for expression profiling the criteria for determining putatively regulated genes from such analyses remain poorly defined the current standard being a 2 fold difference in replicate arrays Using Affymetrix high density rat oligonucleotide array data from control na ve non injured and experimental axotomy 3 day post peripheral nerve injury DRGs and comparing the differences detected in control vs control and control vs experimental arrays we have explored the optimal criteria for minimizing the false positive error rate A 2 fold criterion alone was found to generate a substantial proportion of potential false positives while also excluding many putatively regulated genes Based on significant difference for each probe set P 0 05 109 genes differed in the control vs control group and 556 in the control vs experimental group again a prohibitively high false positive rate 20 However a combination of fold and significant difference was found to maximize the difference between control vs control and control vs experimental array comparisons Using 1 5 fold and P 0 05 240 putatively regulated genes were detected in the experimental group compared with only 12 in the control group an estimated error rate of 5 If fold differences of 1 25 to 1 5 are included many more significantly different genes are recruited 219 in the experimental vs 41 in the control comparison reducing the potential false negative rate At the same time the estimated false positive error rate rises to 11 5 still lower than the 2 fold alone error Producing a reduction in false positive without also producing false negative differences requires the use both of fold and significant difference The established 2 fold criterion is much too conservative when using replicate arrays with pooled samples from multiple animals to reduce biological variation it loses over 50 of putatively regulated genes and fails to eliminate false positives The very high concordance rate found between genes predicted from the array analysis to be regulated and measurements of mRNA for 24 genes by quantitative Northern slot blots and in situ hybridization validates utilization of a two dimensional matrix of fold and significant difference One problem with oligonucleotide arrays is sensitivity Some groups of transcripts particularly GPCRs including the opiate receptors which are expressed in the DRG 14 fall below the microarray detection threshold Lack of sensitivity may result from technical issues such as poor probe performance 11 or low copy number transcripts Tissue heterogeneity and neuronal subpopulation restricted gene expression may lower the concentration of a transcript in the total RNA sample to below detection threshold 10 Recently Xiao et al 9 published a study using 7 5 K cDNA arrays to analyze genes regulated in the DRG 2 7 14 and 28 days following sciatic nerve axotomy Of the genes listed in Table 4 seven were found in both studies Peripheral Benzodiazepine receptor 5HT3 Gadd45 CLP36 Lysozyme SNAP25 and VGF Of those genes whose expression was analyzed across time in this study Figure 5 two Lysozyme and SNAP25 were also detected by Xiao et al 9 Both genes show very similar expression patterns over time in the two studies In a different cDNA array study also recently published 16 genes were identified to be regulated by at least 2 fold one week after sciatic axotomy 8 Of these seven were also identified by our study Five of the non concordant genes were not represented by known probe sets on the array used here Others changed but did not reach statistical significance and likely represented differences in regulation levels relative to the time points used 1 week as opposed to 3 days One gene verified in this study the small proline rich protein 1A Table 2 was characterized in detail by Bonilla et al who show that it colocalizes with filamentous actin in membrane ruffles and augments axonal outgrowth 8 Comparison of the global lists of regulated genes between this study and other reports are complicated by the differing criteria used to identify regulated genes in the different studies However it is encouraging to note that a reasonable number of genes have been cross identified in three separate array studies looking at the effects of peripheral nerve injury on dorsal root ganglion gene expression pointing to the reliability of array technologies across differing platforms Why is the number of genes regulated in sensory neurons after peripheral nerve injury so large The injury constitutes an enormous stress to the cell and also deprives it from contact with its normal target derived neurotrophic support Both of these events represent perturbations from normal cellular functioning that require a variety of compensatory responses A major issue is cell survival Injured adult DRG neurons do not die after axonal injury 15 as a result of the upregulation of cell survival factors such as the small heat shock protein HSP27 16 We now find several genes that could have a survival promoting role including the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor whose agonists are potent antiapoptotic compounds 17 GADD45A which maintains genomic stability and appears to be anti apoptotic in neurons after ischemic damage 18 metallothionein 1L which is a free radical scavenger 19 GTP cyclohydrolase 1 which is obligatory for the actions of NGF on PC12 cells 20 and IES JE MCP 1 which attracts macrophages which in turn have been reported to have a role in neuronal survival 21 Neurons with axons in the peripheral nervous system can successfully regenerate when injured 22 This is in part due to an environment permissive for axonal growth but also due to the upregulation of regeneration associated genes RAGs which increase intrinsic growth capacity 23 Three examples of RAGs are GAP 43 and CAP 23 24 and sprp1A 8 We now find several other potential candidates including 2 macroglobulin CLP36 and VGF all of which have been described to promote neurite outgrowth or interact with the cytoskeleton in a way that may promote regeneration see Table 4 additional file 3 for references MMP3 also known as 53 kD polypeptide transin or stromelysin 1 a secreted protease may facilitate neurite growth by dissolving the extracellular matrix of the basal lamina at the growing tip of the axon see Table 4 for references Sensory neurons react to peripheral nerve injury by increasing their excitability changing their constitutive synaptic transmitter profile and even their synaptic contacts in the spinal cord Interestingly an analysis of the functional classes of the genes differentially expressed Figure 6 reveals the contribution that alterations in transcription make to these processes Several of these changes are maladaptive in the sense that they contribute to the generation of the abnormal sensations that constitute neuropathic pain by producing ectopic spontaneous activity into the CNS altering synaptic drive increasing excitability and diminishing inhibitory action in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and by making novel synaptic contacts with inappropriate neurons 1 4 A number of the injury regulated genes we describe here may contribute directly to this altered sensory processing CB1 receptor VGF the phospholemman ion channel SNAP25 A endothelin 1 and the ligand gated 5 HT3 receptor Table 4 see additional file 3 We have only validated a small fraction of the putatively regulated genes detected by the arrays Our analysis indicates that at a conservative estimate over two hundred genes 240 genes 1 5 fold P 0 05 are regulated by the injury These include genes of a number of distinct functional classes some of which appear to change in a uniform way Ion channels and neurotransmitter related genes tend to decrease their expression while those associated with the cytoskeleton increase This raises the possibility that numbers of different genes may be regulated together by common changes in signal transduction and transcription induced by the injury and contribute in this way to the coordinated changes that constitute the axotomy response Discovering and validating regulated genes by array analysis is clearly only the first step in elucidating their functional role An evaluation of the cellular localization and distribution of the gene product as well as loss and gain of function manipulations in vitro and in vivo are required Functional studies cannot yet be performed at a high throughput level and this represents one of the major limiting factors in analyzing the large numbers of candidate genes identified by microarray analysis Elucidating the specific role of genes regulated in sensory neurons after peripheral nerve injury will provide insight though into many major biological issues including cell survival growth intercellular communication and the factors that contribute to sensory abnormalities Microarray technology provides a powerful tool for beginning this analysis in a high throughput mode by revealing the extent of change in neuronal gene expression Such analysis requires replicate measures to minimize variability calculation of fold and significant differences to detect regulated genes with minimal false positive and negative confounders and validation of individual genes Conclusions 1 A comparison of two na ve control triplicate data sets allowed determination of the inherent variation present in the oligonucleotide array data Analysis revealed a relatively high false positive error rate in the na ve versus axotomy experimental comparisons 16 when using only a 2 fold criterion for regulated gene detection 2 When statistical significance P 0 05 was combined with a fold difference of greater than 1 5 as the criteria for detecting putatively regulated genes not only was the estimated false positive error substantially reduced to 5 but also many more genes were identified compared with the established 2 fold criterion in the na ve versus axotomy comparison 240 as opposed to 178 genes 3 All 240 genes displaying a fold change of greater than 1 5 and a P value of less than 0 05 are listed 4 To validate these findings we performed quantitative triplicate slot blots for 24 genes enabling a direct comparison between the statistically analyzed array data and the mRNA measurements These comparisons show strong concordance between putative and actual regulation as well as a direct relationship between array fold change and mRNA fold change 5 Some genes were further quantified across a time course of 1 3 7 and 14 days post axotomy These genes show diverse patterns of regulation in response to nerve injury and underlie the importance of including time as a dimension in any expression profile study 6 Genes detected from the arrays as being likely to be regulated were assigned to functional groups These data suggest the reorganization of cell structural components following peripheral nerve injury activation of genes expressed by immune and inflammatory cells and a down regulation of genes involved in neurotransmission Methods Surgical procedures All procedures were performed in accordance with Massachusetts General Hospital animal care regulations Adult male Sprague Dawley rats 200 300 g were anesthetized with halothane For the sciatic nerve transection axotomy the left sciatic nerve was exposed at the mid thigh level ligated with 3 0 silk and sectioned distally The wound was sutured in two layers and the animals were allowed to recover Tissue and RNA preparation Animals were terminally anesthetized with CO 2 the L4 and L5 DRGs rapidly removed and stored at 80 C Total RNA was extracted from homogenized DRG samples

is estimated by analysis of signal intensity of the PM MM pairs The arrays are hybridized with biotin labeled cRNA prepared as per standard Affymetrix protocol Briefly total RNA 8 g from DRGs was reverse transcribed using an oligo dT primer coupled to a T7 RNA polymerase binding site Double stranded cDNA was made and biotinylated cRNA synthesized using T7 polymerase The cRNA was hybridized for 16 hours to an array followed by binding with a streptavidin conjugated fluorescent marker and then incubated with a polyclonal anti streptavidin antibody coupled to phycoerythrin as an amplification

software MAS 5 0 1 0 04 2 0 06 To normalize the array data standard Affymetrix protocols were employed each array was scaled to a target signal of 2500 across all probe sets MAS 5 0 The arrays were grouped for two comparisons two triplicate sets of na ve data compared with one another and one triplicate na ve set compared with one triplicate post axotomy set The individual na ve arrays included in each triplicate set were picked randomly A probe set was determined undetected if it received an A call in all of the six arrays involved in the comparison Detected were Present or Marginal by MAS5 0 in at least one array for each analysis Mean signal and standard deviation were calculated for each detected probe set The p value for rejecting the null hypothesis that the mean signals were equal

most 3 nucleotides within each accession sequence PCR was performed on cDNA reverse transcribed from total RNA extracted from lumbar DRGs using poly dT as a primer to obtain cDNA fragments 141 to 596 bp These fragments were subsequently cloned into the PCRII vector TA cloning Kit Invitrogen and the identity of each was confirmed by sequencing in both directions These cDNAs were gel purified and used to produce 32P labeled cDNA probes Prime It kit Stratagene Northern blot analysis Total RNA was size separated by electrophoresis on a 1 5 agarose formaldehyde gel 10 g of total RNA per lane and transferred to a Hybond N nylon membrane Membranes were hybridized with labeled probes see above in ExpressHyb Clontech overnight at 65 C washed and exposed to X ray film with an intensifying screen at 80 C Slot Blots Total RNA 1 25 g was directly transferred to Hybond N nylon membrane under vacuum using a Hoefer PR648 slot blot apparatus Amersham Pharmacia Biotech as described in 25 The slot blots were produced in batches of ten from a relevant master mix and probed with the same cDNA under the same conditions as described for Northern blot analysis Levels of hybridization were quantified using the 24450 phosphorimager system Molecular Dynamics Sunnyvale CA One of the blots in each batch was probed for cyclophilin to act as a loading control The other nine blots were used to measure the expression levels of individual genes Loading levels between samples on each blot were normalized using the cyclophilin levels from the control blot Isotopic in situHybridization DRGs were rapidly
