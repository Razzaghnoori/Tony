 okay okay well what are we doing about recycling in our community well well in our area we just introduced the um citywide uh Clean King Sport campaign and we have a recycling mascot called Kleanaroo he s a kangaroo and um we re setting up curbside recycling bins for the city home owners and several of our local businesses also have recycling stations set up in their parking lots um hum and how about in your area well in our i live in a very small community outside of the Dallas area and uh we re just getting started as a matter of fact this last week we got a notice in the mail from City Hall and they ve informed us that uh we d be getting more instructions in the mail in a week or two but we re going to start a separation of our refuse and separating the cans from the paper et cetera um hum and apart of that we haven t really done much of anything except for uh separating your newspapers and taking those to uh an area that they ve designated um but in uh in the office place we ve been doing it for some time separating our uh uh computer paper from our normal garbage all right so have we we ve been doing the computer paper and then we ve also been doing our aluminum cans uh huh what do they do with the cans i that s the one thing i don t know i i don t know if they take them to the local aluminum uh recycling plant um hum uh just locally or or what i assume that s what they would do i would assume so and then maybe do something with the money for charity or something i would hope yeah i i think that s what they do i think they they give that to charity i yeah that s a good idea and and uh other than the work place and here at home um i don t know too much is going on in the community i know that in Plano it s a larger city in the area they they uh i believe about a month or two ago they started having the citizens separate their refuse okay and they ve even um got a particular huge uh waste can that they have to use oh for each different product oh okay right uh huh that makes it kind of easier then you remember you know yeah i i was going to say i ve seen in some of these um local mail order catalogs they ve got trash can dividers for for home owners who don t have those it it um hum oh uh huh it like cuts your trash can in half so you could put cans on one side and and other on the other side so other side that s a good idea i think i think a lot of people are jumping on the band wagon um hum um as far as you know should more be done i think there s i think there s always more that can be done i think as we all get in the swing of things this is just a beginning don t you think yes i ve even heard them talking about uh recycling Freon from refrigerators refrigeration systems yes there are people there are companies that recycle their Freon oh really um hum and um i m sure there are a lot chemicals that that can be recycled that yeah i know the motor oil there s a lot of um hum we have places that we can take our motor oil to if you change your own oil at home i now that s we we don t have that that s neat um KMart does that some of the KMarts in the area where i don t have any except for the lawn motor lawn mower oh uh huh um machine oil because i always have my oil changed out of the house but but but you d think that uh garages could do that yes i m sure they do uh i mean that would be great um hum because that s something that doesn t go back into the soil does it doesn t break down no it s it s really bad to not break down um hum i uh saw an article the other day in Ann Landers that talked about how long it takes like a cigarette butt to decompose and i think it was between twenty and thirty years is that right i had no idea yes i i was i was flabbergasted and i think plastic was um plastic never totally total breaks down never breaks down um the Styrofoam that s the one that never did yep yeah never did some plastic took fifty years fifty years yeah um i know that i had heard that uh McDonald s has gotten so much flack about sending their hot foods out in the Styrofoam that they are going to work on something they they have here yes i used to get my Egg McMuffin in one of those little Styrofoam cup uh cups like and now they wrap them in paper other than that oh have they um hum do they well good yes so i was really glad to see that i think they re one of the businesses at large that do things like that they re more aware of it they they are good or at least they try and do something about it first i think they recognize their their position as a community leader um hum and really work to keep that going i think you re right so and and the only other thing i ve seen has been the setting up a compost heap in your own backyard um hum but that s that s hard if you don t have a big yard or if you live in an apartment defiantly if you live in an apartment right that might not go over real well right that s for sure so well let s see has it been i think have we been our five minutes uh i really don t know i haven t been timing it but i think i know the last time i did this they came on and said you you have exceeded your ten minutes time limit hang up within the next thirty seconds so oh okay oh all right um well i guess we ll just say good bye then okay and and i think we just hang up i don t think we have to do anything else okay but it s been very nice talking to you okay thank you nice to talk to you also all righty bye bye bye bye
