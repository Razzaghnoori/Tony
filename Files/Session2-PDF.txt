 Session 2 Identifying ED Patients with Alcohol Problems Robert Woolard MD Many patients in the emergency department ED have alcohol problems and they can be identified 1 Research on techniques used to identify these patients has been conducted but several areas of interest should be addressed by further research We need to further examine and refine alcohol screening questionnaires in the ED We need to determine the sequence and combination of questions and tests that constitute the best screening process We need to study barriers to screening identify factors that promote screening implementation and demonstrate the impact of a screening program in the ED The final aim of screening must be improved outcomes through referral and counseling Identification is only the first step in a process of care Alcohol problems defined Alcohol problems designate a spectrum from risk behavior to illness and from problematic consumption to alcohol use disorder We must be careful when interpreting the results of studies and in our own design of screening procedures that we are clear about the endpoints we are measuring Clinicians in the ED are interested in screening for several alcohol endpoints Acute intoxication is of concern to emergency physicians Intoxication in a driver would certainly be considered an alcohol problem The blood or breath alcohol concentration BAC coupled with our clinical observations may help us identify intoxication Most alcohol screening tests identify patients with alcohol use disorders or problematic consumption of alcohol The American Psychiatric Association in DSM III R IV2 and the World Health Organization WHO in the 9th and 10th International Classification of Diseases ICD 9 10 have rigorously defined alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence 3 These definitions largely agree for dependence but not for abuse DSM includes social and legal consequences of abuse and ICD 10 has only medical and psychological consequences Fewer cases of alcohol abuse meet the ICD 10 definition In general an alcohol use disorder is present when an aspect of the patient s function has been compromised by alcohol Before function is compromised problematic consumption occurs Much of the emphasis of screening has shifted toward identifying patients with high alcohol consumption before disease develops WHO defines hazardous drinking as 4 or more drinks day for men and 2 or more drinks day for women The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism NIAAA defines at risk drinking as consumption of more than 14 drinks week or more than 4 drinks occasion for men ages 18 to 65 For women of all ages and men older than age 65 more than 7 drinks week or more than 3 drinks occasion is considered at risk Binge drinking alone is also of concern and has been variably defined as more than 3 4 5 or 6 drinks on an occasion 4 Characteristics of an ideal ED screening test or sequence of tests An ideal screening test would be accurate practical and motivational The accuracy of a test can be measured in several ways For a screening test high sensitivity is the most desirable parameter High sensitivity ensures that most of the patients with problems will be detected High specificity is also desirable to help ensure that positive tests represent real problems There is a trade off between sensitivity and specificity defined by the receiver operator curve The area under the operator curve best reflects the performance of a test the larger the area the better the test Each point on the curve represents a potential cut point A cut point with a high sensitivity and specificity should be manifest in an ideal test Theoretically an ideal test should remain accurate throughout the alcohol use spectrum However real tests don t perform uniformly across a spectrum For example if we re interested in identifying patients with binge drinking we can define binge drinking as 3 4 5 or 6 drinks on an occasion Screening tests designed for patients with more severe problems 6 drinks will be less sensitive at identifying patients with less severe problems 3 drinks An ideal test would perform uniformly in all populations and sub groups However when we screen populations with high case rates trauma admissions 63 5 a highly sensitive test with moderate specificity performs well The same test used to screen a population with low case rates pregnant clinic patients 7 6 does not perform as well In this population a test with higher specificity may be needed to avoid too many false positives A test that is used to screen a diverse population such as ED patients will perform better in some subgroups than others based of the different case rates among subgroups An ideal test should remain accurate in the presence of common ED problems such as stress injury acute illness intoxication other drug use depression and anxiety disorders Many of the screening tests were developed outside the ED Fortunately many have been applied to ED populations Hence their performance has been demonstrated in the presence of some of these distracting factors An ideal test should also remain accurate with differences in gender age race ethnicity or language Some variation in test performance among demographic groups has been demonstrated in studies of screening tests in the ED 7 8 An ideal test in the ED would address both current and lifetime alcohol problems Current use would more likely prompt referral or counseling but past use predicts poor outcome from medical problems such as injury 9 In research trials the impracticality of a screening test may not be evident Research staff do not have to contend with adding a screening test to an already lengthy list of clinical care duties In clinical practice several practical issues will make all the difference to successful implementation The ease of use of a screening test will determine its success Staff with any level of prior health training and little additional training should be able to administer an ideal test Results should be immediately available and easy to interpret The test should be acceptable to regulators payers ED staff and ED patients Several factors may interfere with implementation For example patients may find certain questions offensive or they may not be willing to have blood drawn or submit to breathalyzers Clinical staff may be uncomfortable asking some types of questions Regulators may restrict access to records based on answers to certain questions and add burdens to hospital record keepers Payers may pay for some tests and not others These and other factors may reduce the effectiveness of a screening procedure that has been proven effective in research trials Most experts agree that an ideal ED test is brief 1 to 2 minutes Most of the quest to develop efficient ED screening has emphasized brevity However a longer test could be self administered An ideal screening test should not interfere with the routine sequence of medical history physical examination and laboratory testing The test should be confidential since there may be legal financial or social consequences to screening positive Finally the ideal test should actually motivate the patient to further assessment counseling or referral as needed Currently available screening tests Based on current evidence screening should be undertaken using one or a combination of structured questionnaires 10 Screening undertaken using clinical impression or biochemical tests is not as accurate or as sensitive as structured questionnaires for identifying alcohol use disorders or problematic consumption 7 Of course BAC can help identify acute intoxication The alcohol concentration can be determined by saliva testing breath analysis or blood test 11 12 Clinical impression Clinicians often use their general impression to help with diagnosis but clinical impressions concerning alcohol problems can be inaccurate Trained practitioners counseling alcoholics could identify only 50 of acutely intoxicated patients 13 Primary care physicians and emergency physicians identified fewer than 50 of patients with alcohol problems Unfortunately the majority of physicians 54 screen only those patients they suspect based on their clinical impressions 14 16 Stereotypic profiling may be the consequence of screening only suspected patients Gentilello reported that in a trauma center ED staff suspected alcohol ism in 26 of patients who screened negative on structured questionnaires These patients were more likely to be young male disheveled uninsured and low income 17 Of course some ED patients may spontaneously volunteer information about drinking Cherpitel reported that patient self report of drinking prior to arrival had a sensitivity of 29 for alcohol problems in the ED 7 Structured questionnaires Self report may be enhanced when specific alcohol questions are asked Cyr reported that a single question in a primary care setting Have you ever had a drinking problem had a high sensitivity 40 to 70 18 Subsequent reports from other institutions did not replicate the high sensitivity of this single question 19 23 Cherpitel evaluated single question screens in the ED and found them to be less sensitive than structured questionnaires 7 Most existing screens were developed for primary care settings to detect alcohol use disorders The CAGE was developed in 1968 as a brief screening tool for primary care providers to detect alcohol abuse and dependence CAGE is a mnemonic from four questions Cut down Annoyed Guilty and Eye opener The questions address problems over the patient s lifetime CAGE takes 1 to 2 minutes to administer 24 25 The MAST Michigan Alcohol Screening Test developed in 1971 as a screen for alcohol abuse and dependence has 24 yes no questions MAST has been self administered and used in a computer format It addresses problems over the patient s lifetime MAST requires 20 minutes to administer A shortened version of the MAST exists a 10 question Brief B MAST BMAST takes 5 to 12 minutes to administer and performs nearly as well as the longer version 26 28 SAAST Self Administered Alcoholism Screening Test was developed in 1972 to screen for alcohol abuse and dependence It has 35 yes no questions While lengthy the SAAST has the advantage of being self administered and it has also been administered in a computerized format It addresses problems over the patient s lifetime A shortened 9 item version the Brief SAAST takes the patient 5 to 10 minutes to complete 29 30 More recently screens have been developed to detect at risk drinkers WHO developed the AUDIT Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test in 1992 as a brief screening tool to detect at risk drinking in addition to alcohol abuse and dependence AUDIT has 10 questions It assesses problems experienced within the last three months and over the patient s lifetime AUDIT takes 4 to 8 minutes to administer 31 32 Several screens have been developed for pregnant women Concern about even lower levels of alcohol consumption in this group has prompted development of the screens TWEAK T ACE and NET TWEAK screens for alcohol abuse and dependence It has five questions addresses problems over the patient s lifetime and takes 3 to 5 minutes to administer 33 T ACE also screens for alcohol abuse and dependence T ACE has three of the four CAGE questions and replaces the guilt question with tolerance question T ACE addresses problems over the patient s lifetime and takes 1 to 2 minutes to administer 34 NET was developed to screen pregnant patients for at risk drinking alcohol abuse and dependence It is a three question screen that takes about 1 minute 33 One screen has been developed for emergency department use the Rapid Alcohol Assessment Screen RAPS4 Cherpitel screened an ED population with questions from CAGE BMAST AUDIT and TWEAK She created RAPS4 by combining the four highest yield questions from those screens which covered feeling guilty after drinking blackouts failing to do what is normally expected after drinking and morning drinking However this new instrument has not been studied when administered as a stand alone test 35 In addition to these questionnaires NIAAA suggests that all primary care physicians ask an opening question Do you drink alcohol followed by three questions about alcohol consumption and then the CAGE This sequence was not explicitly designed or studied as a screening test D Onofrio and others have recommended using the NIAAA approach in the ED 10 Studies of screening tests Cherpitel conducted two studies comparing multiple screening tests in the ED In the first study TWEAK and AUDIT were most sensitive identifying 84 and 81 of patients respectively with an ICD 10 diagnosis of alcohol dependence 7 In the second study RAPS and AUDIT were more sensitive than TWEAK and CAGE identifying 79 and 78 compared with 72 and 71 respectively of patients with an ICD 10 or DSM IV diagnosis of alcohol dependence harmful drinking or abuse 5 36 Soderstrom has compared multiple screening tests in a trauma center He reported that CAGE performed best with a sensitivity of 84 for a DSM IV diagnosis of alcohol dependence 37 Fiellin reviewed 38 studies of screening for alcohol use disorder in the primary care setting For at risk hazardous or harmful drinking AUDIT was found most effective with sensitivities of 51 to 97 For alcohol abuse or dependence CAGE was found most effective with sensitivities of 43 to 94 As expected CAGE and AUDIT performed best within the spectrum of alcohol use they were developed to explore 38 Screening biases Cherpitel analyzed variability of test performance in subgroups of ED patients 39 In her first ED study CAGE BMAST AUDIT and TWEAK were less sensitive among females whites and non injured patients In her second ED study with Hispanic patients CAGE BMAST AUDIT TWEAK and RAPS were less sensitive in females patients with less acculturation and non dependent drinkers 36 Lowering the cut point on these screening instruments improved sensitivity without loss of specificity among females Using lower cut points for females may maximize screening test performance 40 Bradley reviewed nine studies with data on women s responses to screening mainly in primary care settings CAGE AUDIT and TWEAK were the best tests for alcohol dependence among women Their reported sensitivities were 66 to 92 All three screens performed better among black women than among white women TWEAK per formed better than CAGE or AUDIT among white women CAGE and AUDIT had low sensitivities 59 and 48 respectively for alcohol dependence among white women We must be careful not to employ screening techniques that do not address important subgroups 41 Evidence of such low sensitivity in an important subgroup may necessitate use of multiple screens tailored to subgroups In addition to women other subgroups such as adolescents older adults pregnant women psychiatric patients and Spanish speakers may need screening with modified or unique tests Standard screens may not perform as well in these patient subgroups that may represent a considerable part of the ED population Adjustment of cut points or use of alternative screening tests may be necessary for these subgroups Alcohol concentration Many injured ED patients are screened with a BAC which can help identify intoxication The presence of alcohol may not always indicate an alcohol problem While a very high BAC in an unimpaired patient can be a specific screen for dependence 42 BAC is an insensitive screen for an alcohol use disorder One study found that only one third of intoxicated drivers had an alcohol use disorder 43 In an ED study BAC was a poor screen for alcohol abuse or dependence with a sensitivity of 20 less sensitive than self reported drinking 7 In another ED study a saliva alcohol level equivalent to a BAC greater than 0 10 g dl in an injured patient identified harmful drinkers AUDIT 8 with a sensitivity of 65 44 In one trauma center BAC had a sensitivity of 63 for an alcohol disorder 5 Other biochemical markers such as mean corpuscular volume platelet count liver enzymes gamma glutamyltransferase GGT aspartate aminotransferase AST alanine aminotransferase ALT and carbohydrate deficient transferrin CDT perform poorly with sensitivities of 13 to 67 for alcohol use disorders or problematic con sumption 45 50 Biochemical tests other than BAC may have use in settings other than an ED but they offer little as screening tests for ED patients Research questions improving existing screening questionnaires We still need to find the most accurate test for ED use This may be RAPS4 which is designed for the ED but it needs further direct testing Many tests would be improved by wording questions to address current problems the past year or three months rather than lifetime problems Screening with embedded questions and indirect questions may also improve self report among adolescents and other groups 20 51 53 These approaches need further testing in the ED The most practical test may be the shortest the three question NET Further sequencing of questions within questionnaires may also improve efficiency 35 If one question answered yes yields a positive test score asking that one first and stopping as soon as the score is positive would be the most efficient approach Cherpitel has analyzed the sensitivity of each of the RAPS4 questions and sequenced them from most to least sensitive for most efficient use 35 Minimizing question sets for interviews will result in obtaining less information Computer administered or self administered screens may address this issue by allowing patients to spend more time completing in depth questioning with no additional staff time 54 55 This approach promises practical avenues for obtaining more information A trial of screening tests in various formats e g interview self administered forms and computer interaction should be undertaken to compare their cost and value in the ED The most motivational screening test is unknown Drawing blood and confronting patients with their blood alcohol levels may actually push them away from counseling Screening questions that reveal the negative consequences or link alcohol to current problems may motivate patients to seek counseling Providing immediate feedback may help make the transition from screening to counseling with little additional intervention The motivational aspects of a variety of screens with and without verbal or computer feedback need to be explored Research questions finding the best approach to screening To determine the best of the available screens a multi center trial with a broad demographic mix and a large number of patients subjected to different screens is needed Further evaluation should be performed of lower cut points for TWEAK CAGE and AUDIT The advantage of tailored screens or specific questions for subgroups such as women 41 adolescents 54 59 and elders 60 64 needs to be determined RAPS4 must be further tested as a stand alone screen in isolation and against other tests A longer self administered screen including one administered by computer should also be tested in the ED To determine the best sequence for screening the approach recommended by NIAAA for primary care should be compared with other sequences Several trials of variations of the NIAAA approach are warranted Trials should be conducted starting with other or no opening questions using other consumption questions such as those in AUDIT using other screens such as TWEAK rather than CAGE changing the sequence to CAGE or TWEAK followed by consumption questions and checking BAC at the beginning or end of the protocol The best screen should be determined in the context of a screening and intervention program Some questions or screens may lead naturally to referral and treatment Others may not promote referral and treatment Much of the screening literature is isolated from intervention Future studies need to incorporate evaluation of screening linked to intervention protocols Barriers to implementing screening In a research protocol in England nurses were trained to screen all emergency patients with CAGE and then provide feedback Only 20 of patients were screened Of them 19 had positive CAGE scores of those only 41 were provided feedback Even with feedback only 12 accepted follow up Of 4 663 patients only 13 were entered into the trial and the trial was abandoned 65 66 There are multiple barriers to screening Nurses identified lack of resources inadequate training stress poor morale and no perceived value to the intervention In a survey sponsored by the West Virginia Chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians a minority of emergency physicians reported routine screening and counseling of ED patients 67 The authors reported provider attitudes of disinterest avoidance disdain and pessimism as well as inadequate time insufficient education and lack of resources as barriers Surveys and interventions should be undertaken to define and reduce barriers to implementing screening in clinical practice Currently screening is a research tool not a clinical tool ED staff does not use structured questionnaires for alcohol screening ED staff has no systematic approach to alcohol screening Staff chooses to screen some individuals and not others based on clinical suspicions or partially implemented protocols In general ED staff screens less often than addiction experts recommend Universal screening is appropriate in populations with high case rates EDs have reported high case rates of alcohol problems especially acute intoxication from 9 to 31 17 28 46 68 71 Within the ED there are even higher case rates in subgroups Major trauma injuries assaults 72 depression and alcohol related medical problems like gastrointestinal bleeding or seizures define even higher risk subgroups Many experts advocate focusing screening on some of the highest risk groups or screening with greater intensity and different tools in these groups Implementing screening in clinical practice Any ED staff member could be assigned the screening task Physician nurse clerical social work or volunteer staff can conduct screening We do not know which staff group will be most effective Self administered questionnaires computer screen interactions or interview techniques may be easier to implement Screening questions can be stand alone or embedded into general health questionnaires or existing registration physician and nurse documentation Screening protocols can be mandatory or voluntary The approaches that will be most effective in ED practice should be determined by studying the implementation of these strategies in actual ED clinical practices Studies of the translation of efficacious research practice into clinical practice is needed most since screening instruments have been used by research staff and not clinical staff Impact of screening ED patient care should be improved by implementing alcohol screening programs A major limit to realizing this improvement is the lack of counseling available to address patients alcohol problems in most EDs Most EDs provide very limited alcohol services When care is unavailable screening makes little sense to clinicians Realizing a gain from screening in an ED is entirely dependent upon linking the screening program to some form of counseling onsite or through referral services The impact of screening should be demonstrated in ED environments that have treatment available an adequate volume of alcohol involved patients and the capacity to undertake clinical trials Studies in these centers should demonstrate the benefits of screening increased referrals more patients receiving counseling and better outcomes such as reduction of risk behaviors Summary research areas of interest concerning screening The ideal screen that is accurate practical and motivational has not been developed Researchers must continue to analyze the performance of structured questionnaires and try computer based screening tools in the ED The sequence of screening tests needs to be evaluated by studying the NIAAA approach and several alternatives Screening must move from research to clinical practice Barriers to screening in clinical practice must be identified and removed Studies of implementation of screening programs in ED clinical practice should be undertaken The impact of screening on referral and intervention as well as outcomes such as reduced risk behaviors must be demonstrated References 1 Lowenstein S Koziol McLain J Thompson M et al Behavioral risk factors in emergency
