Committee on Ways and Means House of Representatives Subject Department of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service Department of Labor Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration Department of Health and Human Services Health Care Financing Administration Interim Rules for Mental Health Parity Pursuant to section 801 a 2 A of title 5 United States Code this is our report on a group of rules which constitute major rules promulgated by the Department of the GAO OGC 98 22 Treasury Internal Revenue Service Department of Labor Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services Health Care Financing Administration entitled Interim Rules for Mental Health Parity RIN 1545 AV53 1210 AA62 0938 AI05 We received the rules from the Department of the Treasury on December 22 1997 the Department of Labor on December 30 1997 and the Department of Health and Human Services on January 2 1998 They were published in the Federal Register as interim rules on December 22 1997 62 Fed Reg 66932 The interim rules govern parity between medical surgical benefits and mental health benefits in group health plans and health insurance coverage offered by issuers in connection with a group health plan The rules implement changes made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ERISA and the Public Health Service Act PHS Act contained in the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 MHPA and the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 We note that the interim rules have a listed effective date of January 1 1998 which is less than the 60 day delay in the effective date required by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 SBREFA The agencies have cited the good cause exception to the 60 day delay requirement contained in section 808 2 Section 808 2 states that notwithstanding section 801 any rule which an agency for good cause finds and incorporates the finding and a brief statement of reasons therefor in the rule issued that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable unnecessary or contrary to the public interest shall take effect at such time as the federal agency promulgating the rule determines The agencies took this action in order to have rules in place when the statutorily mandated effective date occurs Also the agencies invoked the similarly worded good cause exception contained in the Administrative Procedure Act APA at section 553 b 3 B which allows an agency to forego issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking and receiving public comments In the past we have concluded that the exception to the 60 day delay contained in section 808 2 cannot be used when a notice of proposed rulemaking and a public comment period are used in conformance with the provisions of the APA See Department of Health and Human Services Health Care Financing Administration Medicare Program B 275549 B 275552 December 9 1996 GAO OGC 97 9 While in this case there was no notice of proposed rulemaking we note that the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 was enacted in September 1996 and the agencies requested comments on the legislation in July 1997 10 months after enactment Based on these time periods alone it appears likely that the agencies could have obtained comments earlier and issued the interim rules in time to permit SBREFA s 60 day delay period for congressional review Page 2 GAO OGC 98 22 Enclosed is our assessment of the agencies compliance with the procedural steps required by section 801 a 1 B i through iv of title 5 with respect to the rule Our review indicates that the agencies except as noted above complied with the applicable requirements If you have any questions about this report please contact James Vickers Assistant General Counsel at 202

Revenue Service Department of the Treasury The Honorable Donna E Shalala The Secretary of Health and Human Services Page 3 GAO OGC 98 22 ENCLOSURE ANALYSIS UNDER 5 U S C 801 a 1 B i iv OF A MAJOR RULE ISSUED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR PENSION AND WELFARE BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES HEALTH CARE FINANCING ADMINISTRATION ENTITLED INTERIM RULES FOR MENTAL HEALTH PARITY RIN 1545 AV53 1210 AA62 0938 AI05 i Cost benefit analysis The Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services performed an economic impact analysis on the effects of the interim rules Utilizing figures from the Congressional Budget Office it is estimated that the total annual direct impact of the MHPA would be to increase aggregate health plan expenditures by 1 16 billion not accounting for plan sponsor responses to reduce that impact Considering those responses the actual increase in annual aggregate health plan expenditures would be 464 million The preamble to the interim rules contains a further discussion of additional analyses considered and performed by the Departments including an analysis prepared by Coopers and Lybrand The analyses utilized different assumptions and generally resulted in smaller expenditure impact estimates than noted above ii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 U S C 603 605 607 and 609 Since these rules are being issued as interim rules and were not previously published through a notice of proposed rulemaking the Departments were not required to prepare an initial or final regulatory flexibility analysis under the act However the Departments point out in the preamble to the interim rules that many of the issues which would have been considered in such analyses were in fact considered The issues are discussed in the Regulatory Impact Analysis iii Agency actions relevant to sections 202 205 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 2 U S C 1532 1535 Since the rules were issued as interim rules and not as general notices of proposed rulemaking they are not subject to the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 However the Departments indicate that the rules have been designed to be the least GAO OGC 98 22 burdensome alternative on state local and tribal governments and the private sector iv Other relevant information or requirements under acts and executive orders Administrative Procedure Act 5 U S C 551 et seq These rules were adopted on an interim basis because the Secretaries determined that the publication of a proposed regulation for the purpose of notice and public comment would be impracticable unnecessary and contrary to the public interest The Secretaries found that the requirements are effective January 1 1998 under the provisions of the MHPA and that plan administrators and sponsors issuers and participants needed guidance on the new statutory provisions before the effective date However comments on the statutory provisions were solicited from the public by publication in the Federal Register on June 26 1997 62 Fed Reg 34604 and these comments were considered in formulating the interim rules Paperwork Reduction Act 44 U S C 3501 3520 The interim rules contain information collections subject to review and approval by the Office of Management and Budget OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act The Departments have each submitted information collection requests to OMB and according to the preamble the Departments of the Treasury and Labor have requested emergency approval by OMB The information collections concern the notice to participants beneficiaries and the federal government of the 1 election of the 1 percent increased cost exemption 2 calculations and disclosure of documentation of eligibility for the exemption and 3 notice of a group health plan s use of a transition period The preamble to the interim rules contain the information required by the Paperwork Reduction Act including the need for the information the parties affected and the burden estimates related to the collections by each Department Statutory authorization for the rule The Department of the Treasury s rule is adopted pursuant to the authority contained in sections 7805 and 9833 of the Internal Revenue Code 26 U S C 7805 and 9833 as amended by HIPAA Pub L 104 191 110 Stat 1936 and the

Human Services rule is adopted pursuant to sections 2701 2702 2705 2711 2712 2713 2721 2722 2723 and 2792 of the PHS Act 42 U S C 300gg 300gg 1 300gg 5 300gg 11 300gg 12 300gg 13 300gg 21 300gg 22

budgetary impact of the rules Page 3 GAO OGC 98 22
