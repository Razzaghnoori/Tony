 Times Union Albany NY Tuesday May 14 2002 Legal Aid Society ensures justice for needy Arthur J Siegel The Times Union coverage of Law Day quoted Chief Judge Judith S Kaye as saying The promise of freedom and equal justice is an empty one if our justice system is not accessible Unfortunately there was no mention of the Capital Region s own Legal Aid Society of Northeastern New York the nonprofit organization that works to ensure that justice is available to the poor the disabled and the endangered members of our community LASNNY is one of the oldest and most cost effective legal services organizations in the United States Originally incorporated in 1923 as the Legal Aid Society of Albany it now serves income eligible clients in eight counties throughout the Capital Region LASNNY provides only needed civil legal aid urgent noncriminal assistance to low income people Last year the LASNNY helped more than 14 000 people Funding for legal aid preserves community resources and saves tax dollars For example in 2001 LASNNY Opened 585 cases for the victims of domestic violence helping to break the cycle of violence that causes so much lasting harm to women and children Prevented or forestalled 112 evictions saving shelter costs of 151 619 and the disruption that families suffer when they are displaced Won 87 SSI SSD cases enabling clients to receive 850 016 in retroactive benefits saving state taxpayers 441 786 and enabling people with disabilities to live with dignity Because we lack sufficient public and private support the dedicated attorneys and staff at LASNNY are limited in their ability to serve all those in need As a result an estimated four out of five low income people requiring legal help in our community do not receive it Our elected officials and all who are concerned about providing equal access to justice for all must step forward and support Legal Aid services If not many of our neighbors will continue to be denied the protection of the laws and freedoms we cherish and promote throughout the world
