 Just Say No Comment Everybody leads with the decision by Indonesia to allow an armed external peacekeeping force into East Timor Both the New York Times and Los Angeles Times headlines say that it s a U N force that s coming The Washington Post headline calls it Australian led USA Today s headline notes U S support for the development but also the absence of American ground troops The NYT front gives plenty of space to a large picture of Andre Agassi exulting over his win of the U S Open and to a story with picture about the New York Jets The LAT gives a big chunk of its front to its hometown professional sport show business awards This time it s the Emmys The LAT calls Indonesia s acceptance of foreign troops a stunning reversal of policy The WP adds that it is in some ways humiliating for Indonesia s president and top general Although the majority of the peacekeepers figure to be Australian 4 500 out of 7 000 the papers say the coverage mentions that the Indonesians would prefer a predominantly Asian force The Wall Street Journal mentions that perhaps the force will even include Indonesians The Post quotes one Indonesian military analyst saying that indeed there is anti white sentiment in East Timor which could make things dangerous for Australian troops And wonders the LAT what will happen to the militias A WP front pager reports that an examination of records reveals that in 1997 eight federal appeals court judges took part in at least 18 cases in which they or their spouses or trusts they managed held stock in one of the parties involved The story is a follow up to one done last year in the Kansas City Star by the same reporter now with the Post The judges says the paper attributed their participation to innocent mistakes or memory lapses about their finances One case cited gives a feel for the amount of lapse required The husband of a judge who participated in a ruling favorable to Wal Mart held up to 50 000 worth of stock in the retailer Some of the offending judges are quoted saying that they are chagrined and promise to try to be more careful The story doesn t call the practice illegal a related editorial does though and doesn t explain to the reader why the judges aren t looking at criminal charges civil suits or at least discipline from within their profession The WP runs an AP dispatch of a Fox News interview with former President George Bush in which he supports his presidential candidate son s decision not to answer questions about alleged youthful drug use A suggestion If the press is looking for embarrassing questions to ask presidential candidates about their long ago past how about this one arguably much more relevant to presidential performance than ancient drug use What were your SAT scores The real issue isn t who used dope it s who is a dope The NYT runs a piece about the 87 year old great grandmother revealed by a forthcoming book to have been an undetected KGB operative active from the early 40s until the early 70s The little old lady fessed up this past Saturday saying that she had been trying to help Russia keep abreast of Britain America and Germany But she added In general I do not agree with spying against one s country The Times says the British press is saying that soon up to a dozen more Britons who spied for Soviet intelligence will be unmasked including a now dead prominent public figure The WP legal columnist David Segal makes a sharp observation upon a visit to the new Web site of Washington D C s premier lobbying outfit Patton Boggs The hype text says at one point Patton Boggs was the first national law firm to recognize that all three branches of government could serve as forums to achieve client goals How wonders Segal does the firm lobby the judiciary The NYT s William Safire has a wicked version of President Clinton s account of Hillary s recusal from his FALN clemency offer I want you to listen to me I never discussed clemency for terrorists with that woman Ms Clinton Not a single time never Safire also asks a properly pointed question If federal employees can t even accept a lunch from an outsider what of President Clinton s acceptance of a house loan guarantee worth about a grand a month Last Thursday s USAT ran an op ed piece worth looking up It recounted a wacky trend in shady political campaign contributions maximum donations by children and even infants George W Bush recently received separate 1K donations from twin three year olds the grand children of a Utah multimillionaire Lest you think that Dubya has cornered the market on this form of cribbing the piece reports that in 1996 the ranks of Clinton Gore donors included an 11 year old Today s NYT runs a correction saying that an August 24 story about money added by Congress to appropriations bills favoring specific universities referred incompletely to the source of the 797 million figure which is this year s total for such funds Now reading that wouldn t you think the original story said something about that source Well it didn t That figure was calculated by The Chronicle of Higher Education in its own story on the topic but in the August 24 Times story the 797 million appears unattributed in the second paragraph and the Chronicle shows up in the fourteenth and without being connected to the figure Hence today s newspaper deconstruction referred incompletely to the source means referred to the source without mentioning that it was the source These baroque newspaper corrections are to a mistake what a comb over is to baldness
