 Fray of Light A note from the Fraymaster Welcome to the first installment of Best of the Fray a weekly column featuring the sharpest posts from our new reader feedback forum If you d like to comment on a Slate article we encourage you to do so in The Fray and if it s especially good we ll excerpt it here though we may edit it for length You might also get a reply Many Slate writers visit the Fray to read the posts about their stories and some respond there For instance Robert Pinsky our poetry editor will be participating in The Fray s Poem topic at 12 p m PST Friday Oct 29 Michael Brus SUBJECT Love Diary but it s not edgy enough FROM Will Juntunen DATE Thu Sept 9 This is purely an opinion I really like reading the diary feature But I see the writing of high achievers but I m not seeing people who are on the edge For example you had a great feature on a real estate agent But she was a very successful real estate person Likewise the lawyer who went to China was a very successful lawyer Now in the Lewis and Clark diaries the possibility of disaster always loomed Could we read the diaries of a man or a woman who is a little closer to the edge To respond click here SUBJECT Tabloids and Baloney Sandwiches FROM King Arthur DATE Fri Sept 10 I would like to take a moment to put Tabloids in perspective and challenge anyone to make a different observation My job takes me to dozens of grocery stores which distribute a great number of these offensive babble on ion manuscripts and where a large number of employees read them in the break room Not once in my 37 years have I heard anyone admit that they believe in the content Why read this crap then Well why read any type of fiction I believe it is because there is a time for rape murder hurricane political treachery types of reading and a time to just amuse yourself while you re scarfing down a baloney sandwich type of reading To respond click here SUBJECT Response from the author FROM Jennifer Mendelsohn DATE Mon Sept 13 Thank you to everyone in the Fray who s taken the time to comment on this month s Enquiring Minds in Slovakia I ve enjoyed all your comments immensely especially Mr Heaney s suggestions that I am used to wallowing in this type of pigslop and that I should return my fee for writing the column As to the former while I ll confess that my office is a huge mess I ll have to steadfastly disagree that it s quite reached the pigpen level the latter I ll just politely overlook There seems to be a huge misunderstanding underlying many of your posts though and I d like to clear it up Enquiring Minds in Slovakia is not meant to be an essay on the socio cultural implications of the use of the National Enquirer in a Slovakian classroom Nor is it a serious critique or celebration for that matter of the tabloids or a Hollywood gossip column lazily cribbed from the pages of other magazines The article you saw was this month s edition of Keeping Tabs a lighthearted monthly column I write for Slate that sums up and pokes fun at what the supermarket tabloids have been writing about for the previous month Get it We re trying to have a little fun here I m sorry to disappoint all of you who ve complained that I haven t done anything but sum up what s in the tabloids but that s precisely what I m here to do every month I don t do any independent investigation of the veracity of the tabloid stories I just let them speak for themselves in all their ludicrous glory hopefully in a way that s as amusing as the tabs themselves But that s why I m not at all surprised that the poster calling him or herself Too Embarrassed I Read This Crap didn t find rumpology in the dictionary You can read back issues of Keeping Tabs which might help give a little perspective by clicking here Next month s column covering the best and worst of September s Globe Star and Enquirer will be online around Oct 5 or so Thanks again for all your insight All best Jennifer Mendelsohn To respond click here SUBJECT Bradley speech FROM maureen DATE Tues Sept 14 Sure a young girl s smile the pleasure of helping someone in need friendship etc etc may be both hard to measure and extremely corny but let s not get carried away There is no doubt that those things are all indirectly but absolutely affected by those who govern via economic and social policy If elected Bradley might even use unlike Clinton the bully pulpit to remind us of the critical importance of those intangibles in creating responsible and compassionate adult citizens It is more than empty rhetoric To respond click here SUBJECT you think this is a joke FROM outraged DATE Thu Sept 9 A few things to say about the Trippin at the GNC 1 If you don t have an illness say depression or arthritis why on earth do you expect to feel any effects from a drug which is intended to treat said illness Side effects sure but I would doubt any primary effects would be felt 2 Depression is a serious illness Why must you treat anti depressants as party toys 3 If you think herbal products are necessarily safer or have less side effects than commercial pharmaceuticals where do you think those pharmaceuticals came from in the first place Many if not most common drugs were originally a substance that occurred in nature such as various plant extracts 4 Ever heard of a self fulfilling prophecy Or the placebo effect The author could conceivably have convinced him herself that because a product is supposed to make one feel less depressed and therefore happier he she will therefore feel better The mind is a powerful thing and sometimes may be as effective or even more effective in treating a physical or mental malady than pharmaceuticals herbal or otherwise 5 Anti depressants are not meant to make one happier per se but rather to make one feel normal and better able to deal with everyday details that most people take for granted I suffered clinical depression for several years I know So why should it be a big surprise if a non depressed individual does not notice any effects from taking an anti depressant medication Put another way anti depressants don t make you happy they just help lift you to a plateau from which you are able to seek your own happiness whatever that may consist of 6 Severe depression is not a joke Why must the treatment of this illness always become one Don t treat it so lightly unless you ve been there To respond click here
